In the 10th century the eastern counties of the [[March of Gothia]] became independent from the [[Frankish kingdom]], uniting as vassals of [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]]. In 1137 Barcelona and Aragon formed the [[Crown of Aragon]], and Catalonia became the base of Aragonese maritime power in the Mediterranean. Medieval [[Catalan literature]] flourished. Between 1469 and 1516, the crowns of Aragon and [[Crown of Castile|Castille]] united to form the [[Kingdom of Spain]], while retaining their distinct institutions. During the [[Reapers' War]] (1640–52), Catalonia rebelled against Spain, becoming a republic under French protection. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, which ended the wider [[Franco-Spanish War (1635–59)|Franco-Spanish war]], France retained the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly incorporated in the county of [[Roussillon]]. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14), the Crown of Aragon sided against [[Philip V of Spain]], whose subsequent victory led to the [[Nueva Planta decrees|abolition]] of Catalan institutions and the eventual imposition of the Spanish language in public life.<ref name="Wheeler 2010, p.191">{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Max|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-08-087774-7|pages=188–192|url=http://books.google.es/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&printsec=frontcover&hl=ca#v=onepage&q&f=false|chapter=Catalan|ref=harv}}</ref>

Despite the repression and the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] and [[Carlist Wars]], Catalonia experienced economic growth and industrialization. During the second half of the 19th century, the region saw a [[Renaixença|cultural renaissance]] coupled with incipient [[Catalan nationalism|nationalism]], while several workers movements appeared. In 1913, the four Catalan provinces formed a [[Commonwealth of Catalonia|Commonwealth]], and with the advent of democracy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–39), the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] was restored. After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the  [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] dictatorship enacted repressive measures, abolishing Catalan institutions and banning the Catalan language again. During the 1950s and 1960s, Catalonia saw significant economic growth and became an important tourist destination, drawing many workers from across Spain and making Barcelona one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] (1975–82) Catalonia has recovered political and cultural autonomy and is now one of the most economically dynamic regions of Spain. The Catalan government has announced its intention to hold a [[Catalonian independence referendum, 2014|referendum on possible independence]] from Spain in 2014.<ref name="Economist">{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21586323-pressure-referendum-keeps-growing-nothing-lose-their-chains | title=Nothing to lose but their chains | publisher=The Economist | accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>

== Etymology and pronunciation==
The name ''Catalunya'' (Catalonia) began to be used as homeland of "Catalans" (''Catalanenses'') in the late 11th century, probably used before as a mere territorial area in reference to a group of counties that comprised part of the [[Septimania|March of Gothia]] and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]] under the control of the [[Count of Barcelona]] and his relatives.<ref>{{ca icon}} [http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0016436 Enciclopèdia Catalana online: Catalunya ("Geral de Cataluign, Raimundi Catalan and Arnal Catalan appear in 1107/1112")]</ref> The origin of the name, ''Catalunya'', is subject to diverse interpretations because of a lack of evidence.

One theory suggests that ''Catalunya'' (Latin ''Gathia Launia'') derives from the name ''Gothia'' or ''Gauthia'' ("Land of the [[Goths]]"), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the [[Septimania|March of Gothia]], known as ''Gothia'', whence ''Gothland'' > ''Gothlandia'' > ''Gothalania'' > ''Catalonia'' theoretically derived.<ref name="Books.google.com"/><ref>{{cite book| author = Ulick Ralph Burke| title = A history of Spain from the earliest times to the death of Ferdinand the Catholic| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tz3g_YzTQaUC&pg=PA154| year = 1900| publisher = Longmans, Green, and co.| page = 154 }}</ref> During the Middle Ages, Byzantine chroniclers claimed that ''Catalania'' derives from the local medley of [[Goths]] with [[Alans]], initially constituting a ''Goth-Alania''.<ref>The Sarmatians: 600 BC-AD 450 (Men-at-Arms) by Richard Brzezinski and Gerry Embleton, Aug 19, 2002.</ref>

Other less plausible theories suggest:

*''Catalunya'' derives from the term "land of castles", having evolved from the term ''castlà'', the medieval term for the ruler of a castle (see [[castellan]]).<ref name="Books.google.com">{{cite book| author = Maximiano García Venero| title = Historia del nacionalismo catalán: 2a edición| url = http://books.google.com/?id=nUABAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 2010-04-25| date = 2006-07-07| publisher = Ed.

*The source is of Celtic origin, meaning "chiefs of battle". Although the area is not known to have been occupied by Celts, a Celtic culture was present within the interior of Iberia in pre-Roman times.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Catalan&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary].</ref>

*The [[Lacetani]], an [[Iberians|Iberian]] tribe that lived in the area and whose name, due to the Roman influence, could have evolved by [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] to ''Katelans'' and then ''Catalans''.<ref>[http://www.histocat.cat/pdf/talaiotic1.pdf El Misteri de la Paraula Cathalunya].{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediterranees.net/vagabondages/divers/catalogne.html La Catalogne : son nom et ses limites historiques].

In English, ''Catalonia'' may be pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|æ|t|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|k|æ|t|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|j|ə}}. The native name, ''Catalunya'', is pronounced {{IPA-ca|kətəˈɫuɲə|}} in [[Central Catalan]], the most widely spoken variety whose pronunciation is considered standard;<ref>{{Cite book|first=Ingo|last=Feldhausen|year=2010|page=5|title= Sentential Form and Prosodic Structure of Catalan|publisher=John Benjamins B.V.|isbn=978 90 272 5551 8}}</ref> while in [[Eastern Catalan]] it is pronounced {{IPA-ca|kataˈluɲa|}}. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name is ''Cataluña'' ({{IPA-es|kataˈluɲa|}}), and the [[Aranese language|Aranese]] name is ''Catalonha'' ({{IPA-oc|kataˈluɲɔ|}}). In [[French language|French]], the country is called ''Catalogne'' ({{IPA-fr|katalɔɲ|}}).

In pre-Roman times, the area now called Catalonia, like the rest of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] side of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], was populated by the [[Iberians]]. Coastal trading colonies were established by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who settled around the [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] area.  Both Greeks and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] briefly ruled the territory in the course of the [[Second Punic War]] and traded with the surrounding Iberian population. 

After the Carthaginian defeat by the [[Roman Republic]], it became the first area of Iberia to come under Roman rule, and became part of  Roman [[Hispania]], the westernmost part of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Tarraco]], now called [[Tarragona]], was one of the most important Roman cities in Hispania.

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the area was conquered by the [[Visigoths]] and was ruled as part of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] for almost two and a half centuries. In 718, it came under [[Muslim]] control and became part of the [[Ummayad]] province of [[Al-Andalus]].  From the conquest of [[Rousillon]] in 760 to the conquest of [[Barcelona]] in 801 the [[Frankish Empire]] took control of the area from the Muslims and created the counties that would later become known as Catalonia. These counties formed part of the [[March of Gothia]] and [[Marca Hispanica|March of Hispania]], a [[buffer zone]] in the south of the former province of [[Septimania]] and in the northeast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to act as a defensive barrier for the Frankish Empire against the [[Moors]] of Al-Andalus.

In the [[Middle Ages]], these counties became the basis for Catalonia under the rule of the [[List of Counts of Barcelona|counts of Barcelona]]. The counts of Barcelona were Frankish [[vassal]]s nominated by the emperor of the Franks, to whom they were [[feudatory|feudatories]] (801–987).

In 987, [[Wilfred the Hairy]], count of Barcelona did not recognise [[Hugh Capet]], making his successors (Sunyer, Borrell II, Miro I, and so on) de facto independent of the Carolingian crown. In 1137, [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] decided to accept [[Ramiro II of Aragon|King Ramiro II of Aragon]]'s proposal to marry Queen [[Petronilla of Aragon|Petronila]], establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], creating the [[Crown of Aragon]] and making the Catalan counties that were united under the county of Barcelona into a [[principality]] of the Aragonese Crown.

In 1258, by means of the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]], the [[Count of Barcelona]] and King of Aragon, [[James I of Aragon]] renounced his family rights and dominions in [[Occitania]] and recognized the king of France as heir of the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Dynasty]]. The king of France formally relinquished his nominal feudal lordship over the Catalan counties.  This treaty transformed the region's ''[[de facto]]'' union with Aragon into a ''[[de jure]]'' one and was the origin of the definitive separation between both geographical areas, Catalonia and Occitania. 

As a coastal territory of the Crown of Aragon, Catalonia, Barcelona in particular, became the base of the Crown maritime dominion and lead the expansion, the power and the influence of the [[Crown of Aragon]] in the Mediterranean. Gradually, new territories such as, the [[Kingdom of Valencia]], the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] and later [[Sardinia]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], [[Corsica]] and [[Duchy of Athens]] were incorporated under the dynasty of the [[House of Barcelona|House of Aragon and Barcelona]] (1164–1410) into the Crown. In the 12th century, under the patronage of the counts of Barcelona, a [[Catalan literature]] first appeared and flourished in the next few centuries.

The domains of the Crown of Aragon were severely affected by the [[Black Death]] pandemic and by later outbreaks of the plague. Between 1347 and 1497 Catalonia lost 37 percent of its population.<ref>According to John Huxtable Elliott, "Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality [Catalonia] had lost 37% of its inhabitants, and was reduced to a population of something like 300,000." {{cite book| author = John Huxtable Elliott| title = The revolt of the Catalans: a study in the decline of Spain (1598–1640)| url = http://books.google.com/?id=X2Hf-crzPjUC&pg=PA26| year = 1984| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn = 0-521-27890-2| page = 26 }}</ref>

In 1410, King [[Martin of Aragon|Martin I]] died without surviving descendants. As a result, by the [[Pact of Caspe]], [[Ferdinand of Antequera]] from the Castilian dynasty of [[Trastámara]] received the Crown of Aragon as [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]].

His grandson, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] married in 1469, becoming the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; subsequently, this event was seen as the dawn of the unified Kingdom of Spain. At that point, though united by marriage, the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] maintained distinct territories, each keeping its own traditional institutions, parliaments and laws. Castile commissioned the expeditions to the [[Americas]], and benefited from the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial]] riches. Political power gradually shifted away from the Aragonese court to the court of the [[Spanish Crown]].

[[Image:Cortes Catalanas.jpg|thumb|200px|A 15th-century miniature of the [[Court (royal)|Catalan Court]].]]
By virtue of descent from his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand II and Isabella I, in 1516 Charles I (Carlos I) became the first king to rule Castile-León and Aragon simultaneously in his own right. Following the death of his paternal ([[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]) grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], he was also elected Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1519 as  [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] <ref>{{cite web |last=Encyclopedia Britannica online |title=Charles V |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107009/Charles-V |accessdate=October 2012}}</ref>

Until 1716, Catalonia, as a [[principality]] of the Crown of Aragon, continued to retain its own [[Usatges de Barcelona|usages and laws]], but these gradually eroded in the course of the transition from [[feudalism]] to a modern state, fueled by the kings' struggle to have more [[Centralization|centralized]] territories. Over the next few centuries, the increasing centralization of power in Spain led to conflicts between Catalonia and the Spanish Crown. 

The [[Reapers' War]] (1640–52) saw Catalonia rebel with French help against the Spanish Crown for overstepping Catalonia's rights. Most of Catalonia was reconquered but Catalan rights were recognised. Roussillon was lost to France. Rousillon is now the Department of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] and is also named [[Northern Catalonia]] (''Catalunya Nord'').

The most significant conflict concerning the loss of autonomy was the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which began when the childless [[Charles II of Spain]], the last Spanish [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]], died without an  heir in 1700. Charles II had chosen [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] from the French dynasty, the [[Bourbons]]. Catalonia, like the other territories that formed the Crown of Aragon, rose up in support of the Austrian Habsburg pretender [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] in his claim for the Spanish throne as Charles III of Spain. The fight between the houses of Bourbon and Habsburg for the Spanish throne split Spain and Europe.

The [[Siege of Barcelona (1713–1714)|fall of Barcelona]] on 11 September 1714 to the Bourbon king militarily ended the Habsburg claim to the Spanish throne, which became legal fact in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Feeling that he had been betrayed, the first Bourbon king introduced the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions and rights, within a united administration of Spain. The Catalan defeat in the War also iniciated a series of measures imposing the use of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in all spheres of public life, while forbidding the use of Catalan.<ref name="Wheeler 2010, p.191"/> These included preaching, theater, courts, education, legal documents, and on the telephone.<ref name="Wheeler 2010, p.191"/> In the 20th century these measures were mostly repealed and supplemented by others, like the prohibition of teaching Catalan, or sactions for refusing to use Spanish.<ref name="Wheeler 2010, p.191"/>

{{triple image|thumb|Prim madrazo.jpeg|100|Figueras y Moragas.jpg|100|Pi y margall.jpg|100|[[Juan Prim]], [[Estanislao Figueras]] and [[Francisco Pi y Margall]], were Catalan presidents of [[Spain]].}}
In the latter half of the 19th century, Catalonia became an industrial center. To this day it remains one of the most industrialised parts of Spain.  In the first third of the 20th century, Catalonia gained and lost varying degrees of autonomy several times, receiving its first statute of autonomy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931). This period was marked by political unrest and the preeminence of the [[Anarchist Catalonia|Anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39). The Anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, achieving the first [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]] in Europe in 1919.

The defeat of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic of Spain]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] brought fascist [[Francisco Franco]] to power as dictator. His regime imposed linguistic, political and cultural restrictions across Spain. In Catalonia, any kind of public activities associated with Catalan nationalism, [[Anarchism]], [[Socialism]], [[Democracy]] or [[Communism]], including the publication of books on those subjects or simply discussion of them in open meetings, was banned. Franco's regime banned the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events.  The pro-Republic of Spain President of Catalonia, [[Lluís Companys]], was tortured and executed for the crime of 'military rebellion'.<ref>Preston, Paul. (2012). ''The Spanish Holocaust.'' Harper Press. London p.493</ref>

During later stages of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco regime]], certain folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the [[mass media]] had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s<ref>{{cite book| author = Ross| title = Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Oe4popSDfW0C&pg=PA139| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-1-139-46307-2| page = 139 }}</ref> in the theatre. Publishing in Catalan continued throughout the dictatorship.<ref>{{citation |title=The Resurgence of Catalan |first=Earl W |last=Thomas |title=Hispania |volume=45 |issue=1 |month=March |year=1962 |pages=43–48 |doi=10.2307/337523}}</ref>

The years after the war were extremely hard. Catalonia, like many other parts of Spain, had been devastated by the war.  Recovery from the war damage was slow and made more difficult by the international trade embargo against Franco's dictatorial regime. By the late 1950s the country had recovered its pre-war economic levels and in the 1960s was the second fastest growing economy in the world in what became known as the [[Spanish Miracle]]. During this period there was a spectacular growth of industry and tourism in Catalonia that drew large numbers of workers to the region from across Spain and made the area around Barcelona into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas.

After Franco's death in 1975, Catalonia voted for the adoption of a democratic Spanish Constitution in 1978, in which Catalonia recovered political and cultural autonomy. Today, Catalonia is one of the most economically dynamic regions of Spain. The Catalan capital and largest city, Barcelona, is a major international cultural centre and a major tourist destination.

== Geography ==

===Climate===
The climate of Catalonia is diverse. The populated areas lying by the coast in Tarragona, Barcelona and Girona provinces feature a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The inland part (including the Lleida province and the inner part of Barcelona province) show a mostly [[continental Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa''). The Pyrenean peaks have a [[highland climate|mountain]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''H'') or even [[Alpine climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''ET'') at the highest summits, while the valleys have a maritime or [[oceanic climate]] sub-type ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'').

In the Mediterranean area, summers are dry and hot with sea breezes, and the maximum temperature is around {{convert|26|-|31|°C}}. Winter is cool or slightly cold depending on the location. It snows frequently in the Pyrenees, and it occasionally snows at lower altitudes, even by the coastline. Spring and autumn are typically the rainiest seasons, except for the Pyrenean valleys, where summer is typically stormy.

The inland part of Catalonia is hotter and drier in summer. Temperature may reach {{convert|35|°C}}, some days even {{convert|40|°C}}. Nights are cooler there than at the coast, with the temperature of around {{convert|14|-|17|°C}}. Fog is not uncommon in valleys and plains; it can be especially persistent, with [[freezing drizzle]] episodes and subzero temperatures during winter (record from −36 °C), along the [[Segre River|Segre]] and in other river valleys.

===Hydrography===
[[File:Estanybanyoles.jpg|thumb|[[Lake of Banyoles]]]]
Most of Catalonia belongs to the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the [[Ebre|Ebro]] and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia, all of them flow to the [[Mediterranean]]. Furthermore, there is the [[Garona]] river basin that flows to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], but it only covers the 1.73% of the Catalan territory.

The hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebre river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of {{convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on}} per year, while the second only provides an average of {{convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on}}/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebre river, from which the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between ''[[comarca|comarques]]'', given the complex geological structure of the territory.<ref name="GEC clima">{{cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml |title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia |language=catalán |work=l'Enciclopèdia |location=Barcelona |editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana}}</ref> In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]].

{{Politics of Catalonia}}
{{main|Politics of Catalonia|Politics of Spain}}

After Franco's death in 1975 and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain in 1978, Catalonia recovered and extended the powers that it had gained in the [[Statute of Autonomy]] of 1932<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents15.htm |title=Beginnings of the autonomous regime, 1918–1932 |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> but lost with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents16.htm |title=The republican Government of Catalonia, 1931–1939 |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1939.

The region has gradually achieved more [[Self-governance|autonomy]] since the approval of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]. The Generalitat holds exclusive jurisdiction in culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public safety and local government, and shares jurisdiction with the Spanish government in education, health and justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_4.htm |title=Title IV.

A relatively large sector of the population supports the ideas and policies of [[Catalan nationalism]],<ref name="CEO poll">{{cite web |url=http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/docs/2012/06/27/10/36/60220d32-3dde-4bbe-bd32-e66085959a29.pdf |title=CEO Public Opinion Poll covering, among others, nationalist opinions |publisher=ceo.gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}</ref> a political movement which defends the notion that Catalonia is a separate [[nation]] and advocates for either further political autonomy or full independence of Catalonia.

Two major factors were [[Spain's Constitutional Court]]'s 2010 decision to declare part of the  2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia unconstitutional, as well as the fact that Catalonia contributes 19.49% of the federal government’s tax revenue, but only receives 14.03% of federal spending.<ref>{{cite web |last=Abend |first=Lisa |title=Spain Barcelona Warns Madrid: Pay Up, or Catalonia Leaves Spain |url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/barcelona-warns-madrid-pay-up-or-catalonia-leaves-spain/?xid=newsletter-weekly |publisher=TIME |accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref>

Parties that consider themselves either Catalan nationalist or [[Independentism|independentist]] have been present in all Catalan governments since 1980.

===Statutes of Autonomy===
[[File:Estatutf.gif|thumb|200px|The First Statute of Catalonia, 1932.]]
{{main|Autonomous Communities of Spain|Statute of Autonomy}}
The [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]] is the fundamental organic law, second only to the Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates.

In the [[Constitution of Spain|Spanish Constitution of 1978]] Catalonia, along with the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], was defined as a "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationality]]". The same constitution gave Catalonia the automatic right to autonomy, which resulted in the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979]].

Both the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the current one, approved in 2006, state that "Catalonia, as a nationality, exercises its self-government constituted as an Autonomous Community in accordance with the Constitution and with the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which is its basic institutional law, always under the law in Spain".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1 |title=First article of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>

The Preamble of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia states that the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] has defined Catalonia as a [[nation]], but that "the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's national reality as a nationality".<ref>[http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/castellano/titulo_preliminar.html Constitución Española, Título Preliminar].{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous regions of Aragon, Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web|author=Europa Press/Madrid |url=http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html |title=Admitidos los recursos de Aragón, Valencia y Baleares contra el Estatuto catalán. |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1997-12-01 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> as well as by the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]]. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed [[cultural heritage]] but, especially, on the Statute's alleged breaches of the principle of "solidarity between regions" in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]]. After considerable legal debate,<ref>{{cite web |author=El País |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/encarnizada/batalla/politica/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_26/Tes |title=Cuatro años de encarnizada batalla política. |publisher=El País |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref> 

Spain's [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Constitutional Court]] assessed the disputed articles and on 28 June 2010, issued its judgment on the principal allegation of unconstitutionality presented by the People's Party in 2006. The judgment granted clear passage to 182 articles of the 223 that make up the fundamental text. The court approved 73 of the 114 articles that the People's Party had contested, while declaring 14 articles unconstitutional in whole or in part and imposing a restrictive interpretation on 27 others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/retoque/74/articulos/recurridos/elpepunac/20100629elpepinac_4/Tes |title=Ni un retoque en 74 artículos recurridos |publisher=El País |date= |accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref> The court accepted the specific provision that described Catalonia as a "nation", however ruled that it was a historical and cultural term with no legal weight, and that Spain remained the only nation recognized by the constitution.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp |title=Catalonia 'is not a nation' 10 July 2010 |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 2010-07-10|accessdate=2011-01-06 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/ |title=Is Catalonia a nation or a nationality, or is Spain the only nation in Spain? |publisher=Matthewbennett.es |date= |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Fiona Govan in Madrid 1:59PM BST 29 Jun 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html |title=Catalonia can call itself a 'nation', rules Spain's top court 29 Jun 2010 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2011-01-06 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16490065 |title=A nationality, not a nation Jul 1st 2010 |publisher=Economist.com |date= 2010-07-01|accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>

===Government and law===
[[File:Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya]]''.]]
{{main|Generalitat de Catalunya}}

The Catalan Statute of Autonomy establishes that Catalonia is organised politically through the ''[[Generalitat de Catalunya]]'', conformed by the [[Parliament of Catalonia|Parliament]], the Presidency of the Generalitat, the Government or Executive Council and the other institutions created by the Parliament.

The seat of the Executive Council is the city of [[Barcelona]]. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the [[List of Presidents of the Generalitat de Catalunya|presidents of Catalonia]] have been [[Jordi Pujol]] (1980–2003), [[Pasqual Maragall]] (2003–2006), [[José Montilla Aguilera]] (2006–2010) and [[Artur Mas]] incumbent {{as of|2010|lc=on}}.

===Security forces===
{{main|Mossos d'Esquadra}}
Catalonia has its own police force, the ''[[Mossos d'Esquadra]]'', whose origins date back to the 18th century. Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994  they have expanded in number in order to replace the national ''[[Guardia Civil]]'' and ''[[Policía Nacional (Spain)|Policía Nacional]]'', which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control amongst others.

Most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions. The [[criminal justice]] system is uniform throughout Spain, while "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" is administered separately within Catalonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm |title=Legislació civil catalana |publisher=Civil.udg.es |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>

[[Navarre]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and Catalonia are the Spanish regions with the highest degree of autonomy in terms of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].

===Administrative and territorial division===

Catalonia is organised territorially into [[province]]s, further subdivided into [[comarca|comarques]] and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia establishes the administrative organization of three local authorities: [[vegueria|vegueries]], comarques, and municipalities.

====Provinces====
{{further|Provinces of Spain}}
Catalonia is divided administratively into four provinces, the governing body of which is the ''Diputació'' ({{lang-es|Diputación}}). The four provinces and their populations are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/territ/BasicTerr?TC=5&V0=5&V1=08&V3=863&V4=435&ALLINFO=TRUE&PARENT=1&GERMANS=TRUE&CTX=B |title=Padró municipal d'habitants.

====Comarques====
{{main|Comarques of Catalonia}}
Comarques (Shires) are entities composed by the municipalities to manage their responsibilities and services.  The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco.  In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again and in 1988 three new comarques were added ([[Alta Ribagorça]], [[Pla d'Urgell]] i [[Pla de l'Estany]]).  At present there are 41.

The comarca of [[Val d'Aran]] (Aran Valley) has a special status and its autonomous government is named [[Conselh Generau d'Aran]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html# |title=Ley 16/1990, de 13 de julio, sobre el régimen especial del Valle de Arán. |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Noticias Jurídicas |accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref>

====Vegueries====
{{main|Vegueries of Catalonia}}
The ''vegueria'' is a new type of division defined as a specific territorial area for the exercise of government and inter-local cooperation with legal personality. The current Statute of Autonomy states vegueries are intended to supersede provinces in Catalonia, and take over many of functions of the comarques.

The territorial plan of Catalonia (''Pla territorial general de Catalunya'') provided six general functional areas,<ref>{{cite web |title=Pla territorial general de Catalunya |url=http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/general/ptgeneral.jsp |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=20 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> but was amended by Law 24/2001, of December 31, recognizing the [[Alt Pirineu i Aran]] as a new functional area differentiated of Ponent.<ref>[http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/parcials/ptapa/aprovacio_definitiva.jsp Aprovació del Pla territorial parcial de l'Alt Pirineu i Aran].{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>  On 14 July 2010 the Catalan Parliament approved the creation of the functional area of the [[Penedès]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avui.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/195270.html |date=15 de juliol del 2010 |work=Avui |title=El Parlament reconeix l'àmbit funcional del Penedès}}</ref>

The stock market of Barcelona, which in 2004 traded almost €205,000 million,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} is the second largest of Spain after Madrid, and [[Fira de Barcelona]] organizes international exhibitions and congresses to do with different sectors of the economy.

The main economic cost for the Catalan families is the purchase of a home. According to data from the Society of Appraisal on the 31 December 2005 Catalonia is, after Madrid, the second most expensive region in Spain for housing: 3,397 €/m² on average (see [[Spanish property bubble]]).

== Demographics ==
{{main|Catalan people}}

Catalonia covers an area of {{convert|32114|km2|abbr=on}} with an official population of 7,354,411 (2008), of which non-Spanish immigrants represent an estimated 12.3%.<ref>[http://www.vilaweb.cat/www/elpunt/noticia?p_idcmp=2004564 "Catalunya arriba a set milions d'habitants"], Diari El Punt.</ref><ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/6226305.stm Catalans grapple with migrant influx]", BBC News. 3 January 2007.</ref>

The [[Urban Region of Barcelona]] includes 5,217,864 people and covers an area of {{convert|2.268|km2|abbr=on}}, and about 1.7 million people live in a radius of {{convert|15|km2|abbr=on}} from Barcelona. The metropolitan area of the Urban Region includes cities such as [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]], [[Sabadell]], [[Terrassa]], [[Badalona]], [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]] and [[Cornellà de Llobregat]].

In 1900, the population of Catalonia was 1,984,115 people and in 1970 it was 5,107,606.<ref>[http://www15.gencat.net/pres_catalunya_dades/AppPHP/cat/poblacio.htm Gencat.net]. {{ca icon}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> That increase was due to the demographic boom in Spain during the 60s and early 70s and also to the large-scale internal migration from the rural interior of Spain to its industrial cities. In Catalonia that wave of internal migration arrived from several regions of Spain, especially [[Andalusia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Extremadura]].

Immigrants from other countries settled in Catalonia in the 1990s and 2000s; a large percentage came from [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], and smaller numbers from [[Asia]] and [[Eastern Europe]], often settling in urban centers such as Barcelona and industrial areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

According to the most recent linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia {{As of|2009|lc=on}}, a plurality claims Spanish as "their own language" (46.53% Spanish compared to 37.26% Catalan). In everyday use, 11.95% of the population claim to use both languages equally, while 45.92% mainly use Spanish and 35.54% mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the [[Barcelona metropolitan area]] (and, to a lesser extent, the [[Camp de Tarragona|Tarragona area]]), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the rest of Catalonia, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&V0=15&V1=2 |title=Idescat.

Since the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]], [[Aranese]] (a dialect of [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]] [[Occitan]]) has also been official and subject to special protection in [[Val d'Aran]]. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where a dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of Val d'Aran.<ref>[http://www20.gencat.cat/docs/Llengcat/Documents/Dades_territori_poblacio/Altres/Arxius/EULP2008.pdf Enquesta d'usos lingüístics de la població 2008], cap. 8.

Originating in the historic territory of Catalonia, Catalan has enjoyed special status since the approval of the [[Statute of Autonomy of 1979]] which declares it to be the "own language of Catalonia",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a6 |title=Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Article 6) |publisher=Gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> a term which signifies a language given special legal status within a Spanish territory, or which is historically spoken within a given region. The other languages with official status are Spanish, which has official status throughout Spain, and Aranese Occitan, which enjoys co-official status with Catalan and Spanish in the [[Val d'Aran]].

Although not considered an "official language" in the same way as Catalan, Spanish, and Aranese, [[Catalan Sign Language]], with about 18,000 users in Catalonia,<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc Ethnologue Report for Catalan Sign Language]. Usage population as of 1994. Retrieved 2012-08-24.</ref> is granted official recognition and support: "The public authorities shall guarantee the use of Catalan sign language and conditions of equality for deaf people who choose to use this language, which shall be the subject of education, protection and respect."<ref name="estatut_langs" />

Under the Franco dictatorship, Catalan was excluded from the public education system and all other official use, so that for example families were not allowed to officially register children with Catalan names.<ref>{{cite book| author = Joan Miralles i Montserrat| coauthors = Josep Massot i Muntaner| title = Entorn de la histáoria de la llengua| year = 2001| publisher = L'Abadia de Montserrat| isbn = 978-84-8415-309-2| page = 72 }}</ref> While never completely banned, Catalan language publishing was severely restricted during the early 1940s, with only religious texts and small-run self-published texts being released.

[[Rural-urban migration]] originating in other parts of Spain also reduced the social use of the language in urban areas, while increasing the use of Spanish. Lately, a similar [[sociolinguistic]] phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. Catalan cultural activity increased in the 1960s and Catalan classes began thanks to the initiative of associations such as [[Òmnium Cultural]].

After the end of Franco's dictatorship, the newly established self-governing democratic institutions in Catalonia embarked on a long-term [[language policy]] to increase the use of Catalan<ref>{{cite book| author = M. Teresa Turell| title = Multilingualism in Spain: Sociolinguistic and Psycholinguistic Aspects of Linguistic Minority Groups| url = http://books.google.com/?id=li0Fmtfxd6kC&pg=PA64| accessdate = 2010-04-25| year = 2001| publisher = Multilingual Matters| isbn = 978-1-85359-491-5 }}</ref> and has, since 1983, enforced laws which attempt to protect and extend the use of Catalan. This policy, known as the "linguistic normalization" (''normalització lingüística'' in Catalan, ''normalización lingüística'' in Spanish) has been supported by the vast majority of Catalan political parties through the last thirty years.

Today, Catalan is the main language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Basic public education is given in Catalan, except for two hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan under penalty of fines. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.df5fba67cac781e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&newLang=en_GB |title=Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers.

The law ensures that both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=detall&contentid=bc1f657030672110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |title=Second article of Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> but primary education can only be taken in Catalan language.

Due to the [[Immigration to Spain|intense immigration]] which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular experienced in the first decade of the 21st century, many foreign languages are spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which [[Riff language|Rif]]-[[Berber language|Berber]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/cusc/revista/lsc/hemeroteca/numero8/articles/comellas.pdf |title=DESCOBRIR LES LLENGÜES DE LA IMMIGRACIÓ |publisher=University of Barcelona |accessdate=2012-10-06}}</ref>  [[Moroccan Arabic]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]]{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} and [[Urdu]] are the more common.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-catalunya-arabe-urdu-aparecen-lenguas-habituales-catalunya-creando-peligro-guetos-20090629150020.html |title=Árabe y urdu aparecen entre las lenguas habituales de Catalunya, creando peligro de guetos. |publisher=Europapress.es |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>

Recently, some of these policies have been criticized for trying to promote Catalan by imposing fines on businesses. For example, following the passage of a March 2010 law on Catalan cinema, which establishes that half of the movies shown in Catalan cinemas must be in Catalan, a general strike of 75% of the cinemas took place.<ref>{{cite web |author=by Louis @ |url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/32923/catalan-cinema-dubbing-protest-law.html |title=Cinema law: rude case to not dub and subtitle all films in Catalan |publisher=Cafebabel.co.uk |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> These criticisms mostly come from outside Catalonia, especially from [[conservative]], [[conservative liberal]]  and [[classical liberal]] circles of Spanish society. In Catalonia, on the other hand, there is a high social and political consensus on the language policies favoring Catalan, also among Spanish speakers and speakers of other languages.<ref name="presencia.cat">[http://www.presencia.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/349929-els-nous-catalanoparlants-a-favor-de-la-immersio-lingueistica.html Presencia.cat].</ref><ref name="presencia.cat"/><ref>[http://www.asabadell.cat/ca/notices/2010/04/els_nous_catalanoparlants_defensen_la_llengua_catalana_8694.php Asabadell.cat].</ref><ref>[http://www.normalitzacio.cat/noticia/index.php?sec=noticia&n=17756 Normalitzacio.cat].</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Joan Albert Argenter| coauthors = Institut d'Estudis Catalans.

In Catalonia, the Catalan language policy has been challenged by some anti-nationalist intellectuals like [[Albert Boadella]]. Since 2006, the liberal [[Citizens - Party of the Citizenry]] has been one of the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia. The local Catalan branch of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] has a more ambiguous position on the issue: on one hand, it demands a bilingual Catalan-Spanish education and a more balanced language policy that would defend Catalan without favoring it over Spanish,<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y3yT9t_IDA Youtube.com].</ref> while on the other, a few local PP politicians have supported in their municipalities measures privileging Catalan over Spanish<ref>[http://www.regio7.cat/arreu-catalunya-espanya-mon/2010/10/28/ppc-votar-favor-dun-reglament-sobre-catala/110435.html Regio7.cat].</ref> and it has defended some aspects of the official language policies, sometimes against the positions of its colleagues from other parts of Spain.<ref>[http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/889146/barcelones/Sanchez-Camacho-rebutja-la-postura-inicial-de-Bauza-de-derogar-la-llei-de-Normalitzacio-Linguistica-a-les-Illes-Balears 3cat24.cat].</ref>

{{see also|List of autopistes and autovies in Catalonia}}
[[File:Autopista C-16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Autovía C-16|Autovia C-16]] (''Eix del Llobregat'').]]

There are {{convert|12000|km}} of roads throughout Catalonia.

The principal highways are [[Autopista AP-7|<span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;AP-7&nbsp;'''</span>]] (''Autopista del Mediterrani'') and [[Autovía A-7|<span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;A-7&nbsp;'''</span>]] (''Autovia del Mediterrani''). It follows the coast from the [[France|French border]] to [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and [[Andalusia]]. The main roads generally radiate from Barcelona.  The A-2 and AP-2 connect inland and onward to Madrid.

Other major roads are:

Public-own roads in Catalonia are either managed by the autonomous government of Catalonia (e.g., <span style="color:white; background:#f00">'''&nbsp;C-&nbsp;'''</span> roads) or the [[Spanish Government]] (e.g., <span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;AP-&nbsp;'''</span>, <span style="color:white; background:#039">'''&nbsp;A-&nbsp;'''</span>, <span style="color:white; background:#f00">'''&nbsp;N-&nbsp;'''</span> roads).

===Railways===
[[File:RN103007TarJPVL.JPG|thumb|right|[[AVE|High-speed train (AVE)]] at [[Camp de Tarragona]].]]
Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 1848, linking Barcelona with [[Mataró]]. Given the topography most lines radiate from Barcelona.  The city has both suburban and inter-city services.  The main east coast line runs through the province connecting with the [[SNCF]] (French Railways) at [[Portbou]] on the coast.

There are two publicly owned railway companies operating in Catalonia: the Catalan [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya|FGC]] that operatates commuter and regional services, and the Spanish national [[RENFE]] that operates long-distance and high speed rail services (AVE and Avant).

[[High speed rail]] ([[AVE]]) services from [[Madrid]] currently reach [[Lleida]], [[Tarragona]] and [[Barcelona]]. The official opening between Barcelona and Madrid took place 20 February 2008. The journey between Barcelona and Madrid now takes about two-and-a-half hours. A connection to the French high speed TGV network has been completed, but is awaiting the completion of stations along the route to begin passenger service in April 2013.  This new line (currently the [[LGV Perpignan–Figueres|LGV Perpignan- Figueres Vilafant]]) passes through Girona and Figueres with a [[Perthus Tunnel|tunnel]] through the Pyrenees. There is a direct train from [[Barcelona Estació de França]] to [[Gare d'Austerlitz|Paris Austerlitz]] along the older railway tracks.

{{main|Traditions of Catalonia}}

[[Castell]]s are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing ''colles castelleres'' (teams). This practice originated in the southern part of Catalonia during the 18th century. The tradition of [[Castell|els Castells i els Castellers]] was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 2010.

The [[sardana]] is the most characteristic Catalan popular dance, other groups also practice ''[[Ball de bastons]]'', ''[[moixiganga]]'', [[galop]]s or ''[[jota (music)|jota]]'' in the southern part. Musically, the ''[[Habanera (music)|Havaneres]]'' are also characteristic in some marine localities of the [[Costa Brava]] especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a ''[[cremat]]'' of burned rum. Other music styles are [[Catalan rumba]], [[Rock català|Catalan rock]] and [[Nova Cançó]].

In the greater celebrations other elements of the Catalan popular culture are usually present: the parades of ''[[Gegants i capgrossos|gegants]]'' (giants) and ''[[correfoc]]s'' of devils and firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is ''[[Patum de Berga|La Patum de Berga]]'' declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by [[UNESCO]] in 25 November 2005.<ref>[http://www.bergueda.com/lapatum/festa.asp Patum de Berga].{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

In addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions. On July 28, 2010, [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|Catalonia became the second Spanish territory]], after the Canary Islands, to forbid bullfighting. The ban, which went into effect on January 1, 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hCUSkWOROQvtXQvPrgGjjE3dZWag The Press Association: Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting, 28 July 2010].{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>
