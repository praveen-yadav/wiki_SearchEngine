A '''color code''' is a system for displaying information by using different [[color]]s.

The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long distance communication by use of flags, as in [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] communication.<ref>''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers: Volume 29'' (1893), p. 507.</ref> The [[United Kingdom]] adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein [[red]] signified [[Risk|danger]] and [[white]] signified [[safety]], with other colors having similar assignments of meaning.

As chemistry and other technologies advanced, it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar, such as [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] in electrical and electronic devices, and pharmaceutical [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]].

The use of color codes has been extended to abstractions, such as the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] color code in the United States. Similarly, [[hospital emergency codes]] often incorporate colors (such as the widely used "Code Blue" indicating a [[cardiac arrest]]), although they may also include numbers, and may not conform to a uniform standard.

Color codes are often difficult for [[color blindness|color blind]] and blind people to interpret.

=='Friendly fire' prevention==
Military deaths and injuries due to ‘friendly fire’ incidents have long been a perennial problem. Misunderstood verbal messages in battle-field scenarios have often resulted in tragic consequences. In 2007, a '''colour-coded identification signalling system''' was embodied within an autonomous, electronically encrypted communications network by British inventor, Maurice Bligh {1} [patent: GB2449675]. Visual display units (VDUs) for field commanders or those at base command level employed colour-coded symbols and text messages to transcend the need for voice communication. The colour blue, widely recognised as representing friendly forces, identified allies at their geographical locations. The colour red indicated command level orders to cancel any military action deemed potentially dangerous to friendly forces or equipment. The colour green verified that no friendly personnel had been detected at various locations of interest.

==Emergency evacuation signalling systems==
An intelligent or computerised '''colour-coded evacuation signalling system''' was invented in the year 2000 by British inventor Maurice Bligh patents: {2} US 6646545/GB 2370675). The system consisted of a structure-wide network of LED illuminated, colour-coded symbols and text messages. These were designed to automatically illuminate in a narrow strip laid in the centre of floors and walkways. The purpose was to guide evacuees along safe assessed routes leading to their nearest and safest designated exits. The colour red was used to display flashing 'X' symbols and brief warnings messages to indicate the location of pre-determined danger zones, such as dead-end corridors or basement areas where there is no access to exits. Likewise, any developing danger zones where the spreading of fire, toxic smoke or other hazardous elements could prove life-threatening. The colour green was used to display elongated arrow symbols traversing in the pointing direction with text messages indicating the 'count-down' distances to exits to comfort and swiftly guide walking or crawling evacuees to safety, even in darkness and/or a smoke fog.
