'''Alexéy Leonídovich Pájitnov''' ({{lang-ru|Алексе́й Леони́дович Па́житнов}}, {{transl|ru|ISO|Alekséi Leonídovich Pázhitnov}};<!-- but he prefers the spelling Pajitnov, as explained on the talk page --> born 14 March 1956) is a Russian [[video game designer]] and [[Computer engineering|computer engineer]], {{As of|2007|alt=currently}} residing in the United States. Pajitnov developed the popular game ''[[Tetris]]'' while working for the [[Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet government]]-founded [[Research and development|R&D]] center.

Despite being the developer of ''Tetris'', Pajitnov did not receive royalties from his creation, as rights were owned by his employer, the Soviet government, which distributed it throughout the USSR and Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zidxG-ah3y8 |title=Tetris 1985 History of Games part 07 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> He only started to get royalties from his creation in 1996 when he and [[Henk Rogers]] formed [[The Tetris Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/special/tetrishist.html |title=Tetris: a history |publisher=Atarihq.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>

==Biography==
Alexey Pajitnov created ''Tetris'' with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and [[Vadim Gerasimov]] in 1984. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in the West in 1986.

Pajitnov also created the lesser known sequel to ''Tetris'', entitled ''[[Welltris]]'', which has the same principle but in a [[3D computer graphics|three dimensional]] environment where the player sees the playing area from above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mds.mdh.se/~frv95pen/game/tetris/welltris/ |title=Screenshots from Welltris, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Mds.mdh.se |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}</ref> ''Tetris'' was licensed and managed by Soviet company [[ELORG]] which had been founded specially for this purpose, and advertised with the slogan ''"From Russia with Love"'' (on NES: ''"From Russia With Fun!"''). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties.

Pajitnov, together with [[Vladimir Pokhilko]], moved to the [[United States]] in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers. He helped design the puzzles in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] versions of ''[[Yoshi's Cookie]]'' and designed the game ''[[Pandora's Box (1999 video game)|Pandora's Box]]'', which incorporates more traditional [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw-style puzzles]].

He began working for [[Microsoft]] in October 1996. Pajitnov worked for the ''[[Microsoft Entertainment Pack: The Puzzle Collection]]'', MSN Mind Aerobics and [[MSN Games]] groups. Pajitnov's new, enhanced version of ''[[Hexic]]'', ''Hexic HD'', was included with every new [[Xbox 360]] Premium package. He left Microsoft in 2005.

On August 18, 2005, WildSnake Software announced Pajitnov will be collaborating with them to release a new line of puzzle games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildsnake.com/newsletter/2005-08-18/ |title=WildSnake newsletter august 18 2005, retrieved 31-10-2007 |publisher=Wildsnake.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2009-11-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091112184900/http://www.wildsnake.com/newsletter/2005-08-18/| archivedate= 12 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
