'''[[Costa Rica]]''' is located on the [[Central American Isthmus]], surrounding the point 10° north of the [[equator]] and 84° west of the [[prime meridian]]. It borders both the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] (to the west), with a total of 1,228&nbsp;km of coastline (212&nbsp;km on the Caribbean coast and 1,016&nbsp;km on the Pacific).

Costa Rica shares a border with [[Nicaragua]] to the north (309&nbsp;km long border) and with [[Panama]] to the south (330&nbsp;km long border). The area of Costa Rica is 51,100&nbsp;km² of which 50,660&nbsp;km² is land and 440&nbsp;km² is water, making it slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]].

==Physical geography==
The nation's [[terrain]] is coastal plain separated by rugged mountains, the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca, which form the spine of the country and separate the Pacific and Caribbean watersheds.  Costa Rica claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}} and a [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}.  

The spine of the country produces many major river systems.  Rivers draining into the Caribbean include:
* [[Colorado River (Costa Rica)|Colorado River]] (''Rio Colorado'')
* [[Pacuare River]] (''Rio Pacuare'')
* [[Reventazón River]] (''Rio Parismina'')
* [[Reventazón River]] (''Rio Reventazon'')
* [[Sixaola River]] (''Rio Sixaola'')

Rivers draining into the [[Lake Nicaragua]] or the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] (''Rio San Juan''), whose waters eventually drains into the Caribbean, include:
* [[Sapoá River]] (''Rio Sapoá'')
* [[Frío River]] (''Rio Frío'')
* [[San Carlos River (Costa Rica)|San Carlos River]] (''Rio San Carlos'')
* [[Sarapiquí River]] (''Rio Sarapiquí'')

Rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean include:
* [[Abangares River]] (''Rio Abangares'')
* [[Guacimal River]] (''Rio Guacimal'')
* [[Sierpe River]] (''Rio Sierpe'')
* [[Tempisque River]] (''Rio Tempisque'')
* [[Térraba River]] (''Rio Terraba'')

In the eastern half of the country, the San Juan River forms the northern border with [[Nicaragua]].

===Mountain ranges===
====Cordillera de Tilarán====
The Tilaran Range is part of the [[Continental Divide]] east of [[Lake Arenal]] and the nearby [[active volcano]] [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]], and running into the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] range further east.  It is located in the [[Abangares Canton|Abangares]] district of the province of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]].

At the edge of the range is the [[Monteverde]] cloud forest preserve, a major [[ecotourism]] destination.

====Cordillera Central====
The [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Central Range]] continues the [[Continental Divide]] east of [[Cordillera de Tilarán]]. It has four large volcanoes: [[Poás Volcano|Poás]], [[Barva Volcano|Barva]], [[Irazú Volcano|Irazú]] and [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]]. The highest peak is Irazú at 3,432 m.

====Cordillera de Guanacaste====
The [[Cordillera de Guanacaste|Guanacaste Range]] is in northern Costa Rica near the border with [[Nicaragua]]. The range forms part of the southern region of the [[Continental Divide]], the highest peak being the [[extinct]] [[stratovolcano]] [[Miravalles Volcano|Miravalles]] at 2,028 m.  Peaks include:
* [[Tenorio Volcano National Park|Tenorio Volcano]] (1,913 m)
* [[Miravalles Volcano]] (2,028 m)
* [[Orosí Volcano]] (1,659 m)
* [[Rincón de la Vieja Volcano]] (1,916 m)

====Cordillera de Talamanca====
Much of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca|Talamanca Range]] is included in the [[La Amistad International Park]], which is shared between Costa Rica and Panama. The country's highest peaks lie in this mountain range: the [[Cerro Chirripó]] and the [[Cerro Kamuk]]. Much of the region is covered by the [[Talamancan montane forests|forest]].

====Cerros de Escazú====
The [[Cerros de Escazú]] borders the [[Costa Rican Central Valley|Central Valley]] to the south and is considered the northernmost portion of the Cordillera de Talamanca.

== Climate ==
{{main|Climate of Costa Rica}}
The country has a [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropical]] climate and is part of the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]]. It is part of many [[ecoregion]]s, including Costa Rican seasonal moist forests, Bocas del Toro-San Bastimentos Island-San Blas mangroves, Mosquitia-Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast mangroves, Southern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves, Central American dry forests, and Talamancan montane forests. An inlet from the Pacific the [[Gulf of Nicoya]] contains several small islands, the largest of these being [[Chira Island]] with a population of around four thousand.

Costa Rica's dry season in most places is from December to April, while the rainy season is from May to November. On the Caribbean coast, however, December is by far the wettest month. The highlands areas are always cooler. The lowest [[elevation]] levels in the country are on the western and eastern coasts, at [[sea level]]. The highest point is [[Cerro Chirripó]], a [[Volcano|volcanic]] mountain with an elevation of {{convert|3810|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (part of [[Chirripó National Park]]). On a clear day, it is possible to see both the Caribbean and the Pacific from the peak.

== Ecology ==
[[Image:Rainforest at Puentes Colgantes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rainforest]] in Costa Rica]]
Like all Central American countries, [[Costa Rica]] is considered part of a [[biodiversity hotspot]]. According to the [[INBio]], about 4.5% of the world's biodiversity can be found in Costa Rica.
Costa Rica is home to about 12,119 species of [[plant]]s, of which 950 are [[endemism|endemic]].<ref name="rainforests.mongabay.com">[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Costa_Rica.htm Costa Rica Forest Information and Data]. rainforests.mongabay.com</ref> There are 117 native trees and more than 1,400 types of [[orchid]]s, a third of them can be found in the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]].<ref>[http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/monteverde/orchid-garden/photo.htm Monteverde Costa Rica Orchids Garden Photo Gallery]. Monteverdeinfo.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-28.</ref> Almost a half of the country's land is covered by forests, though only 3.5% is covered by primary forests.<ref name="rainforests.mongabay.com"/> [[Deforestation in Costa Rica|Deforestation]] is a devastating process, with more than 8,100 ha of forest being lost annually. The main reason for such high deforestation levels is to make plains for cattle ranching.

[[Wildlife of Costa Rica|Wildlife diversity]] is very high; there are 441 species of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s, 838 species of [[bird]]s, 232 species of [[mammals]] and 181 species of fresh water fish. Costa Rica has high levels of [[endemism]]; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are [[endangered]]. According to the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered.<ref>[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ Home]. Unep-Wcmc. Retrieved on 2012-01-28.</ref> Some of the country's most endangered species are the [[Harpy eagle]], the [[Giant anteater]], the [[Golden toad]] and the [[Jaguar]]. [[IUCN]] reports the [[Golden toad]] as extinct.<ref>{{IUCNlink|3172|Incilius periglenes}} [[IUCN Red List]]'s article about the [[Golden toad]]</ref>

== Protected areas ==
{{See also|National Parks of Costa Rica|List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica}}

The country is noted for its [[National Parks of Costa Rica|national park system]], administered by [[SINAC]] (''Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion'', or "National System of Conservation Areas"). This agency oversees the 26 [[national park]], and more than 160 protected areas in Costa Rica.  The other types of protected areas in Costa Rica are National Wildlife Refuges, Biological Reserves, Protection Zones, and Absolute Nature Reserves.  Together the protected areas comprise over one-fourth of Costa Rican territory. 9.3% of the country is protected under [[IUCN]] categories I-V.

===Tortuguero National Park===
The creation of the [[Tortuguero National Park]] in 1970 gave much needed protection to one of the region's most important and unique natural resources: a 22&nbsp;km stretch of shoreline that serves as the principal nesting site for sea turtles.

==International law==
Costa Rica is party to many environmental treaties, including the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques|Convention on Environmental Modification]], the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], the [[Montreal Protocol]], the [[Ramsar Convention]], the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Desertification Convention]], the [[Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna|Endangered Species Convention]], the [[Basel Convention]], the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Convention on the Law of the Sea]], the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter|Convention on Marine Dumping]], the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. It has signed but not ratified the [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas|Convention on Marine Life Conservation]] and the [[Kyoto Protocol]].

Central America gained independence from Spain on September 15, 1820.
