[[Image:Americasnationalgame.jpg|right|thumb]]'''''America's National Game''''' is a book by [[Albert Spalding]], published in [[1911 in literature|1911]] detailing the early history of the sport of [[baseball]]. Much of the story is told first-hand, since Spalding had been involved in the game, first as a player and later an administrator, since the 1850s. In addition to his personal recollections, he had access to the records of [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], the game's first [[baseball statistics|statistician]] and archivist. Spalding was, however, known to aggrandise his role in the major moments in baseball's history.
