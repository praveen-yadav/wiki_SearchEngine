'''David Paul Cronenberg''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Royal Society of Canada|FRSC]] (born March 15, 1943){{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=1}} is a Canadian filmmaker, screenwriter and actor. He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the ''[[body horror]]'' or ''venereal horror'' genre. This style of [[filmmaking]] explores people's fears of bodily transformation and infection. In his films, the psychological is typically intertwined with the physical. In the first half of his career, he explored these themes mostly through [[horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]], although his work has since expanded beyond these genres. He has been called "the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world."<ref>{{cite web|author=[[J.

==Early life==
Born in [[Toronto]], Canada, Cronenberg was the son of Esther (née Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor.<ref name="filmr">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/David-Cronenberg.html |title=David Cronenberg Biography (1943–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> He was raised in a "middle-class progressive Jewish family".<ref>http://www.egs.edu/faculty/david-cronenberg/biography/."</ref><ref>http://thechronicleherald.ca/heraldmagazine/99409-canadian-icon-david-cronenberg</ref> He began writing as a child and wrote constantly. He attended high school at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]]. A keen interest in science, especially [[botany]] and [[lepidopterology]], led him to enter the Honours Science program at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1963, but he switched to Honors English Language and Literature later in his first year. Cronenberg's fascination with the film ''[[Winter Kept Us Warm]]'' (1966) by classmate [[David Secter]] sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses, learning art of filmmaking and made two 16mm films (''Transfer'' and ''From the Drain''). Inspired by the New York underground film scene, he founded the Toronto Film Co-op with Iain Ewing and [[Ivan Reitman]]. After taking a year off to travel in [[Europe]], he returned to Canada in 1967, graduating from [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]] at the top of his class.<ref name = fullbio>''New York Times'' (January 8, 2012).

==Career==
{{Section OR|date=January 2012}}
After two short sketch films and two short art-house features (the black and white ''[[Stereo (film)|Stereo]]'' and the colour ''[[Crimes of the Future]]'') Cronenberg went into partnership with [[Ivan Reitman]]. The Canadian government provided financing for his films through the 1970s. He alternated his signature "[[body horror]]" films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs (''[[Fast Company (1979 film)|Fast Company]]''). ''[[Rabid]]'' exploited the unexpected acting talents of [[pornographic]] actress [[Marilyn Chambers]] (Cronenberg's first choice was a young, then-unknown [[Sissy Spacek]]). ''Rabid'' was a breakthrough with international distributors and his next two horror features gained stronger support. During the 1970s, a few of Cronenberg's
early movies infuriated critics and led to controversy, but later he showed there was an intention to his films, and it was to shock the viewers with what they never saw before in horror.

During his career, Cronenberg's films follow a definite progression, a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in the breakdown of social order (e.g. ''Shivers'', ''Rabid''). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. ''[[The Brood]]'', ''[[Scanners]]'', ''[[Videodrome]]''). In the later period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. his remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''). This trajectory culminates in ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' in which a twin pair of [[gynecology|gynecologists]] spiral into [[codependency]] and [[drug addiction]]. His later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (''[[eXistenZ]]'', ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'', ''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'').{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}}

Cronenberg has cited [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] as influences.<ref>Browning, Mark (2007) ''David Cronenberg: author or film-maker?''. Intellect Books. ISBN 1-84150-173-5, ISBN 978-1-84150-173-4</ref> Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's "adaptation" of his literary hero [[William S. Burroughs]]' most controversial book, ''[[Naked Lunch]]''. The book was considered "unfilmable" and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would "cost 100 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world". Instead—much like in his earlier film, ''Videodrome''—he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be [[hallucinations]] brought on by the main character's drug addiction. Some of the book's "moments" (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'', he felt a moment of [[synergy]] with the writing style of Burroughs. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, "I'll just write his next book."{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}}

Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen "from the point of view of the disease", and that, for example, he identifies with the characters in ''Shivers'' ''after'' they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of [[Morphological freedom|personal transformation]]. Of his characters' transformations, Cronenberg said, "But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute."<ref>Gordon, Bette. [http://bombsite.com/issues/26/articles/1160 "David Cronenberg"], "[[BOMB Magazine]]", Winter, 1989. Retrieved July 25, 2011.</ref> Similarly, in ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as "a fertilizing rather than a destructive event". In 2005, Cronenberg would say that he was upset that [[Paul Haggis]] had chosen the same name for his [[Academy Award]] winning film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'', feeling it was "stupid" and "very disrespectful."<ref>{{cite web |title=Double Trouble |publisher=Slate Magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2118602/fr/nl/ |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}</ref>

Aside from ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983) and ''The Fly'', Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream [[Hollywood]] filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by [[George Lucas]] as a possible director for ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' but was passed. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' but experienced "creative differences" with producers [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Ronald Shusett]]. A different version of the film was eventually made by [[Paul Verhoeven]]. A fan of [[Philip K. Dick]], author of "We Can Remember it For You Wholesale," the short story upon which the film was based, Cronenberg related (in the biography/overview of his work, ''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'') that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time, he suffered a [[migraine]] just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.

In the late 1990s, Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', but this also fell through. His recent work, the thriller ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' (2005), is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted ''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'', but it is one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' (2007) a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia.

[[File:Director DAVID CRONENBERG of the film 'Spider' during the Toronto International Film Festival.jpg|thumb|left|Cronenberg at the 2011 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Cronenberg has collaborated with composer [[Howard Shore]] on all of his films since ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979), (see [[List of noted film director and composer collaborations]]) with the exception of ''The Dead Zone'' (1983), which was scored by [[Michael Kamen]]. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, [[art director]] Carol Spier, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] Bryan Day, [[film editor]] Ronald Sanders, his sister, [[costume designer]] [[Denise Cronenberg]], and, from 1979 until 1988, [[cinematographer]] Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first [[opera]], ''[[The Fly (opera)|The Fly]]''.

Since 1988's ''Dead Ringers'', Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer [[Peter Suschitzky]] on each of his films (see [[List of noted film director and cinematographer collaborations]]). Suschitzky was the director of photography for ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film "was the only one of those movies that actually looked good",<ref>{{cite web |title=David Cronenberg Re-Examines David Cronenberg |publisher=Film Freak Central |url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/dcronenbergretrointerview.htm|date=March 9, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2003}}</ref> which was a motivating factor to work with him on ''Dead Ringers''.

Having worked with many Hollywood stars, Cronenberg says that he did not get to make a film with an actor he wanted to work with for a long time, [[Burt Reynolds]]. Cronenberg remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles ''The Dead Zone'' and ''The Fly'') having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include ''M. Butterfly'', most of which was shot in China, ''Spider'' and ''Eastern Promises'', which were both filmed primarily in England, and ''A Dangerous Method'', which was filmed in Germany and Austria. ''Rabid'' and ''Shivers'' were shot in and around [[Montreal]]. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by [[Telefilm Canada]], and Cronenberg is a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, saying "Every country needs [a system of government [[Grant (money)|grants]]] in order to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood".<ref>{{cite web|last=Phipps |first=Keith |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22500 |title=David Cronenberg |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

Cronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors' films. Most of his roles are [[cameo appearance]]s, as in ''[[Into the Night (film)|Into The Night]]'', ''[[Jason X]]'', ''[[To Die For]]'', ''[[Blood and Donuts]]'' and ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', but on occasion he has played major roles, as in ''[[Nightbreed]]'' or ''[[Last Night (1998 film)|Last Night]]''. He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in ''The Fly''; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in ''Shivers''; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in ''Crash''; his hands can be glimpsed in ''eXistenZ''; and he appeared as a stand-in for [[James Woods]] in ''Videodrome'' for shots in which Woods' character wore a helmet that covered his head.

In 2008 Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition Chromosomes at the [[Rome Film Fest]] and the opera ''The Fly'' at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Châtelet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'', an adaptation of [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''The Talking Cure'', starring [[Keira Knightley]], [[Michael Fassbender]], and frequent collaborator [[Viggo Mortensen]]. The film was produced by independent British producer [[Jeremy Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/03/viggo-mortensen-replaces-christoph.html |title=Viggo Mortensen Replaces Christoph Waltz As Sigmund Freud In David Cronenberg's 'The Talking Cure' |publisher=The Playlist |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Keira Knightley Takes The Talking Cure | url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=26588|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, his film ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Official Selection">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |work=Cannes}}</ref><ref name="timeout">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |work=timeout}}</ref>

In the October 2011 edition of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'', Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of ''The Fly'', which he would like to direct if given the chance.  He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel, but rather a "parallel story".

For a time it appeared that, as ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' producer Paul Webster told [[Screen International]], a sequel is in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg, [[Steven Knight]] and Viggo Mortensen. The film was to be made by Webster's new production company ''Shoebox Films'' in collaboration with  [[Focus Features]] and to be shot in early 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=

In a September 2013 interview, Cronenberg stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work: "It wouldn't disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it. So what? It doesn't bother me." In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the "time of day" as to whether he is afraid of death.<ref name="Henry" />

==Personal life==
He first married Margaret Hindson in 1972: then his seven-year marriage ended in 1979 amidst personal and professional differences. They had one child, a daughter, Cassandra Cronenberg.
Now he is married to Carolyn Zeifman, production assistant on ''Rabid''. They have two children, Caitlin and [[Brandon Cronenberg|Brandon]].<ref>Mottram, James (October 21, 2007).

''The Independent''. Retrieved on: 2012-01-08.</ref> In the 1992 book ''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'', he revealed that ''[[The Brood]]'' was inspired by events that occurred during the unraveling of his first marriage, which caused both Cronenberg and his daughter Cassandra a great deal of turmoil. The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra's mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be "very satisfying".{{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=84}} Cronenberg lives in Toronto.{{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=1}}

Cronenberg describes himself as an atheist.<ref>Guttsman, Janet, ''Reuters.com'' (September 10, 2007). [http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0824644320070910 Cronenberg gets down and dirty with Russian mob; ''"I'm an atheist," Cronenberg said."'']</ref><ref>"I'm simply a nonbeliever and have been forever. ... I'm interested in saying, 'Let us discuss the existential question. We are all going to die, that is the end of all consciousness. There is no afterlife. There is no God. Now what do we do.' That's the point where it starts getting interesting to me." — Interview, Esquire, February 1992.</ref> His atheism was further explained in a September 2013 interview:

<blockquote>
Anytime I've tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion, I find it claustrophobic and oppressive. I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real.<ref name="Henry" /></blockquote>

In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that film director [[Martin Scorsese]] admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg's early work but was subsequently "terrified" to meet him in person. Cronenberg stated to Scorsese in response: "You're the guy who made ''Taxi Driver'' and you're afraid to meet me?"<ref name="Henry" />

==Awards and recognition {{anchor|Awards|Honours}}==
Cronenberg has appeared on various "Greatest Director" lists. In 2004, [[Science Fiction]] magazine [[Strange Horizons]] named him the 2nd greatest director in the history of the genre, ahead of better known directors such as [[Steven Spielberg]], [[James Cameron]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Ridley Scott]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Adam Smith |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040419/directors.shtml |title=The Ten Best Science Fiction Film Directors |publisher=strangehorizons.com |date=April 19, 2004 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> In the same year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed him 9th on their list of "The world's 40 best directors".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html |title=The world's 40 best directors |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> In 2007, [[Total Film]] named him as the 17th greatest director of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the_greatest_directors_ever_-_part_2 |title=Greatest Directors Ever |work=[[Total Film]] |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref>
