'''Alameda''' is a city in [[Alameda County, California]], United States. It is located on '''[[Alameda (island)|Alameda Island]]''' and [[Bay Farm Island, Alameda, California|Bay Farm Island]], and is adjacent to and west of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and in eastern [[San Francisco Bay]] across from [[San Francisco]] and [[South San Francisco]], in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Bay Farm Island, a portion of which is also known as "Harbor Bay Isle", is not actually an island, and is part of the mainland adjacent to the [[Oakland International Airport]]. At the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 73,812. Alameda is a [[charter city]], rather than a [[general law city]], allowing the city to provide for any form of government. Alameda became a charter city and adopted a [[council-manager government]] in 1916, which it retains to the present.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
The island Alameda occupies was originally a [[peninsula]] connected to Oakland. Much of it was low-lying and marshy, but on higher ground the peninsula and adjacent parts of what is now downtown Oakland were home to one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. The area was therefore called ''Encinal'', Spanish for "oak grove". ''Alameda'' is Spanish for "grove of poplar trees" or "tree-lined avenue",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dict_en_es/spanish/alameda;_ylt=AmS17PW60RO5ki1NGlCOvxP2s8sF|title=alameda – Spanish-English Translation and Pronunciation|work=Yahoo! Education|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> and was chosen in 1853 by popular vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/history_01.html|title=A Brief History of Alameda|work=A Brief History of Alameda|publisher=City of Alameda, California|accessdate=February 15, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110720034819/http://www.ci.alameda.ca.us/community/history_01.html |archivedate = July 20, 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

The inhabitants at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the late 18th century were a local band of the [[Ohlone]] tribe. The peninsula became part of the vast [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]] granted to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California. The grant was later confirmed by the new [[Mexico|Republic of Mexico]] upon its independence from Spain.

Over time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|592}}</ref>

The city was founded on June 6, 1853, and the town originally contained three small settlements. "Alameda" referred to the village at Encinal and High Streets, [[Hibbardsville, Alameda, California|Hibbardsville]] was at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and [[Woodstock, Alameda, California|Woodstock]] was on the west near the ferry piers of the [[South Pacific Coast Railroad]] and the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the [[Alameda Mole]], featuring transit connections between San Francisco ferries, local trollies and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.

The first post office opened in 1854.<ref name=CGN /> The [[San Francisco and Alameda Railroad]] opened the Encinal station in 1864.<ref name=CGN /> The Encinal area was also known as Fasskings Station in honor of Frederick Louis Fassking.<ref name=CGN /> Encinal's own post office opened in 1876, was renamed West End in 1877, and closed in 1891.<ref name=CGN /> The West End area was originally called Bowman's Point in honor of Charles G. Bowman, an early settler.<ref name=CGN />

The [[Alameda Terminal]] was the site of the arrival of the first train via the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] into the San Francisco Bay Area on September 6, 1869. The transcontinental terminus was switched to the [[Oakland Mole]] two months later, on November 8, 1869.

The borders of Alameda were made coextensive with the island in 1872, incorporating Woodstock into Alameda.<ref name=CGN />

In 1917, an attraction called [[Neptune Beach, California|Neptune Beach]] was built in the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to [[Coney Island]], the park was a major attraction in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners of the facility, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create tastes unique to Neptune Beach. Both the American [[snow cone]]<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Around Town – Alameda, CA | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.alamedamagazine.com/media/Alameda-Magazine/January-February-2005/Around-Town/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = December 6, 2007 | language = }}</ref> and the [[popsicle]]<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Alameda Museum Quarterly Newsletter | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.alamedamuseum.org/Quarterly/alamedamuseumQ405.pdf | work = | page =8 | accessdate = December 4, 2007 | language = }}</ref> were first sold at Neptune Beach. The [[Kewpie doll (toy)|Kewpie doll]], hand-painted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games at the beach&nbsp;– another Neptune Beach invention.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own, even filling in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and an exceptional roller coaster which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay. The ''Cottage Baths'' were available for rent.

Neptune Beach's two huge outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian [[Johnny Weismuller]], who later starred as the original Tarzan, and [[Jack LaLanne]], who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the [[Great Depression]], the completion of the [[San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge]], people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.

Some of the resort homes and buildings from the Neptune beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The [[Croll Building]], on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, famous as training quarters for the some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jefferies, Jack Johnson, and many other champions all stayed and trained here. Today this beautiful preserved building is home to Croll's Pizza and the 1400 Bar & Grill Restaurant. Neptune Court, just a block away on the corner of Central Ave. and McKay Ave., provides another glimpse of what resort life was like in Alameda in the 1920s. A short walk near Crab Cove will reveal many more historic gems.

The vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures&nbsp;– the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the [[Ferris wheel]], the roller coaster, and other rides&nbsp;– were auctioned off in 1940 for mere pennies on the dollar of their original cost. Today,{{When|date=February 2011}}  A consequence of the Neptune Beach closing around 1940 was a total dearth of quality, clean swimming facilities in town. A grass roots effort to create swimming pools at two high schools and two city parks would continue into the early 1960s.

When the railroad came to town in the 1860s Park Street developed into the major thoroughfare of the city and the location of the main Alameda train station, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. As a result they designated their mutual property line as Park Street.

The need for expanded shipping facilities led to the dredging of a canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda in 1902, turning Alameda into an island. Most of the soil from the canal was used to fill in nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island, but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author [[Jack London]] was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone. The [[Alameda Works Shipyard]] was one of the largest and best equipped shipyards in the country. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and ship building industries thrived along the [[Oakland Estuary|Alameda Estuary]], where the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane was used. Today,{{When|date=February 2011}}  the [[Port of Oakland]] across the estuary serves as one of the largest ports on the West Coast, using the shipping technologies originally experimented with in Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a "Coast Guard City," one of seven in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812|title=After 80 years, Alameda named 'Coast Guard City'|last=Bender|first=Kristin|date=March 22, 2006|work=Oakland Tribune|publisher=BNET|accessdate=February 15, 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100202181523/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060322/ai_n16140812 |archivedate = February 2, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific) which were later transformed into the [[East Bay Electric Lines]]. Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not [[streetcar]]s, but full-sized railroad cars which connected to the mainland by bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the [[Oakland Long Wharf|Oakland Mole]] and the Alameda Mole. In fact, one line which ran between the two moles was dubbed the "Horseshoe Line" for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after the completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains ran directly to San Francisco on the lower deck of the bridge, the ferries having been rendered unnecessary. Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired.

In the 1930s [[Pan American Airways]] established a [[seaplane]] port along the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the famous [[China Clipper]] flying boat.
In 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport. The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930. The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport. The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS Alameda).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_Oakland.htm#sanfranbay|title=Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Oakland Area|last=Freeman|first=Paul|date=December 27, 2009|work=[[Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields]]: California|publisher=Paul Freeman|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the NAS Alameda established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several [[aircraft carriers]]. It closed in 1997.

In the late 1950s the Utah Construction Company began a landfill beyond the ''Old Sea Wall'' and created ''South Shore''.

===1973 Air Disaster===
On February 7, 1973, a USN [[Ling-Temco-Vought|Vought]] [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7E Corsair II]] fighter jet on a routine training mission from [[Lemoore Naval Air Station]], suddenly caught fire, 28,000 feet over the [[San Francisco Bay]] and crashed into the Tahoe Apartments in Alameda.  Eleven people, including pilot Lieutenant Robert Lee Ward died in the crash and fire.<ref>Kulczyk, David. (2009).

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|10.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|12.3|sqmi|km2}} (53.79%) is water.

Although Alameda's nickname is "The Island City" (or simply "the island"), the current city occupies two islands as well as a small section of the mainland. Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS Alameda) at the west end of Alameda Island, [[South Shore, Alameda, California|Southshore]] along the southern side of Alameda Island, and [[Bay Farm Island]], which is part of the mainland proper. The area of the former NAS is now known as "Alameda Point." The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was. Alameda Point and Southshore are built on bay fill.

Not all of Alameda Island is part of the City of Alameda. Although nearly all of the island is in Alameda city limits, a small portion of a dump site west of the former runways at Alameda Point extends far enough into San Francisco Bay that it is over the county line and part of the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]].<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&-tree_id=4001&-_MapEvent=Pan&-context=tm&-errMsg=&-all_geo_types=N&-_useSS=N&-_dBy=140&-redoLog=false&-_zoomLevel=&-tm_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_M00083&-tm_config=|b=50|l=en|t=4001|zf=0.0|ms=thm_def|dw=0.127654448550011|dh=0.07576475132991932|dt=gov.census.aff.domain.map.EnglishMapExtent|if=gif|cx=-122.18653389899086|cy=37.84539209943137|zl=4|pz=4|bo=|bl=|ft=350:349:335:389:388:332:331|fl=403:381:204:380:369:379:368|g=05000US06001|ds=DEC_2000_SF1_U|sb=50|tud=false|db=140|mn=0.6|mx=79.2|cc=1|cm=1|cn=5|cb=|um=Percent|pr=1|th=DEC_2000_SF1_U_M00083|sf=N|sg=&-PANEL_ID=tm_result&-_pageY=&-_lang=en&-_pageX=&-geo_id=05000US06001&-_mapY=&-_mapX=&-_latitude=&-_pan=SW&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-_longitude=&-_changeMap=Identify#?67,251 FactFinder]</ref> <!-- Notice the small grey sliver on Alameda Point; it is part of San Francisco.-->

== Transportation ==
Vehicle access to Alameda Island is via three bridges from Oakland ([[Park Street Bridge|Park Street]], [[Fruitvale Bridge|Fruitvale Avenue]], and [[High Street Bridge]]s), as well as the two one-way [[Posey and Webster Street Tubes]] leading into [[Chinatown, Oakland|Oakland's Chinatown]]. Connections from Alameda to Bay Farm Island is provided via the Bay Farm Island Bridge for vehicular traffic as well as the Bay Farm Island Bicycle Bridge (the only pedestrian/bicycle-only drawbridge in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/pwa/dept_maintenance_operation_bay_farm_island_bicycle_bridge.shtml|title=Maintenance and Operations Department|publisher=Alameda County Public Works Agency|accessdate=February 15, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100209022257/http://www.acgov.org/pwa/dept_maintenance_operation_bay_farm_island_bicycle_bridge.shtml| archivedate= February 09 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>),.<ref>[http://www.acgov.org/pwa/dept_maintenance_operation_bay_farm_island_bicycle_bridge.shtml Maintenance and Operations Department] Alameda County Government website</ref> [[California State Route 61]] runs down city streets from the Posey and Webster Street Tubes, across the Bay Farm Island Bridge, and south to the Oakland Airport.

Public transportation includes the [[AC Transit]] buses (which include express buses to San Francisco) and two ferry services — the [[Alameda/Oakland Ferry]] and the [[Alameda Harbor Bay Ferry]]. [[AC Transit]] buses also cover 3 bus times in the morning and afternoon to [[Lincoln Middle School (Alameda, California)|Lincoln Middle School]], located in Alameda.Both ferry services may soon be transferred to the [[San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority|Water Transit Authority]]. The closest [[BART]] stations are [[Lake Merritt (BART station)|Lake Merritt]], near the exit to the Posey Tube, and [[Fruitvale (BART station)|Fruitvale]], near the Fruitvale Bridge.

Even though the island is just minutes off [[Interstate 880]] in Oakland, the speed limit for the city is 25&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h) on almost every road. Many unaware drivers fail to slow down after exiting the highway. Groups like Pedestrian Friendly Alameda and BikeAlameda advocate stronger enforcement of speeding laws.

Alameda has also featured prominently on automotive [[blog]] [[Jalopnik]], with their "Down on The Street" segment consisting of cars found on the streets of Alameda. Jalopnik has nicknamed it "The Island That Rust Forgot".

== Attractions ==
[[File:Vichouse.jpg|thumb|Victorian house in Alameda]]Due to its proximity to the Bay, [[windsurfing|wind surfers]] and [[kite surfing|kite surfers]] can often be seen at [[Robert W. Crown Memorial State Beach]]. From the beach there are also views of the San Francisco skyline and the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge.

One of the recent attractions is the [[aircraft carrier]] ''[[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS Hornet]]'', a [[museum ship]] now moored at the former Naval Air Station as the [[USS Hornet Museum|USS ''Hornet'' Museum]]. This ship was originally named the ''USS Kearsarge'', but was renamed in honor of the previous Hornet CV-8 (famous for the [[Doolittle raid]]), which was lost in October 1942.

Alameda is known for its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses; 9% of all single-family houses (1500) in Alameda are Victorian, and many more have been divided into two to four-unit dwellings.<ref>[http://www.eastbayexpress.com/bestof/award.php?oid=oid:18492&section=oid:17192&year=2002 East Bay Express | Page not found]</ref> It is said that Alameda has more pre-1906 earthquake era homes in the Gold Coast section than any other city in the Bay Area.

Alameda is home to the official offices and training facility of the [[Oakland Raiders]] [[American football]] team, which is located on Bay Farm Island. The facility is also home to [[The Raider Image]], the merchandise arm of the franchise, which the public can visit.

At the turn of the 19th century, the city of Alameda took a large chunk of Charles Froling's land away to build a street. Froling had planned to build his dream house on the plot of land he received through inheritance.<ref name="neighbor">Rubin, Sylvia. (January 7, 1988) [[San Francisco Chronicle]] ''Neighbor against neighbor; Mediators can resolve disputes.'' Section: People, Page B3.</ref> To spite the city and an unsympathetic neighbor, Froling built a house {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide, {{convert|54|ft|m}} long and {{convert|20|ft|m}} high on the tiny strip of land left to him.<ref name="neighbor"/> The Froling [[spite house]] is still standing and occupied.<ref name="neighbor"/>

Alameda is also known for its Fourth of July parade, which is advertised as the second oldest and second longest Fourth of July parade in the United States.<ref>[http://alamedaparade.com/media/#background Alameda Mayor's Fourth of July Parade Background Information]</ref> It features homemade floats, classic cars, motorized living room furniture, fire-breathing dragons, marching bands, and large crowds. The parade route is about 3&nbsp;miles (5&nbsp;km) long.

== Economic development ==
After two previous failures, voters in the city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a [[bond measure]] for construction of a new library to replace the city's [[Carnegie library]], damaged during the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]. The city also received state funds for the new library and opened the doors to the new facility in November 2006.

===Alameda Point===
[[Naval Air Station Alameda]] (NAS), at [[Alameda Point, Alameda, California|Alameda Point]], was decommissioned in 1997, and is in process of being turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development. The area of the former NAS is now known as Alameda Point. In late July 2006, the City of Alameda announced a deal with the Navy that would turn the land over to the city for $108M. The transfer process was initially slowed down by disputes between the Navy and the city regarding payment for environmental cleanup of the land.

In September 2010 the US Veterans Administration proposed construction of a $209 million state-of-the-art facility at Alameda Point that would provide primary care, specialty care, and mental health, substance abuse and other services. [http://alamedapointva.blogspot.com] The VA received Congressional $17.33 million in budget authority for the project in 2011. But concerns over the proximity to a nesting site for an endangered bird, the California Least Tern, have led to delays in moving the project forward. The VA’s 2012 and 2013 budget requests to Congress contain no funding requests for Alameda Point. [http://alamedapointva.blogspot.com]

In September 2011 Alameda and the Navy reached an agreement on the terms of a no-cost conveyance for the entire 918 acres at Alameda Point.<ref>http://alamedapointinfo.com/timeline/timeline-alameda</ref>

===America's Cup ===
The 33rd [[America's Cup]] Race was won by Golden Gate Yacht Club racing team BMW Oracle, founded by [[Larry Ellison]]. One possible use of the air station would be an alternate or partnered site with San Francisco for [[34th America's Cup]].
Within 2 weeks of the [http://www.ggyc.org Golden Gate Yacht Club] winning the America's Cup,  [http://alamedawaterfront.com/alameda-locals-and-city-start-americas-cup-campaign Alameda city council with local support] sent a unanimous letter of support to hold AC 34 in San Francisco Bay Area.
In early 2011, the City Council created an ad hoc America's Cup Citizens Advisory Committee to look for ways that Alameda could draw interest from teams and potential spectators. Through those efforts, in mid-2012, the Swedish [[Artemis Racing]] team announced that they would create their team base in one of the former air station hangars on Alameda Point.

===Wine and spirits production===
Rosenblum Cellars Winery, Rock Wall Winery, and [[St. George Spirits]] are located at Alameda Point. In 1978, Alameda veterinarian Kent Rosenblum and his wife Kathy founded Rosenblum Cellars. In 2008, the company was purchased by [[Diageo]] Estates. Shauna Rosenblum, daughter of Kent and Kathy, is the wine maker for Rock Wall Winery. In December, 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte, produced by St. George Spirits became the first brand of American-made [[absinthe]] to be legally produced in the United States since a ban was enacted in 1912.

===Theaters===
[[File:Alameda Theater.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Alameda Theatre]] in 2006 prior to expansion and restoration]]
The city restored the historic [[Art Deco]] city landmark [[Alameda Theatre]], expanding it to include a theater multiplex. The public opening was May 21, 2008.

The South Shore Mall Twin Cinema opened in 1969 and served as a prominent theater on the island until its closure in 1998. In 2002, the building was demolished and its former site is now a parking lot.

Alameda also hosts the Altarena Playhouse, which since 1957 has been home to the Bay Area's oldest continuously operating community theater organization.

==Local newspapers and magazines==
Alameda's first newspaper, the ''Encinal'', appeared in the early 1850s and the paper's editor was instrumental in the movement to incorporate the city. Following the ''Encinal'', several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the ''Daily Argus'' eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, [[Joseph R. Knowland]], wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''. Around 1900, the ''Daily Argus'' began to fade in importance and east and west papers ''The Times'' and ''The Star'' combined to take the leading role as the ''[[Alameda Times-Star]]'' in the 1930s. The ''Times-Star'' was sold to the [[Alameda Newspaper Group]] in the 1970s.

In 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by [[Knight Ridder]], at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally-based newspaper, the ''Alameda Sun'', in 2001. In 2006, Knight Ridder announced its impending sale to [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Corp.]], a Sacramento-based publishing firm. McClatchy Corp. has put the ''Contra Costa Times'', which under the Knight Ridder reorganization included all five of the original Hills Newspapers, up for sale. The current owners of the ''Alameda Times-Star'', [[MediaNews Group|MediaNews, Inc.]], based in [[Colorado]], have announced a strong interest in buying both the ''Contra Costa Times'' chain and the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', consolidating the daily newspaper market of the East Bay, effectively under one owner. MediaNews closed the ''Times-Star'' in 2011.

The Alameda community is currently served by two weekly newspapers, the Alameda Journal, owned by the MediaNews Group, and the Alameda Sun.

==Services==
[[Alameda Hospital]] is located there.

===Alameda Municipal Power===
Unlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power service, [[Alameda Municipal Power]] (AMP), that delivers services directly to consumers. AMP sold the majority of its telecommunications business to [[Comcast]] in 2008 but continues to provide telecommunication service at Alameda Point.

During the [[California electricity crisis]] of 2000 and 2001, Alameda Municipal Power did not raise electricity rates, while residents in most of the state endured significant price increases.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Energy/Alameda-Produces-Energy.htm Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates GeorgeRaine / SF Chronicle 13jan01] Alameda Produces Its Own Energy Island residents sustain low rates SF Chronicle, Jan 13, 2001 (archived)</ref>

The Association began in 1944. An annual benefit, Circus for Arts in the Schools, was started by clown artist [[Jeff Raz]] in 2004. Photo-realist [[Robert Bechtle]] has painted numerous Alameda subjects, including "Alameda Gran Torino," which was acquired by [[SFMOMA]] in 1974 and remains one of Bechtle's most famous works.<ref>[http://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/3509 SFMOMA | Explore Modern Art | Our Collection | Robert Bechtle | Alameda Gran Torino]</ref>

===Films shot in Alameda===
Alameda has been home to many movie sets. Some of the movies filmed on the island have included ''[[Bicentennial Man]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''The Matrix Reloaded'', ''[[The Matrix: Revolutions]]'', ''[[Bee Season]]'', the original 1968 ''Your, Mine and Ours'' and the movie musical ''[[Rent (film)|Rent]]''. Parts of [[Alameda High School]] were animated for the ''[[Animatrix]]'' episode "Kid's Story". A massive hangar at the former Naval Air Station Alameda was used to film special scenes requiring [[computer-generated imagery]] for movies such as ''Bicentennial Man'', ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'', ''[[What Dreams May Come (film)|What Dreams May Come]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]'' and many scenes from the ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' trilogy, including the signature [[bullet time]] scene. The open space of the decommissioned naval base often hosts ''[[MythBusters]]''' more dangerous experiments. The movie "Spirit Of '76" was filmed all throughout Alameda.

{{Main|Alameda Unified School District}}
Public primary and secondary education in Alameda is the responsibility of the [[Alameda Unified School District]], which is legally separate from the City government (as is common throughout California). The [[College of Alameda]], a two-year [[community college]] in the West End is part of the [[Peralta Community College District]]. The city has numerous private primary schools, and one private high school, [[St. Joseph Notre Dame High School]], a Catholic school.

==Sister cities==
Alameda's relationships with Wuxi and Jiangyin were initiated in 2005, in part, by Stewart Chen, who then served on the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board, and who went on to be elected to Alameda City Council in November, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thealamedan.org/news/students-chinese-sister-city-tour-alameda|publisher=The Alamedan|accessdate=October 3, 2013|title=Students from Chinese sister city tour Alameda}}</ref>

Wuxi, China, is a so-called friendship city, because the diplomacy organization [[Sister Cities International]] does not recognize the relationship.<ref name="Alameda Sun">{{cite web|url=http://www.alamedasun.com/local-and-hometown/4020|publisher=Alameda Sun|accessdate=October 1, 2013|title=Alameda Forges Ties With Jiangyin, China}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In September, 2013, a Tibetan rights group initiated a social media and e-mail campaign <ref>[http://tibettruth.com/2013/09/25/asking-the-mayor-of-alameda-not-to-fly-chinas-flag/ Asking The Mayor Of Alameda Not To Fly China’s Flag]</ref> targeting the Mayor of Alameda, complaining that City of Alameda's participation in, and association with, a flag-raising ceremony to recognize [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]] on October 1 was tantamount to endorsing the communist regime in [[China]], its human rights abuses, and the occupation of [[Tibet]]. The City of Alameda responded that the ceremony was a function of the Alameda Sister City Association and the Alameda Wuxi Friendship Committee, not a function of the City of Alameda. The Tibetan rights group responded that on September 26, the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board appointed a member, Michael Robles-Wong, as a representative to the Sister City Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.action-alameda-news.com/2013/09/27/tibetan-rights-group-takes-city-to-task-on-twitter-by-email/|publisher=Action Alameda News|accessdate=October 1, 2013|title=Tibetan Rights Group Takes City to Task on Twitter, by Email}}</ref>

On October 1, 2013, the Tibetan rights groupsTibetTruth and Bay Area Friends of Tibet sent roughly 75 protesters to Alameda City Hall to protest the ceremony, which organizers ultimately canceled before it began. Former City of Alameda Councilmember Frank Matarrese announced the cancellation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_24218191/alameda-protesters-force-cancellation-chinas-national-day-celebration|publisher=Mercury News|accessdate=October 3, 2013|title=Protesters force cancellation of China's National Day celebration}}</ref> Then-city councilmember Stewart Chen subsequently defended the ceremony, as a diplomatic, not political, exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alamedasun.com/editorial/12452-chinese-culture-does-deserve-celebration|publisher=Alameda Sun|accessdate=October 20,2013|title=Chinese Culture Does Deserve Celebration}}</ref>

In 2008, during a ceremony at Alameda City Hall celebrating the association of Jiangyang with Alameda as a sister city, a protester handed out fliers demanding "friendship with the Chinese people, not the Chinese government.".<ref name="Alameda Sun"/>
