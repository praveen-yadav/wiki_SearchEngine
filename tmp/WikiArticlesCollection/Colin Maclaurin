'''Colin Maclaurin''' (February 1698&nbsp;– 14 June 1746) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]] who made important contributions to geometry and algebra.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Maclaurin, Colin}}</ref> The Maclaurin series, a special case of the [[Taylor series]], is named after him.

Owing to changes in [[orthography]] since that time (his name was originally rendered as ''e.g.'' "'''M'Laurine'''"<ref>[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Maclaurin_EMS_notes.html "Colin Maclaurin: A Biographical Note" by Robin Schlapp (6 December 1946)]. (Note that the quotation in [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Turnbull_Maclaurin_1.html] has been altered.)</ref>), his surname is alternatively written '''MacLaurin.'''<ref>http://www.m-a.org.uk/docs/library/2064.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>  In [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] the name is "Cailean MacLabhruinn", which is literally 'Colin, the son of Laurence.'<ref>http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Turnbull_Maclaurin_1.html Turnbull lectures on Colin Maclaurin (4 February 1947), Part I</ref>

==Early life==
Maclaurin was born in [[Kilmodan]], [[Argyll]]. His father, Reverend and Minister of [[Glendaruel]] John Maclaurin, died when Maclaurin was in infancy, and his mother died before he reached nine years of age. He was then educated under the care of his uncle, the Reverend Daniel Maclaurin, minister of [[Kilfinan]].

==Academic career==
At eleven, Maclaurin entered the [[University of Glasgow]]. He graduated MA three years later by defending a thesis on ''the Power of Gravity,'' and remained at Glasgow to study [[divinity]] until he was 19, when he was elected professor of [[mathematics]] in a ten-day competition at the [[Marischal College]] in the [[University of Aberdeen]]. He would hold the record as the world's youngest professor until March 2008, when the record was officially given to [[Alia Sabur]].<ref name="theind">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/university-appoints-child-prodigy-worlds-youngest-professor-818776.html|title=University appoints world's youngest professor|publisher=The Independent|author=David McNeill|date=1 May 2008}}</ref>

In the vacations of 1719 and 1721, Maclaurin went to [[London, England|London]], where he became acquainted with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], Dr. Hoadley, Dr. [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Martin Folkes]], and other eminent philosophers. He was admitted a member of the [[Royal Society]].

In 1722, having provided a substitute for his class at Aberdeen, he traveled on the Continent as tutor to George Hume, the son of Alexander Hume, 2nd Earl of Marchmont. During their time in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], he wrote his essay on the ''Percussion of Bodies'', which would gain the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences]] in 1724. Upon the death of his pupil at [[Montpellier]], Maclaurin returned to Aberdeen.

In 1725 Maclaurin was appointed deputy to the mathematical professor at [[Edinburgh]], James Gregory (brother of [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] and nephew of the esteemed [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]]), upon the recommendation of [[Isaac Newton]]. On 3 November of that year Maclaurin would succeed Gregory, and be credited with raising the character of that university as a school of science. Newton was so impressed with Maclaurin that he had offered to pay his salary himself.

==Contributions to mathematics==
Maclaurin used [[Taylor series]] to characterize maxima, minima, and points of inflection for infinitely differentiable functions in his ''Treatise of Fluxions''. Maclaurin attributed the series to [[Brook Taylor|Taylor]], though the series was known before to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|Gregory]], and in special cases to [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] in fourteenth century India.<ref>{{cite web

Nevertheless, Maclaurin received credit for his use of the series, and the Taylor series expanded around 0 is sometimes known as the ''Maclaurin series'' {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}.

Maclaurin also made significant contributions to the gravitation attraction of ellipsoids, a subject that furthermore attracted the attention of d'Alembert, A.-C. Clairaut, Euler, Laplace, Legendre, Poisson and Gauss.  Maclaurin showed that an oblate spheroid was a possible equilibrium in Newton's theory of gravity.  The subject continues to be of scientific interest, and Nobel Laureate [[Subramanyan Chandrasekhar]] dedicated a chapter of his book ''Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium'' to Maclaurin spheroids. {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}

Independently from [[Euler]] and using the same methods, Maclaurin discovered the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]].  He used it to sum powers of [[arithmetic progression]]s, derive [[Stirling's formula]], and to derive the Newton-Cotes numerical integration formulas which includes [[Simpson's rule]] as a special case. {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}

Maclaurin contributed to the study of [[elliptic integral]]s, reducing many intractable integrals to problems of finding arcs for hyperbolas.  His work was continued by d'Alembert and Euler, who gave a more concise approach.{{harv|Grabiner|1997}}

In his Treatise of Algebra (Ch. XII, Sect 86), published in 1748, two years after his death, Maclaurin proved a rule for solving square linear systems in the cases of 2 and 3 unknowns, and discussed the case of 4 unknowns.<ref>{{cite book

  | year = 1748
}}</ref>  This publication preceded by two years [[Gabriel Cramer|Cramer]]'s publication of a generalization of the rule to ''n'' unknowns, now commonly known as [[Cramer's rule]].

==Personal life==
In 1733, Maclaurin married Anne Stewart, the daughter of [[Walter Stewart (solicitor)|Walter Stewart]], the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]], by whom he had seven children.

Maclaurin actively opposed the  [[Jacobite Risings#The Rebellion/Rising of 1745 ('The Forty-Five')|Jacobite Rebellion of 1745]] and superintended the operations necessary for the defence of Edinburgh against the Highland army. Upon entry into the city, however, he fled to [[York]], where he was invited to stay by the [[Archbishop of York]].

On his journey south, Maclaurin fell from his horse, and the fatigue, anxiety, and cold to which he was exposed on that occasion laid the foundations of [[dropsy]]. He returned to Edinburgh after the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] army marched south, but died soon after his return.

He is buried at [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]], [[Edinburgh]].

Mathematician and former [[MIT]] President [[Richard Cockburn Maclaurin]] was from the same family.

==Notable works==
Some of his important works are:

*''Geometria Organica'' - 1720
*''De Linearum Geometricarum Proprietatibus'' - 1720
*''Treatise on Fluxions'' - 1742 (763 pages in two volumes. The first systematic exposition of Newton's methods.)
*''Treatise on Algebra'' - 1748 (two years after his death.)
*''Account of Newton's Discoveries'' - Incomplete upon his death and published in 1750 or 1748 (sources disagree)

Colin Maclaurin was the name used for the new Mathematics and Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics Building at [[Heriot-Watt University]], Edinburgh.
