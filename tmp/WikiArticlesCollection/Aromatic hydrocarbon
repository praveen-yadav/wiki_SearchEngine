An '''aromatic hydrocarbon''' or '''arene'''<ref>Definition IUPAC [[Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00435.html Link]</ref> (or sometimes '''aryl hydrocarbon''')<ref>[http://diss.kib.ki.se/2003/91-7349-549-2/thesis.pdf Mechanisms of Activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor] by Maria Backlund, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet</ref> is a [[hydrocarbon]] with alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings. The term 'aromatic' was assigned before the physical mechanism determining [[aromaticity]] was discovered, and was derived from the fact that many of the compounds have a sweet scent. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a [[benzene|benzene ring]], after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, [[benzene]]. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ''monocyclic'' (MAH) or ''polycyclic'' (PAH).

Some non-benzene-based compounds called '''heteroarenes''', which follows [[Hückel's rule]], are also called as aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the [[heteroatom]]s [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[sulfur]].   Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are [[furan]], a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes an oxygen atom, and [[pyridine]], a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-aromatic.html HighBeam Encyclopedia: aromatic compound]</ref>

== Benzene ring model ==
[[Image:Benzene circle.svg|100px|right|thumb| [[Benzene]] ]]
{{main|aromaticity}}
[[Benzene]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one recognized. The nature of its bonding was first recognized by [[August Kekulé]] in the 19th century. 
Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighboring carbons. This leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.

The structure is also illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show  six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This also represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds all of [[bond order]] ~1.5. This equivalency is well explained by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance form]]s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.

General properties:
# Display [[aromaticity]].
# The carbon-hydrogen ratio is high.
# They burn with a sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon-hydrogen ratio.
# They undergo [[electrophilic substitution reaction]]s and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]s.

The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Sir Robert Robinson]] and his student James Armit in 1925<ref>James Wilkins Armit and Robert Robinson (1925) "Polynuclear heterocyclic aromatic types.  Part II.  Some anhydronium bases," ''Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions'', '''127''': 1604-1618.</ref> and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison & Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic pi system in some publications, or only those pi systems that obey [[Hückel's rule]] on others. Jensen <ref>William B. Jensen (April 2009) [http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/157.%20Aromaticity%20Circle.pdf "The circle symbol for aromaticity,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education'', '''86'''(4): 423-424.</ref> argues that in line with Robinson's original proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 pi-electron systems. In this way the circle symbol for a 6c–6e bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a [[3c–2e bond]].

==Arene synthesis==
A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an '''aromatization'''. Many laboratory methods exist for the [[organic synthesis]] of arenes from non-arene precursors. Many methods rely on [[cycloaddition]] reactions. [[Alkyne trimerization]] describes the [2+2+2] cyclization of three alkynes, in the [[Dötz reaction]] an alkyne, carbon monoxide and a chromium carbene complex are the reactants.[[Diels-Alder reaction]]s of [[alkyne]]s with [[pyrone]] or [[cyclopentadienone]] with expulsion of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds. In [[Bergman cyclization]] the reactants are an [[enyne]] plus a hydrogen donor.

Another set of methods is the aromatization of [[cyclohexane]]s and other aliphatic rings: reagents are catalysts used in [[hydrogenation]] such as platinum, palladium and nickel (reverse hydrogenation), [[quinone]]s and the elements [[sulfur]] and [[selenium]].<ref>Jerry March Advanced Organic Chemistry 3Ed., ISBN 0-471-85472-7</ref>

==Arene reactions==
Arenes are reactants in many organic reactions.

===Aromatic substitution===
In aromatic substitution one [[substituent]] on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another substituent. The two main types are [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]] when the active reagent is an electrophile and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] when the reagent is a nucleophile. In [[radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] the active reagent is a radical. An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of [[salicylic acid]]:<ref>{{cite DOI|10.1016/0040-4039(95)00281-G}}</ref>
:[[File:Synthesis 5-Nitrosalicylic acid.svg|400px|Nitration of salicylic acid]]

===Coupling reactions===
In [[coupling reaction]]s a metal catalyses a coupling between two formal radical fragments. Common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new [[carbon-carbon bond]]s e.g., alkylarenes, vinyl arenes, biraryls, new [[carbon-nitrogen bond]]s (anilines) or new [[carbon-oxygen bond]]s (aryloxy compounds). An example is the direct arylation of [[perfluorobenzenes]] <ref>{{cite DOI|10.1021/ja062509l}}</ref>

===Hydrogenation===
[[Hydrogenation]] of arenes create saturated rings. The compound [[1-naphthol]] is completely reduced to a mixture of [[decalin]]-ol [[isomer]]s.<ref>Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.371 (1988); Vol. 51, p.103 (1971). http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV6P0371.pdf</ref>
:[[Image:NaphtolHydrogenation.svg|500px|1-naphthol hydrogenation]]
The compound [[resorcinol]], hydrogenated with [[Raney nickel]] in presence of aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] forms an [[enolate]] which is alkylated with [[methyl iodide]] to ''2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexandione'':<ref>Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.743 (1973); Vol. 41, p.56 (1961). http://orgsynth.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV5P0567.pdf</ref>
:[[Image:ResorcinolHydrogenation.svg|600px|Resorcinol Hydrogenation]]

===Cycloadditions===
[[Cycloaddition]] reaction are not common. Unusual thermal Diels-Alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the [[Wagner-Jauregg reaction]]. Other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through [[excimer]]s.

== Benzene and derivatives of benzene ==
Benzene derivatives have from one to six [[substituent]]s attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are [[phenol]], which carries a [[hydroxyl]] group, and [[toluene]] with a [[methyl]] group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring,  their spatial relationship becomes important for which the [[arene substitution patterns]] ''ortho'', ''meta'', and ''para'' are devised. For example, three [[isomer]]s exist for [[cresol]] because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other (ortho), one position removed from each other (meta), or two positions removed from each other (para). [[Xylenol]] has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.

The arene ring has an ability to stabilize charges. This is seen in, for example, phenol (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>-OH), which is [[acidic]] at the hydroxyl (OH), since a charge on this oxygen (alkoxide -O<sup>&ndash;</sup>) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring.

'''[[Polyaromatic hydrocarbons|Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons]]''' ('''PAH'''s), also known as '''polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons''' or '''polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons''', are potent atmospheric pollutants that consist of fused [[aromatic]] [[simple aromatic ring|rings]] and do not contain [[heteroatom]]s or carry [[substituent]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Fetzer |first = J.

PAHs occur in [[oil]], [[coal]], and [[tar]] deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As a pollutant, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic, and [[teratogen]]ic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |publisher=European Commission, Scientific Committee on Food|date=December 4, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Larsson |first=B.

They are also found in the [[interstellar medium]], in [[comet]]s, and in [[meteorite]]s and are a [[PAH world hypothesis|candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life]]. In [[graphene]] the PAH motif is extended to large 2D sheets.

===Occurrence and pollution===
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are [[lipophilic]], meaning they mix more easily with oil than water. The larger compounds are less water-soluble and less [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] (i.e., less prone to evaporate). Because of these properties, PAHs in the environment are found primarily in [[soil]], sediment and oily substances, as opposed to in water or air. However, they are also a component of concern in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] suspended in air.

Natural crude oil and coal deposits contain significant amounts of PAHs, arising from chemical conversion of natural product molecules, such as steroids, to aromatic hydrocarbons. They are also found in processed fossil fuels, [[tar]] and various edible oils.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nmmpK0oDE20C&pg=PA125 |page=125 |title=Activated carbon applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries |author=Glenn Michael Roy |publisher=CRC Press |year=1995 |isbn=1-56676-198-0}}</ref>

PAHs are one of the most widespread organic pollutants. In addition to their presence in fossil fuels they are also formed by incomplete [[combustion]] of [[carbon]]-containing fuels such as [[wood]], [[coal]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[fat]], [[tobacco]], and [[incense]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Incense link to cancer |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2001-08-02 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1467409.stm}}</ref> Different types of combustion yield different distributions of PAHs in both relative amounts of individual PAHs and in which [[isomer]]s are produced. Thus, coal burning produces a different mixture than motor-fuel combustion or a forest fire, making the compounds potentially useful as indicators of the burning history. Hydrocarbon emissions from fossil fuel-burning engines are regulated in developed countries.<ref>For example, EPA regulations for small engines are at 40 CFR §90.103; see [[emission standard]] for more information.</ref>

===Human health===
PAHs toxicity is very structurally dependent, with isomers (PAHs with the same formula and number of rings) varying from being nontoxic to being extremely toxic. Thus, highly carcinogenic PAHs may be small or large. One PAH compound, [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], is notable for being the first chemical carcinogen to be discovered (and is one of many carcinogens found in [[Chemicals in a cigarette|cigarette smoke]]). The EPA has classified seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: [[benz(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']fluoranthene]], [[chrysene]], [[dibenz(a,h)anthracene]], and [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]].

PAHs known for their [[carcinogen]]ic, [[mutagen]]ic and [[teratogen]]ic properties are [[benz(a)anthracene|benz[''a'']anthracene]] and [[chrysene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(j)fluoranthene|benzo[''j'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[benzo(ghi)perylene|benzo[''ghi'']perylene]], [[coronene]], [[dibenz(a,h)anthracene]] (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>14</sub>), [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]] (C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) and [[ovalene]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Luch, A.|year=2005|title=The Carcinogenic Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons|place=London|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-417-5}}</ref>

High prenatal exposure to PAH is associated with lower IQ and childhood asthma.<ref>[http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/07/20/exposure-to-common-pollutant-in-womb-might-lower-iq.html Exposure to Common Pollutant in Womb Might Lower IQ]</ref>   The Center for Children's Environmental Health reports studies that demonstrate that exposure to PAH pollution during pregnancy is related to adverse birth outcomes including low birth weight, premature delivery, and heart malformations.  Cord blood of exposed babies shows DNA damage that has been linked to cancer.  Follow-up studies show a higher level of developmental delays at age three, lower scores on IQ tests and increased behaviorial problems at ages six and eight.<ref>

===Chemistry===
The simplest PAHs, as defined by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) (G.P Moss, IUPAC nomenclature for fused-ring systems), are [[phenanthrene]] and [[anthracene]], which both contain three fused aromatic rings. Smaller molecules, such as [[benzene]], are not PAHs.

PAHs may contain four-, five-, six- or seven-member rings, but those with five or six are most common. PAHs composed only of six-membered rings are called '''alternant''' PAHs. Certain alternant PAHs are called '''benzenoid''' PAHs. The name comes from [[benzene]], an aromatic hydrocarbon with a single, six-membered ring. These can be benzene rings interconnected with each other by single carbon-carbon bonds and with no rings remaining that do not contain a complete benzene ring.

The set of alternant PAHs is closely related to a set of mathematical entities called [[polyhex (mathematics)|polyhex]]es, which are planar figures composed by conjoining regular [[hexagon]]s of identical size.

PAHs containing up to six fused aromatic rings are often known as "small" PAHs, and those containing more than six aromatic rings are called "large" PAHs. Due to the availability of samples of the various small PAHs, the bulk of research on PAHs has been of those of up to six rings. The biological activity and occurrence of the large PAHs does appear to be a continuation of the small PAHs. They are found as combustion products, but at lower levels than the small PAHs due to the kinetic limitation of their production through addition of successive rings. In addition, with many more isomers possible for larger PAHs, the occurrence of specific structures is much smaller.

PAHs possess very characteristic [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|UV absorbance spectra]]. These often possess many absorbance bands and are unique for each ring structure. Thus, for a set of [[isomer]]s, each isomer has a different UV absorbance spectrum than the others. This is particularly useful in the identification of PAHs. Most PAHs are also [[fluorescent]], emitting characteristic wavelengths of light when they are excited (when the molecules absorb light). The extended pi-electron electronic structures of PAHs lead to these spectra, as well as to certain large PAHs also exhibiting [[semiconductor|semi-conducting]] and other behaviors.

[[Naphthalene]] (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub> constituent of [[mothball]]s), consisting of two coplanar six-membered rings sharing an edge, is another aromatic hydrocarbon. By formal convention, it is not a true PAH, though is referred to as a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

Aqueous solubility decreases approximately one order of magnitude for each additional ring.

===Detection===
Detection of PAHs in materials is often done using [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] or [[liquid chromatography]] with [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|ultraviolet-visible]] or [[fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence]] spectroscopic methods or by using rapid test PAH indicator strips.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has designated 32 PAH compounds as priority pollutants. The original 16 are listed. They are [[naphthalene]], [[acenaphthylene]], [[acenaphthene]], [[fluorene]], [[phenanthrene]], [[anthracene]], [[fluoranthene]], [[pyrene]], [[benzo(a)anthracene|benzo[''a'']anthracene]], [[chrysene]], [[benzo(b)fluoranthene|benzo[''b'']fluoranthene]], [[benzo(k)fluoranthene|benzo[''k'']flouranthene]], [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[''a'']pyrene]], [[dibenz(ah)anthracene]], [[benzo(ghi)perylene|benzo[''ghi'']perylene]], and [[indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene]]. This list of the 16 EPA priority PAHs is often targeted for measurement in environmental samples.

===Aromaticity===
Although PAHs clearly are aromatic compounds, the degree of [[aromaticity]] can be different for each ring segment. According to '''Clar's rule''' (formulated by Erich Clar in 1964)<ref>{{cite book |author=Clar, E. (Erich) |year=1964 |title=Polycyclic Hydrocarbons |place=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]]. [http://lccn.loc.gov/63012392 LCCN 63012392]}}</ref> for PAHs the [[resonance structure]] with the most disjoint aromatic п-sextets—i.e., benzene-like moieties—is the most important for the characterization of the properties.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/poc.938|title=Assessment of Clar's aromatic π-sextet rule by means of PDI, NICS and HOMA indicators of local aromaticity|year=2005|last1=Portella|first1=Guillem|last2=Poater|first2=Jordi|last3=Solà|first3=Miquel|journal=Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry|volume=18 |issue=8|pages=785}}</ref>

|}

For example, in [[phenanthrene]] ('''1''') one Clar structure has two sextets at the extremities, while the other resonance structure has just one central sextet. Therefore in this molecule the outer rings are firmly aromatic while its central ring is less aromatic and therefore more reactive. In contrast, in [[anthracene]] ('''2''') the number of sextets is just one and aromaticity spreads out. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the UV absorbance spectra of these two isomers. [[Phenanthrene]] has a highest wavelength absorbance around 290&nbsp;nm, while [[anthracene]] has highest wavelength bands around 380&nbsp;nm. Three Clar structures with two sextets are present in [[chrysene]] ('''3''') and by superposition the aromaticity in the outer ring is larger than in the inner rings. Another relevant Clar hydrocarbon is [[zethrene]].
