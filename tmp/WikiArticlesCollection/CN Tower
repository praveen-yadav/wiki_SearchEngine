Its name "CN" originally referred to [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]], the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to [[Divestment|divest]] non-core freight railway assets, prior to the company's [[privatization]] in 1995, it transferred the tower to the [[Canada Lands Company]], a federal [[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporation]] responsible for real estate development. Since the name ''CN Tower'' became common in daily usage, the abbreviation was eventually expanded to '''Canadian National Tower''' or '''Canada's National Tower'''. However, neither of these names is commonly used.<ref name="CN">{{cite web

== History ==
[[File:Toronto-view-from-cn-tower.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View from CN Tower at night]]
[[File:Gardiner Expressway Downtown Toronto.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east at the CN Tower from the [[Gardiner Expressway]].]]
The idea of the CN Tower originated in 1968 when the [[Canadian National Railway]] had a desire to build a large TV and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, as well as demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972. The tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see [[CityPlace, Toronto|CityPlace]]), a large development south of [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] on the [[Railway Lands]], a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant by newer yards outside the city. Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; [[John Andrews (architect)|John Andrews Architects]]; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).<ref name="skyscraper"/><ref name="emporis"/><ref name="CNTower"/>

As Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably [[First Canadian Place]].  The reflective nature of the new buildings compromised the quality of broadcast signals necessitating new, higher antennas that were at least {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.
At the time, most data communications took place over [[Microwave#Communication|point-to-point microwave]] links, whose dish antennae covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent "hub" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area. The CN Tower can be seen from at least as far away as Kennedy Street in [[Aurora, Ontario]], approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north, {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Toronto, in [[Oshawa]], and from several points on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]], {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south in New York state in the United States.<ref name="great"/><ref name="CNTower"/>

The original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical "pillars" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and the SkyPod lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to the SkyPod, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.<ref name="CNTower"/><ref name="ieee">{{cite web|last=Hahn|first=Trizec|title=A Brief Overview of the CN Tower|url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/cntower/cntower_overview.html|publisher=Ieee.ca|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>

The idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (now named SkyPod) was not part of the plans until some time later. One engineer in particular felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.<ref name="CNTower"/><ref name="ieee"/>

=== Construction ===
[[File:Downtown Toronto from CN Tower1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View of downtown Toronto from the CN Tower]]
Construction on the CN Tower began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, {{convert|56000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} of [[soil|earth]] and [[shale]] were removed to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in the centre, and a base incorporating {{convert|7000|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete with {{convert|450|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[rebar]] and {{convert|36|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on}} of [[wire rope|steel cable]] had been built to a thickness of {{convert|6.7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.<ref name="ieee"/>

To build the main support pillar, a hydraulically raised [[Slip forming|slipform]] was built at the base. This was a fairly impressive engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about {{convert|6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured continuously by a team of 1,532 people until February 22, 1974, during which it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built [[Inco Superstack]], which was built using similar methods. In total, the tower contains {{convert|40500|m3|cuyd|0|abbr=on}} of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive [[plumb bob]]s hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only {{convert|29|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="CNTower"/><ref name="ieee"/>

</div>
[[File:Cntower1974.jpg|thumb|Brackets being raised, August 1974]]
In August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Space Deck (currently named SkyPod) was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.<ref name="ieee"/>

The antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but during construction the [[Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane]] helicopter became available when the [[United States Army]] sold off theirs to civilian operators. The helicopter, named "Olga", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections. The flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in the local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from Moscow's [[Ostankino Tower]], and bringing the total mass to {{convert|118000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.

Two years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that "All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset," and that "Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build."<ref>Fulford, Robert (1995).

=== Opening ===
The CN Tower opened to the public on June 26, 1976, although the official opening date was October 1, 1976. The construction costs of approximately [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]63 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|CA|63000000|1976}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars){{inflation-fn|CA}} were repaid in fifteen years. [[Canadian National Railway]] sold the tower prior to taking the company private in 1995, when they decided to divest themselves of all operations not directly related to their core freight shipping businesses.

From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the [[Metro Toronto Convention Centre]] in 1984 and the SkyDome in 1989 (renamed [[Rogers Centre]] in 2005), the former Railway Lands were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the [[SkyWalk]] in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby railway and subway station, [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] and, in turn, to the city's [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]] underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a boom in [[condominium]] construction in the first two decades of the 21st century.<ref name="great"/><ref name="CNTower"/><ref name="ieee"/>

== Events ==
*When the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: the SkyPod (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at {{convert|447|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the Indoor Observation Level (now named Indoor Lookout Level) at {{convert|346|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="great"/><ref name="ieee"/> One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant, which completed a revolution once every 90 minutes.
*Stuntman [[Dar Robinson]] jumped off of the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980. The first was for a scene from the movie [[Highpoint (film)|Highpoint]], in which Robinson received $250,000 for the stunt. The second was for a personal documentary. Both stunts used a wire decelerator attached to his back. <ref name="robinson">{{cite news |title= Man Jumps From CN Tower With No Parachute (Thirty Years Ago)

*On June 26, 1986, the ten-year anniversary of the tower's opening, [[Tower block|high-rise]] firefighting and rescue advocate [[Dan Goodwin]], in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day. Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first=Dan|title=SkyscraperDefense.com, by Dan Goodwin {{!}} Skyscraper News, Videos, Statistics, and Forum|url=http://www.skyscraperdefense.com/building_climbs.html|publisher=Skyscraperdefense.com|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref>
*The Glass Floor, at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|abbr=on}}, opened to the public on June 26, 1994.<ref name="ieee"/>
*From 1997 to January 2004, [[The Hahn Company|TrizecHahn Corporation]] managed the tower and instituted several expansion projects including a [[Canadian dollar|C$]]26 million entertainment expansion and revitalization that included the 1997 addition of two new elevators (to a total of six) and the relocation of the staircase from the north side leg to inside the core of the building, a conversion that also added nine stairs to the climb. TrizecHahn also owned the [[Willis Tower]] (Sears Tower at the time) approximately at the same time.
*In 2007, [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) lights replaced the incandescent lights that lit the CN Tower at night, the reason cited that LED lights are more cost and energy efficient than the incandescent lights. The colour of the LED lights can change, compared to the constant white colour of the incandescent lights.
*On September 12, 2007, [[Burj Khalifa]], then under construction, surpassed the CN Tower as the world's tallest free-standing structure.<ref name="CBCSurpassed">{{cite news |title= CN Tower dethroned by Dubai building|url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/09/12/cntower-surpassed.html|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date= September 12, 2007|accessdate=April 9, 2008 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjGjwQa |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>
*In 2008, glass panels were installed in one of the CN Tower elevators, which established a world record (346 m) for highest glass floor paneled elevator in the world.
*The CN Tower was closed during the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit|G-20 summit]] on June 26–27, 2010, for security reasons, given its proximity to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.
*In 2011, EdgeWalk (where at an elevation of {{convert|356|m|ft}}, visitors tethered to an overhead rail system can walk on the roof of the main pod) opened to the public.<ref name="ieee"/>

=== Falling ice danger ===
[[File:CN Tower seen from its base.jpg|thumb|left|CN Tower as seen from its base.]]
A [[freezing rain]] storm on March 2, 2007, resulted in a layer of ice several centimetres thick forming on the side of the tower and other downtown buildings. The sun thawed the ice, and winds of up to {{convert|90|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} blew some of it away from the structure. There were fears that cars and windows of nearby buildings would be smashed by large chunks of ice. In response, police closed some streets surrounding the tower. During morning rush hour on March 5, police expanded the area of closed streets to include the [[Gardiner Expressway]] {{convert|310|m|ft|0}} away from the tower, as increased winds blew the ice farther away, as far north as [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street]], {{convert|490|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} away, where a [[taxicab]] window was shattered.

Subsequently, on March 6, 2007, the Gardiner Expressway was reopened after winds died down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citynews.ca/news/features_8415.aspx|title=Video: Falling CN Tower Ice|publisher=[[CITY-DT]] |date=March 2, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjOujAX |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

== Structure ==
[[File:Toronto - ON - CN Tower Turmkorb.jpg|thumb|Main Pod]]
[[File:CN Tower Turmkorb-Modell-blau.png|thumb|Cross-section of the Main Pod]]
The CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the [[Stairs|stairwells]] and power and plumbing connections. The Tower's six [[elevator]]s are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts are lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way up the Tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the Tower; the Tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the Tower is a {{convert|102|m|ft|1|adj=on}} tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying TV and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: the Glass Floor and Outdoor Observation Terrace which are both located at an elevation of {{convert|342|m|ft|0}}, the Indoor Lookout Level (formerly known as "Indoor Observation Level") located at {{convert|346|m|ft|0}}, and the higher SkyPod (formerly known as "Space Deck") at {{convert|446.5|m|ft|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url= http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=21|title= CN Tower|accessdate=April 9, 2008|work=SkyscraperPage.com|publisher=Skyscraper Source Media|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjHU5r3 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> just below the metal [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. The hexagonal shape can be seen between the two areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large [[tripod]].

The main deck level is seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas — at {{convert|338|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} — is a large white donut-shaped [[radome]] containing the structure's microwave receivers. The [[glass floor]] and outdoor observation deck are at {{convert|342|m|ft|1}}. The glass floor has an area of {{convert|24|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} and can withstand a pressure of {{convert|4100|kPa|psi|0|lk=on}}. The floor's thermal glass units are {{convert|64|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, consisting of a pane of {{convert|25|mm|in|1|adj=on}} laminated glass, {{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} airspace and a pane of {{convert|13|mm|in|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} laminated glass. Some people experience [[acrophobia]] when standing on the glass floor and looking down at the ground {{convert|342|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} below. In 2008, one elevator was upgraded to add a glass floor panel, believed to have the highest vertical rise of any elevator equipped with this feature.<ref>{{cite news |author=Canadian Press|authorlink= Canadian Press|title= CN Tower's glass-floor elevator aims for record|url= http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/412944|work=Toronto Star|date= April 9, 2008|accessdate=April 9, 2008 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjI6ZFB |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}} {{cite news |last= Loriggio|first=Paola|title= CN Tower unveils glass-floor elevator|url= http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/413153|work=Toronto Star|date= April 10, 2008|accessdate=April 9, 2008 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjI6ZFB |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}} Both linked pages include a video of the elevator with glass floor in operation.</ref>  The Horizons Cafe and the lookout level are at {{convert|346|m|ft|1}}.

=== Safety features ===
[[File:insidecntower360.JPG|thumb|Inside the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower]]
In August 2000, a fire broke out at the [[Ostankino Tower]] in Moscow. It killed three people and caused extensive damage. The fire was blamed on poor maintenance and outdated equipment. The failure of the fire-suppression systems and the lack of proper equipment for firefighters allowed the fire to destroy most of the interior and spark fears the tower might even collapse.

The Ostankino Tower was completed nine years before the CN Tower, and is only {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}} shorter.<ref name=doom>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/fire-in-1800ft-tv-tower-adds-to-russians-feeling-of-doom-711667.html Fire in 1,800ft TV tower adds to Russians' feeling of doom] by Helen Womackin, The Independent, August 29, 2000.</ref> The parallels between the towers led to some concern that the CN Tower could be at risk of a similar tragedy. However, Canadian officials subsequently stated that it is "highly unlikely" that a similar disaster could occur at the CN Tower, as it has important safeguards that were not present in the Ostankino Tower. Specifically, officials cited:

* the fireproof building materials used in the tower's construction,
* frequent and stringent safety inspections,
* an extensive sprinkler system,
* a 24-hour emergency monitoring operation,
* two 68,160-litre (15,000-imperial gallon; 18,006-US gallon) water reservoirs at the top, which are automatically replenished,
* a fire hose at the base of the structure capable of sending 2725 litres (600 imperial gallons; 720 US Gallon) a minute to any location in the tower,
* a ban on natural gas appliances anywhere in the tower (including the restaurant in the main pod),
* an elevator that can be used during a fire as it runs up the outside of the building and can be powered by three emergency generators at the base of the structure (unlike the elevator at the Ostankino tower, which malfunctioned).<ref name="safety">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/08/28/CN000828.html|date=November 10, 2000|title=What if the CN Tower Caught Fire?|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=June 26, 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjP5iwp |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Officials also noted that the CN Tower has an excellent safety record and that there has never been an accidental fire in the tower since it was opened in 1976.<ref name="safety"/> Moreover, other supertall structures built between 1967 and 1976 — such as the [[Willis Tower]] (formerly the Sears Tower), the [[World Trade Center]] (until its [[September 11 attacks|destruction on September 11, 2001]]), the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]], the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]], the [[John Hancock Center]], and [[First Canadian Place]] — also have excellent safety records, which suggests that the [[Ostankino Tower]] accident was a rare safety failure, and that the likelihood of similar events occurring at other supertall structures is extremely low.

== Lighting ==
[[File:Toronto - ON - CN Tower bei Nacht2.jpg|thumb|right|The CN Tower illuminated, as seen from [[Toronto Islands]]]]
The CN Tower was originally lit at night with [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] lights, but they were removed in 1997, because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright [[light-emitting diode|LED]] lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting up over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower's mast to light the tower from dusk until 2 a.m. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28 before the [[Canada Day]] holiday weekend.

The tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the [[95th Grey Cup]] in Toronto, the tower was lit up in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]].<ref name="LED">{{cite press release |title= Highlighting the CN Tower — Testing of Innovative Illumination Technology Begins Early June 2007|publisher=CN Tower|date= May 28, 2007|url= http://www.cntower.ca/portal/SmartDefault.aspx?at=1577|accessdate=April 9, 2008 }}</ref> From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower was lit in orange, the official colour of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], to commemorate the [[Death and state funeral of Jack Layton|death]] of federal NDP leader [[Jack Layton]].<ref name=layton>{{cite news|title=Jack Layton's 'passion, civility' honoured at funeral|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/08/27/jack-layton-state-funeral-toronto.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=August 28, 2011|date=August 27, 2011}}</ref>

Programmed from a [[desktop computer]] with a [[wireless network interface controller]], the LEDs use less energy to light than the previously used incandescent lights (10% less energy than the dimly lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/219214 |title=Come Canada Day, CN Tower will once again light up the night |author=Debra Black |date=May 30, 2007 |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.

During the spring and autumn [[bird migration]] seasons, the lights will be turned off to comply with the voluntary Fatal Light Awareness Program, which "encourages buildings to dim unnecessary exterior lighting to mitigate bird mortality during spring and summer migration."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/4/6/21 |title=CN Tower in Toronto receives LED lighting treatment |author=LEDs Magazine |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>

The CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere. As of 2013, there are only two other [[List of tallest freestanding structures in the world|freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere]] which exceed {{convert|500|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in height; the [[Willis Tower]] in Chicago, which stands at {{convert|527|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} when measured to its pinnacle; and the recently topped-out [[One World Trade Center]] in New York City, which has a pinnacle height of {{convert|541.33|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}, or approximately {{convert|12|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]), the height of One World Trade Center is unlikely to be increased. The proposed [[Chicago Spire]] was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its construction was halted early due to financial difficulties, and was eventually cancelled in 2010.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/next/archives/2010/02/calatrava_dances_onto_a_new_stage.html Calatrava dances onto a new stage|Business Week]</ref>

== Controversy ==
=== "World's Tallest Tower" title ===
[[Guinness World Records]] has called the CN Tower "the world's tallest self-supporting tower" and "the world's tallest free-standing tower".<ref name="Guinness 1982">
{{Cite book |last=McWhirter|first=Norris| authorlink= Norris McWhirter| title=Guinness Book of World Records 1982 | year= 1981| publisher=[[Sterling Publishing|Sterling Publishing Co., Inc.]]| location= New York| isbn=978-0-8069-0225-8|oclc=7902975| page=704}} Reference is on page 275.</ref><ref name="Guinness 2005">{{waybackdate |site= http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record_subcategory.asp?txtDirection=right&;txtButtonWasHit=true&txtPage=4&subcategoryid=37 |date= 20040925071143| title= Guinness Book of World Records 2005 – Science and Technology << Buildings }}</ref>  Although Guinness did list this description of the CN Tower under the heading "tallest building" at least once,<ref name="Guinness 2005"/> it has also listed it under "tallest tower", omitting it from its list of "tallest buildings."<ref name="Guinness 1982"/> In 1996, Guinness changed the tower's classification to "World's Tallest Building and Freestanding Structure". [[Emporis]] and the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] both listed the CN Tower as the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|world's tallest free-standing structure on land]], and specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building, thereby awarding the title of [[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]] to [[Taipei 101]], which is {{convert|44|m|ft|0}} shorter than the CN Tower.<ref name="info"/><ref name=CTBUH>{{cite web |url= http://www.ctbuh.org/Resources/TallestDatabase/tabid/123/Default.aspx|title= CTBUH Tall Building Database|accessdate=April 10, 2008 |publisher=[[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]]|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjQeDX6 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The issue of what was tallest became moot when Burj Khalifa, then under construction, exceeded the height of the CN Tower in 2007 (see below).

Although the CN Tower contains a restaurant, a gift shop and multiple observation levels, it does not have floors continuously from the ground, and therefore [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest buildings|it is not considered a building]] by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) or Emporis. CTBUH defines a building as "a structure that is designed for residential, business, or manufacturing purposes. An essential characteristic of a building is that it has floors."<ref name=CTBUH/> The CN Tower and other similar structures — such as the [[Ostankino Tower]] in [[Moscow]], Russia; the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]] in [[Shanghai]], China; the [[Stratosphere Las Vegas|Stratosphere Tower]] in [[Las Vegas]], USA; and the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]], France — are categorized as "towers", which are free-standing structures that may have observation decks and a few other habitable levels, but do not have floors from the ground up. The CN Tower was the tallest tower by this definition, until 2010 (see below).<ref name="info"/>

Taller than the CN Tower are numerous [[radio masts and towers]], which are held in place by [[guy-wire]]s, the tallest being the [[KVLY-TV mast]] in [[North Dakota]], USA at {{convert|628|m|ft|0}} tall, leading to [[List of tallest structures in the world|a distinction]] between these and "free-standing" structures. Additionally, the [[Petronius (oil platform)|Petronius Platform]] stands {{convert|610|m|ft|0}} above its base on the bottom of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but only the top {{convert|75|m|ft|0}} of this [[oil platform|oil and natural gas platform]] are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its [[buoyancy]]. Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings.

On September 12, 2007, [[Burj Khalifa]], which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates, and was formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening, passed the CN Tower's 553.33 metre<ref name="CNTower"/> height. The CN Tower held the record of tallest free-standing structure on land for over 30 years.<ref name="CBCSurpassed" />

After Burj Khalifa had been formally recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's tallest freestanding structure, Guinness re-certified CN Tower as the world's tallest freestanding tower.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/698891|title=CN tower now the 'world's tallest freestanding tower'|last=Daubs|first=Katie|date=September 22, 2009|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=September 22, 2009|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKjR2lUu |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The tower definition used by Guinness was defined by the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] as 'a building in which less than 50% of the construction is usable floor space'. Guinness World Records editor-in-chief Craig Glenday announced that Burj Khalifa was not classified as a tower because it has too much usable floor space to be considered to be a tower.<ref>[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2009/09/18/326566.aspx CN Tower remains world's tallest tower, Guinness says]</ref> CN Tower still held world records for highest above ground wine cellar (in 360 Restaurant) at 351 metres, highest above ground restaurant at 346 metres (Horizons Restaurant),<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/09/18/cn-tower-tallest-guiness523.html CN Tower still world's tallest: Guinness]</ref> and tallest free-standing concrete tower during Guinness's recertification. The CN Tower was surpassed by the [[Canton Tower]] in [[Guangzhou]], China, which stands at 600 m tall, as the world's tallest tower, in 2010. The tower, as of 2012, stands as the fifth-tallest free-standing structure on land in the world and the third-tallest free-standing tower.

In 1991, two years following the completion of the [[Rogers Centre]], which was known as SkyDome at the time, the open space between Rogers Centre and CN Tower was renamed '''Bobbie Rosenfeld Park''', in honour of the Canadian athlete [[Bobbie Rosenfeld]]. The city-owned park is mainly an open space covered by paving stone and planters. There are some trees and concession stands selling food and other items to tourists and visitors in the area. 

Located along the south end facing Bremner Avenue, there is a piece of artwork by artist Susan Schelle called ''Salmon Run''.
