'''Cleveland''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|v|l|ən|d}} is a [[city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]],{{GR|6}} the most populous county in the state. The city is located in northeastern Ohio on the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]], approximately {{convert|60|mi|km}} west of the [[Pennsylvania]] border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the [[Cuyahoga River]], and became a [[manufacturing]] center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous [[canal]]s and [[Rail transport in the United States|railroad]] lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, [[Health care in the United States|healthcare]], and biomedical.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cleveland}}
Cleveland obtained its name on July 22, 1796 when surveyors of the [[Connecticut Land Company]] laid out [[Connecticut]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] into townships and a capital city they named "Cleaveland" after their leader, General [[Moses Cleaveland]]. Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on [[Public Square]], before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleaveland was [[Lorenzo Carter]], who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814.<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/timeline.html | title=Cleveland: A Bicentennial Timeline | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007}}</ref>  In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, its waterfront location proved to be an advantage. The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]].  This key link between the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] connected the city to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the [[Erie Canal]] and later via the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]. Growth continued with added railroad links.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=OAEC | title=Ohio and Erie Canal | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007}}</ref> Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836.<ref name="Timeline" />

In 1836, the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring [[Ohio City (Cuyahoga County), Ohio|Ohio City]] over a bridge connecting the two.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CSB | title=Columbus Street Bridge | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007}}</ref> Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexation]] by Cleveland in 1854.<ref name="Timeline" />

[[File:Cleveland 1877.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bird's-eye view]] of Cleveland in 1877]]

The city's prime geographic location as transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland serves as a destination point for [[iron ore]] shipped from [[Minnesota]], as well as [[coal]] transported by rail. In 1870, [[John D. Rockefeller]] founded [[Standard Oil]] in Cleveland, and moved its headquarters to [[New York City]] in 1885.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html | title=Rockefellers Timeline | accessdate=July 7, 2010 | date=1999–2000 | publisher=PBS | quote=1870 Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1 million in capital, the largest corporation in the country. The new company controls 10% of U.S. petroleum refining. 1885 Standard Oil Standard Oil moves into new headquarters at 26 Broadway in New York.}}</ref> Cleveland emerged in the early 20th Century as an important American manufacturing center, which included automotive companies such as [[Peerless]], People's,<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

By 1920, due in large part to the city's economic prosperity, Cleveland became the nation's fifth [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|largest city]].<ref name="Timeline"/> The city counted [[Progressive Era]] politicians such as the [[Populism|populist]] Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson]] among its leaders. Many prominent Clevelanders from this era are buried in the historic [[Lake View Cemetery]], including [[President of the United States|President]] [[James A. Garfield]],<ref>[[Find A Grave]]: [http://www.findagrave.com/php/famous.php?page=cem&FScemeteryid=41762 Lake View Cemetery.] Findagrave.com. Retrieved on 2007-05-09.</ref> and John D. Rockefeller.

In commemoration of the [[centennial]] of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the [[Great Lakes Exposition]] debuted in June 1936 along the [[Lake Erie]] shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the [[Great Depression]], it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=GLE | title=Great Lakes Exposition | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University | accessdate=August 10, 2007}}</ref> The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Burke Lakefront Airport]], among others.<ref>{{cite book | author=Porter, Philip |url=http://www.clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/Chapt06.html |title=Cleveland: Confused City on a Seesaw | chapter=Chapter 6 | pages=106–107 | year=1976 | location=Columbus, Ohio | publisher=Ohio State University Press | isbn= 0-8142-0264-0 | accessdate= July 22, 2009 }}</ref>
Following [[World War II]], the city experienced a prosperous economy. In sports, the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] won the [[1948 World Series]] and the [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] dominated professional [[National Football League|football]] in the 1950s. Businesses proclaimed that Cleveland was the "best location in the nation".<ref>{{cite book |title=Cleveland: Confused City on a Seesaw |first=Philip W. |last=Porter |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1976 |chapter=Chapter Nine: Erieview, the Big Mistake: 1953–1962 |chapterurl=http://clevelandmemory.org/SpecColl/porter/Chapt09.html#p180 |isbn=0-8142-0264-0 |page=180 |publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]] |location=Columbus, Ohio |accessdate=July 22, 2009 }} Transcription at ''The Cleveland Memory Project'' website.</ref><ref>[http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CEIC Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.] Encyclopedia of Cleveland History. 1997-06-14.

During the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, social unrest occurred in Cleveland, resulting in the [[Hough Riots]] from July 18, 1966 – July 23, 1966 and the [[Glenville Shootout]] from July 23, 1968 – July 25, 1968. In December 1978, Cleveland became the first major American city to enter into a [[default (finance)|financial default]] on federal loans since the Great Depression.<ref name="Timeline"/> Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s, when financial difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the city. This, along with the city's struggling professional sports teams, drew negative national press. As a result, Cleveland was often derided as "The Mistake on the Lake".<ref>{{cite web |date=September 10, 2007 |title=Cleveland: A Midwestern Rustbelt City Struggles to Sur(Re)vive |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/cscr/seminars/Keating.doc |first=Dennis |last=Keating |location=Cleveland, Ohio }}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|82.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|77.70|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|4.77|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref>
The shore of [[Lake Erie]] is {{convert|569|ft|m}} above [[above mean sea level|sea level]]; however, the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly perpendicular to the lake. In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the [[Cuyahoga River]], Big Creek, and Euclid Creek. The land rises quickly from the lakeshore. [[Public Square]], less than a mile (2&nbsp;km) inland, sits at an elevation of {{convert|650|ft|m|0}}, and Hopkins Airport, only {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} inland from the lake, is at an elevation of {{convert|791|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web

===Climate===
Typical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a [[continental climate]] with four distinct seasons, which lies in the [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'')<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kottek |first=Marcus |last2=Greiser |first2=Jürgen |last3=Beck |first3=Christoph |last4=Rudolf |first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel |first5=Franz |display-authors=2 |title=World Map of Köppen&nbsp;– Geiger Climate Classification |date=June 2006 |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=15 |issue=3 |page=261 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130}}</ref> zone. Summers are hot and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the [[lake effect snow]] that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} of snowfall in a season three times since 1968,<ref>[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/climate/cle/records/cletop10snow.html Cleveland Snowfalle (sic) Statistics.] [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on 2005-10-13.</ref> seasonal totals approaching or exceeding {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the '[[Snowbelt|Snow Belt]]' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].<ref>Johnson, Mark.

The all-time record high in Cleveland of {{convert|104|°F|0}} was established on June 25, 1988, and the all-time record low of {{convert|-20|°F|0}} was set on January 19, 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of {{convert|73.5|°F|1}}, and January, with a mean temperature of {{convert|28.1|°F|1}}, is the coldest. Normal yearly [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] based on the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010 is {{convert|39.1|in}}.<ref>[http://www.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=cle NOWData – NOAA Online Weather Data.] National Weather Service.

Cleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the [[Cuyahoga County Courthouse]], the [[Cleveland Public Library]], and [[Public Auditorium]], are clustered around an open [[The Mall (Cleveland)|mall]] and share a common [[neoclassical architecture]]. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 [[Group Plan]], and constitute one of the most complete examples of [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] design in the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Michael |title=Make No Little Plans |year=1980 |pages=20–25 |publisher=[[Western Reserve Historical Society]] |location=Cleveland, Ohio |isbn=0-911704-24-8}}</ref> The [[Terminal Tower]], dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside [[New York City]] until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991.<ref>{{cite book |author=Toman, James and Cook, Daniel |title=Cleveland's Towering Treasure |year=2005 |chapter=The Tower |page=76 |publisher=Cleveland Landmarks Press |location=Cleveleand, Ohio |isbn=0-936760-20-6}}</ref> It is a prototypical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[skyscraper]].

[[Downtown Cleveland]] is centered around [[Public Square]] and includes a wide range of diversified districts. Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct [[Cleveland Theater District]], which is home to [[Playhouse Square Center]]. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the [[The Flats|Flats]] and the [[Warehouse District, Cleveland|Warehouse District]] are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of [[condominium]]s, [[loft apartment|lofts]], and [[apartment]]s has been on the increase since 2000.

From 1978 to 1988, Cleveland was home to the [[Cleveland Force (1978–1988)|Cleveland Force]] of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992)|MISL]]. After the Force folded in 1988 they were replaced by the [[Cleveland Crunch]] of the [[National Professional Soccer League II|NPSL]] and [[Major Indoor Soccer League (2001–2008)|MISL]], who played from 1989 to 2005. The Crunch won three league championships in the 1990s, being the first Cleveland sports team to win a championship since the 1964 Cleveland Browns. They re-adopted the Force name in 2002 before ceasing operations in 2005.

Outdoor soccer has also been represented in Cleveland via the [[Cleveland Cobras]] (1972-Cleveland Stars, 1973–1981 Cobras) of the [[American Soccer League|ASL]] and the [[Cleveland Stokers]] (1967–1968) of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]].

City leaders promoted growth of the technology sector in the first decade of the 21st century. Mayor [[Jane L.

===Roads===
Cleveland's [[road]] system consists of numbered streets running roughly north-south, and named avenues, which run roughly east-west. The numbered streets are designated "east" or "west", depending where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects [[Public Square]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=SN1 |title=Street Names |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |date=March 4, 1998 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}</ref> The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the west and east sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a "west" designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the west side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the [[Detroit–Superior Bridge]] and the [[Lorain–Carnegie Bridge]].

===Freeways===
Three two-digit [[Interstate highway]]s serve Cleveland directly. [[Interstate 71]] begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Cincinnati]]. [[Interstate 77]] begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. [[Interstate 90]] connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east–west through the west side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as [[Dead Man's Curve]], then continues northeast, entering [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]] near the eastern split with [[Ohio State Route 2]]. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|Interstate 480]], which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and [[Interstate 490 (Ohio)|Interstate 490]], which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.<ref>[http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-490_oh.html Interstate 490 Cleveland.] Interstate-Guide.com. Retrieved on 2007-07-22.</ref> <!-- Please do not add I-271 here, since it does not run through the City of Cleveland. Instead, please include any relevant information in the Greater Cleveland article. -->

Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] carries [[Ohio State Route 2|State Route 2]] along its length, and at varying points also carries [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]], [[U.S. Route 20|US 20]] and I-90. The Jennings Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 176|State Route 176]]) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]] and [[Brooklyn Heights, Ohio|Brooklyn Heights]]. A third highway, the Berea Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 237|State Route 237]] in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]].<ref>[http://www.nhlink.net/neighborhoodtour/riverside/ntour.htm Riverside Neighborhood Tour.] Neighborhood Link, [[Cleveland State University]].
