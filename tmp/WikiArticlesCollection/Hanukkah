'''Hanukkah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑː|n|ə|k|ə}} {{respell|HAH|nə-kə}}; {{lang-he-n|חֲנֻכָּה}}, Tiberian: {{transl|he|Ḥănukkāh}}, usually spelled {{lang|he|חנוכה}}, pronounced {{IPA-he|χanuˈka|}} in [[Modern Hebrew]]; a transliteration also romanized as '''Chanukah''' or '''Chanukkah'''), also known as the '''Festival of Lights''' and '''Feast of Dedication''', is an eight-day [[Jewish holiday]] commemorating the rededication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]] (the [[Second Temple]]) in [[Jerusalem]] at the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the [[Seleucid Empire]] of the 2nd century BCE. Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] according to the [[Hebrew calendar]], which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the [[Gregorian calendar]].

The festival is observed by the kindling of the lights of a unique [[candelabrum]], the nine-branched ''[[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]]'' or ''Hanukiah'', one additional light on each night of the holiday, progressing to eight on the final night. The typical Menorah consists of eight branches with an additional raised branch. The extra light is called a ''[[gabbai|shamash]]'' ({{lang-he|שמש}}, "attendant")<ref name=Kotel-Notes>Gateway To The Holy Land: "[http://www.kotel-notes.com/holidays/hanukkah/ Hanukkah]." Retrieved on September 03, 2010</ref> and is given a distinct location, usually above or below the rest. The purpose of the ''shamash'' is to have a light available for practical use, as using the Hanukkah lights themselves for purposes other than publicizing and meditating upon Hanukkah is forbidden.<ref>Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21b</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:CHILD LIGHTING HANUKA CANDLES.jpg|thumb|150px|Boy lighting Hanukkah candles]]
The name "Hanukkah" derives from the Hebrew verb "{{lang|he|חנך}}", meaning "to dedicate". On Hanukkah, the Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.<ref>[[Maharsha]] Shabbat 21b; see there for a detailed discussion. ({{PDFLink|1=[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14314&pgnum=390 Hebrew text]}})</ref>

Many [[Homiletics|homiletical]] explanations have been given for the name:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/originchanukah.html|title=Origin of the Name Chanukah|first=Nosson|last=Scherman|publisher=Torah.org}}</ref>
*The name can be broken down into {{lang|he|חנו כ"ה}}, "[they] rested [on the] twenty-fifth", referring to the fact that the Jews ceased fighting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]], the day on which the holiday begins.<ref>[[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]] Shabbat 9b ({{PDFLink|1=[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14314&pgnum=542 Hebrew text]}})</ref>
* {{lang|he|חנוכה}} (Hanukkah) is also the Hebrew [[acronym]] for {{lang|he|'''ח''' '''נ'''רות '''ו'''הלכה '''כ'''בית '''ה'''לל}} — "Eight candles, and the [[halakha]] is like the House of Hillel". This is a reference to the disagreement between two rabbinical schools of thought — the [[Hillel the Elder|House of Hillel]] and the [[Shammai|House of Shammai]] — on the proper order in which to light the Hanukkah flames. Shammai opined that eight candles should be lit on the first night, seven on the second night, and so on down to one on the last night (because the miracle was greatest on the first day). Hillel argued in favor of starting with one candle and lighting an additional one every night, up to eight on the eighth night (because the miracle grew in greatness each day). [[Jewish law]] adopted the position of Hillel.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Historical sources==

===Maccabees, Mishna and Talmud===
{{See also2|[[Mishna#Omissions|Mishna Omissions]]}}
The story of Hanukkah, along with its laws and customs, is entirely missing in the [[Mishna]] apart from several passing references (Bikkurim 1:6, Rosh HaShanah 1:3, Taanit 2:10, Megillah 3:4 and 3:6, Moed Katan 3:9, and Bava Kama 6:6).

[[Nissim Ben Jacob|Rav Nissim Gaon]] postulates in his ''Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud'' that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it. A modern-day scholar [[Reuvein Margolies]]<ref>''Yesod Hamishna Va'arichatah'' pp. 25–28 ({{PDFLink|1=[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20976&pgnum=24 Hebrew text]}})</ref> suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the [[Bar Kochba revolt]], its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.

[[Image:Hanukkah2.jpg|thumb|120px|Hanukkah lamp unearthed near Jerusalem about 1900]]

The story of Hanukkah is preserved in the books of the [[First Maccabees|First]] and [[Second Maccabees]]. These books are not part of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible); they are Jewish apocryphal books instead. The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the [[Talmud]], committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.
<ref>{{cite news|last=Dolanksy|first=Shawna|title=The Truth(s) About Hanukkah|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shawna-dolansky/the-truth-about-hanukah_b_1165708.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2011-12-23}}</ref>

The [[Gemara]] ([[Talmud]]), in tractate ''Shabbat,'' page 21b, focuses on [[Shabbat candles]] and moves to Hanukkah candles and says that after the forces of [[Antiochus IV]] had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still [[seal (device)|seal]]ed by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Talmud/shabbat2.html |title=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>

The Talmud presents three options:
#The law requires only one light each night per household,
#A better practice is to light one light each night for each member of the household
#The most preferred practice is to vary the number of lights each night.

In [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] families, the head of the household lights the candles, while in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] families, all family members light.

Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the [[Mezuza]], or in the window closest to the street. [[Rashi]], in a note to ''Shabbat 21b,'' says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate ''Succah,'' p.&nbsp;46a.

===Narrative of Josephus===
[[Image:Hanukkah1.jpg|thumb|left|Various menorot used for Hanukkah. 12th through 19th century, CE]]
The Jewish historian [[Josephus| Titus Flavius Josephus]] narrates in his book, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Jewish Antiquities]] XII, how the victorious [[Judas Maccabeus]] ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Josephus does not say the festival was called Hannukkah but rather the "Festival of Lights":

:"Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city [[Beth-zur|Bethsura]], that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies."<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+12.287 Perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish Antiquities'' xii. 7, § 7, #323</ref>

===Other ancient sources===
The story of Hanukkah is alluded to in the book of [[1 Maccabees]] and [[2 Maccabees]]. The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees 4:36 ''et seq'', though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, and obviously older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees 1:18 ''et seq'' according to which the relighting of the altar fire by [[Nehemiah]] was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.

Another source is the [[Megillat Antiochus]]. This work (also known as "Megillat HaHasmonaim", "Megillat Hanukkah" or "Megillat Yevanit") is in both [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the Hebrew version is a literal translation from the Aramaic original. Recent scholarship dates it to somewhere between the 2nd and 5th Centuries, probably in the 2nd century,<ref>{{cite web|first=Benjamin|last=Zvieli|title=The Scroll of Antiochus|url= http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html| accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref> with the Hebrew dating to the 7th century.<ref name = "pvgsyw">[http://customerservant.com/2006/12/16/the-scroll-of-the-hasmoneans/ The Scroll Of The Hasmoneans]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> It was published for the first time in [[Mantua]] in 1557. [[Saadia Gaon]], who translated it into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th century, ascribed it to the Maccabees themselves, disputed by some, since it gives dates as so many years before the destruction of the second temple in 70 CE.<ref>[http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html The Scroll of Antiochus] and [http://www.oztorah.com/2007/11/the-unknown-chanukah-mgillah/ The Unknown Chanukah Megillah]</ref> The Hebrew text with an English translation can be found in the [[Siddur]] of [[Philip Birnbaum]].

In the [[Christian Greek Scriptures]], it is stated that Jesus was at the [[Jerusalem Temple]] during "the Feast of Dedication and it was winter", in John 10:22–23.  The Greek term that is used is "the renewals" (Greek ''ta engkainia'' τὰ ἐγκαίνια).<ref> This is the first reference to the Feast of Dedication by this name (ta egkainia, ta enkainia [a typical “festive plural”]) in Jewish literature (Hengel 1999: 317). "</ref> [[Josephus]] refers to the festival as "lights."<ref>''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible'' ed. Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard – 1990 -"Hence Hanukkah also is called the Feast of Lights, an alternate title Josephus confirms with this rationale: "And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it 'Lights.' I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival." (per ''The works of Flavius Josephus'' translated by William Whiston)</ref>

==Story of Hanukkah==

===Background===
[[Judea]] was part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of Egypt until 200 [[BCE]] when King [[Antiochus III the Great]] of [[Syria]] defeated King [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes]] of Egypt at the [[Battle of Panium]]. Judea became at that moment part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] of Syria. King [[Antiochus III the Great]] wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects guaranteed their right to "live according to their ancestral customs" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem. However in 175 BCE, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]], the son of Antiochus III invaded Judea, ostensibly at the request of the sons of Tobias.<ref>[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Old.perseus.tufts.edu]
''Jewish War'' i. 31</ref>  The [[Tobiads]], who led the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizing Jewish faction]] in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest [[Onias]] and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As the ancient Jewish historian Flavius Josephus tells us:
:"The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months."<ref>[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Old.perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish War'' i. 32</ref>

===Traditional view===
[[File:Македонска ханукија - מקדוני חנוכייה - Macedonian Hanukkah menorah.jpg|thumb|A [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] silver [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Hanukkah Menorah]]]]
When the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, [[Judaism]] was outlawed. In 167 BCE [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]] ordered an altar to [[Zeus]] erected in the Temple. He banned [[brit milah]] (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple (the [[Ancient Greek religion#Sacrifice|sacrifice of pigs]] to the [[Greek gods]] was standard ritual practice in the [[Ancient Greek religion]]).<ref>[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=31 Old.perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish War'' i. 34</ref>

Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. [[Mattathias|Mattityahu]], a [[Kohen|Jewish priest]], and his five sons [[Johanan Maccabeus|Jochanan]], [[Simon Maccabaeus|Simeon]], [[Eleazar Maccabeus|Eleazar]], [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]], and [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] led a rebellion against Antiochus. Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi ("Judah the Hammer"). By 166 BCE Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#59 1 Macc. iv. 59]{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, unadulterated and undefiled pure olive oil with the seal of the [[High Priest (Judaism)|kohen gadol]] (high priest) was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that one flask was found with only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of [[Kashrut|kosher]] oil for the menorah. An eight-day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.

The version of the story in 1 Maccabees states that an eight-day celebration of songs and sacrifices was proclaimed upon re-dedication of the altar, and makes no mention of the miracle of the oil.<ref>[http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#36 1 Macc. iv. 36]{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref>

===Modern scholarship===
[[File:Hanukkah-US-Military-GITMO-Dec-28-08.jpg|thumb|[[US Navy]] personnel light candles on Hanukkah]]
Some modern scholars argue that the king was intervening in an internal [[civil war]] between the [[Rabbinic Judaism|traditionalist]] [[Jews]] ([[Pharisees]]) and the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Jews ([[Sadducees]]) in Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite book |title= Jewish Literacy: The Most Important Things to Know about the Jewish Religion, Its People, and Its History|last=Telushkin |first=Joseph |year= 1991|publisher= W.

These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like [[Onias III|Onias]] contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like [[Jason (high priest)|Jason]] and [[Menelaus (High Priest)|Menelaus]].<ref>{{cite book |title= A Survey of the New Testament|last=Gundry |first=Robert H. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Zondervan]] |isbn= 0-310-23825-0|page= 9}}</ref> In particular Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.<ref>{{cite book |title= Judaic Religion in the Second Temple Period: Belief and Practice from the Exile to Yavneh|last= Grabbe|first=Lester L. |year= 2000|publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-21250-2 |page= 59}}</ref> Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible |last=Freedman |first= David Noel|coauthors=Allen C.

==Hanukkah rituals==
[[File:Donetsk hanuka.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[public menorah|Public Hanukkah menorah]] in [[Donetsk, Ukraine]]]]
[[File:Hanukkah sign Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.JPG|thumb|[[public menorah|Public Hanukkah menorah]] in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]]]
Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Hanukkah|daily prayer service]], and a section is added to the [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after meals]].

Hanukkah is not a "Sabbath-like" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath]], as specified in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]''.<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 670:1</ref> Adherents go to work as usual, but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although, in Israel, schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah. Many families exchange small gifts each night, such as books or games. Fried foods (such as latke [[potato pancake]]s, jelly doughnut [[Sufganiyah|sufganiyot]]) are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah.

===Kindling the Hanukkah lights===
Each night, throughout the 8 day holiday, a candle or oil-based light, is lit. As a universally practiced "beautification" ([[hiddur mitzvah]]) of the [[mitzvah]], the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 671:2</ref> An extra light called a ''shamash'', meaning "attendant" or "sexton,"<ref name=Kotel-Notes /> is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others. The purpose of the extra light is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud (Tracate Shabbat 21b–23a), against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the ''shamash'' candle would be available and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some light the ''shamash'' candle first and then use it to light the others.<ref name = "lonorw">''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 673:1</ref> So all together, including the ''shamash'', two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the ''shamash'').

The lights can be candles or oil lamps.<ref name = "lonorw"/> Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm. Most Jewish homes have a special [[candelabrum]] referred to as either a ''chanukkiah'' (the modern Israeli term), or a ''menorah'' (the traditional classical name), or oil lamp holder for Hanukkah, which holds eight lights plus the additional ''shamash'' light. Since the 1970s the worldwide [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement has initiated public menorah lightnings in open public places in many countries.<ref>http://joi.org/bloglinks/JTA%20NEWS%20Chanuka%20Chabad.htm</ref>

The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the "lighting of the house within", but rather for the "illumination of the house without," so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. the triumph of the few over the many and of the pure over the impure). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some [[Ashkenazi Jews]] to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most [[Sephardi Jews]] light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic persecution]] were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in [[Iran|Persia]] under the rule of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the ''[[mezuzah]]'', so that when one passes through the door he is surrounded by the holiness of ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' (the [[613 commandments|commandments]]).

Generally women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles “for they too were involved in the miracle.”<ref>Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 23a</ref> In practice, only the male members of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] households are obliged to light the menorah.

===Candle-lighting time===
Hanukkah lights should burn for at least one half hour after it gets dark. The custom of the [[Vilna Gaon]] observed by many residents of Jerusalem as the custom of the city, is to light at sundown, although most Hasidim light later, even in Jerusalem. Many Hasidic [[Rebbes]] light much later, because they fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.

Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour, so on most days this requirement can be safely ignored.

Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on the [[Shabbat]] itself, the candles must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit until the regular it is time for you to use longer candles, or the traditional oil lamps. In keeping with the above-stated prohibition, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first, followed by the Shabbat candles which signify its onset.

===Blessings over the candles===
Typically three blessings (''brachot''; singular: ''brachah'') are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles:

On the first night of Hanukkah, Jews recite all three blessings; on all subsequent nights, they recite only the first two.<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:1–2</ref>

The blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the Menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first, and so on, proceeding from right to left over the eight nights. On each night, the leftmost candle is lit first, and lighting proceeds from left to right.

For the full text of the blessings, see [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Hanukkah|List of Jewish prayers and blessings: Hanukkah]].

====''Hanerot Halalu''====
During or after the lights are kindled the hymn ''Hanerot Halalu'' is recited. There are several differing versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:4</ref>

During all eight days of Hanukkah these lights are sacred, and we are not permitted to make ordinary use of them except for to look at them in order to express thanks and praise to Your great Name for Your miracles, Your wonders and Your salvations.
|}

===''Maoz Tzur''===
Each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn [[Ma'oz Tzur]] is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in [[Jewish history]], and praises God for survival despite these tragedies ([[the exodus]] from Egypt, the [[Babylonian captivity]], the miracle of the holiday of [[Purim]], the [[Hasmonean]] victory), and a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

===Other customs===
[[File:Colorful dreidels2.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Dreidel]]s / [[Top|Spinning tops]] in a Jerusalem market]]
After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardi]] Jews recite [[Psalms]], such as {{bibleverse||Psalms|30|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Psalms|67|HE}}, and {{bibleverse||Psalms|91|HE}}. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give [[tzedakah]] (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.

===Special additions to daily prayers===
An addition is made to the "''hoda'ah''" (thanksgiving) benediction in the [[Amidah]] (thrice-daily prayers), called ''Al ha-Nissim'' ("On/about the Miracles").<ref>''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 682:1</ref> This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote="We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name."|source=Translation of ''Al ha-Nissim''}}

The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the ''[[Hallel]]'' (praise) {{bibleverse||Psalms|113|HE}} - {{bibleverse||Psalms|118|HE}}) are sung during each morning service and the ''[[Tachanun]]'' penitential prayers are omitted.

The Torah is read every day in the [[shacharit]] morning services in [[synagogue]], on the first day beginning from {{bibleverse||Numbers|6:22|HE}} (according to some customs, {{bibleverse||Numbers|7:1|HE}}), and the last day ending with {{bibleverse||Numbers|8:4|HE}}. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbaths]] (Saturdays). The weekly [[Parsha|Torah portion]] for the first Sabbath is almost always ''[[Miketz]]'', telling of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s dream and his enslavement in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The ''[[Haftarah]]'' reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is {{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:14|HE}} – {{bibleverse||Zechariah|4:7|HE}}. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the ''Haftarah'' reading is from {{bibleverse||1Kings|7:40|HE}} - {{bibleverse||1Kings|7:50|HE}}.

The Hanukkah ''menorah'' is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.

The menorah is not lit on the Sabbath, but rather prior to the beginning of the Sabbath at night and not at all during the day.
During the [[Middle Ages]] "[[Megillat Antiochus]]" was read in the [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] synagogues on Hanukkah just as the [[Book of Esther]] is read on [[Purim]]. It still forms part of the liturgy of the [[Yemenite Jews]].<ref name = "pvgsyw"/>

===''Zot Hanukkah''===
The last day of Hanukkah is known as ''Zot Hanukkah'', from the verse read on this day in the synagogue {{bibleverse||Numbers|7:84|HE}}, ''Zot Chanukat Hamizbe'ach'': "This was the dedication of the altar"). According to the teachings of [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], this day is the final "seal" of the High Holiday season of [[Yom Kippur]], and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other ''Gmar chatimah tovah'' ("may you be sealed totally for good"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.

==Symbolic importance==

Many people define major Jewish holidays as those that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc., and when all forms of work are forbidden. Only biblical holidays fit this criteria, and Hanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Bible was completed and canonized. Nevertheless, though Hanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Hanukiah, at the door or window symbolizes the desire to give the Hanukah miracle a high profile.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/789857/jewish/Chanukah-FAQs.htm#q6 Is Hanukkah a major Jewish Holiday?]</ref>

The classical rabbis downplayed the military and nationalistic dimensions of Hanukkah, and some even interpreted the emphasis upon the story of the miracle oil as a diversion away from the struggle with empires that had led to the disastrous downfall of Jerusalem to the Romans.

Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome’s grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, like the 135 C.E. experience.<ref>Hanukkah in America, Dianne Ashton, New York University Press, page 29</ref>

With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, however, these themes were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.

In North America especially, Hanukkah gained increased importance with many Jewish families in the final decades of the 20th century, including large numbers of [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]], who wanted a Jewish alternative to the [[Christmas]] celebrations that often overlap with Hanukkah. Though it was traditional among Ashkenazi Jews to give "gelt" or money coins to children during Hanukkah, in many families this has changed into gifts in order to prevent Jewish children from feeling left out of the Christmas gift giving.

While Hanukkah is a relatively minor Jewish holiday, as indicated by the lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles, in North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to [[Passover]] as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.

==Hanukkah music==
{{Main|Hanukkah music}}
A large number of songs have been written on Hanukkah themes, perhaps more so than for any other Jewish holiday. Some of the best known are "''Hanukkiah Li Yesh''" ("I Have a Hanukkah Menorah"), "''[[Ocho Kandelikas]]''" ("Eight Little Candles"), "''Kad Katan''" ("A Small Jug"), "''S'vivon Sov Sov Sov''" ("Dreidel, Spin and Spin"), ''Haneirot Halolu''" ("These Candles which we light"), "''Mi Yimalel''" ("Who can Retell") and "''Ner Li, Ner Li''" ("I have a Candle"). The most well known in English-speaking countries include "[[Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel]]" and "Chanukah, Oh Chanukah".

==Hanukkah foods==
[[File:LatkeFry.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Potato [[latke]] frying in hot [[olive oil]].]]
[[File:Chocolate-vanilla cream sufganiyot.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Sufganiyot]] / [[doughnut]]s at a Jerusalem bakery]]
There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably [[olive oil]]) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the flame in the Temple alight for eight days. Traditional foods include  [[potato pancake]]s, known as ''latkes'' in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], especially among [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] families. Sephardi, [[History of Jews in Poland|Polish]] and [[Israeli Jews|Israeli]] families eat jam-filled [[doughnut]]s ({{lang-yi|פאנטשקעס}} ''[[Pączki|pontshkes]]''), [[Buñuelos|bimuelos]] (fritters) and [[Sufganiyah|sufganiyot]] which are [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] in oil.

Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for ''sufganiyot'' besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.<ref>Gur, Jana, ''The Book of New Israeli Food: A Culinary Journey'', pp. 238–243, Schocken (2008) ISBN 0-8052-1224-8</ref> In recent years, downsized, "mini" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version have become popular.<ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1260447411124 Minsberg, Tali and Lidman, Melanie. ''Love Me Dough'']. [[Jerusalem Post]], 10 December 2009. Retrieved 17 December 2009.</ref>

There is also a tradition of eating cheese products on Hanukkah recorded in rabbinic literature. This custom is seen as a commemoration of the involvement of [[Book of Judith|Judith]] and women in the events of Hanukkah.

==Dreidel==
[[File:Dreidel 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dreidel with the [[Gimel (letter)|gimel]] side up]]
The [[dreidel]], or ''sevivon'' in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with on Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter. These letters are an acronym for the Hebrew words {{lang|he|נס גדול היה שם}} ('''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''S'''ham'', "A great miracle happened there"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]].
*{{lang|he|נ}} ''([[Nun (letter)|Nun]])''
*{{lang|he|ג}} ''([[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]])''
*{{lang|he|ה}} ''([[He (letter)|Hey]])''
*{{lang|he|ש}} ''([[Shin (letter)|Shin]])''

On dreidels sold in Israel, the fourth side is inscribed with the letter {{lang|he|פ}} ''([[Pe (letter)|Pe]])'', rendering the acronym {{lang|he|נס גדול היה פה}} ('''''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''P'''o'', "A great miracle happened here"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel. Stores in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] neighborhoods sell the traditional ''Shin'' dreidels as well.

Some Jewish commentators ascribe symbolic significance to the markings on the dreidel. One commentary, for example, connects the four letters with the four exiles to which the nation of Israel was historically subject: Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yaakov |first=Rabbi |url=http://www.ohr.org.il/yhiy/article.php/1309 |title=Ohr Somayach :: Chanukah :: The Secret of the Dreidel |publisher=Ohr.org.il |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref>

After lighting the Hanukkah menorah, it is customary in many homes to play the dreidel game: Each player starts out with 10 or 15 coins (real or of chocolate), nuts, raisins, candies or other markers, and places one marker in the "pot." The first player spins the dreidel, and depending on which side the dreidel falls on, either wins a marker from the pot or gives up part of his stash. The code (based on a [[Yiddish Language|Yiddish]] version of the game) is as follows:

*Nun–''nisht'', "nothing"–nothing happens and the next player spins
*Gimel–''gants'', "all"–the player takes the entire pot
*Hey–''halb'', "half"–the player takes half of the pot
*Shin–''shtel ayn'', "put in"–the player puts one marker in the pot

Another version differs:
*Nun–''nem'', "take"–the player takes one from the pot
*Gimel–''gib'', "give"–the player puts one in the pot
*Hey–''halb'', "half"–the player takes half of the pot
*Shin–''shtil'', "still" (as in "stillness")–nothing happens and the next player spins

The game may last until one person has won everything.

The dreidel is believed to commemorate a game devised by the Jews to camouflage the fact that they were [[Torah study|studying Torah]], which was outlawed by Greeks. The Jews would gather in caves to study, posting a lookout to alert the group to the presence of Greek soldiers. If soldiers were spotted, the Jews would hide their scrolls and spin tops, so the Greeks thought they were gambling, not learning.<ref>[http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2604&pgnum=95&hilite= Otzar Kol Minhagei Yeshurun 19:4]</ref>

The historical context may be from the time of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar-Kohba war]], 132-135 C.E. when the penalty for teaching Torah was death, so decreed by Rome. Others trace the ''dreidel'' itself to the children's top game [[Teetotum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parsha.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-we-should-ban-playing-dreidel-pt-ii.html |title=parshablog: Why we should ban playing dreidel, pt ii |publisher=Parsha.blogspot.com |date=2008-12-28 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}</ref>

*Dreidel gelt (dreidel money): The Eastern European game of dreidel (including the letters nun, gimmel, hey, shin) is like the German equivalent of the totum game: N = Nichts = nothing; G = Ganz = all; H = Halb = half; and S = Stell ein = put in. In German, the spinning top was called a "torrel" or "trundl," and in Yiddish it was called a "dreidel," a "fargl," a "varfl" [= something thrown], "shtel ein" [= put in], and "gor, gorin" [= all]. When Hebrew was revived as a spoken language, the dreidel was called, among other names, a ''sevivon'', which is the one that caught on.

==Hanukkah gelt==
[[File:Chocolate-Gold-Coins.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hanukkah gelt|Chocolate gelt]]]]
[[Hanukkah gelt]] ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for "money") is often distributed to children to add to the holiday ''excitement''. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. In Israel, Hanukkah ''gelt'' is known as ''dmei Hanukkah''. The tradition of giving Chanukah ''gelt'' dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. The connection may be etymological: In Hebrew, the words "Hanukkah" (dedication) and "hinnukh" (education) come from the same root.<ref name="forward1">{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/120106/ |title=Deconstructing Chocolate Gelt |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> In time, money was also given to children to keep for themselves. According to [[Magen Avraham]] (Abraham Abele Gombiner 1635 - 1682), poor [[yeshiva]] students would receive a gift of money from their Jewish benefactors on Hanukkah.<ref>The Biblical and Historical Background of Jewish Customs and Ceremonies by Abraham P. Bloch. Published by KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 1980. Pp. 277.</ref> In the 1920s, American [[chocolatier]]s picked up on the gift/coin concept by creating [[chocolate money|chocolate ''gelt'']].<ref name="forward1"/>

Many [[Rebbe#The Ḥasidic Rebbe|Hasidic Rebbes]] distribute coins to those who visit them during Hanukkah. Hasidic Jews consider this to be a ''[[segula (Kabbalah)|segulah]]'' (merit / good luck) for success.

==Judith and Holofernes==
The eating of dairy foods, especially cheese, on Hanukkah is a minor custom that has its roots in the story of Judith. The [[deuterocanonical]] book of [[Book of Judith|Judith]] (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the [[Tanakh]], records that [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea.

After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews is cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the [[Judith Beheading Holofernes|beheading of Holofernes by Judith]] has historically been a popular theme in art).

When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened, and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.<ref>[[Mishna Berurah]]'' 670:2:10</ref>

==Alternative spellings==
[[Image:Hanukkah.png|thumb|150px|Spelling variations due to transliteration of Hebrew ''Chet Nun Vav Kaf Hey'']]
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word Hanukkah is written {{Hebrew|חֲנֻכָּה}} or {{lang|he|חנוכה}} ({{transl|he|Ḥănukkāh}}). It is most commonly transliterated to English as ''{{transl|he|Chanukah}}'' or ''Hanukkah'', the former because the sound represented by "CH" ({{IPAblink|χ}}, similar to the [[Scots language|Scottish]] pronunciation of "[[loch]]") does not exist in the English language. Furthermore, the letter "[[heth|chet]]" ({{lang|he|ח}}), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew ([[voiceless uvular fricative]]) than in classical Hebrew ([[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] {{IPAblink|ħ}}), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is [[geminate]] in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal {{transl|he|Ḥeth}} can lead to the spelling "Hanukkah"; while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular {{transl|he|Ḥeth}} leads to the spelling "{{transl|he|Chanukah}}". It has also been spelled as "Hannukah".

==Hanukkah in the White House==

To the right is [[Abba Eban]], the Ambassador of Israel to the United States.]]

{{Main|White House Hanukkah Party}}

The United States has a history of recognizing and celebrating Hanukkah in a number of ways, from menorah lighting ceremonies to a 1996 postage stamp, jointly issued with Israel, to special receptions in the White House (although the United States has not had any Jewish presidents).

One of the earliest links with the White House occurred in 1951, when Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] presented United States President [[Harry Truman]] with a Hanukkah Menorah. But it was not until 1979 that a sitting president, [[Jimmy Carter]] took part in a public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony on the [[National Mall]], followed by the first Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony in the [[White House]] itself, led by President [[Bill Clinton]].

In 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House in conjunction with the candle-lighting ceremony, and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by Jewish leaders from around the country. In 2008, George Bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.

On Nov. 28th, 2013 President Obama marked the beginning of Hanukkah with a reception at the White House and noted the holidays convergence with Thanksgiving saying, “For the first time since the late 1800s – and for the last time until some 70,000 years from now – the first day of Hanukkah falls on Thanksgiving. It’s an event so rare some have even coined it 'Thanksgivukkah.' As we gather with loved ones around the turkey, the menorah, or both, we celebrate some fortunate timing and give thanks for miracles both great and small."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.560696}}</ref>

==Green Hanukkah==

Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's "miracle of the oil", emphasizing reflection on [[energy conservation]] and [[North American energy independence|energy independence]].
