The '''Liberal Party''' was a [[Liberalism|liberal]]<ref name="BanchoffSmith1999">{{cite book|author1=Thomas Banchoff|author2=Mitchell Smith|title=Legitimacy and the European Union: The Contested Polity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GgvLEFPY8l4C&pg=PA123|accessdate=16 July 2013|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-18188-4|pages=123–}}</ref> political movement that was one of the two [[Major party|major]] [[Political parties in the United Kingdom|political parties]] of Great Britain during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was the third largest political party throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The party moved towards [[social liberalism]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was responsible for important elements of the welfare state.  Its most important leaders were three prime ministers: [[William Ewart Gladstone]] in the late 19th century and [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] and [[David Lloyd George]] in the era of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Highly influential intellectuals included economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and social planner [[William Beveridge]]. It was generally out of power after 1922, except as a junior partner in coalition governments.  It merged with the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democrats]] in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats]]. Since 2010 the successor party has been in the governing coalition with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]; its leader [[Nick Clegg]] is Deputy Prime Minister.

The Liberal Party grew out of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]] in 1859, and [[William Gladstone]] carried the party through governments in the late 19th century. The party split over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], but returned to power in 1906 through a landslide victory. During this time in government, the Liberals are credited with the so-called [[Liberal welfare reforms|Liberal Reforms]], which saw the creation of a basic [[welfare state]]. During the First World War, the Liberals governed Britain through a coalition with the Conservatives, which ended in 1922. In the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] permanently replaced the Liberals as the largest opponent of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in British politics, and the Liberals went into decline, which culminated in their winning as few as 6 seats at general elections during the 1950s. A comeback of sorts was seen during the 1960s and 1970s, but it was not until 1981, when the Liberals allied with the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) to form the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]], that the party again enjoyed significant electoral success. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the alliance took 25% of the popular vote, but this only translated into 23 seats (out of a total of 650). During 1988, the Liberals formally merged with the SDP to form the Liberal Democrats, though a small splinter [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] was formed in 1989 by former members opposed to the merger.

==Ideology==
During the 19th century the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called [[classical liberalism]]: supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies such as [[free trade]] and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed '[[Gladstonian Liberalism]]' after the [[Victorian era]] Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of [[the Crown]] and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]]) and an extension of the electoral [[Suffrage|franchise]]. Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about [[liberalism]] in 1872:

[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|right|A crowd waits outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general elections]].]]
<blockquote>If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this—that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world...It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.<ref>''The Times'' (31 December 1872), p. 5.</ref></blockquote>

The political terms of "modern", "progressive" or "new" Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.<ref>W. H. Greenleaf, ''The British Political Tradition. Volume II: The Ideological Heritage'' (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 143.</ref>

By the early 20th century the Liberals stance began to shift towards "New Liberalism", what would today be called [[social liberalism]]: a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of [[welfare]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/higher/history/liberal/impact1_rev.shtml |title=Education Scotland – Higher Bitesize Revision – History – Liberal – Impact: Revision 1 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] and his Chancellor [[David Lloyd George]], whose [[Liberal reforms]] in the early 1900s created a basic [[welfare state]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev1.shtml |title=The Liberal reforms 1906–1914 |accessdate= 2009-02-28 |work= GCSE Bitesize |publisher= BBC |quote= One government that is often seen as an example of 'reforming' by introducing positive changes that really improve peoples' lives is the Liberal government in Britain of 1906–1914.

David Lloyd George adopted a programme at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] entitled ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', although by this stage the Liberals had declined to third-party status. The Liberals now (as expressed in the Liberal Yellow Book) regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] extremists.<ref>Liberal Industrial Inquiry, ''Britain's Industrial Future'' (London, 1928), p. 453.</ref>

After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and 50s, the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of [[Jo Grimond]] in the 1960s, by positioning itself as a [[radical center (politics)|radical centrist]] non-[[socialism|socialist]] alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdemmanifesto.com/1964/1964-liberal-manifesto.shtml |title=1964 Liberal Party Election Manifesto |publisher=Liberal / SDP / Libdem Manifestos |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref>

==Origins==
[[Image:palmerston.jpg|thumb|left|Viscount Palmerston]]

The Liberal Party grew out of the [[Whiggism|Whigs]], which had their origins in an [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] faction in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and the early 19th century [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]]. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of the Crown and increasing the power of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of [[democracy]] for its own sake. The great figures of reformist [[Whiggism|Whiggery]] were [[Charles James Fox]] (died 1806) and his disciple and successor [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]. After decades in opposition, the Whigs returned to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] in 1832.

The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggism, but it also brought about the Whigs' demise. The admission of the middle classes to the franchise and to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] led eventually to the development of a systematic [[middle class]] liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey's retirement, the party was led first by [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], a fairly traditional Whig, and then by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a renegade Irish [[Tory]] and essentially a [[conservatism|conservative]], although capable of radical gestures.

As early as 1839 Russell had adopted the name of "Liberals", but in reality his party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the [[House of Lords]] and [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] in the Commons. The leading Radicals were [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]], who represented the manufacturing towns which had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]]), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business), and above all [[free trade]]. For a century, free trade remained the one cause which could unite all Liberals.

In 1841 the Liberals lost office to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] under [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], but their period in [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] was short, because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a free trade issue, and a faction known as the [[Peelite]]s (but not Peel himself, who died soon after), defected to the Liberal side. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston, and the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. A leading Peelite was [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a reforming [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston's second government.

The Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party, however, while it was dominated by aristocrats, and it was not until the departure of the "Two Terrible Old Men", Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston's death in 1865 and Russell's retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative government (during which the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]] was passed by agreement between the parties), Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the [[National Liberal Federation]] in 1877.

==The Gladstonian era==
[[Image:Acgladstone2.jpg|thumb|right|William Gladstone]]

For the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. [[William Ewart Gladstone]] served as prime minister four times (1868–74, 1880–85, 1886, and 1892–94). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes, and laissez-faire, were suited to a developing capitalist society, but they could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the "Grand Old Man" later in life, Gladstone was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to the [[working class]] and to the lower middle class. Deeply religious, Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics, with his evangelical sensibility and his opposition to aristocracy.<ref>J. P. Parry, ''Democracy and Religion: Gladstone and the Liberal Party, 1867–1875'' (1989) p 174</ref> His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal Party.<ref>H. C. G. Matthew, "Gladstone, William Ewart (1809–1898)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004)</ref><ref>J. L. Hammond and M. R. D. Foot, ''Gladstone and Liberalism'' (1952)</ref>

In foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements, but he did not resist the realities of [[imperialism]]. For example, he approved of the occupation of [[History of Egypt under the British|Egypt]] by British forces in 1882.  His goal was to create a European order based on co-operation rather than conflict and on mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the [[rule of law]] was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious [[Concert of Europe]] was opposed to and ultimately defeated by a [[Bismarck]]ian system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, ''British foreign and imperial policy, 1865–1919'' (2000) p. 21</ref>

As prime minister 1868 to 1874, Gladstone headed a Liberal Party which was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs, and Radicals; he was now a spokesman for "peace, economy and reform."  One major achievement was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Elementary Education Act of 1870]], which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time and made attendance compulsory. He also secured the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the army and of religious tests for admission to Oxford and Cambridge; the introduction of the secret ballot in elections; the legalization of trade unions; and the reorganization of the judiciary in the Judicature Act.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title='''Access to History''', Government ''and'' Reform: Britain 1815–1918 (Second Edition), page 56–7|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2000}}</ref>

Regarding Ireland, the major Liberal achievements were land reform, where he [[Irish Land Acts|ended centuries of landlord oppression]], and the [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablishment]] of the (Anglican) [[Church of Ireland]] through the [[Irish Church Act 1869]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]] Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Disraeli during a sharp economic recession. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]], but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli's pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the [[Midlothian campaign]]. The Liberals won a large majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 election]]. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.

Among the consequences of the [[Third Reform Act]] (1884–85) was the giving of the vote to the Catholic peasants in Ireland, and the consequent creation of an [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] this party won the balance of power in the House of Commons, and demanded [[Irish Home Rule]] as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong [[Liberal Unionist]] faction led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it.  The Irish Home Rule bill gave all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years' purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a rescue operation for the landed elite.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, "The Liberal Party and Gladstone's Land Purchase Bill of 1886. Historical Journal 1989 32(3): 627–641 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2639536 in JSTOR]</ref>

The result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 election]] at the hands of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords.

Gladstone finally retired in 1894, and his ineffectual successor, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], led the party to another heavy defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]].

A major long-term consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates, in the absence of any committed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) into single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] and endorsement from [[trade union]]s. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard: in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer Whigs were selected as candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title='''Access to History''', Government ''and'' Reform: Britain 1815–1918 (Second Edition), page 74|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2000}}</ref>

==The Liberal zenith==
[[Image:Asquith Q 42036.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herbert Henry Asquith]]]]

The Liberals languished in opposition for a decade, while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held power. The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone's personal secretary, [[John Morley]]. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. Harcourt's resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal leaders H.H. Asquith, Edward Grey, and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the "Liberal Imperialists" that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's "methods of barbarism" in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, Arthur Balfour, pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as a new education bill and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs. Campbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[united Kingdom general election, 1906|the greatest election victory]] in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right.

Although he presided over a large majority, [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was overshadowed by his ministers, most notably [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] at the Exchequer, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] at the Foreign Office, [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Burdon Haldane]] at the War Office and [[David Lloyd George]] at the Board of Trade. An ill Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died later that year. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government's radicalism. Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer, and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by [[Winston Churchill]], a recent defector from the Conservatives.

The Liberals pushed through much legislation, including the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and welfare. It was at this time that a political battle over the so-called [[People's Budget]] resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, being left once again dependent on the [[Irish nationalism|Irish Nationalists]].

As a result Asquith was forced to introduce a new [[Third Home Rule Act|third Home Rule bill]] in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, the Unionist's [[Ulster Volunteers]] led by Sir [[Edward Carson]], launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] and the threat of [[mutiny]] by army officers in Ireland in 1914 (''see [[Curragh Incident]]''). In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]], was of [[Ulster-Scots]] descent. The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Historian George Dangerfield has argued that the multiplicity of crises in 1910 to 1914, before the war broke out, so weakened the Liberal coalition that it marked the ''Strange Death of Liberal England.''<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England: 1910-1914'' (1935) [http://www.amazon.com/Strange-Death-Liberal-England/dp/1597405582/  excerpt and text search],</ref>  However, most historians date the collapse to the crisis of the First World War.

==Liberal decline==
{{further|History of the United Kingdom during World War I|David Lloyd George}}
The war struck at the heart of everything British Liberals believed in. The party became divided over the distinctly illiberal policies that were introduced under her auspices, including conscription and the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|Defence of the Realm Act]]. Several Cabinet ministers resigned, and Asquith, the master of domestic politics, proved a poor war leader. Lloyd George and Churchill, however, were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-oriented Liberals out. The poor British performance in the early months of the war forced Asquith to invite the Conservatives into a coalition (on 17 May 1915). This marked the end of the last all-Liberal government. This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it to Lloyd George instead, who became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government largely made up of Conservatives. Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was split once again.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914-1935'' (1966)</ref>

Wilson argues that Lloyd George abandoned many liberal principles in his single-minded crusade to win the war at all costs. That brought him and like-minded Liberals into a coalition with the Conservatives, largely on the ground long occupied by Conservatives, were not oriented toward world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfited by aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the Party, says Wilson, was its repudiation  by ideological Liberals who sadly decided that it no longer represented their principles. Finally the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal Party.<ref>Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914-1935'' (1966) pp 23-48</ref>

[[Image:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Lloyd George]]]]

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]] [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], "the Man Who Won the War", led his coalition into another ''[[khaki election]]'', and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]] wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates – this [[The Coalition Coupon|"coupon"]] as it became known was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. Asquith and most of his colleagues lost their seats. Lloyd George still claimed to be leading a Liberal government, but he was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party. In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition, citing in particular the [[Chanak Crisis]] over [[Turkey]] and Lloyd George's corrupt sale of honours amongst other grievances, and Lloyd George was forced to resign. The Conservatives came back to power under Bonar Law and then [[Stanley Baldwin]].

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 elections]] the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons, as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922 Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]] but ominously made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour – a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government, and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience, as well as offering a middle ground that could get support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense. It was a fatal error.

Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left.  [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was forced into a [[united Kingdom general election, 1924|snap election in 1924]], and although his government was defeated, he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives, while others went over to Labour. (Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]], were the sons of Liberal MPs.)

Asquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', largely written for him by the Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the "[[Celtic fringe]]", where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the [[alternative vote]], but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice-versa.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars, 1918–1940'' (1955)</ref>

The last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906.
The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces. Other issues of the period included [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Irish Home Rule]] movement.
After the carnage of 1914–1918, the democratic reforms of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] instantly tripled the number of people entitled to vote in Britain from seven to twenty-one million. The Labour Party benefited most from this huge change in the electorate, forming its [[First Labour Government (UK)|first minority government in 1924]].<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965).</ref>

==The splits over the National Government==
[[Image:Gws samuel 01.jpg|thumb|140px|Herbert Samuel]]
In 1931 MacDonald's government fell apart under the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and the Liberals agreed to join his [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], dominated by the Conservatives. Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join. Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but only a few MPs and candidates followed. Another group under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk – the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]] (officially the "National Liberals" after 1947) led by Simon, also known as "Simonites", and the "Samuelites" or "official Liberals", led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.

The official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to [[protectionism]]. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the [[Ottawa Conference|Ottawa Agreement]] on [[Imperial Preference]]. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]], just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as "[[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|independent Liberals]]". Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as [[Clement Davies]], who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and who would lead it after the war.

==Near extinction==
Samuel had lost his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 election]] and the leadership of the party fell to [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Sir Archibald Sinclair]]. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the [[appeasement]] foreign policy of the British government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party's weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the [[Midlothian Campaign]] and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.

In 1940 they joined Churchill's wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as [[Secretary of State for Air]], the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party's lack of importance that they were not included in the [[War Cabinet]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour, and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminster.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1945_over.stm |title=1945: Labour landslide buries Churchill |work=The election battles 1945–1997 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> But this was just the beginning of the decline. In [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]], the general election saw the Liberals return just nine MPs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1950_over.stm |title=1950: Labour limps home |work=The election battles 1945–1997 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Another [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|general election was called in 1951]], and the Liberals were left with just six MPs in parliament; all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1951_over.stm |title=1951: Churchill's return |work=The election battles 1945–1997 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

In 1957 this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent by-election was lost to the Labour Party, which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader [[Megan Lloyd George|Lady Megan Lloyd George]] as its own candidate. The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.

==Liberal revival==
Through the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, [[Bolton]] and [[Huddersfield]], local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town's two seats. [[Jo Grimond]], for example, who became Liberal leader in 1956, was MP for the remote [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the [[Orpington by-election, 1962|Orpington by-election]] of March 1962 which was won by [[Eric Reginald Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Eric Lubbock]]. There,  the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.

The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the [[European Economic Community]]. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.

The new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, [[Jeremy Thorpe]], the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although [[Emlyn Hooson]] held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon [[Clement Davies]] death in 1962, the party lost five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966 the [[Welsh Liberal Party]] formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.<ref>Russell Deacon (2011) History of the Welsh Liberal party, Welsh Academic Press</ref>

In local elections [[Liverpool]] remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the [[United Kingdom local elections, 1973|elections]] to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973. In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the [[Home Office]] if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing [[proportional representation]] and a change of Prime Minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead a minority Labour government was formed under [[Harold Wilson]] but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]] the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.

Thorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations about his private life. The party's new leader, [[David Steel]], negotiated the [[Lib-Lab pact]] with Wilson's successor as Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of [[proportional representation]] was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson [[John Pardoe]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], who were mutually antagonistic.

==Alliance with Social Democrats==
{{main|SDP–Liberal Alliance}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|right|150px|The symbol of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats.]] -->
When the Labour government fell in 1979, the Conservatives under [[Margaret Thatcher]] won [[united Kingdom general election, 1979|a victory]] which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.

In 1981, defectors from the moderate wing of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]] and [[Shirley Williams]], founded the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. The new party and the Liberals quickly formed an alliance, which for a while polled as high as 50% in the opinion polls and appeared capable of winning the next general election. However, they were later overtaken in the polls by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] the Conservatives triumphed by a landslide, with Labour once again forming the opposition, while the SDP-Liberal Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes (a share of more than 25%) although it only had 23 MPs compared to Labour's 209.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn and Christine F. Collette, eds.|title=Modern Britain Since 1979: A Reader|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-vZ7zHxs690C&pg=PA125|year=2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|pages=125–28}}</ref>

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]] saw the Alliance's share of the votes drop slightly and it now had 22 MPs, and in the election's aftermath Liberal leader [[David Steel]] proposed a merged of the two parties. Most SDP members voted in favour of the merger, but SDP leader [[David Owen]] objected and continued to lead a "rump" SDP, with the merger of the two parties being completed in March 1988 to form the '''Social and Liberal Democrats''', becoming the '''Liberal Democrats''' in October 1989.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm | work=BBC News | title=SDP: Breaking the mould | date=25 January 2001}}</ref>

==Merger with Social Democrats==
{{main|Liberal Democrats (UK)}}

In 1988 the Liberals and Social Democrats merged to create what came to be called the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Over two-thirds of the members, and all the serving MPs, of the Liberal Party joined this party, led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]], and later by [[Paddy Ashdown]] (1988–99), [[Charles Kennedy]] (1999–2006), [[Sir Menzies Campbell]] (2006–07) and [[Nick Clegg]] (incumbent).<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Barberis et al.|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&pg=PA302|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|pages=301–3}}</ref>

Though the merger process was traumatic and the new party suffered a few years of extremely poor poll results, it gradually found much greater electoral success than the Liberal Party had done in the post-war era. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the Liberal Democrats elected 62 MPs to the House of Commons, a far cry from the days when the Liberals had just 5 MPs and Liberalism as a political force had seemed moribund.

As was the case with the Liberal Party for most of the 20th century, the Liberal Democrats face constant questioning about which of the other two parties they are closer to, in particular about which they would support in the event of a [[hung parliament]]. The party is keen to maintain its independent identity however, and argues that the need for a modern Liberal force in British politics has never been greater.

In the 2010 General Election, the Conservative Party won more seats than any other, but not enough to form a majority government. After several days of negotiation, the Liberal Democrats agreed to join the Conservatives as part of a coalition government.

==The post-1988 Liberal Party==
{{main|Liberal Party (UK, 1989)}}
A group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats, including [[Michael Meadowcroft]] (formerly Liberal MP for Leeds West) and Paul Wiggin (who served on [[Local government in Peterborough|Peterborough City Council]] as a Liberal), continued under the old name of "the Liberal Party". This was legally a new organisation (the headquarters, records, assets and debts of the old party were inherited by the Liberal Democrats), but its constitution asserts it to be the same Liberal party. The party retains influence in some local councils. Meadowcroft himself eventually joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007.

==National Liberal Party==
In 1931 a number of Liberal MPs split from the original Liberal Party in protest at the leadership's adherence to free trade. The party name was appropriated in 2006 by the [[far-right politics|far-right]] political [[think tank]] the [[Third Way (UK)|Third Way]].<ref name=nationalliberal>{{cite web|title=National Liberal Party Official Site|url=http://nationalliberal.org/}}</ref>
