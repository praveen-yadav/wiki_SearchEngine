'''Bay leaf''' (plural '''bay leaves''') refers to the aromatic leaves of several plants used in cooking. These include:
*[[Bay laurel]] (''Laurus nobilis'', [[Lauraceae]]). Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinctive flavor and fragrance. The leaves are often used to flavor soups, stews, braises and ''pâtés'' in Mediterranean cuisine. The fresh leaves are very mild and do not develop their full flavor until several weeks after picking and drying.<ref name="Spice Trade: Bay Leaf">{{cite web | url = http://www.spice-trade.com/bay-leaf.html | title = Spice Trade: Bay Leaf | accessdate = 2009-04-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090412090109/http://www.spice-trade.com/bay-leaf.html| archivedate= 12 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
*California bay leaf&nbsp;&ndash; the leaf of the California bay tree (''[[Umbellularia californica]]'', Lauraceae), also known as California laurel, Oregon myrtle, and pepperwood, is similar to the Mediterranean bay laurel, but has a stronger flavor.
*Indian bay leaf or malabathrum (''[[Cinnamomum tamala]]'', Lauraceae) is somewhat similar in appearance to the leaves of bay laurel, but is culinarily quite different, having a fragrance and taste similar to [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cinnamon (cassia)]] bark, but milder.
*Indonesian bay leaf or Indonesian laurel (''salam'' leaf, ''[[Syzygium]] polyanthum'', Myrtaceae) is not commonly found outside of Indonesia; this herb is applied to meat and, less often vegetables.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Euge_pol.html | title =Spice Pages: Indonesian Bay-Leaf | accessdate = 2012-12-01}}</ref>
*West Indian bay leaf, the leaf of the West Indian bay tree (''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'', Myrtaceae), used culinarily and to produce the [[Eau de Cologne|cologne]] called [[bay rum]].
*Mexican bay leaf (''[[Litsea glaucescens]]'', Lauraceae).

== Taste and aroma ==
{{expand section|the species other than ''Laurus nobilis''|date=November 2012}}
If eaten whole, bay leaves are pungent and have a sharp, bitter taste. As with many spices and flavorings, the fragrance of the bay leaf is more noticeable than its taste. When dried, the fragrance is herbal, slightly floral, and somewhat similar to [[oregano]] and [[thyme]]. [[Myrcene]], which is a component of many essential oils used in perfumery, can be extracted from the bay leaf. They also contain the [[essential oil]] [[eugenol]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of Spices: Bay Leaf">{{cite web | url=http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/bay.html | title =Encyclopedia of Spices: Bay Leaf | accessdate = 2009-04-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090416234125/http://www.theepicentre.com/Spices/bay.html| archivedate= 16 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Uses==
Bay leaves were used for flavoring by the ancient Greeks.<ref>[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/botany/trees.htm "Ancient Egyptian Plants: Trees" ''www.reshafim.org.il''] Retrieved October 29, 2013</ref> It is a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), as well as in the Americas. They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood, vegetable dishes, and sauces. The leaves also flavor many classic French dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a ''[[bouquet garni]]'') and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). Thai cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai name ''bai kra wan'') in a few Arab-influenced dishes, notably [[massaman curry]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Tan | first = Hugh T.

In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bay laurel leaves are sometimes used in place of [[Malabathrum|Indian bay leaf]], although they have a different flavor. They are most often used in rice dishes like ''[[biryani]]'' and as an ingredient in ''[[garam masala]]''. Bay (laurel) leaves are frequently packaged as ''tejpatta'' (the Hindi term for Indian bay leaf), creating confusion between the two herbs.

In the Philippines, dried bay laurel leaves are added as a spice in the Filipino dish Adobo.

Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking. Crushed bay leaves impart more of their desired fragrance than whole leaves, but are more difficult to remove, and thus they are often used in a muslin bag or tea infuser. Ground bay laurel may be substituted for whole leaves, and does not need to be removed, but it is much stronger due to the increased surface area and in some dishes the texture may not be desirable. 

Bay leaves can also be used scattered in a [[pantry]] to repel [[meal moth]]s,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/repel-grain-moths-with-bay-leaves.html | title =How to Repel Grain Moths with Bay Leaves | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}</ref> flies,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} roaches,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} mice,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and silverfish.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Bay leaves have been used in entomology as the active ingredient in [[killing jar]]s. The crushed, fresh, young leaves are put into the jar under a layer of paper. The vapors they release kill insects slowly but effectively, and keep the specimens relaxed and easy to mount. The leaves discourage the growth of molds. They are not effective for killing large beetles and similar specimens, but insects that have been killed in a cyanide killing jar can be transferred to a laurel jar to await mounting.<ref  name=JohnSmart>{{cite book | last = Smart | first = John | title = British Museum (Natural History) Instructions for Collectors NO. 4A. Insects | publisher = Trustees of the British Museum | location = London | year = 1963  }}</ref> It is not clear to what extent the effect is due to cyanide released by the crushed leaves, and to what extent other volatile products are responsible.

== Safety ==
Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated but visually similar [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] and [[Prunus laurocerasus|cherry laurel]], have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock. While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true - bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain very stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of scratching the digestive tract or even causing choking. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2695/what-is-the-origin-of-the-song-theres-a-place-in-france-where-the-naked-ladies-dance | title =Straight Dope: Are Bay Leaves Poisonous? | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}</ref>
