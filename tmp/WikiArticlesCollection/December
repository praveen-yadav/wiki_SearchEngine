==History==
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry décembre.jpg|right|thumb|December, from the ''Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry'']]
December was originally the tenth month of the year in the [[Roman calendar]] until a monthless winter period was divided between January and February. It gets its name from the Latin word "decem" which means tenth. However, when the Romans added January and February to the calendar, it became the twelfth month. The name remained the same however.
