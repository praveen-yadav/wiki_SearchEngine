[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Leonhard Euler]] developed the theory of [[buckling]] of columns]]

Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]] (Ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a [[nomad]]ic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and [[Maritime history|sailing]].

Until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture, and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same person, often used interchangeably.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt ISBN 0-8052-1082-2</ref> The construction of [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]] in Egypt (circa 2700–2500 BC) might be considered the first instances of large structure constructions. Other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the [[Qanat]] water management system (the oldest older than 3000 years and longer than 71&nbsp;km,<ref>p. 4 of {{Cite book

The Romans developed civil structures throughout their empire, including especially [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[insulae]], [[harbor]]s, bridges, dams and roads.

In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering.<ref name=eb/>
The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was [[John Smeaton]] who constructed the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]].<ref name=CSCE/><ref name="Oakes"/> In 1771 Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.

In 1818 the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded in London, and in 1820 the eminent engineer [[Thomas Telford]] became its first president. The institution received a Royal Charter in 1828, formally recognising civil engineering as a profession. Its charter defined civil engineering as:

{{quote|the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, as the means of production and of traffic in states, both for external and internal trade, as applied in the construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, canals, river navigation and docks for internal intercourse and exchange, and in the construction of ports, harbours, moles, breakwaters and lighthouses, and in the art of navigation by artificial power for the purposes of commerce, and in the construction and application of machinery, and in the drainage of cities and towns.<ref name=ICE>{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.org.uk|title=Institution of Civil Engineers' website|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref>}}

The first private college to teach Civil Engineering in the United States was [[Norwich University]] founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.<ref>[http://www.norwich.edu/about/legacy.html "Norwich University Legacy Website"]</ref>  The first degree in Civil Engineering in the United States was awarded by [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in 1835.<ref>Griggs, Francis E Jr. "Amos Eaton was Right!".

Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances in understanding of [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] throughout history. Because civil engineering is a wide ranging profession, including several separate specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials science, [[geography]], geology, [[soil]]s, [[hydrology]], [[Environmental science|environment]], [[mechanics]] and other fields.

Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s, such as [[masonry|stonemasons]] and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[Architect|master builder]]. Knowledge was retained in [[guilds]] and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures, roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.<ref name=Saouma>{{cite web|url=http://ceae.colorado.edu/~saouma/Lecture-Notes/se.pdf|title=Lecture notes in Structural Engineering|author=Victor E. Saouma|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>

One of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of [[Archimedes]] in the 3rd century BC, including Archimedes Principle, which underpins our understanding of [[buoyancy]], and practical solutions such as [[Archimedes' screw]].  [[Brahmagupta]], an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.<ref>Henry Thomas Colebrook, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A3cAAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=brahmagupta ''Algebra: with Arithmetic and mensuration''] (London 1817)</ref>

===Education and licensure===
{{Main|Civil engineer}}

Civil engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in civil engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three to five years and the completed degree is usually designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], though some universities designate the degree as a Bachelor of Science. The degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub-disciplines of civil engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub-disciplines towards the end of the degree.<ref>Various undergraduate degree requirements at [http://cee.mit.edu/index.pl?id=10951&isa=Category&op=show MIT], [http://ceenve.calpoly.edu/media/files/cecurriculum0709.pdf Cal Poly], [http://www.civil.queensu.ca/undergraduate/documents/newcivlengprogrm2007-08.doc Queen's] and [http://www.port.ac.uk/courses/coursetypes/undergraduate/BEngHonsCivilEngineering/whatwillistudy/ Portsmouth]</ref> While an Undergraduate (BEng/BSc) Degree will normally provide successful students with industry accredited qualification, some universities offer postgraduate engineering awards (MEng/MSc) which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest within engineering.<ref name="CITE Postgrad">,{{cite web|url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm|title= CITE Postgrad}}</ref>

In most countries, a Bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program itself is certified by a [[professional body]]. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth]] countries), [[Chartered Professional Engineer]] (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or [[European Engineer]] (in much of the [[European Union]]). There are international engineering agreements between relevant professional bodies which are designed to allow engineers to practice across international borders.

The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed [[professional engineer]] may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients.".<ref>{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}</ref> This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as [[Quebec|Quebec's]] Engineers Act.<ref>{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}</ref> In other countries such as the UK no such legislation exists. In Australia, state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of [[Queensland]]. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[code of ethics]] that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ethics Codes and Guidelines | work = Online Ethics Center | url = http://onlineethics.org/CMS/profpractice/ethcodes.aspx | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}</ref> In this way, these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to [[contract law]]. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the [[negligence|tort of negligence]] and, in extreme cases, criminal charges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Singapore's Circle Line criminal trial started | work = New Civil Engineer | url = http://www.nce.co.uk/singapores-circle-line-criminal-trial-started/530302.article | accessdate = 2013-11-16 }}</ref>  An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as [[building codes]] and legislation pertaining to [[environmental law]].

==Sub-disciplines==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}

[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in Scotland.]]
In general, civil engineering is concerned with the overall interface of human created fixed projects with the greater world. General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to fit and serve fixed projects within their given site, community and terrain by designing grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, electric and communications supply, and land divisions. General engineers spend much of their time visiting project sites, developing community consensus, and preparing construction plans. General civil engineering is also referred to as [[site engineering]], a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Civil engineers typically apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.

===Materials science and engineering===
{{Main|Materials science}}
One of the major aspects of Civil engineering is [[materials science]]. Material engineering deals with ceramics such as concrete, mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and polymers such as [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.

[[File:Construction in Sète, Hérault 01.jpg|thumb|left|Construction in progress in [[Sète]], France]]
Materials engineering also consists of protection and prevention like paints and finishes. Alloying is another aspect of materials engineering, combining two types of metals to produce a stronger metal. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With significant media attention focused on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]] in recent years, [[materials science]] has been propelled to the forefront at many universities. It is also an important part of [[forensic engineering]] and [[failure analysis]]. [[Materials science]] also deals with fundamental properties and characteristics of [[materials]].

===Coastal engineering===
{{Main|Coastal management}}

Coastal engineering is concerned with managing coastal areas.
In some jurisdictions the terms sea defense and coastal protection are used to mean, respectively, defense against flooding and erosion. The term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to include techniques that allow erosion to claim land.

===Construction engineering===
{{Main|Construction engineering}}

Construction engineering involves planning and execution of the designs from transportation, site development, hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineers. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms, many construction engineers tend to take on a role that is more business-like in nature: drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and closely monitoring prices of necessary supplies.

===Earthquake engineering===
{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}
[[File:Snapshot of base isolation effect.jpg|thumb||Snapshot from [[shake-table video]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzVvd4Dk6sw&locale=en_US&persist_locale=1] of testing base-isolated (right) and regular (left) building model]]

Earthquake engineering covers ability of various structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures at the sites of their particular location.

[[Earthquake engineering]] is a sub discipline of the broader category of Structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are:<ref>Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, ISBN 0-8493-0068-1, Chapter 2</ref>
* Understand interaction of structures with the shaky ground.
* Foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes.
* Design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake exposure up to the expectations and in compliance with [[building code]]s.

===Environmental engineering===
{{Main|Environmental engineering}}

Environmental engineering deals with the treatment of chemical, biological, and/or thermal waste, the purification of water and air, and the [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites, due to prior waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]] and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers can be involved with pollution reduction, green engineering, and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineering also deals with the gathering of information on the environmental consequences of proposed actions and the assessment of effects of proposed actions for the purpose of assisting society and policy makers in the decision making process.

Environmental engineering is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by the term ''environmental engineering''. Some other terms in use are public health engineering and environmental health engineering.

===Geotechnical engineering===
{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}

Geotechnical engineering is an area of civil engineering concerned with the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and soil that support civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the fields of [[geology]], [[material science]] and testing, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] are applied by geotechnical engineers to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and similar structures. Environmental concerns in relation to [[groundwater]] and [[landfill|waste disposal]] have spawned a new area of study called geoenvironmental engineering where [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] are important.<ref name="mitchell">Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1–2</ref><ref>Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor & Francis, 2003, pp 1–2</ref>

Some of the unique difficulties of geotechnical engineering are the result of the variability and properties of soil. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but with soil, clearly defining these conditions can be impossible. The material properties and behavior of soil are also difficult to predict due to the variability of soil and limited [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. This contrasts with the relatively well defined material properties of steel and concrete used in other areas of civil engineering. [[Soil mechanics]], which describes the behavior of soil, is also complicated because soils exhibit nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress).<ref name="mitchell"/>

===Water resources engineering===
{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hoover dam]]]]

Water resources engineering is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], geology, [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifers]]) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers. 

Hydraulic engineering is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.

===Structural engineering===
{{Main|Structural engineering}}

Structural engineering is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[Overpass|flyover]]s (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.<ref>Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.</ref>

Design considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, [[safety]], aesthetics and [[sustainability]].

===Surveying===
{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}

Surveying is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that generally occur on the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have supplemented (and to a large extent supplanted) the traditional optical instruments. This information is crucial to convert the data into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface, in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and even realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a building or structure must be correctly sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and [[map]]ping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s.
Surveyors may also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructures, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.

'''Land surveying'''

In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a distinct profession.  [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licencing requirements.  The services of a licenced land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastre#Cadastral surveys|cadastral surveying]].

'''Construction surveying'''

Construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians.  Unlike land  surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status.  Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:

* Survey existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and even including underground infrastructure whenever possible;
* Construction surveying (otherwise "lay-out" or "setting-out"): to stake out reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings for subsequent construction;
* Verify the location of structures during construction;
* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.

===Transportation engineering===
{{Main|Transport engineering}}

Transportation engineering is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, [[canals]], highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.

===Municipal or urban engineering===
{{Main|Urban engineering}}

Municipal engineering is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalks]], [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[segregated cycle facilities|bicycle paths]].  In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services.  It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.

=== Forensic engineering ===
{{Main|Forensic engineering}}
[[File:Plate7new.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Failed fuel pipe at right from a road traffic accident]]

Forensic engineering is the investigation of [[materials]], [[Product (business)|products]], [[structures]] or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patents]].

=== Control engineering ===
{{Main|Control engineering}}
[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching.jpg|thumb|left|Control systems play a critical role in [[space flight]]]]

[[Control engineering]] or [[control systems]] engineering is the branch of [[Civil Engineering]] discipline that applies [[control theory]] to design systems with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled (often a vehicle) and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called [[automatic control]] (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of [[control systems]] mainly derived by [[mathematical modeling]] of systems of a diverse range.
