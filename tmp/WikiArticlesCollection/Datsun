'''Datsun''' is an automobile brand owned by the [[Nissan Motor Company]]. Datsun's original production run began in 1931. From 1958 to 1986, only vehicles exported by Nissan were identified as Datsun. In 1986, Nissan phased out the Datsun name but relaunched it in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for [[emerging markets]].

In 1931, DAT Motorcar Co. chose to name its new small car "Datson", a name which indicated the new car's smaller size when compared to the DAT's larger vehicle already in production. When Nissan took control of DAT in 1934, the name "Datson" was changed to "Datsun", because "son" also means "loss" ('''損''') in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and also to honour the sun depicted in the national flag.<ref>Consumano, Michael A. ''Also, the symbol was derived from [lemons] which are famous in Japan. The Japanese Automobile Industry'', H.U.P (1985), ISBN 0-674-47255-1 p.33</ref> Nissan phased out the Datsun brand in March 1986. The Datsun name is most famous for the  [[Datsun 510|510]], [[Datsun Sports|Fairlady]] roadsters, and later the Fairlady ([[Nissan Z-car|240Z]]) coupes.

On 20 March 2012, it was announced that Nissan would revive the brand for use in [[Indonesia]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], and [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlane.com/india-bound-datsun-will-also-1267791.html |title=India bound Datsun will also head to South Africa by 2014 |date=2013-02-28 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref>

==History==
===The origin of Datsun===
{{Further|Nissan Motor Company}}
Before the Datsun brand name came into being, an automobile named the DAT car was built in 1914, by the {{nihongo|Kaishinsha Motorcar Works|快進自動車工場|Kaishin Jidōsha Kōjō}}, in the Azabu-Hiroo District in Tokyo. The new car's name was an acronym of the surnames of the following company partners:

*{{nihongo|Kenjiro '''D'''en|田 健次郎|''Den Kenjirō''}}
*{{nihongo|Rokuro '''A'''oyama|青山 禄朗|''Aoyama Rokurō''}}
*{{nihongo|Meitaro '''T'''akeuchi|竹内 明太郎|''Takeuchi Meitarō''}}.<ref name=BBCMar2012/>

The firm was renamed Kaishinsha Motorcar Co. in 1918, seven years after their establishment and again, in 1925, to DAT Motorcar Co. DAT Motors constructed trucks in addition to the DAT passenger cars. In fact, their output focused on trucks since there was almost no consumer market for passenger cars at the time. Beginning in 1918, the first DAT trucks were assembled for the military market. The low demand from the military market during the 1920s forced DAT to consider merging with other automotive industries. In 1926 the [[Tokyo]]-based DAT Motors merged with the Osaka-based {{nihongo|Jitsuyo Jidosha Co., Ltd.|実用自動車製造株式会社|Jitsuyō Jidōsha Seizō Kabushiki-Gaisha}} also known as Jitsuyo Motors (established 1919, as a Kubota subsidiary) to become {{nihongo|DAT Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd.|ダット自動車製造株式会社|Datto Jidōsha Seizō Kabushiki-Gaisha}} in [[Osaka]] until 1932.  (Jitsuyo Jidosha began producing a three-wheeled vehicle with an enclosed cab called the Gorham in 1920, and the following year produced a four-wheeled version. From 1923 to 1925, the company produced light cars and trucks under the name of Lila.<ref>''The Complete Encyclopedia of Motorcars 1885 to the Present'' Edited by [[G.N. Georgano]]; 1968; E.P. Dutton and Company; New York, NY</ref>)

The DAT corporation had been selling full size cars to Japanese consumers under the DAT name since 1914 ([http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/is/is494.pdf Madely], pg. 19), but in 1930 the Japanese government created a ministerial ordinance that allowed cars with engines up to 500 cc to be driven without a license. ([http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID963953_code436859.pdf?abstractid=963953&mirid=1 TOGO], pg. 11).  DAT Automobile Manufacturing began development of a line of 495 cc cars to sell in this new market segment, calling the new small cars "Datson" - meaning "Son of DAT". The name was changed to "Datsun" two years later in 1933. ([http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/is/is494.pdf Madely], pg. 20)

The first prototype Datson was completed in the summer of 1931.<ref>[http://nissan-me.com/English/Pages/heritage/short_story/en_p05-01.html Nissan]</ref> The production vehicle was called the Datson Type 10, and "approximately ten" of these cars were sold in 1931.<ref name="JSAE">[http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/1-5e.html JSAE]</ref> They sold around 150 cars in 1932, now calling the model the Datson Type 11.<ref name="JSAE"/>  In 1933, government rules were revised to permit {{convert|750|cc|cid|abbr=on}} engines, and Datsun increased the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of their microcar engine to the maximum allowed.<ref name="JSAE"/> These larger displacement cars were called [[Datsun Type 12|Type 12]]s.<ref>[http://nissan-me.com/English/Pages/heritage/en_detail.html?001 Nissan Heritage]</ref>

By 1935, the company had established a true production line, following the example of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and were producing a car closely resembling the [[Austin 7]].<ref name="Daniels, p.495">Daniels, p.495.</ref> There is evidence that six of these early Datsuns were exported to [[New Zealand]] in 1936, a market they re-entered in May 1962.<ref name=NZA>{{citation | ref = NZa | title = Assembly: New Zealand Car Production 1921-98 | last = Webster | first = Mark | publisher = Reed | year = 2002 | page = 78 | location = Birkenhead, Auckland, New Zealand | isbn = 0-7900-0846-7 }}</ref>

After Japan went to war with China in 1937, passenger car production was restricted, so by 1938, Datsun's Yokohama plant concentrated on building trucks for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].<ref name="Daniels, p.495"/>

When the [[Pacific War]] ended, Datsun would turn to providing trucks for the Occupation forces.<ref name="Daniels, p.495"/> This lasted until car production resumed in 1947.<ref name="Daniels, p.495"/> As before the war, Datsun closely patterned their cars on contemporary [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] products: postwar, the [[Austin A40 Devon|Devon]] and [[Austin A40 Somerset|Somerset]] were selected.<ref name="Daniels, p.495"/> Not until 1955 did Datsun offer an indigenous design.<ref name="Daniels, p.495"/>

That year, the Occupation returned production facilities to Japanese control, and Datsun introduced the [[Datsun 110|110]] [[Sedan (car)|saloon]] and 110-based [[Datsun Truck#Datsun 120/220|120]] [[Coupé utility|pickup]]<ref name="Daniels, p.495"/> (what [[Hot rod|rodder]]s call a [[Hot rod#Common terms|"pickoupe"]]).

===Datsun in the American market===
[[File:Datsun logo.png|thumb|right|The "classic" Datsun logo, based on the [[Flag of Japan]] and Japan's [[Names of Japan|nickname]] as the "Land of the Rising Sun". After the Nissan rebrand, the logo remained the same, with "Datsun" replaced by "Nissan".]]

The use of the ''Datsun'' name in the American market derives from the name Nissan used for its production cars. In fact, the cars produced by Nissan already used the Datsun brand name, a successful brand in Japan since 1932, long before [[World War II]]. Before the entry into the American market in 1958, Nissan did not produce cars under the Nissan brand name, but only trucks. Their in-house-designed cars were always branded as ''Datsuns''. Hence, for Nissan executives it would be only natural to use such a successful name when exporting models to the United States. Only in the 1960s did Datsun begin to brand some automobile models as ''Nissans'', and these were limited to their high-end models, for example the [[Nissan Cedric|Cedric]] luxury-type [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. In America, the Nissan branch was named "''Nissan Motor Corporation in U.S.A.''", and chartered on September 28, 1960, in California. Nissan may have had no problems with using the name Nissan in America, but the small cars the firm exported to America were still named Datsun.

Corporate choice favored Datsun, so as to distance the [[parent factory]] Nissan’s association by [[United States|Americans]] with Japanese military manufacture. In fact Nissan's involvement in Japan's military industries was substantial. The company's car production at the Yokohama plant shifted towards military needs just a few years after the first passenger cars rolled off the assembly line, on April 11, 1935. By 1939 Nissan's operations had moved to [[Manchuria]], then under Japanese occupation, where its founder and President, Yoshisuke Ayukawa, established the Manchurian Motor Company to manufacture military trucks.

Ayukawa, a well-connected and aggressive risk taker, also made himself a principal partner of the Japanese Colonial Government of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>Halberstam, David  ''The Reckoning'', Avon Books, 1986 ISBN 0-380-72147-3.</ref> Ultimately, Nissan Heavy Industries emerged near the end of the war as an important player in Japan’s war machinery. After the war ended, [[Soviet Union]] seized all of Nissan’s Manchuria assets, while the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation Forces]] made use of over half of the [[Yokohama]] plant. [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] had Ayukawa imprisoned for 21 months as a [[war crime|war criminal]]. After release he was forbidden from returning to any corporate or public office until 1951. He was never allowed back into Nissan, which returned to passenger car manufacture in 1947 and to its original name of Nissan Motor Company Ltd. in 1949.

[[File:SPL212.jpg|thumb|right|Datsun Fairlady]]

[[United States armed forces|American service personnel]] in their teens or early twenties during the Second World War would be in prime car-buying age by 1960, if only to find an [[economic system|economical]] small second car for their growing family needs. [[Yutaka Katayama]] (Mr. "K"), former president of Nissan's American operations, would have had his personal wartime experiences in mind supporting the name Datsun. Katayama's visit to Nissan’s Manchuria truck factory in 1939 made him realize (the person who made this misspelled realize. He/she put realise. Ok keep reading because this is getting interesting) the appalling conditions of the assembly lines, leading him to abandon the firm.<ref>“Yutaka Katayama; A Man Who Realized a Dream in America", 1998 Z Car Club Association, pg 71.</ref> In 1945, near the end of the war, Katayama was ordered to return to the Manchurian plant, however he rebuffed these calls and refused to return.

[[File:Datsun 240Z.jpg|thumb|Datsun 240Z (USDM) or Fairlady Z (JDM)]]

Katayama desired to build and sell passenger cars to people, not to the military; for him, the name "''Datsun''" had survived the war with its purity intact, not "''Nissan''". This obviously led Katayama to have problems with the corporate management. The discouragement felt by Katayama as regards his prospects at Nissan, led to his going on the verge of resigning, when Datsun’s [[Mobil Economy Run|1958 Australian Mobilgas victories]] vaunted him, as leader of the winning Datsun teams, to national prominence in a [[Post-Occupation Japan|Japan bent on regaining international status]].

The company's first product to be exported around the world was the [[Nissan Bluebird#210/211 series|113]], with a [[Nissan D engine|proprietary]] {{convert|25|hp|kW PS|abbr=on|lk=on}} {{convert|850|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[four-cylinder engine]].<ref>Daniels, p.496 caption.</ref>

Datsun entered the American market in 1958, with sales in California.<ref name="Daniels, p.496">Daniels, p.496.</ref> By 1959, the company had dealers across the U.S.<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/> and began selling the [[Nissan Bluebird#310 series|310]] (known as Bluebird domestically).<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/>

From 1960 on, exports and production continued to grow. A new plant was built at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Oppama]], south of [[Yokohama]]; it opened in 1962. The next year, Bluebird sales first topped 200,000, and exports touched 100,000.<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/> By 1964, Bluebird was being built at 10,000 cars a month.<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/>

For 1966, Datsun debuted the [[Datsun 1000|1000]], allowing owners of {{convert|360|cc|cid|abbr=on}} [[kei car|kei]] cars to move up to something bigger.<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/> That same year, Datsun won the [[Safari Rally|East African Safari Rally]] and merged with [[Prince Motors]], giving the company the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] model range, as well as a test track at Murayama.<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/>

The company introduced the [[Datsun 510|Bluebird 510]] in 1967.<ref name="Daniels, p.496"/> This was followed in 1968 with the iconic [[Datsun 240Z|240Z]], which proved affordable [[sports car]]s could be built and sold profitably: it was soon the world's #1-selling sports car.<ref>Daniels, pp.496-497.</ref> It relied on an engine based on the Bluebird and used Bluebird suspension components.<ref name="Daniels, p.497">Daniels, p.497.</ref> It would go on to two outright wins in the East African Rally.<ref name="Daniels, p.497"/>

Katayama was made Vice President of the Nissan North American subsidiary in 1960, and as long as he was involved in decision making, both as North American Vice President from 1960 to 1965, and then President of Nissan Motor Company U.S.A. from 1965 to 1975, the cars were sold as Datsuns. “What we need to do is improve our car’s [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] gradually and creep up slowly before others notice. Then, before [[Detroit]] realizes it, we will have become an excellent car maker, and the customers will think so too. If we work hard to sell our own cars, we won’t be bothered by whatever the other manufacturers do. If all we do is worry about the other cars in the race, we will definitely lose.”<ref>“Yutaka Katayama; A Man Who Realized a Dream in America", 1998 Z Car Club Association, pg 36.</ref>

===Rebranding===
[[File:Nissan-720.jpg|thumb|right|Datsun 720]]

In Japan, there appears to have been what probably constituted a long held 'official' company [[bias]] against use of the name "Datsun".<ref>Business Week, April 7, 1973, interview with Katsuji Kawamata, president of Nissan Motor Company Ltd.</ref> At the time, Kawamata was a veteran of Nissan, in the last year of his presidency, a powerful figure whose experience in the firm exceeded two decades. His rise to its leadership position occurred in 1957 in part because of his handling of the critical Nissan workers' strike that began May 25, 1953, and ran for 100 days. During his tenure as President, Kawamata stated that he "regretted that his company did not imprint its corporate name on cars, the way [[Toyota]] does. 'Looking back, we wish we had started using Nissan on all of our cars,' he says. 'But Datsun was a pet name for the cars when we started [[export]]ing.'"<ref>Business Week, April 7, 1973, pg. 69.</ref>

Ultimately, the decision was made to stop using the brand name ''Datsun'' worldwide, in order to strengthen the company name ''Nissan''.

"The decision to change the name Datsun to Nissan in the U.S. was announced  in the autumn (September/October) of 1981. The rationale was that the name change would help the pursuit of a [[global strategy]]. A single name worldwide would increase the possibility that advertising campaigns, brochures, and promotional materials could be used across countries and simplify product design and manufacturing. Further, potential buyers would be exposed to the name and product when traveling to other countries. Industry observers, however, speculated that the most important motivation was that a name change would help Nissan market stocks and bonds in the U.S. They also presumed substantial [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] involvement, since the absence of the Nissan name in the [[United States of America|U.S]]. surely rankled Nissan executives who had seen [[Toyota]] and [[Honda]] become household words."<ref>Aaker, David A. ''Managing Brand Equity : Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name'', New York: The Free Press, 1991 ISBN 0-02-900101-3 Chapter 3, Pg. 57</ref>

Ultimately, the name change campaign lasted for a three-year period from 1982 to 1984 (Datsun badged vehicles had been progressively fitted with small "Nissan" and "Datsun by Nissan" badges from the late 1970s onward) until the Nissan name was given prominence in 1983 - although in some export markets vehicles continued to wear both the Datsun and Nissan badges until 1986. The name change had cost Nissan a figure in the region of US$500 million. Operational costs included the changing of signs at 1,100 Datsun dealerships, and amounted to US$30 million. Another US$200 million were spent during the 1982 to 1986 advertising campaigns, where the ''"Datsun, We Are Driven!"'' campaign yielded to ''"The Name is Nissan"'' campaign. (The latter campaign was used for some years beyond 1985.) Another US$50 million was spent on Datsun advertisements that were paid for but stopped or never used.<ref>[http://www.zcca.org/pages/ZCarsZhistoryDatsuntoNissan.htm What's in a name?] - ZCCA</ref> Five years after the name change program was over, ''Datsun'' still remained more familiar than ''Nissan''.<ref>Aaker, pg 56.</ref>

In 2001, [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] marketed its [[Nissan Frontier|D22]] pick-up model in Japan with the name ''Datsun''. This time however, the use of the brand name was wholly restricted to this one specific model name. Production of this model was between May 2001 and October 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.nissan.co.jp/DATSUN/TRUCK/D22/0105/ |title=日産：ダットサン トラック TRUCK |publisher=History.nissan.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-08-12}}</ref>

On 15 July 2013, Datsun was relaunched as a low-cost brand, nearly three decades after it was phased it out in 1986.
