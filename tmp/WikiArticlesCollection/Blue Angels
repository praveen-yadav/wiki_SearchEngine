The '''Blue Angels''' is the [[United States Navy]]'s flight demonstration squadron.  The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946,<ref name=OFFICIAL>[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/history.htm History of the Blue Angels]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} Blue Angels official website.</ref> making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French [[Patrouille de France]] formed in 1931. The Blue Angels' six demonstration pilots fly the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]], typically in more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques used in their aerial displays in 1946. An estimated 11 million spectators view the squadron during air shows each full year. The Blue Angels also visit more than 50,000 people in a standard show season (March through November) in schools and hospitals.<ref name="Blueangels.navy.mil">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx |title=Blue Angels: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Blueangels.navy.mil |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref> Since 1946, the Blue Angels have flown for more than 260 million spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/aircraft/b-angels/blues.html |title=United States Navy: The Blue Angels History |publisher=Navy.mil |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>

On 1 March 2013 the US Navy announced that due to [[Sequester (2013)|sequestration actions]] aerial demonstration team performances including that of the Blue Angels would cease from 1 April 2013.<ref>[http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/01/17149624-military-spending-cuts-ground-blue-angels-thunderbirds?lite/ Military spending cuts ground Blue Angels, Thunderbirds] 1 March 2013 NBC News; [http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=73264 U.S. Navy Cancels Blue Angels 2013 Performances] 10 April 2013, U.S. Navy</ref>

==Mission==
The mission of the Blue Angels is to enhance Navy and Marine Corps recruiting, and credibly represent Navy and Marine Corps aviation to the United States and its Armed Forces to America and other countries.<ref name="Blueangels.navy.mil"/>

==Air show overview==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}

The Blue Angels' show season runs each year from March until November. They perform at both military and civilian airfields, and often perform directly over major cities such as San Francisco's "[[Fleet Week]]" maritime festival, [[Cleveland]]'s annual Labor Day Air Show, the [[Chicago Air and Water Show]], and [[Seattle]]'s annual [[Seafair]] festival.

[[File:Blue Angels Flying in Delta Formation at Miramar.jpg|thumb|left|The Blue Angels flying in a Delta Formation at [[Miramar, San Diego]] in 2011]]

During their [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] demonstration, the Blues fly six F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, split into the [[diamond formation|Diamond Formation]] (Blue Angels 1 through 4) and the Lead and Opposing ''Solos'' (Blue Angels 5 and 6). Most of the show alternates between [[Aerobatic maneuver|maneuver]]s performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400&nbsp;mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, barrel rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The fastest speed flown during an air show is 700&nbsp;mph (just under Mach 1) and the slowest speed is 120&nbsp;mph.<ref name="Blueangels.navy.mil"/> Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back. belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the [[Delta Formation]].

The parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the ''high'' show is performed; in overcast conditions a ''low'' show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the ''flat'' show is presented.The ''high'' show requires at least an {{convert|8000|ft|m|-2|sing=on}} [[Flight ceiling|ceiling]] and visibility of at least {{convert|3|nmi|km|0}} from the show's centerpoint. The maximum ceilings allowed for low and flat shows are 3,500 feet (~1&nbsp;km) and {{convert|1500|ft|m|-1}}, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.king5.com/news/local/high-show-low-show-Blue-Angels-100150074.html |title=What determines high show vs. low show for Blue Angels? &#124; KING5.com Seattle |publisher=King5.com |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>

==Origin of squadron name, insignia and paint scheme==

When initially formed, the unit was called the ''Navy Flight Exhibition Team''. The squadron was officially redesignated as the United States Navy Flight Demonstration ''Squadron'' in December 1974.<ref>http://a4skyhawk.org/3e/blues/blues.htm</ref> The original team was christened the ''Blue Angels'' in 1946, when one of the pilots came across the name of New York City's Blue Angel Nightclub in ''[[New Yorker Magazine|The New Yorker]]'' magazine; the team introduced themselves as the "Blue Angels" to the public for the first time on 21 July 1946, in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The official Blue Angels insignia was designed by then team leader Lt. Cmdr. R.E. "Dusty" Rhodes and approved by [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in 1949. It is nearly identical to the current design. In the cloud in the upper right quadrant, the aircraft were originally shown heading down and to the right. Over the years, the plane silhouettes have changed along with the squadron's aircraft. Additionally, the lower left quadrant, which contains the Chief of Naval Air Training insignia, has occasionally contained only [[Naval Aviator]] wings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Originally, demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering. The current shades of blue and yellow were adopted when the team transitioned to the Bearcat in 1946. For a single year in 1949, the team performed in an all-yellow scheme with blue markings.<ref>Campbell, ''War Paint'', p. 171.</ref>

==Current aircraft==
[[File:BlueAngelsFA18.jpg|thumb|[[Prandtl-Glauert singularity|Water condensation]] in the [[Strake (aviation)|strake]] vortices of a Hornet during a tight maneuver.]]

The Blues' F/A-18 Hornets are former fleet aircraft that are nearly combat-ready. Modifications to each aircraft include removal of the aircraft gun and replacement with the tank that contains smoke-oil used in demonstrations, and outfitting with the control stick spring system for more precise aircraft control input.  The standard demonstration configuration has a spring tensioned with {{convert|40|lb}} of force installed on the control stick as to allow the pilot minimal room for uncommanded movement. The Blues do not wear [[G-suit]]s, because the air bladders inside them would repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with the control stick between the pilot's legs. Instead, Blue Angel pilots tense their muscles to prevent blood from rushing from their heads and rendering them unconscious.<ref name="ba_faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/show/faq.aspx |title=Blue Angels Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Blueangels.navy.mil |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>

[[File:C-130 Herculues with JATO.jpg|thumb|left|"Fat Albert" conducting a [[JATO|Jet Assisted Take Off]].]]

The show's narrator flies Blue Angel 7, a two-seat F/A-18B Hornet, to show sites. The Blues use this jet for backup, and to give demonstration rides to VIP civilians. Three backseats each show are available, one of them goes to members of the press, the other two to Key Influencers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyfighterjet.com/jetflights/fly-with-the-blue-angels.html |title=Flights with the Blue Angels |publisher=Flyfighterjet.com |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>  The No.4 slot pilot often flies the No. 7 aircraft in Friday's "practice" shows.

The Blue Angels use a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130T Hercules]], nicknamed "Fat Albert", for their logistics, carrying spare parts, equipment, and to carry support personnel between shows. Beginning in 1975, "Bert" was used for [[JATO|Jet Assisted Take Off]] (JATO) and short aerial demonstrations just prior to the main event at selected venues, but the JATO demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets.<ref name="FA JATO">{{cite news|title=Abort Launch: Air shows to do without Fat Albert’s famed JATO|last=McCullough|first=Amy|date=9 November 2009|work=[[Marine Corps Times]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|page=6|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref> "Fat Albert Airlines" flies with an all-Marine crew of three officers and five enlisted personnel.

[[File:Blue Angels Pilot.jpg|thumb|right|A Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron pilot sits in the cockpit of an [[F/A-18 Hornet]] aircraft]]

All team members, both officer and enlisted, pilots and staff officers, come from the ranks of regular Navy and [[United States Marine Corps]] units. The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC [[Naval Aviator]]s. Pilots serve two to three years,<ref name="Blueangels.navy.mil"/> and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members.

The officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation and flight records.  Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified.  Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.gosportpensacola.com/gosport-03-02-2012.pdf|title=Gosport article, March 02, 2012, "Blue Angels Seek Officer Applicants", page 2|publisher=Gosport NAS Pensacola Base Newspaper}}</ref>

Applicants "rush" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs and post-show activities and social events.  Rushes are asked to tell a joke prior to the brief, and graded by the team as part of the rigorous selection process.  Team members vote in secret on the next year's members, with no accountability to the higher Navy authority why an applicant was or was not selected.  Selections must be unanimous. There have been female and racial minority staff officers as official Blue Angel members, in support of the Blue Angels recruiting for the Navy and Marine Corps.  The most recent minority Blue Angel pilot was LCDR Keith Hoskins on the 2000 team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels-usn.org/blues_pilots2000.html|title=Blue Angels Alumni 2000 |publisher=blueangels-usn.org}}</ref>  Flight surgeons serve a two-year term, and act as the team recorder during air shows, and help oversee emergency response planning with the various air show planners.  The first female Blue Angel flight surgeon was LT Tamara Schnurr, as a member of the 2001 team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueangels-usn.org/blues_pilots2001.html|title=Blue Angels Alumni 2001 |publisher=blueangels-usn.org}}</ref>

The team leader (#1) is the Commanding Officer and is always a Navy Commander, who may be promoted to Captain mid-tour if approved for Captain by the selection board. Pilots of numbers 2–7 are Navy Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders, or Marine Corps Captains or Majors. The number 7 pilot narrates for a year, and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years, respectively. The number 3 pilot moves to the number 4 (slot) position for his second year. Blue Angel No.4 serves as the demonstration safety officer, due largely to the perspective he is afforded from the slot position within the formation, as well as his status as a second-year demonstration pilot. There are a number of other officers in the squadron, including a [[Naval Flight Officer]], the USMC C-130 pilots, a Maintenance Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a Flight Surgeon. Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9, and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron.<ref name="Blueangels.navy.mil"/> After serving with the Blues, members return to fleet assignments.

==Training and weekly routine==

Annual winter training takes place at [[NAF El Centro]], California, where new and returning pilots hone skills learned in the fleet. During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, in order to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in [[Pensacola]], Florida in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting "circle and arrival" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a "practice" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is the Blues' day off.

==History==

===1940s===
[[File:Blue Angels Vinage Insignia.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The original team insignia]]

On 24 April 1946 [[Chief of Naval Operations]] [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Roy Marlin Voris|Roy Marlin "Butch" Voris]], a World War II [[fighter ace]], to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice "Wick" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida [[Everglades]] so that, in Voris' words, "...if anything happened, just the alligators would know." The team's first demonstration before Navy officials took place on 10 May 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.

[[File:F6F-5 Blue Angels NAN10 46.jpg|thumb|[[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]] in 1946]]

On 15 June Voris led a trio of [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats]], specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at their Florida home base, [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]].<ref name=OFFICIAL/> The team employed an [[T-6 Texan|SNJ Texan]], painted and configured to simulate a [[Japanese Zero]], to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the "Beetle Bomb".

The team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by "...keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career." The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]].

[[File:F8F-1 Blue Angels 1946.jpg|thumb|left|In 1947 the Blue Angels introduced the famous "diamond" formation.]]

The team soon became known worldwide for its spectacular aerobatic maneuvers. On 25 August 1946 the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the [[F8F Bearcat|F8F-1 Bearcat]].  In May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke, replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team, he introduced the famous Diamond Formation, now considered the Blue Angels' trademark.

In 1949, the team acquired a Douglas [[C-47|R4D Sky Train]] for logistics to and from show sites. The team's SNJ was also replaced by a F8F-1 "Bearcat", painted yellow for the air combat routine. The Blues transitioned to the straight-wing Grumman [[F9F Panther|F9F-2 Panther]] on 13 July 1949, wherein the F8F-1 "Beetle Bomb" was relegated to solo aerobatics before the main show, until it crashed on takeoff at a training show in Pensacola in 1950.

Team headquarters shifted from [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, to [[Naval Air Station Whiting Field|NAAS Whiting Field]], Florida, in the fall of 1949, announced 14 July 1949.<ref>Fort Walton, Florida, "'''Blue Angels' To Pensacola – Navy Flight Exhibition Team Is Transferred''", Playground News, Thursday 14 July 1949, Volume 4, Number 24, page 2.</ref>

===1950s===
The "Blues" continued to perform nationwide until the start of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, when (due to a shortage of pilots, and no planes were available) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty. Once aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|6}} the group formed the core of [[VF-191|VF-191, Satan's Kittens]].

[[File:F9F-8 Blue Angles1 NAN1-57.jpg|thumb|left|F9F-8 Cougar formation in 1956]]

The Blue Angels were officially recommissioned on 25 October 1951, and reported to [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas. Lt. Cdr. Voris was again tasked with assembling the team (he was the first of only two commanding officers to lead them twice). In 1953 the team traded its Sky Train for a Curtiss [[C-46|R5C Commando]].

The ''Blues'' remained in Corpus Christi until the winter of 1954, when they relocated to their present home at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]]. It was here they progressed to the swept-wing Grumman [[F9F Cougar|F9F-8 Cougar]].

The first [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] pilot, Capt Chuck Hiett, joined the team and they relocated to their current home of [[NAS Pensacola]] in the winter of 1954. In August 1954, "Blues" leader [[Arthur Ray Hawkins|LCDR Ray Hawkins]] became the first naval aviator to survive an ejection at supersonic speeds when his F9F-6 became uncontrollable on a cross-country flight.

[[File:Grumman F11F-1 Tiger Blue Angels.jpg|thumb|Grumman F11F-1 Tiger, 1957–69]]

In Sept 1956, the team added a sixth aircraft to the flight demonstration in the Opposing Solo position, and gave its first performance outside the United States at the International Air Exposition in [[Toronto, Canada]]. It also upgraded its logistics aircraft to the Douglas [[C-54|R5D Skymaster]].

In January 1957, the team left its winter training facility at [[Naval Air Facility El Centro]], California for a ten-year period. For the next ten years, the team would winter at [[NAS Key West]], Florida. For the 1957 show season, the Blue Angels transitioned to the supersonic Grumman [[F11F Tiger|F11F-1 Tiger]], first flying the short-nosed, and then the long-nosed versions. The first Six-Plane Delta Maneuvers were added in the 1958 season.

===1960s===
In July 1964, the Blue Angels participated in the Aeronaves de Mexico Anniversary Air Show over [[Mexico City]], Mexico, before an estimated crowd of 1.5&nbsp;million people.

In 1965, the Blue Angels conducted a [[Caribbean]] island tour, flying at five sites. Later that year, they embarked on a European tour to a dozen sites, including the [[Paris Air Show]], where they were the only team to receive a standing ovation.

[[File:F-4J Phantom II Blue Angels parked.JPG|thumb|McDonnell F-4J Phantom II]]

The ''Blues'' toured Europe again in 1967 touring six sites. In 1968 Skymaster transport aircraft was replaced with a [[Lockheed C-121 Constellation|C-121J Constellation]]. The ''Blues'' transitioned to the two-seat [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4J Phantom II]] in 1969, nearly always keeping the back seat empty for flight demonstrations. The ''Phantom'' was the only plane to be flown by both the "Blues" and the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]]. That year they also upgraded to the Lockheed [[Lockheed Constellation|C-121 Super Constellation]] for logistics.

===1970s===

The ''Blues'' received their first U.S Marine Corps Lockheed [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|KC-130F Hercules]] in 1970. An all-Marine crew manned it. That year, they went on their first South American tour. In 1971, the team conducted its first Far East Tour, performing at a dozen locations in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1972, the Blue Angels were awarded the Navy's [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for the two-year period from 1 March 1970 – 31 December 1971. Another European tour followed in 1973, including air shows in Tehran, Iran, England, France, Spain, Turkey, Greece, and Italy.

[[File:A-4Fs Blue Angels Fleur de Lis 1984.JPEG|thumb|left|All six Blue Angel [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4F Skyhawk]]s executing a "fleur de lis" maneuver.]]

In December 1974 the Navy Flight Demonstration Team downsized to the subsonic [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|Douglas A-4F Skyhawk II]] and was reorganized into the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron. This reorganization permitted the establishment of a commanding officer (the flight leader), added support officers, and further redefined the squadron's mission emphasizing the support of recruiting efforts. Commander Tony Less was the squadron's first official commanding officer.<ref name=Blue_Angels_history>[http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/history_iframe.htm History of the Blue Angels]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}. blueangels.navy.mil.</ref>

===1980s===

On 8 November 1986 the Blue Angels completed their 40th anniversary year during ceremonies unveiling their present aircraft, the McDonnell Douglas [[F/A-18 Hornet]], the first multi-role fighter/attack aircraft. The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow, high [[angle of attack]] "tail sitting" maneuver, and to fly a "dirty" (landing gear down) formation loop, the last of which is not duplicated by the USAF Thunderbirds.

Also in 1986, LCDR [[Donnie Cochran]], joined the Blue Angels as the first [[Black people|African-American]] Naval Aviator to be selected. He would return to lead the team in 1993.
