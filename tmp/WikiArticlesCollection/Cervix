The '''cervix''' (from the Latin ''cervix uteri'', meaning "neck of the womb") is the lower, narrow portion of the [[uterus]] where it joins with the top end of the [[vagina]]. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible with appropriate medical equipment; the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The cervix has an opening to allow sperm and menstrual fluid to move through.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2GZ7N4wOeGYC&pg=PA221&dq=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=--UzT_yKD6Gn0QWg_oSrAg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=&f=false Health and Wellness for Life]</ref>

==Anatomy==
[[File:Cervix.jpg|thumb|The cervix with cervical mucus]]
[[File:Cervix uteri 1.jpg|thumb|The cervical os]]

===Ectocervix===
The portion projecting into the vagina is referred to as the ''[[Vaginal portion of cervix|portio vaginalis]]'' or ectocervix. On average, the ectocervix is 3&nbsp;cm long and 2.5&nbsp;cm wide. It has a convex, elliptical surface and is divided into anterior and posterior lips.

====External os====
{{Main|External orifice of the uterus}}
The ectocervix's opening is called the [[External orifice of the uterus|external os]]. The size and shape of the external os and the ectocervix varies widely with age, hormonal state, and whether the woman has had a vaginal birth. In women who have not had a vaginal birth the external os appears as a small, circular opening. In women who have had a vaginal birth, the ectocervix appears bulkier and the external os appears wider, more slit-like and gaping.

===Endocervical canal===
The passageway between the external os and the uterine cavity is referred to as the [[Canal of the cervix|endocervical canal]]. It varies greatly in length and width, along with the cervix overall. Flattened anterior to posterior, the endocervical canal measures 7 to 8&nbsp;mm at its widest in reproductive-aged women.

===Internal os===
The endocervical canal terminates at the [[Internal orifice of the uterus|internal os]] which is the opening of the cervix inside the uterine cavity.

==Histology==
The [[epithelium]] of the cervix is varied.
The ectocervix (more distal, by the vagina) is composed of nonkeratinized [[stratified squamous epithelium]].
The endocervix (more proximal, within the uterus) is composed of [[simple columnar epithelium]].<ref>{{BUHistology|19404loa}}</ref>

The area adjacent to the border of the endocervix and ectocervix is known as the [[transformation zone]] or squamocolumnar junction.<ref name=":0">Manual of Obstetrics. (3rd ed.). Elsevier 2011. pp. 1-16. ISBN 9788131225561.</ref> The Transformation zone undergoes [[metaplasia]] numerous times during normal life. When the endocervix is exposed to the harsh acidic environment of the vagina it undergoes [[metaplasia]] to squamous epithelium, which is better suited to the vaginal environment. Similarly when the ectocervix enters the less harsh uterine area, it undergoes [[metaplasia]] to become columnar epithelium.

Times in life when this [[metaplasia]] of the transformation zone occurs:
* puberty; when the endocervix everts (moves out) of the uterus
* with the changes of the cervix associated with the normal menstrual cycle
* post-menopause; the uterus shrinks moving the transformation zone upwards

All these changes are normal and the occurrence is said to be [[physiological]].

However, all this metaplasia does increase the risk of cancer in this area - the transformation zone is the most common area for cervical cancer to occur.

At certain times of life, the columnar epithelium is replaced by metaplastic squamous epithelium, and is then known as the transformation zone.

[[Nabothian cyst]]s are often found in the cervix.<ref>Weschler, pp. 227–228.</ref>

==Cervical mucus==
[[File:Gray34.png|thumb|Mucus plug]]

Cervical mucus is 90% water.  Depending on the water content which varies during the menstrual cycle the mucus functions as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. Cervical mucus also contains electrolytes (calcium, sodium and potassium), organic components such as glucose, amino acids and soluble proteins.<ref>{{cite paper |url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/cgi/reprint/60/1/17.pdf |title=Electrolytes in vaginal fluid during the menstrual cycle of coitally active and inactive women |first=G. |last=Wagner |first2=R. J. |last2=Levin }}</ref>

Cervical mucus contains trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, mangenese and selenium, the levels of which vary dependant on cyclical hormone variation during different phases of the menstrual cycle.<ref>Hagenfeldt et al., 1973;{{full|date=November 2012}} Pandey et al., 1986.{{full|date=November 2012}}</ref> Various enzymes have been identified in human cervical mucus.

[[File:cervical mucus1.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Cervical mucus]]

After a [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual period]] ends, the external os is blocked by [[mucus]] that is thick and acidic.  This "infertile" mucus blocks spermatozoa from entering the [[uterus]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ann |last=Westinore |last2=Evelyn |first2=Billings |title=The Billings Method: Controlling Fertility Without Drugs or Devices |publisher=Life Cycle Books |location=Toronto |year=1998 |pages=37 |isbn=0-919225-17-9}}</ref>  For several days around the time of [[ovulation]], "fertile" types of mucus are produced; they have a higher water content, and are less acidic and higher in electrolytes.  These electrolytes cause the 'ferning' pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern.<ref name="w59">Weschler, pp. 58–59.</ref>

Some methods of [[fertility awareness]] such as the [[Creighton Model FertilityCare System|Creighton Model]] and the [[Billings ovulation method|Billings Method]] involve estimating a woman's periods of fertility and infertility by observing changes in her body.  Among these changes are several involving the quality of her cervical mucus: the sensation it causes at the vulva, its elasticity ([[Spinnbarkeit]]), its transparency, and the presence of ''[[Fern test|ferning]]''.<ref name="w59" />

Most methods of [[hormonal contraception]] work primarily by preventing ovulation, but their effectiveness is increased because they prevent the fertile types of cervical mucus from being produced.  Conversely, methods of thinning the mucus may help to achieve pregnancy.  One suggested method is to take [[guaifenesin]] in the few days before ovulation.<ref>Weschler, p. 173.</ref>

During pregnancy, the cervix is blocked by a special antibacterial [[Cervical mucus plug|mucosal plug]], which prevents infection, somewhat similar to its state during the infertile portion of the [[menstrual cycle]].<!-- is it the same, or not? --> The mucus plug comes out as the cervix dilates in labor or shortly before.

==Cervical position==
After menstruation and directly under the influence of [[estrogen]], the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, like the tip of the nose, and is positioned low and closed.  However, as a woman approaches ovulation, the cervix becomes softer, more similar to the lips, and rises and opens in response to the high levels of estrogen present at ovulation.<ref name ="Weschler">Weschler, Toni, MPH, ''Taking Charge of Your Fertility'', Second Edition, 2002, pp. 59, 64.</ref>  These changes, accompanied by the production of fertile types of cervical mucus, support the survival and movement of sperm.

==Function==
* Sphincter: Cervix acts as a sphincter of uterus. During [[menstruation]] the cervix stretches open slightly to allow the [[endometrium]] to be shed. This stretching is believed to be part of the [[cramp]]ing pain that many women experience. Evidence for this is given by the fact that some women's cramps subside or disappear after their first vaginal birth because the cervical opening has widened.  During [[childbirth]], contractions of the uterus will [[cervical dilation|dilate the cervix]] up to 10&nbsp;cm in diameter to allow the child to pass through.

* Sperm upsuck and storage: During [[orgasm]], the cervix convulses and the [[external os]] dilates. Robin Baker and Mark A. Bellis, both at the [[University of Manchester]], first proposed that this behavior would tend to draw [[semen]] in the [[vagina]] into the [[uterus]], increasing the likelihood of [[Conception (biology)|conception]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Singh D, Meyer W, Zambarano RJ, Hurlbert DF |title=Frequency and timing of coital orgasm in women desirous of becoming pregnant |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=15–29 |year=1998 |month=February |pmid=9494687 |doi=10.1023/A:1018653724159}}</ref>  This explanation has been called the "upsuck theory of female orgasm."

==Cervical cancer==

{{Main|Cervical cancer}}

[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV) infection is a necessary factor in the development of nearly all cases of cervical cancer.  [[HPV vaccine]]s can reduce the chance of developing cervical cancer, if administered before initiation of sexual activity.  Potentially pre-cancerous changes in the cervix can be detected by a [[Pap smear]], in which [[epithelium|epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] are scraped from the surface of the cervix and [[cytopathology|examined under a microscope]].  With appropriate treatment of detected abnormalities, cervical cancer can be prevented.  Most women who develop cervical cancer have never had a Pap smear, or have not had one within the last ten years.

Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fifth most deadly cancer in women.<ref name="who fact sheet">{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |month=February |year=2006 |title=Fact sheet No. 297: Cancer |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html |accessdate=2007-12-01}}</ref> It affects about 16 per 100,000 women per year and kills about 9 per 100,000 per year.<ref>{{cite web |title= GLOBOCAN 2002 database: summary table by cancer | url=http://www-dep.iarc.fr/GLOBOCAN/Table1_sel1.htm|accessdate=2008-10-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616085344/http://www-dep.iarc.fr/GLOBOCAN/Table1_sel1.htm  |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}</ref> Pap smear screening has greatly reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality in nations with regular screening programs.

==Blood supply==
Cervix is supplied by descending cervical branch of [[uterine artery]].<ref name=":0" />
==Lymphatic drainage==
The [[Lymphatic system|lymphatic drainage]] of the cervix is along the [[uterine artery|uterine arteries]] and cardinal [[ligament]]s to the parametrial, [[external iliac vein]], [[internal iliac vein]], and [[obturator]] and presacral [[lymph node]]s. From these pelvic lymph nodes, drainage then proceeds to the [[paraaortic lymph node]]s. In some women, the lymphatics drain directly to the paraaortic nodes.

==Nervous supply==
Nerves supplying the cervix pass through uterosacral ligaments.<ref name=":0" />
