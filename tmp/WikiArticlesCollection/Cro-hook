The '''cro-hook''', is a special double-ended [[crochet hook]] used to make double-sided [[crochet]], which is a variation of [[Tunisian crochet]]. Because the hook has two ends, two colors of thread can be used simultaneously and freely interchanged. 

Crafts using a double-ended hook are commercially marketed as Cro-hook and Crochenit.
