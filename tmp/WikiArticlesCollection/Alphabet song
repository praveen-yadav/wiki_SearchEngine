An '''alphabet song''' is any of various songs used to teach children an [[alphabet]], used in [[kindergarten]]s, [[pre-school]]s and homes around the world. Alphabet songs typically follow the [[alphabetic principle]] (though the [[phonics]] method offers variants). In languages such as [[English language|English]] with [[morphophonemic]] variation (e.g. "c'''a'''ke" is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|k}}, not {{IPA|[ˈkaːkɛ]}}), an alphabet song usually chooses a particular [[pronunciation]] for each letter in the alphabet and also typically for some words in the song.

== The A.B.C. (Verse 1) ==
"The A.B.C." {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˌ|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː}} or "A.B.C's" {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˌ|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː|z}} is one of the best-known [[English language]] alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as "the alphabet song", especially in the [[United States]].

The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the [[Boston]]-based music publisher [[Charles Bradlee]], and given the title "The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte". The musical arrangement was attributed to [[Louis Le Maire]] (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was "Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts", according to the Newberry Library,<ref>[http://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First  Newberry Library catalog]</ref> which also says, "The theme is that used by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] for his [[Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman"|piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman]]."<ref>The alphabet song is sometimes said to come from another of Bradlee's publications, "The Schoolmaster", but the first line of that song is given as "Come, come my children, I must see", in [http://orbis.library.yale.edu [[Yale University]]'s library catalog].  It is described as "a favorite glee for three voices, as sung at the Salem glee club."</ref> This tune is the same as the tune for  "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]" and "[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]".

=== Zed for Zee ===
In the [[United States]], [[Z]] is pronounced ''zee''; in most other English-speaking countries it is pronounced ''zed''.  Generally, the absent ''zee''-rhyme is not missed, although some children use a ''zee'' pronunciation in the rhyme which they would not use elsewhere. Variants of the song exist to accommodate the ''zed'' pronunciation.  One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between [[N]] and zed:

:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''q-r-s''
:''t-u-v''
:''w, x''
:''y and z''
:''Now I know my "ABCs",''
:''Next time won't you sing with me."

In UK ([[Nursery Rhymes]]):

:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''q-r-s''
:''t-u-v''
:''w, x''
:''and y and z''
:''Now I know my "ABCs",''
:''Next time won't you sing with me''

Other variants make significantly more changes in order to rhyme with zed, and even alter the rest of the song to fit a new rhythm. For example:
:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-lmnop''
:''lmnop-q-r-s-t''
:''u-v-w, x-y-z''
:''x-y-z''
:''Sugar on your bread''
:''Eat it all up''
:''Before you are dead.''

== Phonics songs ==
Because the English language has 40 sounds and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds (phonemes) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.

== Acrostic songs ==
There are also songs that go through the alphabet, making each letter stand for something in the process. An example was recorded in 1948, by [[Buddy Kaye]], [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], [[Sidney Lippman]], and later [[Perry Como]], called ''[[A, You're Adorable]]'' (also known as "The Alphabet Love Song"):

:''A, you're adorable''
:''B, you're so beautiful''
:''C, you're a cutie full of charms''
:''D, you're a darling''
:''And E, you're exciting''
:''And F, you're a feather in my arms''
:''G, you look good to me''
:''H, you're so heavenly''
:''I, you're the one I idolize''
:''J, we're like Jack and Jill''
:''K, you're so kissable''
:''L, is the love light in your eyes''
:''M, N, O, P''
:''I could go on all day''
:''Q, R, S, T''
:''Alphabetically speaking: "You're OK"''
:''U, made my life complete''
:''V, means you're very sweet''
:''W, X, Y, Z''
:''It's fun to wander through the alphabet with you to tell you what you mean to me''

== Backwards song (Verse 2) ==
The group [[Wee Sing]] released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It is called ZYXs. It goes as follows:

:''Z-Y-X-W-V-and-U--''
:''T-and-S-and-R-and-Q--''
:''P-O-N-M-L-K-J--,''
:''I-H-G-F-EDCBA--'' (EDCBA said like LMNOP in alphabet song)
:''Now I know my CBAs''
:''Next time won't you lead the way''

Another version ends with "Now I know my ZYXs, let's all go and walk to [[Texas]]."

The Canadian children's TV series ''[[The Big Comfy Couch]]'' used a version of the song in the episode "Backwards".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Comedian [[Soupy Sales]] released a song in 1966 called "Backwards Alphabet" which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the opening scene of the 1992 episode of ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'', Martin sings the song in the dark radio station in season 1's "Dead Men Don't Flush".
