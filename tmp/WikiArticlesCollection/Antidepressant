'''Antidepressants''' are drugs used for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] and other conditions, including [[dysthymia]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]], [[neuropathic pain]] and, in some cases, [[dysmenorrhoea]], snoring, [[migraine]]s, [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[substance abuse]] and [[sleep disorder]]s. They can be used alone or in combination with other medications.

The most important classes of antidepressants are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs). Other drugs used or proposed for the treatment of depression include [[buprenorphine]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004714-199502000-00008 |title=Buprenorphine Treatment of Refractory Depression |year=1995 |last1=Bodkin |first1=J.

==Efficacy==
To establish [[efficacy]], an antidepressant must show that it can produce a therapeutic effect for the condition for which it is taken. An antidepressant should be more efficacious than placebo to justify the risk associated with side effects. For depression, the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (HAM-D) is often used to measure the severity of depression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp.23.1.56 |title=A Rating Scale for Depression |year=1960 |last1=Hamilton|first1=M. |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=23 |pages=56–62 |pmid=14399272|pmc=495331|issue=1}}</ref> The maximum score for the 17-item HAM-D questionnaire is 52; the higher the score, the more severe the depression. What constitute a sufficient response to a drug has not been well established, but total remission or virtual elimination of all depression symptoms is the goal, however, remission rates are rarely published. For placebo, the percentage of symptom reduction is approximately 31 to 38%, compared to 46 to 54% for antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0041778 |title=A Systematic Review of Comparative Efficacy of Treatments and Controls for Depression |year=2012 |editor1-last=Holscher |editor1-first=Christian |last1=Khan |first1=Arif|last2=Faucett|first2=James |last3=Lichtenberg |first3=Pesach |last4=Kirsch |first4=Irving |last5=Brown |first5=Walter A. |journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=e41778 |pmid=22860015 |pmc=3408478|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...741778K }}</ref>

On the basis of 234 studies, no clinically relevant superiority of one antidepressant over another was detected for the treatment of acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of depression, taking into account age, sex, ethnicity, or [[comorbidity|comorbid conditions]]. Individual drugs differed in onset of action, adverse events, and some measures of health-related quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Gerald|last1=Gartlehner |first2=Richard A. |last2=Hansen |first3=Laura C.|last3=Morgan |first4=Kylie |last4=Thaler |first5=Linda |last5=Lux|first6=Megan |last6=Van Noord |first7=Ursula|last7=Mager |first8=Patricia |last8=Thieda |first9=Bradley N. |last9=Gaynes |displayauthors=9|title=Comparative Benefits and Harms of Second-Generation Antidepressants for Treating Major Depressive Disorder: An Updated Meta-analysis|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |pmid=22147715 |url=http://www.annals.org/article.aspx?volume=155&page=772|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-155-11-201112060-00009 |year=2011 |volume=155 |issue=11 |pages=772–85}}</ref>

The largest and most expensive study conducted to date, on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for depression, was commissioned by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/trials/practical/stard/index.shtml |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> The study was dubbed "[[STAR*D|The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression]]" (STAR*D) Study.

A 2008 review of [[randomized controlled trial]]s concluded that symptomatic improvement with SSRIs was greatest by the end of the first week of use, but that some improvement continued for at least 6 weeks.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.11.1217 |title=Early Onset of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressant Action: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |year=2006 |last1=Taylor |first1=Matthew J.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1217–23 |pmid=17088502 |last2=Freemantle |first2=N |last3=Geddes |first3=JR|last4=Bhagwagar|first4=Z |pmc=2211759}}</ref>

A 2002 review concluded that there was no evidence that antidepressants reduce the risk of recurrence of depression when their use is terminated. The authors of this review advocated that antidepressants be combined with therapy, and pointed to [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] (IPT) and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1529-1006.00008 |title=Treatment and Prevention of Depression|year=2002|last1=Hollon |first1=S.

===Clinical guidelines===
The UK [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor; that for moderate or severe depression an SSRI is more likely to be tolerated than a tricyclic; and that antidepressants for severe depression should be combined with a psychological treatment such as [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |month=December|year=2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archivedate=15 November 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with [[major depressive disorder]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guidelines.gov/content.aspx?id=24158 |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder|publisher=[[National Guideline Clearinghouse]] |year=2010 |accessdate=20 March 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081028165751/http://www.guidelines.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=2605&nbr=1831 |archivedate=28 October 2008 |deadurl=no}}</ref> indicates that, if preferred by the patient, antidepressant medications may be provided as an initial primary treatment for mild major depressive disorder; antidepressant medications should be provided for moderate to severe major depressive disorder unless [[electroconvulsive therapy]] is planned; and a combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications or electroconvulsive therapy should be used for [[psychotic depression]]. It states that efficacy is generally comparable between classes and within classes and that the initial selection will largely be based on the anticipated side-effects for an individual patient, patient preference, quantity and quality of clinical trial data regarding the medication, and its cost.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Limitations and strategies===
Between 30% and 50% of individuals treated with a given antidepressant do not show a response.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2174/138161206775474422|title=Recent Progress in Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Treatment Options of Major Depression |year=2006 |last1=Baghai |first1=Thomas|last2=Moller |first2=Hans-Jurgen |last3=Rupprecht |first3=Rainer|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=503–15|pmid=16472142}}</ref><ref name="SSRIswitch">{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v67n1203 |title=Switching Antidepressants After a First Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor in Major Depressive Disorder |year=2006 |last1=Ruhé |first1=Henricus G. |last2=Huyser |first2=Jochanan|last3=Swinkels|first3=Jan A. |last4=Schene |first4=Aart H. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=67|issue=12 |pages=1836–55 |pmid=17194261}}</ref> In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full [[remission (medicine)|remission]], one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3–6 times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=12174733 |year=2002|last1=Tranter |first1=R|last2=O'Donovan |first2=C |last3=Chandarana |first3=P |last4=Kennedy |first4=S |title=Prevalence and outcome of partial remission in depression|volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=241–7 |pmc=161658 |journal=Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience}}</ref> In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v59n0602 |title=Loss of Antidepressant Efficacy During Maintenance Therapy |year=1998|last1=Byrne |first1=Sarah E. |last2=Rothschild |first2=Anthony J. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=59|issue=6 |pages=279–88 |pmid=9671339}}</ref> A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10900529 |year=2000 |last1=Mischoulon |first1=D |last2=Nierenberg|first2=AA |last3=Kizilbash |first3=L|last4=Rosenbaum |first4=JF |last5=Fava |first5=M |title=Strategies for managing depression refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: A survey of clinicians |volume=45 |issue=5|pages=476–81 |journal=Canadian journal of psychiatry}}</ref> They include switching medication, augmentation, and combination.

===="Trial and error" switching====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant. The remission rate reported by the STAR*D study was 21% using this method.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.<ref name="SSRIswitch"/> However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant patients responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01458.x |title=No evidence for switching the antidepressant: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of a common therapeutic strategy |year=2010 |last1=Bschor|first1=T. |last2=Baethge|first2=C. |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=174–9|pmid=19703121}}</ref> Thus, the clinical response to the new drug might be a [[placebo effect]] associated with the belief that one is receiving a different medication.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Augmentation and combination====
For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include: [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, [[dopamine agonists]], [[sex steroids]], [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRIs]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsant]]s.<ref name="augment">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x |title=Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression |year=2005 |last1=Debattista|first1=Charles |last2=Lembke |first2=Anna|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=435–40 |pmid=16318821}}</ref>

A combination strategy involves adding an additional antidepressant, usually from a different class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n0805 |title=Combining Antidepressants for Treatment-Resistant Depression |year=2002 |last1=Lam |first1=Raymond W.|last2=Wan |first2=Dante D.

Opponents of switching, augmentation and combination argue that treatment may also propel the illness to a malignant and treatment-unresponsive course with [[wikt:iatrogenic|iatrogenic]] psychiatric-like symptoms and treatment resistance or episode acceleration.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000112883|title=Atypical Antipsychotics: CATIE Study, Drug-Induced Movement Disorder and Resulting Iatrogenic Psychiatric-Like Symptoms, Supersensitivity Rebound Psychosis and Withdrawal Discontinuation Syndromes |year=2008 |last1=Chouinard |first1=Guy |last2=Chouinard |first2=Virginie-Anne|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=69–77 |pmid=18230939}}</ref>

====Long-term use====
The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of [[relapse]]. A recent [[meta-analysis]] of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 |title=Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: A systematic review|year=2003 |last1=Geddes |first1=John R |last2=Carney |first2=Stuart M |last3=Davies |first3=Christina|last4=Furukawa|first4=Toshiaki A |last5=Kupfer |first5=David J |last6=Frank |first6=Ellen |last7=Goodwin |first7=Guy M |journal=The Lancet|volume=361 |issue=9358 |pages=653–61 |pmid=12606176}}</ref>

In a five-year follow up, relapse rates was 23% greater for users greater than one year, but not different for 6 or 12 months users.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e31819302b1 |title=Does the Length of the First Antidepressant Treatment Episode Influence Risk and Time to a Second Episode? |year=2009 |last1=Gardarsdottir |first1=Helga |last2=Van Geffen |first2=Erica C.G. |last3=Stolker |first3=Joost J. |last4=Egberts|first4=Toine C.G. |last5=Heerdink |first5=Eibert R. |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=29 |pages=69–72 |pmid=19142111|issue=1}}</ref> In addition, gradual loss of therapeutic benefit occurs during the course of treatment.<ref name = fava/> A strategy involving the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of the acute episode, followed by psychotherapy in its residual phase, has been suggested by some studies.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1586/14737175.6.11.1735 |title=Treatment of recurrent depression|year=2006 |last1=Fava |first1=Giovanni A|last2=Park |first2=Seung K |last3=Sonino |first3=Nicoletta |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1735–40|pmid=17144786}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1359786806064314 |title=Enhancing the efficacy of antidepressants with psychotherapy|year=2006|last1=Petersen |first1=T.

====Antidepressant-induced mania====
Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with [[bipolar disorder]]. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20-40% of bipolar patients.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x|title=Antidepressant-induced mania: An overview of current controversies |year=2003 |last1=Goldberg|first1=Joseph F|last2=Truman |first2=Christine J |journal=Bipolar Disorders |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=407–20 |pmid=14636364}}</ref>

===Mild depression===
{{medref|section|date=November 2013}}

Various researchers have contested the ability of antidepressants to relieve depression, skeptical that the drugs aid patients significantly more than [[placebo]].

A review of antidepressant trials submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] by the industry for drug approval revealed that when a trial was successful, the results of the trial was published 94% of the time, however, when the trial was not found to be more effective than placebo, it was only published 50% of the time. This demonstrated a measure of bias in reporting by industry. Combined, 51% of all studies showed efficacy.<ref name="Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R 2008 252–60">{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMsa065779|title=Selective Publication of Antidepressant Trials and Its Influence on Apparent Efficacy |year=2008 |last1=Turner |first1=Erick H.|last2=Matthews|first2=Annette M. |last3=Linardatos |first3=Eftihia |last4=Tell |first4=Robert A. |last5=Rosenthal|first5=Robert|journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=358 |issue=3 |pages=252–60 |pmid=18199864}}</ref> The difference in effect between [[active placebo]]s and several antidepressants appeared small and strongly affected by [[publication bias]].<ref name="Turner EH, Matthews AM, Linardatos E, Tell RA, Rosenthal R 2008 252–60"/>

Controversy regarding the efficacy of antidepressants has arisen due to studies showing that antidepressants fail to provide significantly greater efficacy than placebo in some studies. A 2002 study claimed that the difference between antidepressants and placebo is close to negligible.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|year=2002 |last1=Kirsch |first1=Irving |last2=Moore |first2=Thomas J. |last3=Scoboria|first3=Alan|last4=Nicholls|first4=Sarah S. |journal=Prevention & Treatment |volume=5}}</ref><!--

Through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, two psychologists obtained 47 studies used by the FDA for approval of the six antidepressants prescribed most widely between 1987-99. Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, "but not meaningful for people in clinical settings", says psychologist [[Irving Kirsch]], lead author of the study. He and co-author Thomas Moore released their findings in "Prevention and Treatment", an e-journal of the American Psychological Association.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-07-08-antidepressants.htm |title= Study: Antidepressant barely better than placebo |work=USA Today |date=2002-07-07 |accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref>

A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.287.14.1840 |title=Placebo Response in Studies of Major Depression: Variable, Substantial, and Growing|year=2002|last1=Walsh |first1=B.

Another study by psychologists at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Vanderbilt University]], the University of Colorado, and the [[University of New Mexico]] also found that antidepressant drugs hardly have better effects than a placebo in those cases of mild or moderate depression. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study focused on [[paroxetine]] (Paxil) from GlaxoSmithKline and imipramine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/05/antidepressant-paxil-placebo-business-healthcare-depression.html| title=Study Undermines Case for Antidepressants|date=2010-01-05|accessdate= 2010-07-01|work=Forbes|first=Robert|last=Langreth|archiveurl=http://archive.is/1jmU|archivedate=2012-12-08}}</ref>

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] recently performed a systematic review of clinical trials of the generic antidepressant [[amitriptyline]]. The study concluded that in spite of moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2|title=Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2012 |last1=Leucht |first1=Claudia |last2=Huhn |first2=Maximilian|last3=Leucht|first3=Stefan |editor1-last=Leucht|editor1-first=Claudia |pmid=23235671 |volume=12 |pages=CD009138}}</ref>

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Clinical Excellence]] concluded that there there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with this review suggest that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Depression in Adults (update)|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf|publisher=www.nice.org.uk |format=PDF|work=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health

In 2005, antidepressants became the most prescribed drug in the United States, causing more debate over the issue. Some doctors believe this is a positive sign that people are finally seeking help for their issues. Others disagree, saying that this shows that people are becoming too dependent on antidepressants.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/09/antidepressants/index.html |title=CDC: Antidepressants most prescribed drugs in U.S  |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2011-05-21 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

In 2012, Aimee Hunter and her team used [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and showed that taking placebo decreased pre-frontal brain activity in those subjects who had prior use of an antidepressants, similar to the expected antidepressant response, but increased brain activity in antidepressant-naive subjects. She attributes this antidepressant response of placebo, in repeat users, to a memory effect.<ref name="ANI">{{cite news |agency=ANI |title='Remembering' prior antidepressant use affects the brain's response to new drugs |publisher=Yahoo! India News |date=27 March 2012|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/remembering-prior-antidepressant-affects-brains-response-drugs-043127500.html}}</ref>

However, the later experiment conducted by John H. Krystal at Yale University School of Medicine to assess whether growth mixture modeling can provide insights into antidepressant and placebo responses in clinical trials of patients with major depression showed that Duloxetine and SSRI did not differ in efficacy, and compared with placebo they significantly decreased the odds of following the nonresponder trajectory. Antidepressant responders had significantly better [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (HAM-D) scores over time than placebo-treated patients, but antidepressant nonresponders had significantly worse HAM-D scores over time than the placebo-treated patients.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.132 |title=Trajectories of Depression Severity in Clinical Trials of Duloxetine: Insights into Antidepressant and Placebo Responses |year=2011 |last1=Gueorguieva |first1=Ralitza|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=12|pages=1227–37 |pmid=22147842 |last2=Mallinckrodt |first2=C|last3=Krystal|first3=JH |pmc=3339151}}</ref>

Almost any medication involved with serotonin regulation has the potential to cause [[serotonin syndrome|serotonin toxicity]] (also known as''serotonin syndrome''){{spaced ndash}} an excess of serotonin that can induce mania, restlessness, agitation, [[emotional lability]], insomnia and confusion as its primary symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |title=At the Bedside: Serotonin syndrome: a brief review|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC155963/ |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |year=2003 |volume=168 |issue=11|pages=1439–1442 |accessdate=29 November 2013 |author=Birmes, P; Coppin, D; Schmitt, L; Lauque, D |pmc=155963}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Current Concepts: The Serotonin Syndrome |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |year=2005 |volume=352 |issue=11|pages=1112–1120|doi=10.1056/NEJMra041867 |pmid=15784664 |url=http://toxicology.ucsd.edu/art%203%20serotonin%20syndrome.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2013 |author=Boyer, EW; Shannon, M |format=PDF}}</ref> Although the condition is serious, it is not particularly common, generally only appearing at high doses or while on other medications.

[[MAOIs]] tend to have pronounced (sometimes fatal) interactions with a wide variety of medications and [[over-the-counter drug]]s. If taken with foods that contain very high levels of [[tyramine]] (e.g., mature cheese, cured meats, or yeast extracts), they may cause a potentially lethal [[hypertensive crisis]].

Although these reactions may be lethal, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns is comparable to over-the-counter medications.-->

In response to these adverse effects, a different type of MAOI has been developed: the [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage is that they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.<ref name="pmid7717091">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb05920.x|title=Clinical efficacy of reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase a in major depression |year=1995 |last1=Paykel|first1=E.

===Pregnancy===
{{tone|section|date=November 2013}}

Pregnancy can trigger a range of emotions that make it more difficult to cope with depression. The risk of medication discontinuation and relapse have to be weighed against the risk to the developing fetus and baby. Some antidepressants have lower risk for the baby during pregnancy, but the FDA advises for the risk of birth defects with the use of Paxil<ref>{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |title=FDA Advising of Risk of Birth Defects with Paxil|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2005/ucm108527.htm |accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> and the MAOI should be avoided. A [[neonate]] (infant less than 28 days old) may experience a withdrawal syndrome from abrupt discontinuation of the antidepressant at birth. The use of antidepressants during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion,<ref name="autogenerated1031">{{cite journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.091208 |title=Use of antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion |year=2010 |last1=Nakhai-Pour |first1=H.

Moreover, SSRIs inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, which leads to [[vasoconstriction]]. This is significant in pregnancy as SSRIs have been associated with the development of [[hypertension]] (high blood pressure) and [[pre-eclampsia]] of pregnancy. This in turn can lead to fetal prematurity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sivagnanam |first=G.|title=Antidepressants |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|year=2012 |volume=3 |issue=3|pages=287–8 |url=http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2012/3/3/287/99452}}</ref>
A 2006 industry based publication in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') found that discontinuing antidepressive medication during pregnancy led to more frequent relapse.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.295.5.499 |title=Relapse of Major Depression During Pregnancy in Women Who Maintain or Discontinue Antidepressant Treatment |year=2006 |last1=Cohen |first1=L.

===Suicide===
{{main|Antidepressants and suicide risk}}
The relationship between antidepressant use and suicide risk is uncertain, complicated, and the target of medical research. Some studies have shown that the use of some antidepressants correlate with an increased risk of suicide in some patients and especially youth.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/14651858.CD008324.pub2}}</ref> This problem has been serious enough to warrant government interventions in some places to label greater likelihood of suicide as a risk of using antidepressants.<ref>{{cite doi| 10.1056/NEJMp078015}}</ref> The circumstances under which this can happen are not clear, and other studies show that antidepressants treat [[suicidal ideation]].

===Psychosis===
Commonly prescribed antidepressants have been reported to induce [[psychosis]]. Data trends suggest a correlation between induced psychosis and people with family histories of [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] or [[psychotic disorder]].

A 2001 Yale study found that over a 14 month period, among patients on [[SSRI]] antidepressants, forty-three (8.1%) of 533 patients were found to have been admitted to a psychiatric facility owing to antidepressant-associated mania or psychosis.<ref name="YaleAntidepressantPsychosis">{{cite journal |author=Bowers MB et al |title=Antidepressant-associated mania and psychosis resulting in psychiatric admissions |journal=J Clinical Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=30–3 |year=2001|month=Jan |pmid=21130229 |postscript=. |doi=10.1016/j.encep.2010.01.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Fortunati F, Mazure C, Preda A, Wahl R, Bowers M Jr | year = 2002 | title = Plasma catecholamine metabolites in antidepressant-exacerbated mania and psychosis | url =http://uci.academia.edu/AdrianPreda/Papers/264409/Plasma_Catecholamine_Metabolites_In_Antidepressant-Exacerbated_Mania_and_Psychosis | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 331–334 }}</ref>

[[Bupropion]], a dual reuptake inhibitor (of norepinephrine and dopamine), often causes a moderate increase in sexual drive, due to increased dopamine activity. This effect is also seen with dopamine reuptake inhibitors, CNS stimulants and dopamine agonists, and is due to increases in testosterone production (due to inhibition of prolactin) and nitric oxide synthesis.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===REM Sleep===
All major antidepressant drugs{{spaced ndash}} except [[trimipramine]], [[mirtazapine]] and [[nefazodone]]{{spaced ndash}} suppress [[REM sleep]], and it has been proposed that the clinical efficacy of these drugs largely derives from their suppressant effects on REM sleep. The three major classes of antidepressant drugs (MAOIs, TCAs, and SSRIs), profoundly suppress REM sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00004003 |title=The case against memory consolidation in REM sleep |year=2000 |last1=Vertes|first1=Robert P. |last2=Eastman |first2=Kathleen E. |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=23 |issue=6|pages=867–76; discussion 904–1121 |pmid=11515146}}</ref> Mirtazapine either has no effect on REM sleep or increases it slightly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmaclub.com/news/content.nsf/MedicalNews/6B507D111151964A85256AA20069C3BA?OpenDocument&id= |title=Mirtazapine Regulates Stress Hormones, Improves Sleep In Depressed Patients: Presented at ISP}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref> The MAOIs almost completely suppress REM sleep, while the TCAs and SSRIs have been shown to produce immediate (40-85%) and sustained (30-50%) reductions in REM sleep. This effect often causes increased fatigue in patients who take large doses of antidepressants for extended periods of time. Such fatigue can occasionally interfere with a patient's everyday activities. Abrupt discontinuation of MAOIs can cause a temporary phenomenon known as "[[REM rebound]]" in which the patient experiences extremely vivid dreams and nightmares.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Changes in weight===
Changes in appetite or weight are common among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and are related to which neurotransmitters they affect. [[Mirtazapine]] and [[paroxetine]], for example, have the effect of weight gain and/or increased appetite,<ref name="Stimmel">{{cite journal|pmid=9017762 |year=1997 |last1=Stimmel |first1=GL |last2=Dopheide|first2=JA |last3=Stahl |first3=SM |title=Mirtazapine: An antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic effects |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=10–21 |journal=Pharmacotherapy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=mirtazapine (Rx) - Remeron, Remeron SolTab|work=Medscape|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=19 November 2013|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/remeron-soltab-mirtazapine-342966}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1032">{{cite journal|author=Papakostas GI |title=Tolerability of modern antidepressants |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=Suppl E1 |pages=8–13 |year=2008|pmid=18494538 }}</ref> while others (such as [[buproprion]] and [[venlafaxine]]) achieve the opposite effect.<ref name="Buproprion weight">{{cite journal | author = Li Z, Maglione M, Tu W, Mojica W, Arterburn D, Shugarman LR, Hilton L, Suttorp M, Solomon V, Shekelle PG, Morton SC | title = Meta-analysis: pharmacologic treatment of obesity | journal = Ann.

The [[antihistamine|antihistaminic]] properties of certain TCA- and TeCA-class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side-effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication.

===Withdrawal symptoms===
{{Main|SSRI discontinuation syndrome}}

If an SSRI is suddenly discontinued, it frequently produces an event of "[[SSRI discontinuation syndrome]]" that has a both a bodily and psychological [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] component.<ref name="TamamLut">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02850015 |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor discontinuation syndrome: A review |year=2002|last1=Tamam |first1=Lut |last2=Ozpoyraz |first2=Nurgul |journal=Advances in Therapy |volume=19 |pages=17–26|pmid=12008858 |issue=1}}</ref>

Withdrawal syndromes have been reported with TCAs,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14459296 |year=1961 |last1=Kramer |first1=JC|last2=Klein |first2=DF|last3=Fink |first3=M |title=Withdrawal symptoms following{{notatypo|dicontinuation}} of imipramine therapy|volume=118 |pages=549–50 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref> MOAIs,<ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad" /> SNRIs,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Parker G, Blennerhassett J|title=Withdrawal reactions associated with venlafaxine|journal=Aust N Z J Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=291–4 |year=1998 |pmid=9588310|doi=10.3109/00048679809062742}}</ref> and with SSRIs.

When treatment is prolonged over 6–9 months, processes oppose the initial effects of antidepressant drugs (loss of clinical effects). When drug treatment ends, these processes may be unopposed and yield withdrawal symptoms and increased vulnerability to relapse. Such processes are not necessarily reversible. The more antidepressants are switched or potentiated, the more likely oppositional tolerance can take place.<ref name =fava>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.07.026 |title=The mechanisms of tolerance in antidepressant action |year=2011|last1=Fava|first1=Giovanni A. |last2=Offidani |first2=Emanuela |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=35|issue=7 |pages=1593–602 |pmid=20728491}}</ref>

Some of the withdrawal symptoms of SSRI discontinuation include: Anger, anxiety, panic, depression, [[depersonalization]] (a sense of not being oneself), detachment (a sense of not being part of reality), confusion, decreased concentration, memory problems, bouts of crying, hallucinations, mania, [[delirium]] (severe confusion and disorientation), headache, sweating, [[convulsion]] (seizure), [[myalgia]], lethargy, fatigue, sleep disturbances, nightmares, gastrointestinal problems, balance problems, visual disturbances, electric shock sensations,<ref name="JClinPsy2004-Baboolal"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1592/phco.23.5.678.32198 |title=Shock-Like Sensations During Venlafaxine Withdrawal|year=2003|last1=Reeves |first1=Roy R. |last2=Mack |first2=James E. |last3=Beddingfield |first3=John J. |journal=Pharmacotherapy|volume=23|issue=5 |pages=678–81 |pmid=12741444}}</ref> numbness, [[parasthesia]], restless legs, tingling, [[tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears), tremors, shaking, [[parkinsonism]], aggression, and [[catatonia]] (paralysis-like stupor).{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Moreover, when changes in antidepressant dosage occur, whether up or down, a doubling of the risk of suicide is seen.<ref name="Valuck 2009 1069–1077">{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.08m04943 |title=Antidepressant Discontinuation and Risk of Suicide Attempt |year=2009 |last1=Valuck|first1=Robert J. |last2=Orton |first2=Heather D. |last3=Libby |first3=Anne M.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=70 |issue=8|pages=1069–77 |pmid=19758520}}</ref>

==Pharmacology==
{{Main|Pharmacology of antidepressants}}
The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the [[monoamine hypothesis]] (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (namely [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]).<ref name = GG/> It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on [[monoamine oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters.<ref name = GG/> All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of [[agomelatine]] which acts on a dual [[Melatonin|melatonergic]]-[[Serotonin|serotonergic]] pathway.<ref name = GG/> Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (>40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants.<ref name = Infl>{{cite pmid|19085093}}</ref><ref name = glut>{{cite pmid|21827775}}</ref> Further evidence to the contrary of the monoamine hypothesis are the recent findings that a single intravenous infusion with [[ketamine]], an antagonist of the [[NMDA receptor]] — a type of [[glutamate]] receptor — produces rapid (within 2 hours), robust and sustained (lasting for up to a fortnight) antidepressant effects.<ref name = glut/> To overcome these flaws with the monoamine hypothesis a number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]], cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.<ref name = Infl/><ref name = glut/><ref name = Epig>{{cite pmid|22681167}}</ref><ref name = Epig2>{{cite pmid|23020296}}</ref>

==Types==
{{See also|List of antidepressants}}

==Adjuncts==

Adjunct medications are an umbrella term used to describe substances that increase the potency or "enhance" antidepressants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&alt=sh#v1028590 |work=Merck Manual |title=Depressive Disorders |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref> They work by affecting variables very close to the antidepressant, sometimes affecting a completely different [[mechanism of action]]. This is may be attempted when depression treatments have not been successful in the past.

Types of adjunct medication techniques generally fall into the following categories:
*Two or more antidepressants taken together
**From the same class (affecting the same area of the brain, often at a much higher level)
**From different classes (affecting multiple parts of the brain not covered simultaneously by either drug alone)
*A [[psychostimulant|stimulant]] with an antidepressant (e.g., amphetamine and fluoxetine){{spaced ndash}} the idea being to release the needed neurotransmitter with the stimulant and "capture" it with the antidepressant
*An [[antipsychotic]], particularly [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, for reasons not clearly understood

A review article published in 2007 found psychostimulants may be effective in treatment-resistant depression with concomitant antidepressant therapy. A more certain conclusion could not be drawn due to substantial deficiencies in the studies available for consideration, and the somewhat contradictory nature of their results.<!--

commented out 19 November 2013

However, the authors claim psychostimulants are likely to have a higher level of clinical effectiveness under circumstances in which the patient will probably die soon, so rapid relief is of great importance. In this situation, the patient is likely to die before dependence on, or tolerance of, the medication interferes with their care.

Chronic nicotine intake via nicotine patches results in an increased response to standard antidepressants. Similarly [[varenicline]] has been shown to augment sub-therapeutic doses of SSRIs to produce an antidepressant effect.<ref name="pmid20965579"/>

[[Atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[aripiprazole]] (Abilify), [[quetiapine]] (Seroquel), [[olanzapine]], and [[risperidone]] are also popular adjuncts and appear to be an effective adjunctive treatment option in this indication.<ref name = Maudsley>{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=D|last2=Carol|first2=P|last3=Shitij|first3=K|title=The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=West Sussex|isbn=9780470979693}}</ref> [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] may also be used as an adjunct in [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name = Maudsley /><ref>{{cite book|title=Australian Medicines Handbook 2013|year=2013|publisher=Australian Medicines Handbook Pty Ltd|location=Adelaide|isbn=9780980579093}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=M|last2=Dopfmer|first2=S|title=Lithium augmentation in treatment-resistant depression: meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies.|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology|date=October 1999|year=1999|volume=19|issue=5|pages=427–434|pmid=10505584}}</ref> [[Triiodothyronine]] (T<sub>3</sub>) has also been successfully used as an adjunct in [[major depressive disorder]].<ref name = Maudsley /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Aronson|first=R|coauthors=Offman, HJ; Joffe, RT; Naylor, CD|title=Triiodothyronine augmentation in the treatment of refractory depression.

===Nicotine===
[[Nicotine]] is believed to act as an antidepressant,<ref name="pmid19293201">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1753465809102662 |title=Smoking and depression: Is smoking cessation effective? |year=2009 |last1=Ischaki |first1=E. |last2=Gratziou |first2=C. |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease |volume=3 |pages=31–8 |pmid=19293201 |issue=1}}</ref> by stimulating the release of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]]; in addition, nicotine is believed to exert an antidepressant effect due to the desensitisation of nicotinic receptors, which occurs as a result of tolerance.<ref name="pmid18834313">{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094742 |title=Pharmacology of Nicotine: Addiction, Smoking-Induced Disease, and Therapeutics |year=2009 |last1=Benowitz |first1=Neal L. |journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology |volume=49 |pages=57–71 |pmid=18834313 |pmc=2946180}}</ref> Clinical trials have demonstrated nicotine (administered using a dermal [[nicotine patch]]) exerts an antidepressant effect in both depressed nonsmokers and smokers, and can be considered for [[treatment-resistant depression]].

===Caffeine===
Individuals using [[caffeine]] at moderate doses (fewer than 6 cups of coffee per day), have a reduced incidence of depressive symptoms and an overall reduced risk of [[suicide]]. Anxiety is an important side-effect of caffeine that occurs more commonly in individuals suffering from [[panic disorder]] or [[social phobia]] or when taken in excessive amounts.<ref name="pmid20164571">{{cite journal |doi=10.3233/JAD-2010-1378 |doi_brokendate=19 March 2013 |first1=Diogo R. |last1=Lara |title=Caffeine, Mental Health, and Psychiatric Disorders |journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease |pmid=20164571 |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&issn=1387-2877&volume=20%20Suppl%201&issue=&spage=S239 |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S239–48}}</ref>

===Ketamine===

===Nutrition===

[[Omega-3 fatty acids]] have been proposed as a treatment for depression, alone or in combination with other treatments. One small pilot study of childhood depression (ages 6–12) suggested omega 3 fatty acids may have therapeutic benefits for treating childhood depression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.6.1098 |title=Omega-3 Treatment of Childhood Depression: A Controlled, Double-Blind Pilot Study |year=2006 |last1=Nemets |first1=H. |last2=Nemets |first2=B. |last3=Apter |first3=A. |last4=Bracha |first4=Z. |last5=Belmaker |first5=R.H. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=6 |pages=1098–100 |pmid=16741212}}</ref> A 2005 review article that included [[double-blind studies]], [[randomized control trials]], and epidemiological studies linking omega-3 fatty acids consumption and depression found that low fish consumption (the primary source of omega-3 fatty acids) correlated to increased rates of depression. Additionally, case-control and cohort studies of unipolar and [[postpartum depression]] indicated low blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in depressed patients.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2005.11.005 |title=Ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: A review of the evidence and a methodological critique |year=2006 |last1=Sontrop |first1=Jessica |last2=Campbell |first2=M.

==History==
[[Image:Saint johns wart flowers.jpg|thumb|[[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]]]]

Before the 1950s, opioids and [[amphetamine]]s were commonly used as antidepressants. Their use was later restricted due to their addictive nature and side effects.<ref name="Weber 1988 255–66">{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00004850-198807000-00007 |title=Current and Historical Concepts of Opiate Treatment in Psychiatric Disorders |year=1988 |last1=Weber|first1=Matthias M |last2=Emrich |first2=Hinderk M |journal=International Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=3 |issue=3|pages=255–66 |pmid=3153713}}</ref> Extracts from the herb [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]]had been used as a "nerve tonic" to alleviate depression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pauz.200390062 |title=Kulturgeschichte und Mystik des Johanniskrauts: Vom 2500 Jahre alten Apotropaikum zum aktuellen Antidepressivum |year=2003 |last1=Czygan|first1=Franz-C. |journal=Pharmazie in unserer Zeit |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=184–90 |pmid=12784538 |trans_title=From a 2500 year old apotropic comes a current antidepressive.

===Isoniazid, iproniazid, and imipramine===
In 1951, [[Irving Selikoff]] and Edward Robitzek, working out of Sea View Hospital on [[Staten Island]], began clinical trials on two new[[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted "a subtle general stimulation ... the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems."<ref name="pmid14906149">{{cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.21.4.385 |title=Tuberculosis Chemotherapy with Hydrazine Derivatives of Isonicotinic Acid |year=1952|last1=Selikoff|first1=Irving J. |journal=CHEST Journal |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=385–438 |pmid=14906149 |last2=Robitzek|first2=EH}}</ref> The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press.

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to describe its action.<ref name="isbn0-88048-397-0">{{cite book|last=Healy |first=D |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=MM |title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC |accessdate=2009-05-28 |year=2001 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-0-88048-397-1 |pages=10–1 |chapter=The Antidepressant Drama |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}</ref> A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital.

The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of [[diamine oxidase]], coupled with a weak inhibition of [[monoamine oxidase A]].<ref name="isbn1-86036-010-6">{{Cite book |last=Healy |first=David|title=The Psychopharmacologists: Volume 2 |publisher=A Hodder Arnold Publication |year=1998 |pages=132–4 |isbn=978-1-86036-010-7}}</ref>

Selikoff and Robitzek also experimented with another anti-tuberculosis drug, [[iproniazid]]; it showed a greater psychostimulant effect, but more pronounced toxicity.<ref name="pmid12998444">{{cite journal |doi=10.1378/chest.23.1.1|title=Isoniazid and Its Isopropyl Derivative in the Therapy of Tuberculosis in Humans: Comparative Therapeutic and Toxicologic Properties |year=1953 |last1=Robitzek |first1=Edward H. |journal=CHEST Journal|volume=23 |pages=1–15|pmid=12998444 |last2=Selikoff |first2=IJ |last3=Mamlok |first3=E |last4=Tendlau |first4=A |issue=1}}</ref> Later, Jackson Smith, Gordon Kamman, George Crane, and [[Frank Ayd]], described the psychiatric applications of iproniazid.

The antidepressant effect of a [[tricyclic]], a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. [[Antihistamine]] derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as [[neuroleptics]]. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as [[sedatives]] and[[antipsychotics]].{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn{{spaced ndash}} in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[Pharmaceutical Company]]{{spaced ndash}} discovered the compound "G 22355", later renamed [[imipramine]]. Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and [[motor retardation]]. Kuhn described his new compound as a "thymoleptic" "taking hold of the emotions," in contrast with neuroleptics, "taking hold of the nerves" in 1955-56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=13583250 |year=1958 |last1=Kuhn |first1=R |title=The treatment of depressive states with G 22355 (imipramine hydrochloride) |volume=115 |issue=5 |pages=459–64 |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry}}</ref>

===Second generation antidepressants===
{{Main|Second-generation antidepressants}}

Antidepressants became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers,<ref>{{cite web|title=Tranquilizers|url=http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm|work=Cumberland Moutain Community Services|publisher=www.cmcsb.com|accessdate=20 November 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120916074410/http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm|archivedate=16 September 2012}}{{MEDRS|date=March 2013}}</ref> which were being marketed for different uses.<ref name="3faces">{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00005053-199903000-00007 |title=The Three Faces of the Antidepressants: A Critical Commentary on the Clinical-Economic Context of Diagnosis |year=1999 |last1=Healy |first1=David |journal=The Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease |volume=187 |issue=3 |pages=174–80|pmid=10086474}}</ref> Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced.

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect [[serotonin]] as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was [[zimelidine]] in 1971, while the first released clinically was [[indalpine]]. [[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI.

Surveys indicate that antidepressant use, particularly of SSRIs, has increased rapidly in most developed countries, driven by an increased awareness of depression together with the availability and commercial promotion of new antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11149300 |year=2000 |last1=McManus |first1=Peter |last2=Mant |first2=Andrea |last3=Mitchell |first3=Philip B |last4=Montgomery |first4=William S |last5=Marley |first5=John |last6=Auland |first6=Merran E |title=Recent trends in the use of antidepressant drugs in Australia, 1990-1998 |volume=173 |issue=9 |pages=458–61 |journal=The Medical journal of Australia |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/173_09_061100/mcmanus/mcmanus.html}}</ref> Antidepressants are also increasingly used worldwide for non-depressive patients as studies continue to show the potential of immunomodulatory, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in antidepressants.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The choice of a particular antidepressant is reported to be based, in the absence of research evidence of differences in efficacy, on seeking to avoid certain side-effects, and taking into account comorbid (co-occurring) psychiatric disorders, specific clinical symptoms and prior treatment history.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.161.7.1285 |title=Which Factors Influence Psychiatrists' Selection of Antidepressants? |year=2004 |last1=Zimmerman |first1=M. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=7 |pages=1285–9 |pmid=15229063 |last2=Posternak |first2=M |last3=Friedman |first3=M |last4=Attiullah |first4=N |last5=Baymiller |first5=S |last6=Boland |first6=R |last7=Berlowitz |first7=S |last8=Rahman |first8=S |last9=Uy |first9=K |displayauthors=9}}</ref>

It is also reported that, despite equivocal evidence of a significant difference in efficacy between older and newer antidepressants, clinicians perceive the newer drugs, including SSRIs and SNRIs, to be more effective than the older drugs (tricyclics and MAOIs).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0278-5846(01)00250-0 |title=A survey of prescribing practices in the treatment of depression |year=2002 |last1=Petersen |first1=Timothy |last2=Dording |first2=Christina |last3=Neault |first3=Nicole B |last4=Kornbluh |first4=Rebecca |last5=Alpert |first5=Jonathan E |last6=Nierenberg |first6=Andrew A |last7=Rosenbaum |first7=Jerrold F |last8=Fava |first8=Maurizio |journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry |volume=26 |pages=177–87 |pmid=11853110 |issue=1}}</ref> Currently, the most commonly prescribed antidepressants are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), even though a Cochrane systematic review found no major difference in efficacy between SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants.<ref name=CD002791.>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002791 |title=Treatment discontinuation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2000 |last1=Barbui |first1=C |last2=Hotopf |first2=M |last3=Freemantle |first3=N |last4=Boynton |first4=J |last5=Churchill |first5=R |last6=Eccles |first6=MP |last7=Geddes |first7=JR |last8=Hardy |first8=R |last9=Lewis |first9=G |displayauthors=9 |editor1-last=Barbui |editor1-first=Corrado |pmid=17636706 |issue=3 |pages=CD002791}}{{MEDRS|withdrawn|date=March 2013}}</ref> A survey in the UK found that male general physicians were more likely to prescribe antidepressants than female doctors.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Male GPs depression pills 'bias' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4704053.stm|date=21 July 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref>

The number of antidepressants prescribed by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in the UK almost doubled during one decade, authorities reported in 2010. Furthermore the number increased sharply in 2009 when 39.1 million [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]] were issued, compared to 20.1 million issued in 1999. Also, physicians issued 3.18 million more prescriptions in 2009 than in 2008. Health authorities believed the increase was partly linked to the [[recession]]. However, other reasons include a diagnosis improvement, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] on mental ill-health, and more distress caused by the economic crisis. Furthermore, physicians' concern is that some people who exhibit milder symptoms of depression are being prescribed drugs unnecessarily due to the lack of other options including talk therapies, [[counseling]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]. One more factor that may be increasing the consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[post traumatic stress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession| title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry|date=2010-06-11|accessdate= 2010-07-01 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rowenna | last=Davis| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100615165456/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession?| archivedate= 15 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The use of antidepressants in the US doubled over one decade, from 1996 to 2005. Antidepressant drugs were prescribed to 13 million in 1996 and to 27 million people by 2005. In 2008, more than 164 million prescriptions were written. During this period, patients were less likely to undergo [[psychotherapy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5725E720090804| title=Antidepressant Use Doubles in U.S., Study Finds|date=2009-08-04|accessdate= 2010-07-01 | work=Reuters| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100703003724/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5725E720090804| archivedate= 3 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

MAOIs can be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants, although they generally are used less frequently because they have a higher incidence of dangerous side effects and interactions.

* Ely Lilly In one of the only three cases to ever go to trial for SSRI indication in suicide, [[Eli Lilly and Company]] was caught corrupting the judicial process by making a deal with the plaintiff's attorney to throw the case, in part by not disclosing damaging evidence to the jury. The case, known as the [[Fentress Case]], involved a Kentucky man, [[Joseph Wesbecker]], on Prozac, who went to his workplace and opened fire with an assault rifle, killing 8 people (including Fentress), and injuring 12 others before turning the gun on himself. The jury returned a 9-to-3 verdict in favor of Lilly. The judge, in the end, took the matter to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which found that "there was a serious lack of candor with the trial court and there may have been deception, bad faith conduct, abuse of judicial process and, perhaps even fraud." The judge later revoked the verdict and instead recorded the case as settled. The value of the secret settlement deal has never been disclosed, but was reportedly "tremendous".<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Zitrin |first2=Carol M. |last2=Langford |chapter=Hide and Secrets in Louisville |title=The Moral Compass of the American Lawyer |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1999}}{{page needed|date=March 2013}}</ref>

* Publication bias. Trials for which results were unfavorable were less likely to be published. Published data suggest a favorable risk-benefit profile for some SSRIs; however, addition of unpublished data indicates that risks could outweigh benefits of these drugs to treat depression in children and young people.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16043-1 |title=Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in childhood depression: Systematic review of published versus unpublished data |year=2004 |last1=Whittington |first1=Craig J |last2=Kendall |first2=Tim |last3=Fonagy|first3=Peter |last4=Cottrell |first4=David |last5=Cotgrove |first5=Andrew |last6=Boddington |first6=Ellen |journal=The Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9418 |pages=1341–5 |pmid=15110490}}</ref> Of 90 drugs approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2000, trials that did not show statistically significant results were 34% less likely to have been published;<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050191 |title=Publication of Clinical Trials Supporting Successful New Drug Applications: A Literature Analysis |year=2008 |editor1-last=Clarke |editor1-first=Mike |last1=Lee |first1=Kirby|last2=Bacchetti |first2=Peter |last3=Sim |first3=Ida |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=e191 |pmid=18816163 |pmc=2553819}}</ref> on the other hand, positive results are often published more than once. Based on Healy's examination of the data produced from the Cochrane study of Olanzapine for schizophrenia, the four initial trials of Zyprexa gave rise to 234 publications, most of which were ghost written.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001359.pub2 |title=Olanzapine for schizophrenia  |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2005 |last1=Duggan|first1=Lorna |last2=Fenton |first2=Mark |last3=Rathbone |first3=John |last4=Dardennes |first4=Roland |last5=El-Dosoky |first5=Ahmed |last6=Indran |first6=Saroja |editor1-last=Duggan |editor1-first=Lorna |pmid=10796640 |issue=2 |pages=CD001359}}</ref>
* Lack of access to raw data, data suppression, misrepresentation, and manipulation has eroded value of trial results. Demands on access to data has been met by resistance on the part of industry.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1745-6215-11-64 |title=Legislation for trial registration and data transparency |year=2010 |last1=Bian |first1=Zhao-Xiang |last2=Wu|first2=Tai-Xiang |journal=Trials |volume=11 |pages=64 |pmid=20504337 |pmc=2882906}}</ref>
* A meta-analysis by UK, US and Canadian researchers was published in 2008, surveying all pharmaceutical company-sponsored drug trials on the six most widely prescribed new-generation antidepressants submitted for approval to the FDA between 1987 and 1999. The results showed that the difference in efficacy between antidepressants and placebo was minimal, but that it increased from virtually no difference at moderate levels of initial depression to a relatively small difference for patients with very severe depression. The difference reached conventional criteria for clinical significance for patients at the upper end of the very severely depressed category, due to a reduction in the efficacy of placebo.<ref name="pmid18303940">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |title=Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |year=2008 |last1=Kirsch |first1=Irving|last2=Deacon |first2=Brett J. |last3=Huedo-Medina |first3=Tania B. |last4=Scoboria |first4=Alan |last5=Moore|first5=Thomas J. |last6=Johnson |first6=Blair T. |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |pmid=18303940|pmc=2253608}}</ref> The study received widespread media coverage in some countries, but was met with criticism from the professional community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/articles/page/152|title=Antidepressants do they work?

:[[Eli Lilly and Company]] responded by highlighting that the study did not take into account more recent studies on its product, Prozac, and that it was proud of the difference Prozac has made to millions of people. [[GlaxoSmithKline]] warned that this one study should not be used to cause unnecessary alarm and concern for patients. Two leading UK psychiatrists/pharmacologists, with financial and professional links to pharmaceutical companies, argued that short-term approval trials are not very suitable for evaluating effectiveness, that the unpublished trials are of poorer quality, that the meta-analysis authors came from a "psychology background" rather than drug testing background, and that the media and "elements of the medico/scientific community [sic]" have "a down on antidepressants" and that the media do not appreciate the seriousness of depression, and blame and stigmatize sufferers.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0269881108091877 |title=Why does the world have such a 'down' on antidepressants? |year=2008 |last1=Nutt|first1=D. |last2=Malizia |first2=A. |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=223–6|pmid=18541622}}</ref> [[Wyeth]] pointed out that the data were good enough for FDA approval of the drugs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blue |first=L. |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1717306,00.html |title=Antidepressants Hardly Help |work=Time |date=26 February 2008}}</ref>
