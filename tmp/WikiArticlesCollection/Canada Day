In 1946, [[Philéas Côté]], a Quebec member of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], introduced a [[private member's bill]] to rename Dominion Day as Canada Day.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Carnegie| first=R.K.| title=Drew Right: Provinces Have Say-So On Holidays| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=15| date=April 19, 1946| ref=harv| postscript=.}}</ref> His bill was passed quickly by the House of Commons but was stalled by the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], which returned the bill to the Commons with the recommendation that the holiday be renamed ''The National Holiday of Canada'', an amendment that effectively killed the bill.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Editorial Board| title=A New Low in Compromise| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| page=6| date=August 10, 1946}}</ref>

Beginning in 1958, the Canadian government began to orchestrate Dominion Day celebrations. That year, then Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] requested that Secretary of State [[Ellen Fairclough]] put together appropriate events, with a budget of $14,000. Parliament was traditionally in session on July 1, but Fairclough persuaded Diefenbaker and the rest of the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal Cabinet]] to attend.<ref name=Levine /> Official celebrations thereafter consisted usually of [[Trooping the Colour]] ceremonies on [[Parliament Hill]] in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display, though Fairclough, who became [[Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Canada)|Minister of Citizenship and Immigration]], later expanded the bills to include performing folk and ethnic groups and the day became more casual and family oriented.<ref name=Levine /> [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's centennial]] in 1967 is often seen as an important milestone in the history of Canadian patriotism, and in Canada's maturing as a distinct, independent country, after which Dominion Day became more popular with average Canadians. Into the late 1960s, nationally televised, multi-cultural concerts held in [[Ottawa]] were added, and the fête became known as ''Festival Canada''; after 1980 the Canadian government began to promote the celebrating of Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving grants and aid to cities across the country to help fund local activities.

As the anniversary of Confederation, Dominion Day, and later Canada Day, was the date set for a number of important events, such as the first national radio network hookup by the Canadian National Railway (1927); the inauguration of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s cross-country television broadcast, with Governor General [[Vincent Massey]]'s Dominion Day speech from Parliament Hill (1958);<ref name=Levine /> the flooding of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] (1958); the first colour television transmission in Canada (1966); the inauguration of the [[Order of Canada]] (1967); and the establishment of "[[O Canada]]" as the country's [[national anthem]] (1980). Other events fell on the same day coincidentally, such as the [[first day on the Somme|first day of the Battle of the Somme]] in 1916—shortly after which [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] recognized July 1 as [[Memorial Day (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Memorial Day]] to commemorate the [[Newfoundland Regiment]]'s heavy losses during the battle<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/custom.html| last=Hiscock| first=Philip| title=Society and Culture > Folklore and Traditional Culture > Custom| publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland| accessdate=June 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mun.ca/memorial/living/memorial_day.php| title=A Living Memorial > Memorial Day| publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland| accessdate=May 31, 2008}}</ref>—and the enactment of the [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]] in 1923—leading [[Chinese-Canadian]]s to refer to July 1 as ''Humiliation Day'' and boycott Dominion Day celebrations until the act was repealed in 1947.<ref>{{cite news| title=CBC News > Indepth > China > Chinese Immigration| publisher=CBC| date=June 10, 2004| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/china/chinese_immigration.html| accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref>
