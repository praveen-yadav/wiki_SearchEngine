In [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], an '''''aedicula''''' (plural '''''aediculae''''') is a small [[shrine]]. The word ''aedicula'' is the [[diminutive]] of the [[Latin]] ''[[aedes (Roman)|aedes]]'', a temple building or house.

Many aediculae were household [[shrine]]s that held small [[altar]]s or [[statue]]s of the [[Lares]] and [[Penates]]. The Lares were [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] protecting the house and the family household gods. The Penates were originally [[patron gods]] (really [[genius (mythology)|genii]]) of the storeroom, later becoming household gods guarding the entire house.

Other aediculae were small shrines within larger [[temple]]s, usually set on a base, surmounted by a pediment and surrounded by columns. In Roman architecture the aedicula has this representative function in the society. They are installed in public buildings like the [[Triumphal arch]], [[City gate]], or [[Therm]]es. The [[Celsus]] Library in [[Ephesus]] (2. c. AD) is a good example.  From the 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire onwards such shrines, or the framework enclosing them, are often called by the Biblical term [[tabernacle]], which becomes extended to any elaborated framework for a niche, window or picture.

==Gothic aediculae==
As in [[Classical architecture]], in [[Gothic architecture]], too, an aedicule or  tabernacle frame is a structural framing device that gives importance to its contents, whether an inscribed plaque, a [[cult object]], a bust or the like, by assuming the tectonic vocabulary of a little building that sets it apart from the wall against which it is placed. A tabernacle frame on a wall serves similar hieratic functions as a free-standing, three-dimensional architectural [[baldaquin]] or a [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] over an [[altar]].

In Late Gothic settings, [[altarpiece]]s and [[devotional image]]s were customarily crowned with [[gable]]s and canopies supported by clustered-column piers, echoing in small the architecture of Gothic churches.  Painted ædicules frame figures from sacred history in initial letters of [[Illuminated manuscript]]s.

==Renaissance aediculae==

Classicizing architectonic structure and decor ''all'antica'', in the "ancient [Roman] mode", became a fashionable way to frame a painted or bas-relief portrait, or protect an expensive and precious mirror<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/fram/ho_1975.1.1638.htm Metropolitan Museum: tabernacle frame, Florence, ca 1510]</ref> during the [[High Renaissance]]; Italian precedents were imitated in France, then in Spain, England and Germany during the later 16th century.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/tabernacleinfo.shtm National Gallery of Art: Tabernacle frames from the Samuel H. Kress collection]</ref>

==Post-Renaissance classicism==
Aedicular door surrounds that are architecturally treated, with pilasters or columns flanking the doorway and an [[entablature]] even with a [[pediment]] over it came into use with the 16th century.  In the [[neo-Palladian]] revival in Britain, architectonic aedicular or tabernacle frames, carved and gilded. are favourite schemes for English [[Palladian]] mirror frames of the late 1720s through the 1740s, by such designers as [[William Kent]].

==Other aedicula==
Similar small shrines, called ''[[naiskos|naiskoi]]'', are found in [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], but their use was strictly religious.

Aediculae exist today in Roman [[cemeteries]] as a part of funeral architecture.

Presently the most famous Aedicule is situated inside the [[Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem.
