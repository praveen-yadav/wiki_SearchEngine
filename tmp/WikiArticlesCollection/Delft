'''Delft''' ({{IPA-nl|dɛɫft}}, {{pronunciation|Nl-Delft.ogg}}) is a city and [[municipality]] in the province of [[South Holland]] (Zuid-Holland), in the [[Netherlands]]. Delft is located between the larger cities of [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]].
Delft is primarily known for its historic town centre with [[canals]]; also for the painter [[Vermeer]], [[Delftware|Delft Blue pottery]] ([[Delftware]]), the [[Delft University of Technology]], and its association with the Dutch royal family, the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].

==History==
From a rural village in the early Middle Ages Delft developed to a city, that in the 13th century (1246) received its [[City rights in the Netherlands|charter]].<br''>''(For some more information about the early development, see the article "[[Gracht]]", section "Delft as an example").''

The town's association with the [[House of Orange]] started when [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Willem van Oranje), nicknamed [[William the Silent]] (Willem de Zwijger), took up residence in 1572. At the time he was the leader of growing national Dutch resistance against Spanish occupation of the country, which struggle is known as the [[Eighty Years' War]]. By then Delft was one of the leading cities of [[Holland]] and it was equipped with the necessary [[city wall]]s to serve as a headquarters.

After the [[Act of Abjuration]] was proclaimed in 1581 Delft became the ''[[de facto]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of the newly independent Netherlands, as the seat of the [[Prince of Orange]].

When William was shot dead in 1584, by [[Balthazar Gerards]] in the hall of the Prinsenhof, the family's traditional burial place in [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] was still in the hands of the Spanish. Therefore, he was buried in the Delft [[Nieuwe Kerk (Delft)|Nieuwe Kerk]] (New Church), starting a tradition for the House of Orange that has continued to the present day.

===Delft Explosion===
'''The Delft Explosion''', also known in history as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred on 12 October 1654 when a [[gunpowder]] store exploded, destroying much of the city.  Over a hundred people were killed and thousands wounded.

About 30 [[tonnes]] (66,138 pounds) of gunpowder were stored in [[Barrel (storage)|barrels]] in a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] in a former [[Order of Poor Ladies|Clarissen]] [[convent]] in the Doelenkwartier district.  Cornelis Soetens, the keeper of the magazine, opened the store to check a sample of the powder and a huge explosion followed.  Luckily, many citizens were away, visiting a [[market]] in [[Schiedam]] or a [[fair]] in [[The Hague]]. Artist [[Carel Fabritius]] was wounded in the explosion and died of his injuries.  Later on, [[Egbert van der Poel]] painted several pictures of Delft showing the devastation. The Delft Explosion is the principal reason why [[Delft University of Technology]] maintains explosion science as a key topic within its research portfolio and [[List of the Delft University of Technology Alumni|graduate skill-set]].

==Culture==
[[File:Delft plate faience Famille Rose 1760 1780.jpg|thumb|180px|Delft blue is most famous but there are other kinds of Delftware, like this plate faience in rose]]
Delft is well known for the [[Delftware|Delft pottery]] [[ceramic]] products<ref name="Dunford2010"/> which were styled on the imported [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]] of the 17th century. The city had an early start in this area since it was a home port of the [[Dutch East India Company]].

The painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] (1632–1675) was born in Delft. Vermeer used Delft streets and home interiors as the subject or background of his paintings.<ref name="Dunford2010"/>
Several other famous painters lived and worked in Delft at that time, such as [[Pieter de Hooch|Pieter de Hoogh]], [[Carel Fabritius]], [[Nicolaes Maes]], Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet. They all were members of the [[Delft School (painting)|Delft School]]. The Delft School is known for its images of domestic life, views of households, church interiors, courtyards, squares and the streets of Delft. The painters also produced pictures showing historic events, flower paintings, portraits for patrons and the court, and decorative pieces of art.

==Education==
[[File:TU Delft buildings.jpg|thumb|TU Delft buildings]]
[[File:Delftechpark 003.JPG|thumb|Site at business park "Delftechpark"]]

[[Delft University of Technology]] (TU Delft) is one of three universities of technology in the Netherlands. It was founded as an academy for civil engineering in 1842 by [[William II of the Netherlands|King William II]]. Today well over 16,000 students are enrolled.

The [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, providing postgraduate education for people from developing countries, draws on the strong tradition in [[water management]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] of the Delft university.

==Economy==
In the local economic field essential elements are:
* education; (a.o. TU Delft [[Delft University of Technology]]) (As of 2007 14.299 students, 2.712 scientists and 1.859 researchers),
* scientific research; (a.o. "TNO" ( [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]]),  Stichting GeoDelft, Nederlands Normalisatie-Instituut, [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for water education.
* tourism; (about one million registered visitors a year),
* industry; (DSM Gist Services BV,  ([[Delftware]]) earthenware production by [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles]], [[Exact Holding|Exact Software Nederland BV]],
* retail;  ([[Ikea]] ( Inter IKEA Systems B.V., owner and worldwide franchisor of the IKEA Concept, is based in Delft), Makro, Eneco Energy NV).

==Nature and recreation==
East of Delft a relatively vast nature and recreation area called the "Delftse Hout" ("Delft Wood")<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Delftse_Hout Delftse Hout images on Commons]</ref> is situated. Apart from a forest, through which bike-, horseride- and footpaths are leading, it also comprises a vast lake (suitable for swimming and windsurfing), narrow beaches, a restaurant, community gardens, plus campground and other recreational and sports facilities. (There is a possibility to rent bikes at the station).

Inside the city apart from a central park there are also several smaller town parks, like "Nieuwe Plantage", "Agnetapark", "Kalverbos" and others.
Furthermore there's a [[Botanical Garden]] of the TU and an [[arboretum]] in Delftse Hout.

Trains stopping at these stations connect Delft with, among others, nearby cities of [[Rotterdam]] and [[The Hague]], up to every five minutes, for most of the day.

There are several bus routes from Delft to similar destinations. Tram lines frequently travel between Delft and The Hague via special double tracks crossing the city. One of those two lines is still under construction inside Delft and is meant to connect The Hague with a science park, which being developed on the southern (Rotterdam) side of Delft and is a joint project by the Delft and Rotterdam municipalities.<ref name="tram19_contruction">{{cite web |url = http://haaglanden.nl/nieuwe-tram-en-buslijnen |title = Nieuwe tram -en buslijnen |trans_title = New tram and bus lines |language = Dutch |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date = |work = Traffic and Transit |publisher = [[Haaglanden| Haaglanden Urban Regio]] |accessdate = 16 March 2013}}</ref>
