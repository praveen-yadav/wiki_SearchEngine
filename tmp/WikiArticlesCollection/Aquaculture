According to the [[FAO]], aquaculture "is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated."<ref>[http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-aquaculture-production/en Global Aquaculture Production] Fishery Statistical Collections, FAO, Rome.

Particular kinds of aquaculture include [[fish farming]], [[shrimp farm]]ing, [[oyster farming]], [[algaculture]] (such as [[seaweed farming]]), and the cultivation of [[ornamental fish]]. Particular methods include [[aquaponics]] and [[Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]], both of which integrate fish farming and plant farming.

About 430 (97%) of the [[species]] cultured as of 2007 were domesticated during the 20th century, of which an estimated 106 came in the decade to 2007. Given the long-term importance of agriculture, it is interesting to note that to date only 0.08% of known land plant species and 0.0002% of known land animal species have been domesticated, compared with 0.17% of known marine plant species and 0.13% of known marine animal species.

===Aquatic plants===
{{See also|Algaculture|Seaweed farming}}

[[Microalgae]], also referred to as [[phytoplankton]], [[microphytes]], or [[planktonic algae]] constitute the majority of cultivated [[algae]].

[[Macroalgae]], commonly known as [[seaweed]], also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild.

===Fish===
{{Main|Fish farming}}
The farming of fish is the most common form of aquaculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, ponds, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational [[fishing]] or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish [[hatchery]]. Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are, in order, [[carp]], [[salmon]], [[tilapia]] and [[catfish]].<ref name="faostat" />

===Crustaceans===
{{See also|Shrimp farm|Freshwater prawn farm}}
Commercial [[shrimp]] farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply thereafter. Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about 9 billion [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in [[Asia]], in particular in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Thailand]]. The other 25% is produced mainly in [[Latin America]], where [[Brazil]] is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.

Shrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in [[Southeast Asia]] into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and [[broodstock]] is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are [[penaeid]]s (i.e., shrimp of the [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Penaeidae]]''), and just two species of shrimp, the [[Whiteleg shrimp|Pacific white shrimp]] and the [[giant tiger prawn]], account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial [[monoculture]]s are very susceptible to [[disease]], which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing [[ecology|ecological]] problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable farming]] practices through the [[Seafood Watch]] program.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Seafood Watch|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_aboutsfw.aspx?c=ln|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium}}</ref>

The global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding [[crayfish]] and [[crab]]s) in 2003 was about 280,000 [[tonne]]s of which China produced 180,000 tonnes followed by India and Thailand with 35,000 tonnes each. Additionally, China produced about 370,000 tonnes of [[Chinese river crab]].<ref name="figis_fresh">Data extracted from the [http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?dom=collection&xml=global-aquaculture-production.xml FAO Fisheries Global Aquaculture Production Database] for freshwater crustaceans.

These bivalves are filter and/or deposit feeders, which rely on ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed. As such shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial.<ref>Burkholder, J.M. and S.E. Shumway. 2011. Bivalve shellfish aquaculture and eutrophication. In, Shellfish Aquaculture and the Environment. Ed. S.E. Shumway. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> Depending on the species and local conditions, bivalve molluscs are either grown on the beach, on longlines, or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging.

Watson and Pauly suggested this may be related to China policies where state entities that monitor the economy are also tasked with increasing output. Also, until recently, the promotion of Chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas.<ref>Heilprin, John (2001) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/OtherWebsites/2001/CaliforniaFish_29Nov01.pdf Chinese Misreporting Masks Dramatic Decline In Ocean Fish Catches] ''Associated Press'', 29 November 2001.</ref><ref>Reville, William (2002) [http://www.seaaroundus.org/newspapers/2002/IrishTimes_14Mar02.pdf Something fishy about the figures] ''The Irish Times'', 14 March 2002</ref>

{{Main|Mariculture}}

[[Mariculture]] is the term used for the cultivation of marine organisms in [[seawater]], usually in sheltered coastal waters. In particular, the farming of marine fish is an example of mariculture, and so also is the farming of marine crustaceans (such as [[shrimp]]s), molluscs (such as [[oyster]]s) and seaweed.

===Integrated===
{{Main|Integrated Multi-trophic Aquaculture}}
[[Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture]] (IMTA) is a practice in which the by-products (wastes) from one species are recycled to become inputs ([[fertilizer]]s, [[food]]) for another. Fed aquaculture (for example, [[fish]], [[shrimp]]) is combined with inorganic extractive and organic extractive (for example, [[shellfish]]) aquaculture to create balanced systems for environmental sustainability (biomitigation), economic stability (product diversification and risk reduction) and social acceptability (better management practices).<ref name="Chopin et al. 2001">Chopin T, Buschmann AH, Halling C, Troell M, Kautsky N, Neori A, Kraemer GP, Zertuche-Gonzalez JA, Yarish C and Neefus C. 2001. Integrating seaweeds into marine aquaculture systems: a key toward sustainability. Journal of Phycology 37: 975-986.</ref>

"Multi-Trophic" refers to the incorporation of [[species]] from different [[trophic level|trophic]] or [[nutritional]] levels in the same system.<ref name="Chopin 2006">Chopin T. 2006. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture. What it is, and why you should care... and don’t confuse it with polyculture. Northern Aquaculture, Vol. 12, No. 4, July/August 2006, pg. 4.</ref> This is one potential distinction from the age-old practice of aquatic [[polyculture]], which could simply be the co-culture of different fish species from the same trophic level. In this case, these organisms may all share the same biological and chemical processes, with few [[synergy|synergistic]] benefits, which could potentially lead to significant shifts in the [[ecosystem]]. Some traditional polyculture systems may, in fact, incorporate a greater diversity of species, occupying several [[Ecological niche|niches]], as extensive cultures (low intensity, low management) within the same pond. The "Integrated" in IMTA refers to the more intensive cultivation of the different species in proximity of each other, connected by nutrient and energy transfer through water.

Ideally, the biological and chemical processes in an IMTA system should balance. This is achieved through the appropriate selection and proportions of different species providing different ecosystem functions. The co-cultured species are typically more than just [[biofilters]]; they are harvestable crops of commercial value.<ref name="Chopin 2006"/> A working IMTA system can result in greater total production based on mutual benefits to the co-cultured species and improved [[ecosystem health]], even if the production of individual species is lower than in a [[monoculture]] over a short term period.<ref name="Neori et al. 2004">Neori A, Chopin T, Troell M, Buschmann AH, Kraemer GP, Halling C, Shpigel M and Yarish C. 2004. Integrated aquaculture: rationale, evolution and state of the art emphasizing seaweed biofiltration in modern mariculture. Aquaculture 231: 361-391.</ref>

Sometimes the term "Integrated Aquaculture" is used to describe the integration of monocultures through water transfer.<ref name="Neori et al. 2004"/> For all intents and purposes however, the terms "IMTA" and "integrated aquaculture" differ only in their degree of descriptiveness. [[Aquaponics]], fractionated aquaculture, IAAS (integrated agriculture-aquaculture systems), IPUAS (integrated peri-urban-aquaculture systems), and IFAS (integrated fisheries-aquaculture systems) are other variations of the IMTA concept.

Various materials, including [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene]], plastic-coated welded [[wire]], [[rubber]], patented [[rope]] products (Spectra, Thorn-D, Dyneema), [[galvanized steel]] and [[copper]] are used for netting in aquaculture fish enclosures around the world.<ref>Offshore Aquaculture in the United States: Economic considerations, implications, and opportunities, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, July 2008, p. 53</ref><ref name=Braithwaite>{{cite journal|pmid=15596168|year=2005|last1=Braithwaite|first1=RA|last2=McEvoy|first2=LA|title=Marine biofouling on fish farms and its remediation|volume=47|pages=215–52|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(04)47003-5|journal=Advances in marine biology}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sterlingnets.com/fishfarm.html |title=Commercial and research fish farming and aquaculture netting and supplies |publisher=Sterlingnets.com |accessdate=2010-06-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100726100545/http://www.sterlingnets.com/fishfarm.html| archivedate= 26 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.industrialnetting.com/aquaculture.htm |title=Aquaculture Netting by Industrial Netting |publisher=Industrialnetting.com |accessdate=2010-06-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100529033431/http://www.industrialnetting.com/aquaculture.htm?| archivedate= 29 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>Southern Regional Aquaculture Center at http://aquanic.org/publicat/usda_rac/efs/srac/162fs.pdf</ref> All of these materials are selected for a variety of reasons, including design feasibility, [[material strength]], cost, and [[corrosion resistance]].

{{Main|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}
Recently, copper alloys have become important netting materials in aquaculture because they are antimicrobial (i.e., they destroy [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], [[algae]], and other [[microbes]]) and they therefore prevent [[biofouling]] (i.e.,  the undesirable accumulation, adhesion, and growth of microorganisms, plants, algae, tubeworms, barnacles, mollusks, and other organisms). By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture cages avoid costly net changes that are necessary with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive.

==Issues==
{{See also|Aquaculture of salmon#Issues|l1=Issues with salmon aquaculture}}
Aquaculture can be more environmentally damaging than exploiting [[wild fisheries of the world|wild fisheries]] on a local area basis but has considerably less impact on the global environment on a per kg of production basis.<ref>Diamond, Jared, ''Collapse: How societies choose to fail or succeed,'' Viking Press, 2005, pp. 479-485</ref> Local concerns include waste handling, side-effects of [[antibiotic]]s, competition between farmed and wild animals, and using other fish to feed more marketable [[carnivorous]] fish. However, research and commercial feed improvements during the 1990s and 2000s have lessened many of these concerns.<ref>Costa-Pierce, B.A., 2002, ''Ecological Aquaculture,'' Blackwell Science, Oxford, UK.</ref>

Aquaculture may contribute to propagation of [[invasive species]]. As the cases of [[Nile perch]] and [[Janitor fish]] show, this issue may be damaging to native fauna. 

Fish waste is organic and composed of nutrients necessary in all components of aquatic food webs. In-ocean aquaculture often produces much higher {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} than normal fish waste concentrations. The waste collects on the ocean bottom, damaging or eliminating bottom-dwelling life. Waste can also decrease [[dissolved oxygen]] levels in the [[water column]], putting further pressure on wild animals.<ref>[http://0-pubs.acs.org.catalog.llu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1021/es0626988 Thacker P, (June 2008) ''Fish Farms Harm Local Food Supply,'' Environmental Science and Technology, V. 40, Issue 11, pp 3445-3446]</ref>

===Fish oils===
{{further|Tilapia#Nutrition}}

Tilapia from aquaculture has been shown to contain more fat and a much higher ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 oils.

===Impacts on wild fish===
Salmon farming currently leads to a high demand for wild [[forage fish]]. Fish do not actually produce omega-3 fatty acids, but instead accumulate them from either consuming [[microalgae]] that produce these fatty acids, as is the case with forage fish like [[herring]] and [[sardines]], or, as is the case with fatty [[predatory fish]], like salmon, by eating [[prey fish]] that have accumulated [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s from microalgae. To satisfy this requirement, more than 50 percent of the world [[fish oil]] production is fed to farmed salmon.<ref>[[FAO]]: World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture 2008: [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/i0250e/i0250e03.pdf Highlights of Special Studies] Rome.</ref>

In addition, as carnivores, salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, protein which is often supplied to them in the form of forage fish.<ref>[http://phys.org/news/2012-04-species-wild-fish-aquaculture.html 8 species of wild fish found in aquaculture feed]</ref> Consequently, farmed salmon consume more [[wild fish]] than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, at a time when seventy five percent of the worlds monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their [[maximum sustainable yield]].<ref name="Alliance">[[Seafood Choices Alliance]] (2005) [http://www.seafoodchoices.com/resources/afishianado_pdfs/Salmon_Spring05.pdf It's all about salmon]</ref> The industrial scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming then impacts the survivability of the wild predator fish who rely on them for food.

Fish can escape from coastal pens, where they can interbreed with their wild counterparts, diluting wild genetic stocks.<ref>[http://www.davidsuzuki.org/Oceans/Aquaculture/Salmon/ David Suzuki Foundation: Open-net-cage fish farming]</ref> Escaped fish can become [[invasive species|invasive]], out competing native species.<ref>

==Animal welfare==
{{see also|Pain in fish}}
{{see also|Pain in invertebrates}}

As with the farming of terrestrial animals, social attitudes influence the need for humane practices and regulations in farmed marine animals.  Under the guidelines advised by the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]] good animal welfare means both fitness and a sense of well being in the animal’s physical and mental state. This can be defined by the [[Five Freedoms]]:
* Freedom from hunger & thirst
* Freedom from discomfort
* Freedom from pain, disease, or injury
* Freedom to express normal behaviour
* Freedom from fear and distress

However, the controversial issue in aquaculture is whether fish and farmed marine invertebrates are actually [[sentient]], or have the perception and awareness to experience suffering. Although no evidence of this has been found in marine invertebrates,<ref name="Hastein">Hastein, T., Scarfe, A.D. and Lund, V.L. (2005) Science-based assessment of welfare: Aquatic animals. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epiz 24 (2) 529-547</ref> recent studies conclude that fish do have the necessary receptors ([[nociceptors]]) to sense noxious stimuli and so are likely to experience states of pain, fear and stress.<ref name="Hastein" /><ref>Chandroo, K.P., Duncan, I.J.H. and Moccia, R.D. (2004) "Can fish suffer?: Perspectives on sentience, pain, fear and stress." ''Applied Animal Behaviour Science'' 86 (3,4) 225-250</ref> Consequently, welfare in aquaculture is directed at vertebrates; finfish in particular.<ref name="Conte">Conte, F.S. (2004) "Stress and the welfare of cultured fish." ''Applied Animal Behaviour Science'' 86 (3-4), 205-223</ref>

===Common welfare concerns===
Welfare in aquaculture can be impacted by a number of issues such as stocking densities, behavioural interactions, [[fish diseases and parasites#Disease|disease]] and [[fish diseases and parasites#Parasites|parasitism]]. A major problem in determining the cause of impaired welfare is that these issues are often all interrelated and influence each other at different times.<ref name="Huntingford">{{Cite journal

Optimal stocking density is often defined by the [[carrying capacity]] of the stocked environment and the amount of individual space needed by the fish, which is very species specific. Although behavioural interactions such as [[shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] may mean that high stocking densities are beneficial to some species,<ref name="Hastein" /><ref name="Ashley">Ashley, P.J.

===Improving welfare===
The key to improving welfare of marine cultured organisms is to reduce stress to a minimum, as prolonged or repeated stress can cause a range of adverse effects. Attempts to minimise stress can occur throughout the culture process. During grow out it is important to keep stocking densities at appropriate levels specific to each species, as well as separating size classes and grading to reduce aggressive behavioural interactions. Keeping nets and cages clean can assist positive water flow to reduce the risk of water degradation.

Not surprisingly disease and parasitism can have a major effect on fish welfare and it is important for farmers not only to manage infected stock but also to apply disease prevention measures. However, prevention methods, such as vaccination, can also induce stress because of the extra handling and injection.<ref name="Ashley" /> Other methods include adding antibiotics to feed, adding chemicals into water for treatment baths and biological control, such as using [[cleaner fish|cleaner wrasse]] to remove lice from farmed salmon.<ref name="Ashley" /> 

Many steps are involved in transport, including capture, food deprivation to reduce faecal contamination of transport water, transfer to transport vehicle via nets or pumps, plus transport and transfer to the delivery location. During transport water needs to be maintained to a high quality, with regulated temperature, sufficient oxygen and minimal waste products.<ref name="Conte" /><ref name="Ashley" /> In some cases [[anaesthetics]] may be used in small doses to calm fish before transport.<ref name="Ashley" />

Aquaculture is sometimes part of an environmental rehabilitation program or as an aid in conserving endangered species.<ref>[http://books.google.be/books?id=mZ0eOg8ld5QC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=aquaculture+and+rehabilitation+and+ex-situ&source=bl&ots=qq9b_fMvvc&sig=itYIabSe1EVCbLZW3j-U99qk_fc&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=0ph1T8LqJOKp0QXx3qGkDQ&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=aquaculture%20and%20rehabilitation%20and%20ex-situ&f=false In and ex-situ aquaculture for environmental rehabilitation]</ref>

Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using [[polyculture]] techniques, and properly sited facilities (for example, offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects.

Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) recycle water by circulating it through filters to remove fish waste and food and then recirculating it back into the tanks.  This saves water and the waste gathered can be used in [[compost]] or, in some cases, could even be treated and used on land. While RAS was developed with freshwater fish in mind, scientist associated with the [[Agricultural Research Service]] have found a way to rear saltwater fish using RAS in low-salinity waters.<ref name="Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!">{{cite web
|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/feb09/seafood0209.htm
|title=Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!
|publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service
|date=February 2009}}</ref> Although saltwater fish are raised in off-shore cages or caught with nets in water that typically has a salinity of 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt), scientists were able to produce healthy pompano, a saltwater fish, in tanks with a salinity of only 5 ppt. Commercializing low-salinity RAS are predicted to have positive environmental and economical effects. Unwanted nutrients from the fish food would not be added to the ocean and the risk of transmitting diseases between wild and farm-raised fish would greatly be reduced. The price of expensive saltwater fish, such as the pompano and combia used in the experiments, would be reduced. However, before any of this can be done researchers must study every aspect of the fish’s lifecycle, including the amount of ammonia and nitrate the fish will tolerate in the water, what to feed the fish during each stage of its lifecycle, the [[stocking rate]] that will produce the healthiest fish, etc.<ref name="Growing Premium Seafood-Inland!"/>

Some 16 countries now use [[geothermal energy]] for aquaculture, including China, [[Israel]], and the United States.<ref name="earth-policy">[http://www.earth-policy.org/Books/PB2/pb2ch10.pdf "Stabilizing Climate"] in Lester R. Brown, ''[[Plan B 2.0]] Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble'' (NY: W.W. Norton & Co., 2006), p. 199.</ref>  In California, for example, 15 fish farms produce tilapia, bass, and catfish with warm water from underground. This warmer water enables fish to grow all year round and mature more quickly. Collectively these California farms produce 4.5 million kilograms of fish each year.<ref name="earth-policy" />
