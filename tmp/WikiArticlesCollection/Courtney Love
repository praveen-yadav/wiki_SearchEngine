===1994-96: ''Live Through This'' and tours===
In October 1993, Hole recorded their second album, titled ''[[Live Through This]]'', in Atlanta, Georgia. The album featured a new lineup, with bassist [[Kristen Pfaff]] and drummer [[Patty Schemel]]. ''Live Through This'' was released on [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]'s subsidiary [[DGC Records|DGC]] label in April 1994, four days after Love's husband, Cobain, was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in their home. Two months later, in June 1994, bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose,<ref name="vh1" /> and Love recruited [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] for the band's impending tour. Throughout the months preceding the tour, Love was rarely seen in public, spending time at her Seattle home, or visiting the [[Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies|Namgyal Buddhist Monastery]] in New York.<ref name="thepoweroflove" />

===1997-2000: ''Celebrity Skin'', mainstream success===
In 1997, Hole released a compilation album, ''[[My Body, The Hand Grenade]]'', and, in September 1998, released their third studio album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'', which marked something of a transformation for Love, featuring a stark [[power pop]] sound as opposed to the group's earlier punk rock influences. Love divulged her ambition of making an album where "art meets commerce&nbsp;... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to the [our] original vision."<ref name="int" /> She claimed to have been influenced by [[Neil Young]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], and [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] when writing the album.<ref name="int">{{cite album-notes|title=The Interview|artist=Hole|year=1998|type=CD|publisher=Geffen|publisherid=PRO-CD-1232}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hole: Celebrity Skin (songbook)|date=1999-03-01|publisher=Cherry Lane Music|isbn=978-1-57560-137-3}}</ref> ''Celebrity Skin'' was well received by critics; ''Rolling Stone'' called the album "accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time&nbsp;... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic."<ref>{{cite web|author=James Hunter |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/celebrity-skin-19980901|title=James Hunter reviews Celebrity Skin |work=Rolling Stone  |date=1998-09-01|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref> ''Celebrity Skin'' went on to go multi-platinum, and topped "Best of Year" lists at ''Spin'', the ''Village Voice'', and other periodicals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityhollywoodnews.com/erlandson-also-declared-that-patty/ |title=Erlandson also declared that Patty |publisher=Celebrity Hollywood News |date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref> The album garnered the band their first and only No.&nbsp;1 hit single on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart with the title track "[[Celebrity Skin (song)|Celebrity Skin]]". The band made various appearances promoting the album, including MTV performances and at the 1998 [[Billboard Music Awards]]. Hole toured with [[Marilyn Manson]] on the [[Beautiful Monsters Tour]] in 1999, but dropped out of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over production costs between Love and Manson; Hole resumed touring with [[Imperial Teen]].<ref name="MTV Hole Walks Out">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430056/hole-walks-out-on-tour-manson-injury-postpones-several-dates.jhtml |title=Hole Walks Out On Tour, Manson Injury Postpones Several Dates |publisher=MTVNews.com |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430055/marilyn-manson-holes-departure-from-tour-not-personal-thing.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson Says Hole's Departure From Tour "Not A Personal Thing" |publisher=MTVNews.com |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}</ref> 

Prior to the release and promotion of ''Celebrity Skin'', Love and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] designed a low-priced [[Squier]] brand guitar, called [[Squier Venus|Vista Venus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drownsoda.free.fr/vistavenus.htm |title=Fender Squier Vista Venus |publisher=Drown Soda |accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref> The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], and [[Rickenbacker]]'s solidbodies and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions.<ref name="ultimate guitar">{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Guitar Sourcebook|author=Tony Bacon|page=106|isbn=978-1-937994-04-4|publisher=Race Point Publishing}}</ref> In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty (...&nbsp;) And something that could also be your first band guitar.

After touring for ''Celebrity Skin'' finished, Auf der Maur left the band to tour with the Smashing Pumpkins; Hole's touring drummer Samantha Maloney left soon after. Love and Erlandson continued with the band, and released the single "[[Be a Man (song)|Be A Man]]"— an outtake from the ''Celebrity Skin'' sessions— for the soundtrack of the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' (1999). The group became dormant in the following two years, and, in May 2002, officially announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with [[Universal Music Group]] over their record contract.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnfF_10jpb8C&pg=PA6&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Doug Levy|page=6|title= CMJ New Music Report|date=2002-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT507&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|author=Roy Edroso|page=500|publisher=Rough Guides|year= 2003}}</ref>

===2001–05: Solo album===
With Hole in disarray, Love began a "punk rock femme [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]]" called Bastard during autumn 2001, enlisting Schemel, [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] co-frontwoman [[Louise Post]], and bassist Gina Crosley. Though a demo was completed, the project never reached fruition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weston |first=Colin |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1018 |title=Sort The 'Bastard' Out |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2001-05-04|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juicemagazine.com/COREYPARKS.html |title=Corey Parks |publisher=Juicemagazine.com |accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref>

In 2002, Love began composing an album with [[Linda Perry]], titled ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]''. Love signed with [[Virgin Records]] to release it, and initially recorded it in France, but was forced by the label to re-record the entire album in the summer of 2003.<ref name="foxnews" /> ''America's Sweetheart'' was released in February 2004, and was embraced by critics with mixed reviews. ''Spin'' called it a "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's ''Live Through This''" and awarded it eight out of ten stars,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/courtney-love-americas-sweetheart-virgin|title=Courtney Love, America's Sweetheart Review|author=Charles Aaron}}</ref> while ''Rolling Stone'' suggested that, "for people who enjoy watching celebrities fall apart, ''America's Sweetheart'' should be more fun than an [[The Osbournes|Osbournes]] marathon." The album sold 86,000 copies in its first three months, with the singles "[[Mono (Courtney Love song)|Mono]]" and "Hold on to Me", both of which earned competent spots on album charts. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, calling it "a crap record" and reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/hole/49737|work=NME |location=UK|title=Courtney Love blasts UK music scene and slags off 'America's Sweetheart' during Oxford Union speech|date=2010-02-13|accessdate=2011-01-23}}</ref> Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on [[TRL]]: "I cannot exist as a solo artist.

A rough acoustic version of "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for ''[[The Times]]'' in November, was also released.

===2006-present: Hole reformation, solo career===
[[File:Courtney Love SXSW Stubb's Spin Party 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Love performing with Hole at South by Southwest, Austin, Texas, 2010]]
On June 17, 2009, ''[[NME]]'' reported that Hole would be reuniting. Former Hole guitarist Erlandson stated in ''Spin'' magazine that contractually no reunion can take place without his involvement; therefore ''Nobody's Daughter'' would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a "Hole" record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a [[Twitter]] post, claiming "he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark".<ref>CourtneyLoveUK (verified account) Twitter posting (2009-06-18).</ref> ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist [[Micko Larkin]], Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). ''Nobody's Daughter'' featured a great deal of material written and recorded for Love's aborted solo album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'', including "Pacific Coast Highway", "Letter to God", "Samantha", and "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced with Larkin. The first single from ''Nobody's Daughter'' was "[[Skinny Little Bitch]]", which became a hit on alternative rock radio in early March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courtney-love.org/skinny-little-bitch-most-added-song-on-alternative-radio|title=Skinny Little Bitch, most added song on alternative radio|date=2010-03-15|accessdate=2010-11-04|first=Mel|work=courtney-love.org}}</ref>

The album received mixed reviews. ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love "worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, ''America's Sweetheart''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/nobodys-daughter-20100426|author=Robert Sheffield|title=Nobody's Daughter by Hole|work=Rolling Stone|date=2010-04-26|accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> ''Slant Magazine'' also gave the album three out of five stars, saying "It's [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like "Honey" and "For Once in Your Life." The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date. Co-penned by Linda Perry, the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/hole-nobodys-daughter/2083|work=Slant|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2013-06-25|author=Sal Cinquemani|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter}}</ref> The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk-rock sound with much more acoustic work than previous Hole albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/jun/12/nobodys-daughter/|work=San Diego Reader|title=Nobody's Daughter|author=Michael Caldwell|date=2010-06-12|accessdate=2013-11-16|quote=Despite the heaviness in Beinhorn and Hole’s respective pasts, most of the tracks here are singer-songwriterly, where acoustics provide the backbone.

''Celebrity Skin'' and ''America's Sweetheart'' deal with celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image.

As a result of Love's high-profile marriage to Kurt Cobain, comparisons have been made of her to [[Yoko Ono]].<ref name="Buzzy Jackson"/> Shortly following their marriage, and particularly after Cobain's suicide, she was often negatively compared to [[John Lennon]]'s widow Ono by Cobain's fans.<ref name="Buzzy Jackson"/> This media comparison was addressed by Love in 1992, prior to Cobain's death, in the song "20 Years in the Dakota", which she explicitly wrote about Ono.<ref name="clash music">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/ask-courtney-love|work=Clash Music|title=Ask Courtney Love|date=2010-02-23|accessdate=2013-11-10|quote=I’ve never had an encounter with Ms. Ono Lennon. I did write a song about her called ‘20 Years In The Dakota’. Yes, she’s right. I don’t know what to say. Wow. I can tell you this: I’d just had Frances and Kurt came into the hospital with a Yoko Ono boxset and I threw it at his head. I was so offended by it, because of what it meant. He thought that was cool, I did not at the time. He loved Yoko Ono and he loved her work. Then I got round to listening to it and I thought she was quite brilliant. Bizarre but brilliant. She sticks with her own thing. Why was I offended? Because she got so much shit – I wrote in the song: “You don’t fuck with the fabulous four, or you spend the rest of your life picking things up off the floor”.}}</ref> Love again commented on the comparison in a 1993 interview with ''NME'', which drew several parallels to her public image in relationship to Cobain's, saying: <blockquote>People hate her [Yoko Ono], they really do. Did you know that to 'Yoko someone' is a verb in America? It is something that boys say if they’re hanging out with you too much and they’re going to school or they have a band. It’s almost a myth that’s used to suppress women. Y’know, ‘You’re gonna Yoko me. You’re gonna destroy me.’ And this woman put up with racial inequality from [[Fleet Street]], she put up with being accused of breaking up the best band in the world [The Beatles], she put up with people’s idea that she castrated this man and then, worst of all, she had her best friend, her husband, the person she lived for, die in her arms in front of a fortress that she’d hidden herself in for twenty years. And I just feel that the world media should apologize to her because she handled it with so much dignity.<ref>{{cite news|work=NME|date=1993-04-17|people=Love, Courtney|title=Love resurrection|author=Sutherland, Steve}}</ref></blockquote>
