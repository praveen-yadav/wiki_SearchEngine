Four divisions of the [[Tenth United States Army|U.S. 10th Army]] (the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th]], [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], and [[96th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|96th]]) and two Marine Divisions (the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]] and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th]]) fought on the island while the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]] remained as an amphibious reserve and was never brought ashore. The invasion was supported by naval, amphibious, and tactical air forces.

Simultaneously, 149,193 local civilians were killed  or committed suicide, more than one third of the total local population.

TF 56 was the largest force within TF 50 and was built around the 10th Army. The army had two [[corps]] under its command, III Amphibious Corps, consisting of 1st and 6th Marine Divisions, and XXIV Corps, consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th]] and [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th Infantry Divisions]]. The 2nd Marine Division was an afloat reserve, and Tenth Army also controlled the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th Infantry Division]], earmarked as a [[garrison]], and [[77th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|77th Infantry Division]]s. In all, the Army had over 102,000 Army (of these 38,000+ were non-divisional artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops),<ref name="Rottman 2002 39"/> over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly [[Seabees]] and medical personnel).<ref name="Rottman 2002 40">{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon|year=2002|title=Okinawa 1945: The last Battle|publisher= Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-546-5|page=40}}</ref> At the start of Battle of Okinawa 10th Army had 182,821 men under its command.<ref name="Rottman 2002 40"/>

Most of the air-to-air [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s and the small [[dive bomber]]s and [[Ground-attack aircraft|strike aircraft]] were U.S. Navy [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-based]] airplanes. The U.S. Navy sustained greater casualties in this operation than in any other battle of the war.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Although Allied land forces were entirely composed of U.S. units, the [[British Pacific Fleet]] (BPF; known to the U.S. Navy as Task Force 57) provided about ¼ of Allied naval air power (450 planes). It comprised a force which included 50 warships of which 17 were aircraft carriers, but while the British [[armoured flight deck|armored flight decks]] meant that fewer planes could be carried in a single aircraft carrier, they were more resistant to ''kamikaze'' strikes. Although all the aircraft carriers were provided by Britain, the carrier group was a combined [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] fleet with British, [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]] and [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] ships and personnel.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Their mission was to neutralize Japanese [[Military airbase|airfield]]s in the [[Sakishima Islands]] and provide air cover against Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks.

===Japanese===
[[File:Japanese Commanders on Okinawa.jpg|thumb|left|Commanders of the Japanese [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|Thirty-Second Army]], February 1945.]]

The Japanese land [[Military campaign|campaign]] (mainly [[defense (military)|defensive]]) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) [[Regular Army|regular]] [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|32nd Army]] and some 9,000 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 [[Conscription|draft]]ed local [[Ryukyuan people]] (including 24,000 hastily drafted [[Rear (military)|rear]] [[militia]] called ''Boeitai'' and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). In addition, 1,500 [[middle school]] senior boys organized into [[front line|front-line]]-service "Iron and Blood Volunteer Units", while 600 [[Himeyuri Students]] were organized into a [[nurse|nursing]] unit.<ref name=command>Huber, Thomas M. [http://web.archive.org/web/20090214183638/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp Japan's Battle of Okinawa, March–June 1945], [[Command and General Staff College]]</ref>

The 32nd Army initially consisted of the [[9th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|9th]], [[24th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|24th]], and [[62nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|62nd]] Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] prior to the [[invasion]], resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lt.&nbsp;General [[Mitsuru Ushijima]], his [[chief of staff]], Lieutenant General [[Isamu Chō]] and his chief of operations, Colonel [[Hiromichi Yahara]]. Yahara advocated a defensive [[Military strategy|strategy]], whilst Chō advocated an [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] one. In the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Minoru Ota]]. They expected the Americans to land 6–10 [[division (military)|division]]s against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each U.S. division five or six times the [[firepower]] of a Japanese division; to this would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.

The Japanese had used ''[[kamikaze]]'' tactics since the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on 1 April and 25 May, seven major ''kamikaze'' attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes. {{-}}

==Naval battle==
[[File:USS Bunker Hill hit by two Kamikazes.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|6}} burns after being hit by two ''[[kamikaze]]'' planes within 30 seconds.]]

{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=There was a hypnotic fascination to the sight so alien to our Western philosophy.

The United States Navy's Task Force 58, deployed to the east of Okinawa with a picket group of from 6 to 8 destroyers, kept 13 carriers (7 CV and 6 CVL) on duty from 23 March to 27 April and a smaller number thereafter. Until 27 April, from 14 to 18 converted carriers (CVE's) were in the area at all times, and until 20 April British Task Force 57, with 4 large and 6 escort carriers, remained off the Sakishima Islands to protect the southern flank.<ref>{{cite web|title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 97|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm|accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref>

Japanese air opposition had been relatively light during the first few days after the landings. However, on 6 April the expected air reaction began with an attack by 400 planes from [[Kyushu]]. Periodic heavy air attacks continued through April. During the period 26 March-30 April, 20 American ships were sunk and 157 damaged by enemy action. For their part, the Japanese had lost up to 30 April more than 1,100 planes in the battle to Allied naval forces alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 102|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm|accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref>

Between 6 April and 22 June, the Japanese flew 1,465 ''kamikaze'' aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from [[Formosa]]. When U.S. intelligence estimated 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese had approximately 700, dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the U.S. [[Fifth Air Force]] disputed Navy claims of ''kamikaze'' coming from Formosa.<ref>Baldwin, Hanson W. ''Sea Fights and Shipwrecks'' Hanover House 1956 page 309</ref>{{clarify|This is a bit confusing. "US Intelligence" is not shared by U.S. Army Air Force which otherwise seems not involved? Needs tweaking IMO|date=June 2012}} The ships lost were smaller vessels, particularly the destroyers of the [[radar picket]]s, as well as [[destroyer escort]]s and landing ships. While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based [[motorboat]]s were also used in the Japanese [[suicide attack]]s.

The protracted length of the campaign under stressful conditions forced Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, U.S. naval forces began the campaign as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|U.S. 5th Fleet]] under Adm. [[Raymond Spruance]], but ended it as the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] under Adm. [[William Halsey]].

===Operation ''Ten-Go''===
{{Main|Ten-gō sakusen}}
[[File:Yamato battleship explosion.jpg|thumb|left|{{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} explodes after persistent attacks from U.S. aircraft.]]

Operation ''Ten-Go'' (''Ten-gō sakusen'') was the attempted attack by a strike force of ten Japanese surface vessels, led by the [[Super Battleship (Warship)|super battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and commanded by [[List of Imperial Japanese Navy admirals|Admiral]] [[Seiichi Itō]]. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach themselves and fight from shore using their guns as [[coastal artillery]] and crewmen as [[naval infantry]]. The ''Ten-Go'' force was spotted by [[submarine]]s shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was attacked by U.S. carrier aircraft.

Under attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on 7 April 1945 after a one-sided battle, long before she could reach Okinawa. U.S. [[torpedo bomber]]s were instructed to aim for only one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and hitting preferably the bow or stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest. Of ''Yamato''{{'}}s screening force, the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi|1942|2}} and four of the eight destroyers were also sunk. In all, the Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Itō, at the relatively low cost of just 10 U.S. aircraft and 12 airmen.

===British Pacific Fleet===
[[File:HMS Implacable AWM 019037.jpg|thumb|Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Avengers]], [[Supermarine Seafire|Seafires]] and [[Fairey Firefly|Fireflies]] on [[HMS Implacable (R86)|HMS ''Implacable'']] warm up their engines before taking off.]]

The British Pacific Fleet, taking part as Task Force 57, was assigned the task of neutralizing the Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, which it did successfully from 26 March-10 April. On 10 April, its attention was shifted to airfields on northern [[Taiwan (island)|Formosa]]. The force withdrew to San Pedro Bay on 23 April. On 1 May, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval [[bombardment]] as well as aircraft. Several ''kamikaze'' attacks caused significant damage, but since the British used armored [[flight deck]]s on their aircraft carriers, they only experienced a brief interruption to their force's objective.<ref>Hastings (2007), p. 401.</ref> {{-}}

==Land battle==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Battle of Okinawa.svg|thumb|left|A map of U.S. operations at Okinawa.]]
[[File:New Mexico class battleship bombarding Okinawa.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|6}} shells Okinawa on 1 April 1945.]]

The land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on 1 April 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed in the Kerama Islands ([[Kerama Retto]]), {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Okinawa on 26 March. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.

On 31 March, Marines of the [[Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion]] landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Okinawan capital of [[Naha, Okinawa|Naha]]. [[155 mm Long Tom|{{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} "Long Tom"]]s went ashore on the islets to cover operations on Okinawa. {{-}}

===Northern Okinawa===
[[File:Marines land on Okinawa shores.jpg|thumb|United States Marine Corps|[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] reinforcements wade ashore to support the [[beachhead]] on Okinawa, 1 April 1945.]]

The main landing was made by [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps]] on the Hagushi beaches on the western coast of Okinawa on '''[[L-Day]]''', 1 April, which was both Easter Sunday and [[April Fools' Day]] in 1945. The 2nd Marine Division conducted a [[demonstration (military)|demonstration]] off the Minatoga beaches on the southeastern coast to confuse the Japanese about American intentions and delay movement of [[Military reserve|reserves]] from there.

The 10th Army swept across<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Okinawa/USMC-M-Okinawa-6.html|title=Action in the North, Chp 6 of Okinawa: Victory in the Pacific by Major Chas.

In light of the weak opposition, General Buckner decided to proceed immediately with Phase II of his plan—the seizure of northern Okinawa. The [[6th Marine Division]] headed up the Ishikawa Isthmus and by 7 April, had sealed off the [[Motobu, Okinawa|Motobu Peninsula]].

Six days later on 13 April, the 2nd Battalion, [[22nd Marine Regiment]] reached Hedo Point ([[Hedo-misaki]]) at the northernmost tip of the island. By this point, the bulk of the Japanese forces in the north (codenamed ''Udo Force'') was cornered on the Motobu Peninsula. Here, the terrain was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on Yae-Take; a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the center of the peninsula. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared Yae-Take on 18 April.

Meanwhile, the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] assaulted Ie Island ([[Ie Shima]])—a small island off the western end of the peninsula—on 16 April. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered ''kamikaze'' attacks, and even local women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before Ie was declared secured on 21 April and became another air base for operations against Japan.

===Southern Okinawa===
[[File:Corsair fighter firing on Okinawa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsair]] fighter firing air-to-ground rockets in support of the troops on Okinawa]]

While the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the U.S. Army 96th Infantry division and 7th Infantry Division wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as [[Cactus Ridge]]. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed "[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]").<!--Former edit specified that the 6th Marine Division was heading south after the XXIV corps was done clearing the north (wrong). 2nd Marine Division were not introduced until later in the campaign-->

By the night of 8 April, U.S. troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese, yet the battle had only just begun, for it was now realized they were merely outposts guarding the Shuri Line.

The next American objective was Kakazu Ridge, two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. The U.S. forces often lost men before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to acquire water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.

[[File:OkinawaMarinesDeadJapanese.jpg|thumb|Marines pass through a destroyed small village where a Japanese soldier lies dead, April 1945.]]

As the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Gen. Ushijima — influenced by Gen. Chō — decided to take the offensive. On the evening of 12 April, the 32nd Army attacked U.S. positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce [[close combat]] the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on 14 April was again repulsed. The effort led 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night [[infiltration tactics]], but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.

The 27th Infantry Division—which had landed on 9 April—took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General [[John R. Hodge]] now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th on the east, with each division holding a front of only about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

Hodge launched a new offensive of 19 April with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean Theater]]. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with [[napalm]], rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on [[reverse slope defence|reverse slope]]s, where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.

A tank assault to achieve [[breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] by outflanking Kakazu Ridge, failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge and failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although [[flame tank]]s cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps lost 720 men [[killed in action|KIA]], [[wounded in action|WIA]] and [[missing in action|MIA]]. The losses might have been greater, except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.

At the end of April, after the Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line,<ref>West Point Atlas of American Wars</ref> the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 7th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and 10th Army assumed control of the battle.

On 4 May, the 32nd Army launched another [[counteroffensive]]. This time, Ushijima attempted to make [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assaults]] on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support but an effective U.S. [[counter-battery fire]] destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack failed.

Buckner launched another American attack on 11 May. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On 13 May, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and 763rd Tank Battalion captured Conical Hill. Rising {{convert|476|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 6th Marine Division fought for "Sugar Loaf Hill". The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.

By the end of May, monsoon rains which turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the [[Military tactics|tactical]] and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a [[World War I]] battlefield as troops became mired in mud and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese and American bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew. Anyone sliding down the greasy slopes could easily find their pockets full of maggots at the end of the journey.<ref name=gso>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/okinawa-battle.htm Battle of Okinawa], GlobalSecurity.org</ref>

On 29 May, Maj.&nbsp;Gen. [[Pedro del Valle]] — commanding the 1st Marine Division—ordered Company A, [[1st Battalion 5th Marines|1st Battalion]], [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marines]] to capture [[Shuri Castle]].

The Japanese retreat — although harassed by artillery fire — was conducted with great skill at night and aided by the monsoon storms. The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 men into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia, with approximately 4,000 holed up at the underground headquarters on the hillside overlooking the Okinawa Naval Base in the Oroku Peninsula, east of the airfield. On June 4, elements of the 6th Marine Division launched an amphibious assault on the peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors — including Admiral [[Minoru Ota]] — all committed suicide within the hand-built tunnels of the underground Naval headquarters on 13 June. By 17 June, the remnants of Ushijima's shattered 32nd Army were pushed into a small pocket in the far south of the island to the southeast of [[Itoman]].

On 18 June, Gen. Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire while monitoring the forward progress of his troops. Buckner was replaced by [[Roy Geiger]]. Upon assuming command, Geiger became the only U.S. Marine to command a numbered army of the U.S. Army in combat. He was relieved five days later by [[Joseph Stilwell]].

The last remnants of Japanese resistance fell on 21 June, although some Japanese continued hiding, including the future governor of [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Masahide Ota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Norimatsu-Satoko/3415 |title="The World is beginning to know Okinawa": Ota Masahide reflects on his life from the Battle of Okinawa to the Struggle for Okinawa |publisher=Japanfocus.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> Ushijima and Chō committed suicide by ''[[seppuku]]'' in their command headquarters on Hill 89 in the closing hours of the battle.

Lt. Gen. Buckner's decision to attack the Japanese defenses head-on, although extremely costly in U.S. lives, was ultimately successful. Just four days from the closing of the campaign, Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire, which blew lethal slivers of coral into his body, while inspecting his troops at the front line. He was the highest-ranking U.S. officer to be killed by enemy fire during the war. The day after, Brig. Gen. [[Claudius Miller Easley]] was killed by machine gun fire.

Aircraft losses over the three-month period were 768 U.S. planes, including those bombing the Kyushu airfields launching ''kamikaze''s. Combat losses were 458, and the other 310 were operational accidents. On land, the U.S. forces lost at least 225 tanks and many [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT]]s.

At sea, 368 Allied ships—including 120 amphibious craft—were damaged while another 28—including 15 amphibious ships and 12 destroyers—were sunk during the Okinawa campaign. The U.S. Navy's dead exceeded its wounded with 4,907 killed and 4,874 wounded, primarily from ''kamikaze'' attacks.<ref name=ACtC>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ACTC/actc-24.html |title=The Amphibians Came to Conquer |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}</ref>

The U.S. military estimates that 110,071 Japanese soldiers were killed during the battle. This total includes an unknown number of impressed Okinawans and civilians who were killed during the battle. A total of 7,401 soldiers surrendered or were captured during the battle.

===Civilian losses===
[[File:OkinawaMarineOrphan.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Marines share a [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] with an Okinawan war orphan in April 1945.]]

Some islands that saw major battles, such as the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], were uninhabited or previously evacuated. Okinawa, by contrast, had a large [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] civilian population; U.S. Army records from the planning phase of the operation make the assumption that Okinawa was home to about 300,000 civilians. According to various estimates, between one tenth and one third of them died during the battle,<ref name=gso/> or between 42,000 and 150,000 dead. Okinawa Prefecture's estimate is over 100,000 losses<ref name="museum"/>), while the official U.S. Army count for the 82-day campaign is a total of 142,058 civilian casualties, including those killed by artillery fire, air attacks and those who were [[Impressment|pressed into service]] by the Imperial Japanese Army.<ref name=gso/> Since many Okinawan residents fled to caves where they subsequently were entombed, the precise number of civilian casualties will probably never be known.  At the conclusion of hostilities around 196,000 civilians remained.

During the battle, U.S. soldiers found it difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became routine for U.S. soldiers to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote, "There was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians – and we didn't care. It was a terrible thing not to distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately."<ref>Feifer, George, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', The Lyons Press (2001), p. 374</ref> When the American forces occupied the island, many Japanese soldiers put on Okinawan clothing to avoid capture and the Okinawans would come to the Americans' aid by offering a simple way to detect Japanese in hiding. The [[Okinawan language]] differs greatly from the [[Japanese language]]; with Americans at their sides, Okinawans would give directions to people in the local language, and those who did not understand were considered the mainland Japanese in hiding who were then captured.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Mass suicides and murder–suicides==
[[File:Overcoming the last resistance.jpg|thumb|Overcoming the civilian resistance on Okinawa was aided by U.S. propaganda [[Pamphlet|leaflet]]s, one of which is being read by a prisoner awaiting transport.]]

With the impending victory of American troops, civilians often committed [[mass suicide]], urged on by the Japanese soldiers who told locals that victorious American soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and [[rape|raping]]. ''[[Ryukyu Shimpo]]'', one of the two major Okinawan newspapers, wrote in 2007: "There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese Army directed them to commit suicide. There are also people who have testified that they were handed grenades by Japanese soldiers" to blow themselves up.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/world/asia/01japan.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=Japan’s Textbooks Reflect Revised History|work=New York Times|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> Some of the civilians, having been induced by [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|Japanese propaganda]] to believe that U.S. soldiers were [[barbarian]]s committing horrible atrocities, killed their families and themselves to avoid capture.

===MEXT controversy===
There is ongoing major disagreement between Okinawa's local government and Japan's national government over the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides during the battle. In March 2007, the national [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) advised textbook publishers to reword descriptions that the embattled Imperial Japanese Army forced civilians to kill themselves in the war so they would not be taken prisoner by the U.S. military. MEXT preferred descriptions that just say that civilians received hand grenades from the Japanese military. This move sparked widespread protests among the Okinawans. In June 2007, the [[Okinawa Prefectural Assembly]] adopted a resolution stating, "We strongly call on the (national) government to retract the instruction and to immediately restore the description in the textbooks so the truth of the Battle of Okinawa will be handed down correctly and a tragic war will never happen again."<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite], ''Japan Times'', June 23, 2007</ref> On September 29, 2007, about 110,000 people held the biggest [[political rally]] in the history of Okinawa to demand that MEXT retract its order to textbook publishers on revising the account of the civilian suicides. The resolution stated: "It is an undeniable fact that the 'multiple suicides' would not have occurred without the involvement of the Japanese military and any deletion of or [[Historical revisionism|revision]] to (the descriptions) is a denial and distortion of the many testimonies by those people who survived the incidents."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070930a2.html |title="110,000 protest history text revision order" |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2007-09-30 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}</ref> In December 2007, MEXT partially admitted the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/26/asia/japan.php Japan to amend textbook accounts of Okinawa suicides] ''[[International Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'', December 26, 2007</ref> The ministry's Textbook Authorization Council allowed the publishers to reinstate the reference that civilians "were forced into mass suicides by the Japanese military", on condition it is placed in sufficient context.

The court recognized the military's involvement in the mass suicides and [[murder–suicide]]s, citing the testimony about the distribution of grenades for suicide by soldiers and the fact that mass suicides were not recorded on islands where the military was not stationed.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080329a1.html Court sides with Oe over mass suicides], ''Japan Times'', March 29, 2008</ref> In 2012, Korean-Japanese director Pak Su-nam announced her work on the documentary ''Nuchigafu'' (Okinawan for "only if one is alive") collecting the still-living survivors’ accounts in order to show "the truth of history to many people," alleging that "there were two types of orders for 'honorable deaths'--one for residents to kill each other and the other for the military to kill all residents."<ref>Nayoki Himeno, [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201205240011 Director humanizes tragedy of Okinawan mass suicides], ''The Asashi Shimbun'', May 24, 2012</ref> In March 2013, Japanese textbook publisher Shimizu Shoin was permitted by MEXT to publish the statements that, "Orders from Japanese soldiers led to Okinawans committing group suicide," and, "The [Japanese] army caused many tragedies in Okinawa, killing local civilians and forcing them to commit mass suicide."<ref>[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130327p2a00m0na014000c.html New high school texts say Japanese Imperial Army ordered WWII Okinawa suicides], ''The Mainichi'', March 29, 2013</ref>

==Aftermath==
Ninety percent of the buildings on the island were destroyed, along with countless historical documents, artifacts, and cultural treasures, and the tropical landscape was turned into "a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots".<ref>[http://www.nyc-shorinryu.com/okinawa.html Okinawan History and Karate-do]</ref> The military value of Okinawa "exceeded all hope." Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in close proximity to Japan. The U.S. cleared the surrounding waters of mines in [[Operation Zebra|Operation ''Zebra'']], occupied Okinawa, and set up the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]], a form of military government, after the battle.<ref>{{cite web| title=Military Government In The Ryukyu Islands, 1945–1950|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1410218791| accessdate=February 26, 2008}}</ref> Significant U.S. forces remain garrisoned there, and Kadena remains the largest U.S. air base in Asia.

In 1995, the Okinawa government erected a memorial named [[Cornerstone of Peace]] in Mabuni, the site of the last fighting in southeastern Okinawa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/summit/a_la/peace/ishiji/index2.htm |title=The Cornerstone of Peace |language={{ja icon}} |publisher=Pref.okinawa.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> The memorial lists all the known names of those who died in the battle, civilian and military, Japanese and foreign. As of June 2008, it contains 240,734 names.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080624a6.html Okinawa is promised reduced base burden], ''[[The Japan Times]]'', June 24, 2008</ref>

Some military historians believe that the Okinawa campaign led directly to the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], as a means of avoiding the [[Operation Downfall|planned ground invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. An alternate view is offered by [[Victor Davis Hanson]] in his book ''Ripples of Battle'':

{{bquote|...because the Japanese on Okinawa... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion. This means presented itself, with the advent of atomic bombs, which worked admirably in convincing the Japanese to sue for peace [unconditionally], without American casualties. Ironically, the American conventional [[Air Raids on Japan|firebombing of major Japanese cities]] (which had been going on for months before Okinawa) was far more effective at killing civilians than the atomic bombs and, had the Americans simply continued, or expanded this, the Japanese would likely have surrendered anyway.}} {{-}}
