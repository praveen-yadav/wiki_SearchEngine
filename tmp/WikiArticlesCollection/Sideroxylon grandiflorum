'''''Sideroxylon grandiflorum''''', known as '''tambalacoque''' or '''dodo tree''', is a long-lived tree in the family [[Sapotaceae]], [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to [[Mauritius]]. It is valued for its timber.

The ''Sideroxylon grandiflorum'' fruit is analogous to the [[peach]]. They are both termed [[drupes]] because both have a hard [[endocarp]], or pit, surrounding the seed, with the endocarp naturally splitting along a fracture line during germination.

In 1973, it was thought that this species was dying out. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. The true age could not be determined because tambalacoque has no [[growth ring]]s. [[Stanley Temple]] hypothesized that the [[dodo]], which became extinct in the 17th century, ate tambalacoque fruits, and only by passing through the digestive tract of the dodo could the seeds germinate. Temple (1977) force-fed seventeen tambalacoque fruits to wild [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]]. Seven of the fruits were crushed by the bird's gizzard. The remaining ten were either regurgitated or passed with the bird's feces. Temple planted the remaining ten fruits and three germinated. Temple did not try to germinate any seeds from control fruits not fed to turkeys so the effect of feeding fruits to turkeys was unclear. Reports made on tambalacoque seed germination by Hill (1941) and King (1946) found the seeds germinated without abrading.

Temple's hypothesis that the tree required the dodo has been contested. Others have suggested the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or that other extinct animals may also have been distributing the seeds, such as [[tortoise]]s, [[fruit bat]]s or the [[Broad-billed Parrot]]. Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] [[ecology]], claim that while a rare tree, it has germinated since the demise of the Dodo and numbers a few hundred, not 13.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The difference in numbers is because young trees are not distinct in appearance and may easily be confused with similar species. The decline of the tree may possibly be due to [[introduced species|introduction]] of [[domestic pig]]s and [[crab-eating macaque]]s and competition with introduced plants. Catling (2001) in a summary cites Owadally and Temple (1979), and Witmer (1991). Hershey (2004) reviewed the flaws in Temple's dodo-tambalacoque hypothesis.

To aid the seed in germination, botanists now use [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]] and [[Tumble polishing|gem polishers]] to erode the endocarp to allow germination.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}<!--pooh-poohed by Hershey, D.
