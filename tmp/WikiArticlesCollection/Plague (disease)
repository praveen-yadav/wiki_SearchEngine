'''Plague''' is a deadly [[infectious disease]] that is caused by the [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', named after the French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]]. Until June 2007, plague was one of the three epidemic diseases specifically reportable to the [[World Health Organization]] (the other two being [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]]).<ref>[http://www.who.int/ihr/ihr_brief_no_2_en.pdf WHO IHR Brief No. 2. Notification and other reporting requirements under the IHR (2005)]</ref>

Depending on lung infection, or sanitary conditions, plague also can be spread in the air, by direct contact, or by contaminated undercooked food or materials. The symptoms of plague depend on the concentrated areas of infection in each person: such as [[bubonic plague]] in lymph nodes, [[septicemic plague]] in blood vessels, [[pneumonic plague]] in lungs, and so on. It is treatable if detected early. Plague is still [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in some parts of the world.

==Name==
The epidemiological use of the term ''"plague"'' is currently applied to bacterial infections that cause ''[[bubo]]es'', although historically the medical use of the term "plague" has been applied to [[pandemic]] infections in general. Plague is often synonymous with "[[bubonic plague]]" but this describes just one of its manifestations. Other names have been used to describe this disease, such as "The Black Plague" and "The [[Black Death]]"; the latter is now used primarily by scholars to describe the second, and most devastating, pandemic of the disease.

The [[etymology]] of the word ''"plague"'' is believed to come from the Latin word ''plāga'' ("blow, wound") and ''plangere'' (“to strike, or to strike down”), cf. German ''Plage'' (“infestation”).

==Epidemiology and distribution==

===Infection and transmission===
[[File:Xenopsylla chepsis (oriental rat flea).jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Oriental rat flea]] (Xenopsylla cheopsis) engorged with blood after a blood meal. This species of flea is the primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the transmission of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' the organism responsible for bubonic plague in most plague [[epidemic]]s in Asia, Africa, and South America. Both male and female fleas [[hematophagy|feed on blood]] and can transmit the infection.]]

Transmission of ''Y. pestis'' to an uninfected individual is possible by any of the following means.<ref name="PM">''Plague Manual: Epidemiology, Distribution, Surveillance and Control'', pp. 9 and 11. WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.2</ref>
* droplet contact&nbsp;– coughing or sneezing on another person
* direct physical contact&nbsp;– touching an infected person, including sexual contact
* indirect contact&nbsp;– usually by touching [[soil contamination]] or a contaminated surface
* airborne transmission&nbsp;– if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods
* fecal-oral transmission&nbsp;– usually from contaminated food or water sources
* vector borne transmission&nbsp;– carried by insects or other animals.
''Yersinia pestis'' circulates in animal reservoirs, particularly in rodents, in the natural foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub–tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.<ref name=PM/>
Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the [[flea]]s (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'') that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new victim, and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.
In 1894, two bacteriologists, [[Alexandre Emile John Yersin|Alexandre Yersin]] of [[France]] and [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] of [[Japan]], independently isolated the bacterium in [[Hong Kong]] responsible for the [[Third plague pandemic|Third Pandemic]]. Though both investigators reported their findings, a series of confusing and contradictory statements by Kitasato eventually led to the acceptance of Yersin as the primary discoverer of the organism. Yersin named it '''''Pasteurella pestis''''' in honor of the [[Pasteur Institute]], where he worked, but in 1967 it was moved to a new genus, renamed '''''[[Yersinia pestis]]''''' in honor of Yersin. Yersin also noted that rats were affected by plague not only during plague epidemics but also often preceding such epidemics in humans, and that plague was regarded by many locals as a disease of rats: villagers in [[China]] and [[India]] asserted that, when large numbers of rats were found dead, plague outbreaks soon followed.

In 1898, the French scientist [[Paul-Louis Simond]] (who had also come to [[China]] to battle the Third Pandemic) established the rat-flea [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill did not have to be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In [[Yunnan, China]], inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of [[Formosa]] ([[Taiwan]]), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with recently dead rats, who had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of plague, after infected fleas had jumped to it, from a rat which had recently died of the plague.<ref>http://www.asnom.org/en/423_peste.html</ref>

==Plague immunization==
{{Main|Plague vaccine}}
Since human plague is rare in most parts of the world, there is no need to vaccinate people other than those at particularly high risk of exposure. Routine vaccination is not necessary for people living in areas with enzootic plague such as the western United States. It is not indicated for most travellers to countries reporting cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: 1) All laboratory and field personnel who are working with ''Y. pestis'' organisms resistant to antimicrobials, 2) People engaged in aerosol experiments with ''Y. pestis'' and 3) People engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).

A systematic review by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jefferson T, Demicheli V, Pratt M |title=Vaccines for preventing plague |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000976 |year=2000 |pmid=10796565 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000976 |editor1-last=Jefferson |editor1-first=Tom |ref=harv}}</ref>

==Pathology==

===Bubonic plague===
{{Main|Bubonic plague}}

[[File:Plague -buboes.jpg|thumb|Swollen inguinal lymph glands on a person infected with the bubonic plague. The swollen lymph glands are termed ''buboes'' from the Greek word for groin, swollen gland: ''bubo''.]]

When a flea bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated blood, the plague carrying bacteria are passed into the tissue. ''Y. pestis'' can reproduce inside cells, so even if [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]], they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the [[lymphatic system]], which drains [[interstitial fluid]]. Plague bacteria secrete several [[toxin]]s, one of which is known to cause dangerous [[beta blocker|beta-adrenergic blockade]].

''Y. pestis'' spreads through the lymphatics of the infected human until it reaches a [[lymph node]], where it stimulates severe [[bleeding|haemorrhagic]] [[inflammation]] that causes the lymph nodes to expand. The expansion of lymph nodes is the cause of the characteristic "bubo" associated with the disease.

===Septicemic plague===
{{Main|Septicemic plague}}
Lymphatics ultimately drain into the bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter the blood and travel to almost any part of the body. In [[septicemia|septicemic]] plague, bacterial endotoxins cause [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with [[antibiotics]] reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent.<ref name="Wagle1948">{{cite journal| author=Wagle PM| title=Recent advances in the treatment of bubonic plague| journal=Indian J Med Sci| year=1948| volume=2| pages=489–94| ref=harv }}</ref><ref name="Meyer1950">{{cite journal| author=Meyer KF| title=Modern therapy of plague| year=1950| journal=J Am Med Assoc| volume=144| pages=982–985| pmid=14774219| issue=12| doi=10.1001/jama.1950.02920120006003| ref=harv}}</ref><ref name="DattGupta1948">{{cite journal| author=Datt Gupta AK| title=A short note on plague cases treated at Campbell Hospital| journal=Ind Med Gaz| year=1948| volume=83| pages=150–151| ref=harv}}</ref> People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.

===Pneumonic plague===
{{Main|Pneumonic plague}}
The [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] plague infects the [[human lung|lung]]s, and with that infection comes the possibility of person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is usually between two and four days, but can be as little as a few hours. The initial symptoms are headache, weakness, and coughing with blood (hemoptysis), or vomiting blood (hematemesis), are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses. Without diagnosis and treatment, the infection can be fatal in one to six days; mortality in untreated cases is approximately 100%.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Ryan |editor-first=K.

===Pharyngeal plague===
This is an uncommon form of plague that resembles [[tonsillitis]] found in cases of close contact of patients with other forms of plague.<ref>

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}
</ref>

===Meningeal plague===
This form of plague occurs when bacteria cross the blood brain barrier, leading to infectious meningitis.

===Other clinical forms===
There are a few other rare manifestations of plague, including asymptomatic plague and abortive plague. ''Cellulocutaneous plague'' sometimes results in infection of the skin and soft tissue, often around the bite site of a flea.

==Treatments==
[[Waldemar Haffkine]], a doctor who worked in Bombay, India, was the first to invent and test a [[plague vaccine]] against [[bubonic plague]] in 1897.<ref>Haffkine, W. M. 1897. Remarks on the plague prophylactic fluid. Br. Med. J. 1:1461</ref>

If diagnosed in time the various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are [[streptomycin]], [[chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracycline]]. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, [[gentamicin]] and [[doxycycline]] have proven effective in [[monotherapy|monotherapeutic]] treatment of plague.<ref name="Mwengee2006">{{cite journal| author=Mwengee W| title=Treatment of Plague with Genamicin or Doxycycline in a Randomized Clinical Trial in Tanzania| year=2006| journal=Clin Infect Dis| volume=42| pmid=16447105| issue=5| pages=614–621| doi=10.1086/500137| last2=Butler| first2=Thomas| last3=Mgema| first3=Samuel| last4=Mhina| first4=George| last5=Almasi| first5=Yusuf| last6=Bradley| first6=Charles| last7=Formanik| first7=James B.| last8=Rochester| first8=C.

==History==

===Antiquity===
[[File:Amulet to ward off plague.jpg|thumb|Amulet (800&nbsp;BC&nbsp;– 612&nbsp;BC) to ward off plague inscribed with a quotation from the [[Akkadian Erra Epic]]]]
[[File:Plague in Ashod.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Poussin (1594–1665), French. The Plague of Ashdod, 1630. Oil on canvas, 148 x 198 cm. Musée du Louvre, Paris, France, Giraudon/Bridgeman Art Library.]]

The earliest account describing a possible plague [[epidemic]] is found in I Samuel 5:6 of the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]). In this account, the [[Philistines]] of [[Ashdod]] were stricken with a plague for the crime of stealing the [[Ark of the Covenant]] from the Children of Israel. These events have been dated to approximately the second half of the 11th century BC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The word "[[tumor]]s" is used in most [[English translations of the Bible|English translations]] to describe the sores that came upon the Philistines. The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], however, can be interpreted as "swelling in the secret parts".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The account indicates that the Philistine city and its political territory were stricken with a "ravaging of mice" and a plague, bringing death to a large segment of the population.

In the second year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (430 BC), [[Thucydides]] described an epidemic disease which was said to have begun in [[Ethiopia]], passed through [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]], then come to the Greek world. In the [[Plague of Athens]], the city lost possibly one third of its population, including [[Pericles]]. Modern historians disagree on whether the plague was a critical factor in the loss of the war. Although this epidemic has long been considered an outbreak of plague, many modern scholars believe that [[typhus]],<ref>[http://www.umm.edu/news/releases/athens.html Plague of Athens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[smallpox]], or [[measles]] may better fit the surviving descriptions. A recent study of DNA found in the dental pulp of plague victims suggests that [[typhoid]] was actually responsible.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Papagrigorakis |first1=Manolis J. |last2=Yapijakis |first2=Christos |last3=Synodinos |first3=Philippos N. |last4=Baziotopoulou-Valavani |first4=Effie |year=2006 |title=DNA examination of ancient dental pulp incriminates typhoid fever as a probable cause of the Plague of Athens |journal=International Journal of Infectious Diseases |publisher= |volume=10 |issue= 3|pages=206–214 |url=http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712%2805%2900178-5/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.ijid.2005.09.001 |pmid=16412683 |ref=harv }}</ref>

In the first century AD, [[Rufus of Ephesus]], a Greek anatomist, refers to an outbreak of plague in [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Syria]]. He records that Alexandrian doctors named Dioscorides and Posidonius described symptoms including acute fever, pain, agitation, and delirium. Buboes—large, hard, and non-suppurating—developed behind the knees, around the elbows, and "in the usual places." The death toll of those infected was very high. Rufus also wrote that similar buboes were reported by a Dionysius Curtus, who may have practiced medicine in [[Alexandria]] in the third century BC. If this is correct, the eastern [[Mediterranean]] world may have been familiar with bubonic plague at that early date.<ref>Simpson, W.J.</ref><ref>Patrick, A.</ref>

In the second century, the [[Antonine Plague]], named after [[Marcus Aurelius]]’ family name of Antoninus and also known as the Plague of Galen, who had first hand knowledge of the disease, may in fact have been [[smallpox]]. Galen was in Rome when it struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168–69 during an outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]]; he had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and describes its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references are scattered and brief. According to Barthold Georg Niebuhr<ref>Niebuhr, 1873. ''Lectures on the history of Rome'', p 733.</ref> "this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflected upon it by the plague which visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius." The mortality rate of the plague was 7–10 percent; the outbreak in 165–6–168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. Otto Seek believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.

===Medieval and post-medieval pandemics===
Local outbreaks of the plague are grouped into three plague [[pandemic]]s, whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to either pandemic are still subject to discussion.<ref name="Frandsen13">{{cite book|last=Frandsen|first=Karl-Erik|title=The Last Plague in the Baltic Region. 1709-1713|location=Copenhagen|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F3bNWrVRMb8C|page=13|isbn=9788763507707}}</ref> According to Joseph P. Byrne from [[Belmont University]], the pandemics were:
* the first plague pandemic from 541 to ~750, spreading from [[Egypt]] to the [[Mediterranean]] (starting with the [[Plague of Justinian]]) and northwestern [[Europe]]<ref name="Byrnexxi">{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=Joseph Patrick|title=Encyclopedia of the Black Death|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara (CA)|year=2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5KtDfvlSrDAC|page=xxi|isbn=9781598842531}}</ref>
* the second plague pandemic from ~1345 to ~1840, spreading from [[Central Asia]] to the Mediterranean and Europe (starting with the [[Black Death]]), and probably also to [[China]]<ref name=Byrnexxi/>
* the third plague pandemic from 1866 to the 1960s, spreading from China to various places around the world, notably [[India]] and the [[West Coast of the United States]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=Joseph Patrick|title=Encyclopedia of the Black Death|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara (CA)|year=2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5KtDfvlSrDAC|page=xxii|isbn=9781598842531}}</ref>
However, the late medieval Black Death is sometimes seen not as the start of the second, but as the end of the first pandemic&nbsp;– in that case, the second pandemic's start would be 1361; also vary the end dates of the second pandemic given in literature, e.g. ~1890 instead of ~1840.<ref name=Frandsen13/>

===First Pandemic: Early Middle Ages (Plague of Justinian)===
{{main|Plague of Justinian}}

The [[Plague of Justinian]] in AD 541–542 is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of bubonic plague. This disease is thought to have originated in China.<ref name=nytimes/> It then spread to Africa from where the huge city of [[Constantinople]] imported massive amounts of grain, mostly from Egypt, to feed its citizens. The grain ships were the source of contagion for the city, with massive public granaries nurturing the rat and flea population. At its peak the plague was killing 10,000 people in Constantinople every day and ultimately destroyed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. It went on to destroy up to a quarter of the human population of the eastern Mediterranean.

In AD 588 a second major wave of plague spread through the Mediterranean into what is now France. It is estimated that the [[Plague of Justinian]] killed as many as {{nowrap|100 million}} people across the world.<ref>[http://dpalm.med.uth.tmc.edu/courses/BT2003/BTstudents2003_files%5CPlague2003.htm The History of the Bubonic Plague]</ref><ref>[http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1996/plague.htm Scientists Identify Genes Critical to Transmission of Bubonic Plague]</ref> It caused [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700.<ref>[http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/anempiresepidemic.html An Empire's Epidemic]</ref> It also may have contributed to the success of the [[Arab conquests]].<ref>[http://www.justiniansflea.com/events.htm Justinian's Flea]</ref><ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/04/arts/idbriefs5H.php The Great Arab Conquests]</ref> An outbreak of it in the AD 560s was described in AD 790 as causing "swellings in the glands&nbsp;... in the manner of a nut or date" in the groin "and in other rather delicate places followed by an unbearable fever". While the swellings in this description have been identified by some as buboes, there is some contention as to whether the pandemic should be attributed to the bubonic plague, ''Yersinia pestis'', known in modern times.<ref name=Encyclopedia/>

This makes the Black Death the largest death toll from any known non-viral epidemic. Although accurate statistical data does not exist, it is thought that 1.4 million died in England (1/3 of England's 4.2 million people), while an even higher percentage of Italy's population was likely wiped out. On the other hand, Northeastern Germany, Bohemia, Poland and Hungary are believed to have suffered less, and there are no estimates available for Russia or the Balkans. It is conceivable that Russia may not have been as affected due to its very cold climate and large size, hence often less close contact with the contagion.

In the early 20th century, following the identification by Yersin and Kitasato of the plague bacterium that caused the late 19th and early 20th century Asian bubonic plague (the [[Third Pandemic]]), most scientists and historians came to believe that the Black Death was an incidence of this plague, with a strong presence of the more contagious pneumonic and septicemic varieties increasing the pace of infection, spreading the disease deep into inland areas of the continents. It was claimed that the disease was spread mainly by [[black rat]]s in Asia and that therefore there must have been black rats in north-west Europe at the time of the Black Death to spread it, although black rats are currently rare except near the [[Mediterranean]]. This led to the development of a theory that [[brown rat]]s had invaded Europe, largely wiping out black rats, bringing the plagues to an end, although there is no evidence for the theory in historical records. Some historians suggest that [[marmot]]s, rather than [[rat]]s, were the primary carriers of the disease.<ref>[http://hnn.us/articles/10949.html The Shifting Explanations for the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague in Human History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The view that the Black Death was caused by ''Yersinia pestis'' has been incorporated into medical textbooks throughout the 20th century and has become part of popular culture, as illustrated by recent books, such as John Kelly's ''The Great Mortality''. Many modern researchers have argued that the disease was more likely to have been viral (that is, not bubonic plague), pointing to the absence of rats from some parts of Europe that were badly affected and to the conviction of people at the time that the disease was spread by direct human contact. According to the accounts of the time the Black Death was extremely virulent, unlike the 19th and early 20th century bubonic plague. Samuel K. Cohn has made a comprehensive attempt to rebut the bubonic plague theory.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cohn | first = Samuel K. | title = The Black Death Transformed: Disease and Culture in Early Renaissance Europe | publisher = A Hodder Arnold |year=2003 | pages = 336 | isbn= 0-340-70646-5 }}</ref> In the Encyclopedia of Population, he points to five major weaknesses in this theory:
* very different transmission speeds&nbsp;— the Black Death was reported to have spread 385&nbsp;km in 91 days (4.23&nbsp;km/day) in 664, compared to 12–15&nbsp;km a year for the modern bubonic plague, with the assistance of trains and cars
* difficulties with the attempt to explain the rapid spread of the Black Death by arguing that it was spread by the rare pneumonic form of the disease&nbsp;— in fact this form killed less than 0.3% of the infected population in its worst outbreak ([[Manchuria]] in 1911)
* different seasonality&nbsp;— the modern plague can only be sustained at temperatures between 10 and 26°C and requires high humidity, while the Black Death occurred even in [[Norway]] in the middle of the winter and in the Mediterranean in the middle of hot dry summers
* very different death rates&nbsp;— in several places (including [[Florence]] in 1348) over 75% of the population appears to have died; in contrast the highest mortality for the modern bubonic plague was 3% in [[Bombay]] in 1903
* the cycles and trends of infection were very different between the diseases&nbsp;— humans did not develop resistance to the modern disease, but resistance to the Black Death rose sharply, so that eventually it became mainly a childhood disease
Cohn also points out that while the identification of the disease as having buboes relies on accounts of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and others, they described buboes, [[abscess]]es, [[rash]]es and [[carbuncle]]s occurring all over the body, the neck or behind the ears. In contrast, the modern disease rarely has more than one bubo, most commonly in the groin, and is not characterised by abscesses, rashes and carbuncles.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Black Death | encyclopedia =Encyclopedia of Population | volume = 1 | pages = 98–101 | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]] |year=2003 | isbn = 0-02-865677-6 | ref = harv }}</ref>

Researchers have offered a mathematical model based on the changing demography of Europe from 1000 to 1800 AD demonstrating how plague epidemics, 1347 to 1670, could have provided the selection pressure that raised the frequency of a [[CCR5#CCR5-.CE.9432|mutation]] to the level seen today that prevent HIV from entering [[macrophages]] and CD4+ [[T cell]]s that carry the mutation (the average frequency of this [[allele]] is 10% in European populations).<ref name="Duncan2005">{{cite journal| author = Duncan Chris| title = Reappraisal of the historical selective pressures for the CCR5-Δ32 mutation| journal = Journal of Medical Genetics| year = 2005| volume = 42| pages = 205–208 | pmid = 15744032| doi = 10.1136/jmg.2004.025346| last2 = Scott| first2 = S| last3 = Duncan| first3 = CJ| issue = 3| pmc = 1736018| ref = harv }}</ref> It is suggested that the original single mutation appeared over 2,500 years ago and that persistent epidemics of a [[haemorrhagic fever]] struck at the early classical civilizations.

However recent research published in the open-access scientific journal ''PloS Pathogens'' in October 2010 presented conclusive evidence that two previously unknown [[clade]]s (variant strains) of ''Y. pestis'' were responsible for the Black Death.<ref name="PLOS">{{cite journal| author =Haensch S, Bianucci R, Signoli M, Rajerison M, Schultz M, et al.| title =Distinct Clones of ''Yersinia pestis'' Caused the Black Death | journal =PLoS Pathog  |year = 2010| volume =6 | issue = 10| doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134| pmid=20949072 | pmc=2951374| editor1-last =Besansky| editor1-first =Nora J| pages =e1001134| ref =harv}}</ref> A multinational team conducted new surveys that used both ancient DNA analyses and protein-specific detection to find DNA and protein signatures specific for ''Y. pestis'' in human skeletons from widely distributed mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany,

:"... ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages."

The study also identified two previously unknown but related strains of ''Y. pestis'' that were associated with distinct medieval mass graves. These were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the present-day ''Y. pestis'' strains 'Orientalis' and 'Medievalis', suggesting that these variant strains (which are now presumed to be extinct) may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate that the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three successive epidemics.

However, surveys of plague pit remains from the Netherlands town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed evidence of a second ''Y. pestis'' genotype which differed from that found in Britain and France and this second strain is now thought to have been responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350. This discovery implies that Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France c. AD 1349, and the researchers have suggested that a second wave of plague infection, distinct from that which occurred in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities, or another site.<ref name="PLOS"/>

===Third Pandemic: 19th and 20th centuries===
{{main|Third plague pandemic}}
[[File:Burning houses during bubonic plague-China-1890s.jpg|thumb|300px|Houses being burned in China in the 1890s during the bubonic plague pandemic]]
The [[Third plague pandemic|Third Pandemic]] began in China's [[Yunnan province]] in 1855, spreading plague to all inhabited continents and ultimately killing more than {{nowrap|12 million}} people in [[India]] and China alone. Casualty patterns indicate that waves of this pandemic may have come from two different sources. The first was primarily [[bubo]]nic and was carried around the world through ocean-going trade, transporting infected persons, rats, and cargoes harboring fleas. The second, more virulent strain was primarily [[Pneumonic device|pneumonic]] in character, with a strong person-to-person contagion. This strain was largely confined to [[Manchuria]] and [[Mongolia]]. Researchers during the "Third Pandemic" identified plague vectors and the plague bacterium (see above), leading in time to modern treatment methods.

Plague occurred in [[Russia]] in 1877–1889 in rural areas near the [[Ural Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Efforts in hygiene and patient isolation reduced the spread of the disease, with approximately 420 deaths in the region. Significantly, the region of [[Vetlianka]] in this area is near a population of the [[Bobak Marmot|bobak marmot]], a small rodent considered a very dangerous plague reservoir. The last significant Russian outbreak of Plague was in [[Siberia]] in 1910 after sudden demand for Marmot skins (a substitute for [[Sable]]) increased the price by 400 percent. The traditional hunters would not hunt a sick Marmot and it was taboo to eat the fat from under the arm (the axillary [[lymph node|lymphatic gland]] that often harboured the plague) so outbreaks tended to be confined to single individuals. The price increase, however, attracted thousands of [[China|Chinese]] hunters from [[Manchuria]] who not only caught the sick animals but also ate the fat, which was considered a delicacy. The plague spread from the hunting grounds to the terminus of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] and then followed the track for 2,700&nbsp;km. The plague lasted 7 months and killed 60,000 people.

The bubonic plague continued to circulate through different ports globally for the next fifty years; however, it was primarily found in Southeast Asia. An epidemic in [[Hong Kong]] in 1894 had particularly high death rates, 90%.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pryor | first = E.G.| title = The Great Plague of Hong Kong | journal = Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society | volume = 1975| pages = 69 | publisher = Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Although the outbreak that began in [[China]] in 1855 is conventionally known as the Third Pandemic (see above), it is unclear whether there have been fewer, or more, than three major outbreaks of bubonic plague. Most modern outbreaks of bubonic plague amongst humans have been preceded by a striking, high mortality amongst rats, yet this phenomenon is absent from descriptions of some earlier plagues, especially the Black Death. The buboes, or swellings in the groin, that are especially characteristic of bubonic plague, are a feature of other diseases as well.

Research done by a team of biologists from the Institute of Pasteur in Paris and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany by analyzing the DNA and proteins from plague pits was published in Oct., 2010, reported beyond doubt that all 'the three major plagues' were due to at least two previously unknown strains of ''Yersinia pestis'' and originated from China. A team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman of University College Cork in Ireland reconstructed a family tree of the bacterium and concluded in an online issue of Nature Genetics published on 31 Oct., 2010 that all three of the great waves of plague originated from China.

==Plague as a biological weapon==
{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
[[File:World distribution of plague 1998.PNG|thumb|right|Worldwide distribution of plague infected animals 1998]]
Plague has a long history as a [[biological weapon]]. Historical accounts from [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] and [[medieval Europe]] detail the use of infected animal carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the [[Xiongnu]]/[[Huns]], [[Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Huo Qubing]] is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by [[catapult]] into cities under siege.

In 1347, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession of [[Theodosia|Caffa]], a great trade emporium on the [[Crimea]]n peninsula, came under siege by an army of [[Mongol]] warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] under the command of [[Janibeg]]. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague ([[Black Death]]) via their ships into the south of [[Europe]], whence it rapidly spread.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no9/01-0536.htm |author=Wheelis M. |title=Biological warfare at the 1346 siege of Caffa |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |publisher=Center for Disease Control|year = 2002 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–5 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530 |ref=harv }}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] developed weaponised plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas. During the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]], [[Unit 731]] deliberately infected [[Chinese people|Chinese]], Korean, and Manchurian [[civilian]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] with the plague bacterium. These subjects, termed "maruta", or "logs", were then studied by [[dissection]], others by [[Human Subject Research#Human vivisection|vivisection]] while still conscious. Members of the unit such as [[Shiro Ishii]] were exonerated from the [[Tokyo tribunal]] by [[Douglas MacArthur]] but 12 of them were prosecuted in the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] in 1949 during which some admitted having spread [[bubonic plague]] within a 36-km radius around the city of [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].<ref>Daniel Barenblatt, ''A plague upon Humanity'', HarperCollns, 2004, pp.220-221</ref>

Ishii innovated bombs containing live mice and fleas, with very small explosive loads, to deliver the weaponized microbes, overcoming the problem of the explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.

After World War II, both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as [[diphtheria]]), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in [[Soviet Union|USSR]] bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat. The plague can be easily treated with antibiotics, thus a widespread [[epidemic]] is highly unlikely in developed countries.

In 1994, there was a pneumonic plague epidemic in [[Surat]], [[India]] that resulted in 52 deaths and in a large internal migration of about 300,000 residents, who fled fearing quarantine.<ref>{{cite web | title = Pneumonic Plague Epidemic in Sural | publisher = [[Association of American Geographers]] | url = http://www.aag.org/hdgc/www/health/units/unit4/html/4bkground.html | accessdate = April 26, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

A combination of heavy monsoon rain and clogged sewers led to massive flooding which resulted in unhygienic conditions and a number of uncleared animal carcasses. It is believed that this situation precipitated the epidemic.<ref>{{cite news | title = Surat: A Victim of Its Open Sewers | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = September 25, 1994 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E0DB123AF936A1575AC0A962958260 | accessdate = April 26, 2008 }}</ref> There was widespread fear that the flood of refugees might spread the epidemic to other parts of India and the world, but that scenario was averted, probably as a result of effective public health response mounted by the Indian health authorities.<ref>{{cite news | title =  With Old Skills and New, India Battles the Plague | publisher = New York Times | date = September 29, 1994 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE3D7113AF93AA1575AC0A962958260 | accessdate = April 26, 2008 | first=John F. | last=Burns}}</ref>

Much like the [[Black Death]] that spread through medieval Europe, some questions still remain unanswered about the 1994 epidemic in Surat.<ref name = "nmdsll">{{cite news | title = Plague's Origins A Mystery | publisher = New York Times | date = March 14, 1995 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DB173BF937A25750C0A963958260 | accessdate = April 26, 2008 | first=Sanjoy | last=Hazarika}}</ref>

Initial questions about whether it was an epidemic of plague arose because the Indian health authorities were unable to culture ''Yersinia pestis'', but this could have been due to poor laboratory procedures.<ref name = "nmdsll"/> Yet, there are several lines of evidence strongly suggesting that it was a plague epidemic: blood tests for Yersinia were positive, a number of individuals showed antibodies against Yersinia and the clinical symptoms displayed by the affected were all consistent with the disease being plague.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Surat Plague and its Aftermath | publisher = Godshen Robert Pallipparambil | url = http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/YersiniaEssays/Godshen.htm | accessdate = April 26, 2008 }}</ref>

* On August 31, 1984, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported a case of [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] plague in [[Claremont, California]]. The CDC believes that the patient, a [[veterinarian]], contracted plague from a stray cat. As the cat wasn't available for necropsy, this could not be ultimately confirmed.<ref>{{cite web | title = Plague Pneumonia&nbsp;– California | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] | date = August 31, 1984 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000394.htm | accessdate = April 20, 2007 }}</ref>

On October 27, York performed a necropsy on a [[mountain lion]] that had likely perished from the disease and three days afterward York complained of flu-like symptoms and called in sick from work. He was treated at a local clinic but was not diagnosed with any serious ailment. The discovery of his death sparked a minor health scare, with officials stating he likely died of either plague or [[hantavirus]], and 49 people who had come into contact with York were given aggressive antibiotic treatments. None of them fell ill. Autopsy results released on November 9, confirmed the presence of ''Y. pestis'' in his body, confirming plague as a likely cause of death.<ref>
