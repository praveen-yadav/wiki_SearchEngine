'''De Benneville "Bert" Bell''' (February 25, 1895 – October 11, 1959) was the [[National Football League]] (NFL) commissioner from 1945 until his death in 1959. As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the [[United States]] (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

Bell played football at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where as [[quarterback]], he led his team to an appearance in the [[1917 Rose Bowl]]. After being drafted into the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War I]], he returned to complete his collegiate career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the [[Penn Quakers football|Quakers]] in the 1920s. During the [[Great Depression]], he was an assistant coach for the [[Temple Owls football|Temple Owls]] and a co-founder and co-owner of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].

With the Eagles, Bell led the way in cooperating with the other NFL owners to establish the [[National Football League Draft]] in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. During [[World War II]], Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.

After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling policy, negotiated a merger with the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on enhancing the dramatic effect of late-season matches. During the [[Golden Age of Television]], he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amid criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from [[United States Congress|Congress]], he unilaterally recognized the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for the players. He survived to oversee the [[1958 NFL Championship Game|"Greatest Game Ever Played"]] and to envision what the league would become in the future.

==Early life (1895–1932)==
Bell was born de Benneville Bell,<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 6; cf. Claassen: 163, Yost: 54</ref> on February 25, 1895,<ref>MacCambridge: 41; cf.

In 1904, Bell matriculated at the [[Episcopal Academy]], the [[Delancey School]] from 1909 to 1911 and then the [[The Haverford School|Haverford School]] until 1914.<ref name="LY3-4"/> About this time, his father was installed as athletics director at Penn<ref name="Sully2324"/> and helped form the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].<ref name= "LY235">Lyons: 2–3, 5.</ref> At Haverford, Bell captained the school's football, basketball, and baseball teams,<ref>Lyons: 4; cf.

===University of Pennsylvania (1914–1919)===
[[File:1916 Penn Quakers backfield.jpg|thumb|right|Bell (left) with Penn teammates Ben Derr (center) and [[Joe Berry (second baseman)|Joe Berry]] in 1916.]]
Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined [[Phi Kappa Sigma]].<ref name="LY5-7">Lyons: 5–7</ref><ref>Rothe: 34</ref> In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn's coach [[George H.

Prior to Penn's 1916 season, his mother died while he was en route to her bedside.<ref name="LY7-8">Lyons:7-8</ref> Nevertheless, he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach [[Bob Folwell]], but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season.<ref name="LY7-8"/> Penn finished with a record of 7–2–1.<ref name="MAC 1080"/> However, the Quakers secured an invitation to the [[1917 Rose Bowl]] against the [[Oregon Ducks]].<ref>King: 21; cf. Lyons: 9</ref> Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20-14 loss to Oregon was a 20-yard run by Bell, he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception.<ref>Lyons: 10</ref>

In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9–2–0 record.<ref name="MAC 1080"/> Afterwards, he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for [[World War I]] and was deployed to [[France]] in May 1918.<ref name="LY1115">Lyons: 11–15</ref> As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from [[General officer|General]] [[John J.

===Early career (1920–1932)===
Bell assembled the [[Stanley Professionals]] in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the [[Black Sox Scandal]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Widespread Baseball Probe Harmful for Pro Grid Sport; Bell Disbands Local Eleven | date = 1920-10-05 | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045211/1920-10-05/ed-1/seq-18/;words=Bert+BERT+BELL+Bell?date1=1920&rows=20&searchType=basic&state=&date2=1922&proxtext=bert+bell&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&index=2 | work = Evening Public Ledger | page = 18}}; cf.

Lyons: 23, 29</ref> In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by [[Lud Wray]], a fellow assistant coach.<ref name="LY2527">Lyons: 25–27</ref> Bell's resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season.<ref name="LY2527"/>

Bell was then an employee of the [[Ritz-Carlton]] in Philadelphia. At one ponit, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1929|r=0}}}}) during the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref name="LY3032">Lyons: 30-32</ref> His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz.<ref name="LY3032"/> From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the [[Temple Owls football]] team.<ref>{{cite news | title = Bell Signed by Temple | date = 1929-12-04 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D1FFD3C5F177A93C6A91789D95F4D8285F9&scp=2&sq=bert+bell&st=p | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = 42 }}; cf. Rothe: 34, Lyons: 28, Willis: 310</ref> In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea.<ref>Lyons: 49</ref> When [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.<ref>Lyons: 28; cf. MacCambridge 2009: 1081</ref>

==NFL career==

===Philadelphia Eagles (1933–1940)===
By early 1933, Bell's opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia.<ref name = "RPW56-95">Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 56, 95.</ref> After being advised by the NFL that a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the [[Blue law|Pennsylvania Blue Laws]] would have to be mollified,<ref name="WWARPW">Westcott: 101; cf. Willis: 303–304, Algeo: 13–15, Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 95</ref> he was the ''force majeure'' in lobbying to getting the laws deprecated.<ref name="WWARPW"/> He borrowed funds from [[Frances Upton]],<ref name="LCMPW"/> partnered with Wray,<ref name = "LCMPW">Lyons: 46–47; cf. Claassen: 336, MacCambridge 2005: 42, Peterson: 112, Westcott: 101</ref> and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia<ref name="LCMPW"/> which he christened as the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref>Lyons: 47; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 42</ref>
 
After the inaugural [[1933 Philadelphia Eagles season]],<ref>Willis: 310–311; cf. Coenen: 237, Didinger with Lyons: 255</ref> Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia.<ref>Lyons: 33–38, 41.</ref> Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the [[Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy]] was affirmed.<ref>Willis: 327–328</ref> In [[1934 NFL season|1934]], the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record,<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 255</ref> The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets,<ref>Lyons: 54</ref> and his failure to sign a talented college prospect<ref>Lyons: 56; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 43</ref> led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players.<ref>Peterson: 119; cf. Williams: 41</ref> In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted,<ref>Willis: 341–343; cf. Lyons: 57–58, DeVito: 84, Didinger with Lyons: 256</ref> and in February 1936, the [[1936 NFL Draft|first draft]] kicked off, at which he acted as [[Master of Ceremonies]].<ref>Williams: 41–42; cf. Peterson: 119</ref> Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.<ref>Lyons: 60</ref>

In the Eagles' first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 (presently, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|85000|1936|r=0}}}}),<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 43; cf. Lyons: 63</ref> and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $4,500 (presently, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1936|r=0}}}}).<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 43; cf. Claassen: 335, Lyons: 63</ref> Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles,<ref>Lyons: 63; cf. Claassen: 342</ref> wherein Bell led the Eagles to an 1–11 finish, their worst record ever (as of the {{currentyear}} season).<ref>;Didinger with Lyons: 256</ref> In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games.<ref>Willis: 355</ref> During the Eagles' 2-8-1 [[1937 NFL season|1937 season]],<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 257</ref> his second child, [[Upton Bell|John "Upton"]], was born.<ref>Lyons: 70</ref> In the Eagles' first profitable season, [[1938 NFL season|1938]], they posted a 5–6 record.<ref>Lyons: 72–73.</ref> The Eagles finished 1–9–1 in [[1939 NFL season|1939]] and 1–10 in [[1940 NFL season|1940]].<ref>Didinger with Lyons: 258</ref>

===Pittsburgh Steelers (1940–1945)===
In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of Rooney's Steelers to [[Alexis Thompson (American football owner)|Alexis Thompson]],<ref name="Algeo: 16">Algeo: 16</ref> and then Rooney acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 183–184; cf. Herskowitz: 149, Lyons: 81–82</ref> In a series of events known as the ''Pennsylvania Polka'',<ref name="Algeo: 16"/> Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their ''territorial rights'' in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.<ref>Lyons: 87; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 187</ref> Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 303; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 45</ref> Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager.<ref>Ruck; with Patterson and Weber: 187; cf. Lyons: 88, MacCambridge 2005: 45</ref>

During the training camp of the Pittsburgh's inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team's prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the "[s]ame old Steelers" (SOS).<ref>{{cite news|title=Rooney and Bell Views Differ After Early Look at Steelers|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kHcbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b0wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5658%2C3817409|date=August 10, 1941}}; cf. Claassen: 247, Lyons: 90, Leblanc: 62</ref> After losing the first two games of the [[1941 NFL season|1941 season]], Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach.<ref>Lyons: 90–91</ref> Bell's coaching career ended with a 10–46–2 record, and for coaches with at least five years in the NFL, it is the worst record ever (as of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 season]]).<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 225; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 45</ref> His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months after the season's conclusion.<ref>Lyons: 92</ref>

By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the [[United States Armed Forces]] for [[World War II]].<ref>Algeo: 29, 35, 46.</ref> The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since [[Major League Baseball]] was continuing unabated, then they should also.<ref>DeVito: 103</ref>

Throughout Bell's affiliation with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him.<ref>Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 71</ref> Compounding Bell's problems, [[Arch Ward]] organized the [[All-American Football Conference]] (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL's sovereignty in professional football.<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 13; cf. Davis 2005: 196–197</ref> Ward's AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league,<ref>Davis 2005: 199; cf. Piascik: 11, Littlewood 166, Staudohar: 56</ref> which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 228; cf. Davis 2005: 200–201</ref> In [[Bill Dudley]]'s contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell's anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC.<ref>Whittingham: 229</ref> Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.<ref>Claassen: 251–252</ref>

===NFL commissioner (1946–1959)===

====Election, Hapes-Filchock, and the NFL schedule (1946–1948)====
[[Elmer Layden]] was appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring.<ref>Littlewood: 133</ref> Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 1946.<ref>Davis 2005: 199; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 15, Peterson: 159</ref> Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh,<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 225; cf. Davis 2005: 201</ref> was elected to replace him.<ref>Williams: 41; cf. Lyons: 116–117, MacCambridge 2005: 15</ref> He received a three-year contract at $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1946|r=0}}}}) per year,<ref>{{cite news | title = Layden Quits; Bell New Czar | date = 1946-01-12 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rlFQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Dw4EAAAAIBAJ&dq=bert%20bell&pg=7194%2C6023617 | work = [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]}}</ref> and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney,<ref>Lyons: 114</ref> albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value.<ref name="Lyons">Lyons: 166–167</ref> He was then immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied [[Dan Reeves (NFL owner)|Dan Reeves]] permission to relocate the [[History of the St. Louis Rams#NFL Cleveland Rams (1937–1945)|Cleveland Rams]] to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name = "MDYL">MacCambridge 2005: 15–16; cf. Davis 2005: 201–202, Yost: 57–58: Lyons: 117–118</ref> Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the [[History of the St. Louis Rams#Los Angeles Rams (1946–1979)|Los Angeles Rams]] were formed.<ref name = "MDYL"/> As a precondition to the Rams leasing the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], they signed [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]], which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field, but also caused "'all hell to break loose'" amidst the owners.<!--although no details exist on what the exactly means--><ref>Rathet; Brown: 210</ref>

The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception.<ref>Willis: 302, 303, 308, 371, 383</ref> The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record.<ref>Yost: 61; cf. Sullivan: 26.</ref> The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league's schedule.<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 40; cf.

On the eve of the [[1946 NFL Championship Game|1946 championship game]], Bell was notified that [[Merle Hapes]] and [[Frank Filchock]] of the [[New York Giants]] had been implicated in a bribing scandal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Merle Hapes, 75, Ex-Giant Fullback |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/21/obituaries/merle-hapes-75-ex-giant-fullback.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 21, 1994}}; cf.

Pervin: 16, Davis 2005 p. 207</ref> At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing.<ref name="NYTH">{{cite news | first = Al | last = Hirschberg | title = He Calls the Signals in Pro Football | date = 1958-11-23 | work = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | pages = 23+}}</ref> However he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year.<ref name="LY129">Lyons: 129</ref> Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.<ref>Lyons: 289; cf. DeVito: 83, Willis: 301, Maule: 242</ref>

Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into the league constitution,<ref>Lyons: 131–132; cf: [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=byY_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=M08MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3053,1968248 Bell Planning Campaign to Kill Gambling]</ref> which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed.<ref>Lyons: 203–204; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 48–49</ref> Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games,<ref name="NYTH"/> and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game.<ref>Lyons: 134–135; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 48–49</ref> Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events<ref name="Lyons_a">Lyons: 142</ref> and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.<ref>Yost: 60; cf. Daley: 193</ref>

====AAFC-NFL merger (1948–1950)====
The NFL's struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages,<ref>Lyons: 129; cf. Davis 2005: 203–204</ref> attendance,<ref>Coenen: 125–126</ref> marketing,<ref>Coenen: 125</ref> and by [[1949 NFL season|1949]], it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years.<ref>Lyons: 171</ref> Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless.<ref>Piascik: 125; cf. Lyons: 146</ref> In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets.<ref>Coenen: 154</ref> Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 290</ref>—the [[1949 NFL Championship Game|1949 championship game]].<ref>Lyons: 156–157</ref> Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from [[Bill Radovich]], who had been [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC.<ref>Lyons and the New York Times incorrectly list Radovich for playing with the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|Los Angeles Seals]]. U.S. House Committee III, 1957, pp. 2778–2779; cf. Piascik: 27, Carrol with Gersham, Neft, and Thorn: 1197, Lyons: 154</ref> Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.<ref>Lyons: 154–155</ref>

One of the primary impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of "territorial rights" claimed by Marshall.<ref>{{cite news|last=Heller|first=Dick|title=Washington-Baltimore should be a hatefest for the ages|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56813391.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|publisher=[[HighBeam Research]] {{subscription required}}|date=25 October 1997}}</ref>  Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC.<ref>Davis 2005: 229</ref> In late 1949, the leagues merged,<ref name="L150_163_Mac_52">Lyons: 150, 163; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 52</ref> and Bell would stay on as commissioner<ref name="L150_163_Mac_52"/> with his contract extended from five to ten years<ref>Lyons: 147</ref> as three AAFC teams (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[San Francisco 49ers]], and [[Baltimore Colts (1947–1950)|Baltimore Colts]]) were subsumed.<ref name="L150_163_Mac_52"/> Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized "exquisite dramatic" and business sense and allocated the [[1950 NFL season|1950]] opening game to a contest between the [[1949 Philadelphia Eagles season|1949 champion Eagles]] versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns.<ref>Peterson: 191–192; cf: Brown with Clary: 197</ref> Feeling financially secure after the merger, he purchased his first home for himself and his family in [[Narberth, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Lyons" />

====Marketing of the NFL (1950–1956)====
In 1950, Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75 mile radius of their stadium - except for the Rams.<!--Why?--><ref>Coenen: 154; cf. Davis 2005: 259–260, 266, 268–269, LaBlanc p. 10.</ref> Consequently, the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) opened an investigation into a violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].<ref>Coenen: 157.</ref> Ensuingly, the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50%,<ref>Peterson: 197; cf. Hessions: 45, MacCambridge 2005: 70</ref> and this signaled a potential financial disaster.<ref>Rader: 86–87</ref> In 1951, he licensed the [[DuMont Television Network]] to air the championship games for the next five years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently.<ref>{{cite news | first = Dan | last = Hall | title = Hallucinations | date = 1951-05-22 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=feST4K8J0scC&dat=19510523&printsec=frontpage&hl=en | work = [[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]] | page = 17 | quote = <nowiki>[Bell said the]</nowiki> $475,000 <nowiki>[received from the contract]</nowiki> goes into the players' pool.}}; cf.

However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league.<ref>Davis 2005: 271; cf. MacCambridge, 2005: 73</ref> The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, "You can't give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952.<ref>Coenen: 157–158</ref> After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL.<ref>Rader: 86; cf. Peterson: 197</ref> He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q5IoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lmoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1566%2C964714 |title=Westinghouse to Sponsor Professional TV Football |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=May 14, 1953}}; cf.

Lyons: 196</ref> In the DOJ's case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract;<ref>Patton: 55; cf. Peterson: 198, Lyons: 199–200</ref> Bell was ecstatic.<ref>Rader: 86</ref> Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns' football games.<ref>Brown with Clary: 230–232</ref> Although he hated to fly,<ref>Patton: 48</ref> at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league.<ref>U.S. House Committee III, 1957, p. 2587; cf. Summerall with Levin: 36–37</ref>

Bell authorized a [[Pro Bowl]] to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players.<ref>Brown with Clary: 214</ref> But in the early 1950s, on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline ''assault and battery''<ref>Ratterman; with Deindorfer: 125</ref> with teams' star players being viciously targeted by opposing players.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128848/1/index.htm |title=Football Is Getting Too Vicious|author=Graham, Otto |date=October 11, 1954 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}; cf. Piascik: 155</ref> He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, "'I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don't believe there are any.'"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1132736/1/index.htm |title=I Don't Believe There Is Dirty Football |author=Maule, Tex |date=January 21, 1957 |work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were "'salesman for professional football <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football.'"<ref>King: 37; cf. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1132736/1/index.htm I Don't Believe There Is Dirty Football]</ref>

Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product.<ref>Lyons: 282</ref> After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956,<ref>Patton: 37; cf Rader: 87</ref> he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give "'us our greatest opportunity to sell the <nowiki>NFL</nowiki> and everyone must present to the public the greatest games&nbsp;... combined with the finest sportsmanship.'"<ref>Maraniss: 168–169</ref> This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL's rise to becoming America's most popular sport.<ref>Lomax: 16</ref>

====Compromise with the NFLPA (1956–1957)====
In [[Radovich v. National Football League]], the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in Radovich's favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws,<ref>Coenen: 182; cf. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 293</ref> and the implication was that the legality of the draft and [[reserve clause]] were dubious.<ref>Coenen: 182; cf. Lyons: 255–256</ref> Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business.<ref>Lyons: 261</ref> He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PRsfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3pkEAAAAIBAJ&dq=bert%20bell&pg=7199%2C6474989 |title=Pro Football Would Welcome Probe, Says NFL Commissioner Bert Bell | date=February 27, 1957 | work=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] | page = 8}}</ref> The [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary]] committee, chaired by [[Emanuel Celler]]—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision.<ref>Carroll: 199</ref> [[Red Grange]] and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success.<ref>U.S. House Committee III, 1957, p. 2596; cf.

However, Bell was speaking only for himself and without the auspices of the owners.<ref name="ROONEY 78">Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 78</ref> At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner.<ref name="ROONEY, 2007, p. 78.">Rooney; Halaas and Masich, 2007, p. 78.</ref> In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a ''super-majority''.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 294; cf.

Oriard: 57</ref> However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.<ref name="S_63 O_57"/>

====Final days (1958–1959) ====
For the 1958 season, the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 90 seconds<ref>Gifford; with Richmond: 121; cf. Maule: 245</ref> and Bell mandated officials call a few ''TV timeouts'' during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters.<ref>Powers: 84</ref> The [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 championship game]] became the first NFL championship game decided in overtime<ref>Gifford uses literary license when he writes "The overtime rule had been instituted for this game&nbsp;..." p. 210 Gifford; with Richmond: 207–208, 210, 214</ref> and it was considered to be the greatest football game ever played.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070060/1/index.htm |title=Here's Why It Was The Best Football Game Ever |author=Maule, Tex |date=January 19, 1959 |work=Sports Illustrated}}; cf.

The death of Mara in February 1959 unsettled Bell and he experienced a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] later that month.<ref name="LY 308">Lyons: 308</ref> He converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife,<ref name="Lyons_a"/> Mara's death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney,<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 311</ref> a practicing Catholic.<ref>Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 26; cf. Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 84</ref> Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, "I'd rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off."<ref name="LY 308"/> Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at [[Franklin Field]] in October 1959.<ref name="LY275">Lyons: 275</ref> The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans.<ref name="LY275"/> Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and passed away later that day.<ref>{{cite news |author=Bernstein, Ralph |title=Heart Attack Is Fatal To Bert Bell |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cxosAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4MYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,4791016 |newspaper=[[Times Daily]] |date=October 12, 1959}} Other authors alternately list his age at death (e.g., Ruck p. 313, Lyons p. 306) and his date of death (Lyons p. 306).</ref>

Though his career spanned the [[Black players in American professional football|desegregation and reintegration of the NFL]], as an owner, he never had an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd.<ref name="Lyons_a" /> Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph.<ref>MacCambridge 2005: 53; cf. Brown with Clary:194</ref> Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games,<ref>Oriard: 13; cf. Gifford with Richmond: 29, Brown with Clary: 230–232</ref> he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers,<ref>Lyons: 131–132; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 48–49</ref> and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.<ref>Yost: 60–61</ref> 

Bell was criticized as being too strict with his refusal to let sold-out games to be televised locally.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1001623/1/index.htm |title=Wonderful World Of Sport |date=January 6, 1958 |work=Sports Illustrated}}; cf. Coenen: 167, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128906/1/index.htm Detroit Free Press]</ref> Nevertheless, his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance made the NFL the "healthiest professional sport in America",<ref name="NYTH"/> and he was the "leading protagonist in pro football's evolution into America's major sport."<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 222</ref> He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it.<ref>Patton: 52–53; cf.

Bell's implementation of the draft did not show immediate results,<ref>Coenen: 90; cf.
