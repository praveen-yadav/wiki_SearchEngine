The '''economy of Djbouti''' is derived in large part from its strategic location on the [[Red Sea]]. [[Djibouti]] is mostly barren, with little development in the [[agricultural]] and [[Industry|industrial]] sectors. The country has a harsh climate, a largely [[unskilled labour]] force, and limited natural resources. The country’s most important economic asset is its strategic location connecting the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]]. As such, Djibouti’s economy is dominated by the services sector, providing services as both a transit port for the region and as an international [[transshipment]] and [[refuelling centre]].

From 1991 to 1994, Djibouti experienced a [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] which had devastating effects on the economy. Since then, the country has benefited from political stability. In recent years, Djibouti has seen significant improvement in [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] stability, with its annual [[gross domestic product]] improving at an average of over 3 percent since 2003. This comes after a decade of negative or low growth. This is attributed to [[fiscal adjustment]] measures aimed at improving public financing, as well as reforms in port management.

Despite the recent modest and stable growth, Djibouti is faced with many economic challenges, particularly job creation and poverty reduction. With an average annual [[population growth]] rate of 2.5 percent, the economy cannot significantly benefit national [[Per capita income|income per capita]] growth. [[Unemployment]] is extremely high at over 43 percent and is a major contributor to widespread [[poverty]]. Efforts are needed in creating conditions that will enhance [[private sector development]] and accumulate [[human capital]]. These conditions can be achieved through improvements in macroeconomic and fiscal framework, public administration, and [[labour market flexibility]].<ref name="Country Watch">[http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&vcountry=49&topic=MAOVR Country Watch]</ref>

Djibouti was ranked the 177th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney Country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>

==Economic performance==
[[File:Djibuswalm.jpg|thumb|250px|right|

Djibouti has experienced stable economic growth in recent years as a result of achievements in macroeconomic adjustment efforts. Fiscal adjustment measures included downsizing the civil service, implementing a pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger financial footing, and strengthening public expenditure institutions. From 2003 to 2005, annual real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent driven by good performance in the services sector and strong consumption. [[Inflation]] has been kept low (only 1 percent in 2004, compared with 2.2 percent in 2003), due to the fixed peg of the [[Djiboutian franc|Djibouti franc]] to the [[US dollar]]. However, as mentioned above, unemployment has remained high at over 40 percent in recent years.

The government fiscal balance is in deficit because the government has not been able to raise sufficient [[tax revenue]]s to cover expenses. In 2004, a substantial increase in expenditure resulted in a deterioration of the fiscal position. As a result, the government deficit increased to US$17 million in 2004 from US$7 million in 2003. But improvement in expenditure management brought down the fiscal deficit to US$11 million in 2005.<ref name="Country Watch"/>

==Balance of payments==

Djibouti’s merchandise trade balance has shown a large deficit. This is due to the country's enormous need for imports and narrow base of exports. Although Djibouti runs a substantial surplus in its services balance, the surplus has been smaller than the deficit in the merchandise trade balance. As a result, Djibouti's current account balance has been in deficit. There is very limited information for Djibouti’s current account; the country’s merchandise trade deficit was estimated at US$737 million in 2004.<ref name="Country Watch"/>

==Regional situation==

With its position on the Red Sea, Djibouti holds a major strategic importance. The facilities of the [[Port of Djibouti]] are important to sea transportation companies for fuel bunkering and refuelling. Its transport facilities are used by several landlocked African countries for the re-export of their goods. Djibouti earns transit taxes and harbour fees from this trade, these form the bulk of government revenue. This strategic location also has ensured a steady inflow of foreign assistance. The port of Djibouti functions as a small [[France|French]] naval facility, and the [[United States]] also has stationed hundreds of troops in Djibouti, its only African base, in an effort to counter terrorism in the region.<ref name="Country Watch"/>

==Macro-economic trend==

===Background===
[[Image:Quartier européen à Djibouti.jpg|thumb|240px|European Quarter, Djibouti City.]]
Djibouti’s economy is based on service activities connected with the country's strategic location and status as a [[free trade zone]] in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Two-thirds of inhabitants live in the capital and the remainder of the populace is mostly nomadic herders. Low amounts of rainfall limit crop production to fruits and vegetables, and requiring most food to be imported. The government provides services as both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and refuelling centre. Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. All of these factors contribute to its heavy dependence on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance development projects. 

An unemployment rate of 50 percent continues to be a major problem. Inflation is not a concern, however, because of the fixed tie of the franc to the US dollar. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 percent over the last seven years because of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate. Faced with a multitude of economic difficulties, the government has fallen in arrears on long-term [[external debt]] and has been struggling to meet the stipulations of foreign aid donors.<ref name="Country Watch">[http://www.countrywatch.com/cw_topic.aspx?type=text&vcountry=49&topic=INFIC Country Watch]</ref>

===Openness to foreign investment===

The [[Politics of Djibouti|government of Djibouti]] welcomes all foreign direct investment. Djibouti's assets include a strategic geographic location, an open trade regime, a stable currency, substantial tax breaks and other incentives. Potential areas of investment include [[Port of Djibouti|Djibouti's port]] and the telecommunications sectors. President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]]h first elected in 1999, has named [[privatization]], [[economic reform]], and increased [[foreign investment]] as top priorities for his government. The president pledged to seek the help of the international private sector to develop the country's infrastructure.

Djibouti has no major laws that would discourage incoming foreign investment. In principle there is no screening of investment or other discriminatory mechanisms. That said, certain sectors, most notably public utilities, are state owned and some parts are not currently open to investors. Conditions of the structural adjustment agreement recently signed by Djibouti and the [[International Monetary Fund]] stipulate increased privatization of [[parastatal]] and government-owned monopolies. There are no [[patent law]]s in Djibouti.<ref>[http://www.billanderson.com.au/Gazetteer-Patents.htm Bill Anderson]</ref>

As in most African nations, access to licenses and approvals is complicated not so much by law as by administrative procedures. In Djibouti, the administrative process has been characterized as a form of 'circular dependency.' For example, the finance ministry will issue a license only if an investor possesses an approved investor visa, while the interior ministry will only issue an investor visa to a licensed business. The Djiboutian government is increasingly realizing the importance of establishing a one-stop shop to facilitate the investment process.<ref name="Country Watch"/>

==Trade==
[[File:Marché-Djibouti-2000.jpg|thumb|240px|Market of Djibouti in 2000]]
Principal exports from the region transiting Djibouti are [[coffee]], [[salt]], [[hides]], dried [[beans]], [[cereals]], other agricultural products, chalk, and wax. Djibouti itself has few exports, and the majority of its imports come from [[France]]. Most imports are consumed in Djibouti and the remainder goes to [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. Djibouti's unfavourable [[balance of trade]] is offset partially by invisible earnings such as transit taxes and harbour dues. In 1999, U.S. exports to Djibouti totalled $26.7 million while U.S. imports from Djibouti were less than $1 million.

The [[Djibouti (city)|City of Djibouti]] has the only paved [[Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport|airport in the republic]]. Djibouti has one of the most liberal economic regimes in Africa, with almost unrestricted banking and commerce sectors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
