'''Antoninus Pius''' ({{lang-la|Titus Fulvius Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius}};<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius">Weigel, ''Antoninus Pius''</ref><ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Antoninus' name would be inscribed as TITVS AELIVS HADRIANVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS PIVS.</ref> born 19 September, 86 AD –  died 7 March, 161 AD), also known as '''Antoninus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 138 to 161. He was a member of the [[Nerva-Antonine dynasty]] and the [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelii]].<ref name="Bowman, pg. 150">Bowman, pg. 150</ref>

He acquired the [[cognomen|name]] [[Pius]] after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deify]] his adoptive father [[Hadrian]],<ref>Birley, pg. 54; Dio, 70:1:2</ref> or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.<ref>Birley, pg. 55, citing the ''[[Historia Augusta]],'' ''Life of Hadrian'' 24.4</ref>

==Early life==
===Childhood and family===
He was born as the only child of Titus Aurelius Fulvius, [[consul]] in 89<ref name="Bowman, pg. 150">Bowman, pg. 150</ref> whose family came from [[Nemausus]] (modern [[Nîmes]]).<ref name="Bury, pg. 523">Bury, pg. 523</ref>  He was born near [[Lanuvium]]<ref>Harvey, Paul B., ''Religion in republican Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, pg. 134; Canduci, pg. 39</ref> and his mother was Arria Fadilla. Antoninus’ father and paternal grandfather died when he was young and he was raised by [[Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus]],<ref name="Bowman, pg. 150">Bowman, pg. 150</ref> his maternal grandfather, reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of [[Pliny the Younger]]. His mother married Publius Julius Lupus (a man of consular rank) suffect consul in 98, and two daughters, Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla, were born from that union.<ref>Birley, pg. 242; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:6</ref>

===Marriage and children===
Some time between 110 and 115, he married Annia Galeria [[Faustina the Elder]].<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/>  They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul [[Marcus Annius Verus]]<ref name="Bowman, pg. 150">Bowman, pg. 150</ref> and [[Rupilia]] Faustina (a half-sister to Roman Empress [[Vibia Sabina]]). Faustina was a beautiful woman, well known for her wisdom. She spent her whole life caring for the poor and assisting the most disadvantaged Romans.

Faustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters.<ref>Birley, pg. 34; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:7</ref> They were:
* Marcus Aurelius Fulvius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.<ref name="Magie, David 1921">Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 6</ref>
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.<ref name="Magie, David 1921"/>  His name appears on a Greek Imperial coin.
* Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Lucius Lamia Silvanus, consul 145. She appeared to have no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in [[Italy]].<ref>Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 7</ref>
* Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or [[Faustina the Younger]] (between 125–130–175), a future Roman Empress, married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in 146.<ref name="Bury, pg. 523">Bury, pg. 523</ref>

When Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly distressed.<ref>Bury, pg. 528</ref>  In honor of her memory, he asked the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to deify her as a goddess, and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the [[Roman Forum]] in her name, with priestesses serving in her temple.<ref>Birley, pg. 77; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 6:7</ref>  He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted ‘DIVA FAUSTINA’ and were elaborately decorated. He further created a charity which he founded and called it ''Puellae Faustinianae'' or ''Girls of Faustina'', which assisted orphaned girls.<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/>  Finally, Antoninus created a new ''alimenta'' (see [[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]).

===Favor with Hadrian===
Having filled the offices of [[quaestor]] and [[praetor]] with more than usual success,<ref>Traver, Andrew G., ''From polis to empire, the ancient world, c. 800 B.C.-A.D. 500'', (2002) pg. 33; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 2:9</ref> he obtained the consulship in 120.<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/> He was next appointed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] as one of the four [[proconsul]]s to administer [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]],<ref name="Bowman, pg. 149">Bowman, pg. 149</ref> then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], probably during 134–135.<ref name="Bowman, pg. 149">Bowman, pg. 149</ref> 

He acquired much favor with the Emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138,<ref>Bowman,pg. 148</ref> after the death of his first adopted son [[Lucius Aelius]],<ref>Bury, pg. 517</ref> on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Aelius Verus, who afterwards became the emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]].<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/>

==Emperor (138)==
[[Image:Roman Empire in 150 AD.png|300px|thumb|The Roman Empire during the reign of Antoninus Pius.]]
[[Image:Antoninus Pius BM Sc1463.jpg|thumb|Another version of the standardised imperial portrait; from the house of Jason Magnus at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], North Africa ([[British Museum]]).]]
[[Image:RomaForoRomanoTempioAntoninoFaustina.JPG|thumb|250px|The temple of Antoninus and [[Faustina the Elder|Faustina]] in the [[Roman forum]] (now the church of [[San Lorenzo in Miranda]]). The emperor and his ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' were deified after their death by [[Marcus Aurelius]].]]

On his accession, Antoninus' name became "Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus". One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused;<ref name="Bowman, pg. 151">Bowman, pg. 151</ref> his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of ''Pius'' (dutiful in affection; compare ''[[pietas]]'').<ref>Birley, pg. 55; Canduci, pg. 39</ref>  Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.<ref name="Bury, pg. 523">Bury,pg. 523</ref> 

Antoninus built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]].<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius">Weigel,''Antoninus Pius''</ref>  Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian.<ref name="Bowman, pg. 151">Bowman, pg. 151</ref>

There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written "It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion".<ref>J. J. Wilkes, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Volume LXXV 1985, ISSN 0075-4358, p. 242.</ref> 

His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the [[Principate]];<ref name="Bury, pg. 525">Bury, pg. 525</ref> while there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time, in [[Mauretania]], [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], and amongst the [[Brigantes]] in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], none of them are considered serious.<ref name="Bury, pg. 525">Bury, pg. 525</ref>  It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]].<ref name="Bowman, pg. 151">Bowman, pg. 151</ref> 

Under instructions from the emperor, he undertook an invasion of southern [[Scotland]], winning some significant victories, and constructing the [[Antonine Wall]]<ref>Bowman, pg. 152</ref> from the [[Firth of Forth]] to the [[Firth of Clyde]], although it was soon abandoned for reasons that are still not quite clear.<ref name="Bowman, pg. 155">Bowman, pg. 155</ref>  There were also some troubles in [[Dacia Inferior]] which required the granting of additional powers to the [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province.<ref name="Bowman, pg. 155">Bowman, pg. 155</ref> Also during his reign the governor of [[Upper Germany]], probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo, built new fortifications in the [[Agri Decumates]], advancing the [[Limes Germanicus]] fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring [[Raetia]].<ref>Birley, pg. 113</ref>

Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign,<ref>Speidel, Michael P., ''Riding for Caesar: The Roman Emperors' Horse Guards'', Harvard University Press, 1997, pg. 50; Canduci, pg. 40</ref> but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.<ref>See Victor, 15:3</ref>

===Legal reforms===
Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information, but, to judge by what is extant, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after his reign. However, he did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.<ref name="Bury, pg. 526">Bury, pg. 526</ref>  Although he was not an innovator, he would not follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into [[Roman law]] many important new principles based upon this notion.<ref name="Bury, pg. 526">Bury, pg. 526</ref> 

In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L. Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises; L. Volusius Maecianus, chosen to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius, and author of a large work on Fidei Commissa (Testamentary Trusts); L. Ulpius Marcellus, a prolific writer; and two others .<ref name="Bury, pg. 526">Bury, pg. 526</ref>  His reign saw the appearance of the ''Institutes of Gaius'', an elementary legal manual for beginners (see [[Gaius (jurist)]]).<ref name="Bury, pg. 526">Bury, pg. 526</ref>

Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the [[enfranchisement]] of [[slavery|slaves]].<ref name="Bury, pg. 527">Bury, pg. 527</ref>  In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are not to be treated as guilty before trial.<ref name="Bury, pg. 527">Bury, pg. 527</ref>  He also asserted the principle, that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of [[torture]] in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions.<ref name="Bury, pg. 527">Bury, pg. 527</ref>

One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of [[Rome]] being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome.<ref>Bowman, pg, 154</ref>  It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami. While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.88&nbsp;grams to 2.68&nbsp;grams.<ref name="Bowman, pg. 155">Bowman, pg. 155</ref><ref>[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University "Roman Currency of the Principate"]</ref>

Scholars place Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for fulfilling the role as a friend of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Judah the Prince]]. According to the [[Talmud]] (Avodah Zarah 10a-b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with "Antoninus", possibly Antoninus Pius,<ref>A. Mischcon, Abodah Zara, p.10a Soncino, 1988. Mischcon cites various sources, "SJ Rappaport... is of opinion that our Antoninus is Antoninus Pius." Other opinions cited suggest "Antoninus" was [[Caracalla]], [[Lucius Verus]] or [[Alexander Severus]].</ref> who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.

===Death (161)===
After the longest reign since Augustus (surpassing [[Tiberius]] by a couple of months), Antoninus died of fever at [[Lorium]] in [[Etruria]],<ref>Bowman, pg. 156; Victor, 15:7</ref> about twelve miles (19&nbsp;km) from Rome, on 7 March 161,<ref name="Bowman, pg. 156">Bowman, pg. 156</ref> giving the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the [[tribune]] of the night-watch came to ask the password—"aequanimitas" (equanimity).<ref name="Bury, pg. 532">Bury, pg. 532</ref>  His body was placed in [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's mausoleum]], a [[Column of Antoninus Pius|column]] was dedicated to him on the [[Campus Martius]],<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/> and the [[Temple of Antoninus and Faustina|temple]] he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus.<ref name="Bury, pg. 532">Bury, pg. 532</ref>

==Historiography==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
[[Image:Sbeitla 04.jpg|thumb|250px|Arch of Antoninus Pius in [[Sbeïtla]], [[Tunisia]].]]
The only account of his life handed down to us is that of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.<ref>Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 5:4</ref>  Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. Historians have therefore turned to public records for what details we know.

===In later scholarship===
Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as [[Edward Gibbon]] or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]:
{{quote|A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname κυμινοπριστης "cummin-splitter"). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.}}

Later historians had a more nuanced view of his reign. According to the historian [[J. B. Bury]], {{quote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian’s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.<ref>Bury, pg. 524</ref>}}

Inevitably, the surviving evidence is not complete enough to determine whether one should interpret, with older scholars, that he wisely curtailed the activities of the Roman Empire to a careful minimum, or perhaps that he was uninterested in events away from Rome and [[Italy]] and his inaction contributed to the pressing troubles that faced not only Marcus Aurelius but also the emperors of the third century.  German historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''Römische Geschichte'' [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised "a succession of grossly wasted opportunities," given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing.  Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders.

==Descendants==
Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent Roman statesmen and socialites, including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the Emperor [[Commodus]].  The family of Antoninus Pius and [[Faustina the Elder]] also represents one of the few periods in ancient Roman history where the position of Emperor passed smoothly from father to son.  Direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina were confirmed to exist at least into the fifth century AD.
