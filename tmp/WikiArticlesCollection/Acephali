In one instance, the term referred to a strict sect that separated itself, in the end of the 5th century, from the rule of [[Peter III of Alexandria|Peter Mongus]], [[List of Patriarchs of Alexandria|Patriarch of Alexandria]], and remained "without king or bishop" until they were reconciled by [[Pope Mark II of Alexandria|Mark II]] (799 - 819).

The term is also used to denote ''[[clerici vagantes]]'', i.e. clergy without title or benefice. Certain persons in [[England]] during the reign of King [[Henry I of England]] were called Acephali because they had no lands with which could identify their allegiance with a particular lord.<ref name="brewer"/>

The name is also given to certain legendary races described by ancient naturalists and 
geographers as having no heads. Their mouths and eyes being in their breasts, these creatures are  generally identified with the work [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Blemmyes (legendary creatures)|Blemmyae]].<ref name="brewer"/> They live in [[Libya]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-00-720873-1|year=2005|last=Matthews|first=John & Caitlin|page=6}}</ref>
