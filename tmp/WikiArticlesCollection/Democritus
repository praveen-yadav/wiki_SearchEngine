'''Democritus''' ({{lang-el|Δημόκριτος, ''Dēmókritos''}}, "chosen of the people") (c. 460 – c. 370 BCE) was an [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosopher]] born in [[Abdera, Thrace]], [[Greece]].<ref name="Russell64">[[#Russell|Russell]], pp.64–65.</ref> A pupil of [[Leucippus]], he was an influential [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]]  who formulated an [[atomic theory]] for the universe.<ref name="Barnes87">[[#Barnes|Barnes]] (1987).</ref>

His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from those of his mentor [[Leucippus]], as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the nineteenth-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however, their ideas rested on very different bases.<ref>Stephen Toulmin and June Goodfield, ''The Architecture of Matter'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), 56.</ref> Largely ignored in ancient [[Athens]], Democritus was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Aristotle]]. [[Plato]] is said to have disliked him so much that he wished all his books burned.<ref>[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'',  Book IX, Chapter 7 (40): "[[Aristoxenus]] in his ''Historical Notes'' affirms that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he could collect".</ref> Many consider Democritus to be the "father of modern science".<ref>Pamela Gossin, ''Encyclopedia of Literature and Science'', 2002.</ref>

==Life==
Democritus was born in the city of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]], an [[Ionians|Ionian]] colony of [[Teos]],<ref>Aristotle, ''de Coel.'' iii.4, ''Meteor.'' ii.7</ref> although some called him a [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]].<ref>[[#DL|Diogenes Laërtius]], ix. 34, etc.</ref> He was born in the 80th [[Olympiad]] (460–457 BC) according to [[Apollodorus of Athens]],<ref name="diogix41"/> and although [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]] placed his birth in 470 BC,<ref name="diogix41">[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ix. 41.</ref> the later date is probably more likely.<ref>"The latter date [460 BC] is perhaps somewhat preferable, especially given the evident temptation to classify Democritus as older than Socrates on generic grounds, i.e. that Democritus was the last 'scientific' philosopher, Socrates the first 'ethical' one." Cynthia Farrar, 1989, The Origins of Democratic Thinking: The Invention of Politics in Classical Athens, page 195. Cambridge University Press</ref> [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] has argued that the date of 460 is "too early" since, according to Diogenes Laërtius ix.41, Democritus said that he was a "young man (''neos'')" during [[Anaxagoras]]' old age (circa 440–428).<ref>[[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] (1955). ''Greek Philosophy: Thales to [[Plato]]'', London: Macmillan, p.194.</ref>  It was said that Democritus' father was so wealthy that he received [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] on his march through Abdera. Democritus spent the [[inheritance]] which his father left him on travels into distant countries, to satisfy his thirst for knowledge. He traveled to [[Asia]], and was even said to have reached [[India]] and [[Ethiopia]].<ref>[[Cicero]], ''de Finibus'', v.19; [[Strabo]], xvi.</ref>
[[File:Hendrik ter Brugghen - Democritus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Democritus'', by [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], 1628.]]
We know that he wrote on [[Babylon]] and [[Meroe]]; he visited [[Egypt]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] states that he lived there for five years.<ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]], i.98.</ref> He himself declared<ref>[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', i.</ref> that among his contemporaries none had made greater journeys, seen more countries, and met more scholars than himself. He particularly mentions the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptian mathematicians]], whose knowledge he praises. [[Theophrastus]], too, spoke of him as a man who had seen many countries.<ref>Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', iv. 20; Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 35.</ref> During his travels, according to Diogenes Laërtius, he became acquainted with the [[Assyria|Chaldean]] magi. "[[Ostanes]]", one of the magi accompanying [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], was also said to have taught him.<ref>Tatian, ''Orat. cont. Graec.'' 17. "However, this Democritus, whom Tatian identified with the philosopher, was a certain [[Bolus of Mendes]] who, under the name of Democritus, wrote a book on sympathies and antipathies" – Owsei Temkin (1991), ''Hippocrates in a World of Pagans and Christians'', p.120. JHU Press.</ref>

After returning to his native land he occupied himself with natural [[philosophy]]. He traveled throughout [[Greece]] to acquire a better knowledge of its cultures. He mentions many [[Greeks|Greek]] philosophers in his writings, and his wealth enabled him to purchase their writings. [[Leucippus]], the founder of [[atomism]], was the greatest influence upon him. He also praises [[Anaxagoras]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ii.14; [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.140.</ref> Diogenes Laertius says that he was friends with [[Hippocrates]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ix.42.</ref> He may have been acquainted with [[Socrates]], but [[Plato]] does not mention him and Democritus himself is quoted as saying, "I came to Athens and no one knew me."<ref>Diogenes Laertius 9.36 and Cicero ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'' 5.36.104, cited in p. 349 n. 2 of [[W. K. C. Guthrie]] (1965), ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 2, Cambridge.</ref> [[Aristotle]] placed him among the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] natural philosophers.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaph.'' xiii.4; ''Phys.'' ii.2, ''de Partib. Anim.'' i.1</ref>
[[File:Rembrandt self-portrait 1629.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rembrandt]], ''The Young Rembrandt as Democritus the Laughing Philosopher'' (1628-1629).|left]]
The many [[anecdote]]s about Democritus, especially in [[Diogenes Laërtius]], attest to his [[disinterest]], modesty, and simplicity, and show that he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately [[blinding]] himself in order to be less disturbed in his pursuits;<ref>Cicero, ''de Finibus'' v.29; [[Aulus Gellius]], x.17; Diogenes Laërtius, ix.36; Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'' v.39.</ref> it may well be true that he lost his sight in [[old age]]. He was cheerful, and was always ready to see the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.<ref>Seneca, ''de Ira'', ii.10; Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', iv.20.</ref>

He was highly esteemed by his fellow-[[citizen]]s, "because," as Diogenes Laërtius says, "he had foretold them some things which events proved to be true," which may refer to his knowledge of [[natural phenomena]]. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]],<ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]], xiv.11.5.</ref> Democritus died at the age of 90, which would put his death around 370 BC, but other writers have him living to 104,<ref>Lucian, ''Macrobii'' 18</ref> or even 109.<ref>Hipparchus ap. Diogenes Laërtius, ix.43.</ref>

Popularly known as the Laughing Philosopher (for laughing at human follies), the terms ''Abderitan laughter'', which means scoffing, incessant laughter, and Abderite, which means a scoffer, are derived from Democritus.<ref name="brewer">{{cite book | last = Brewer | first = E.

== Philosophy and science ==
Democritus followed in the tradition of Leucippus, who seems to have come from Miletus, and he carried on the scientific rationalist philosophy associated with that city. They were both strict determinists and thorough [[Materialism|materialists]], believing everything to be the result of natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the [[Atomism|atomists]] attempted to explain the world without reasoning to ''purpose'', ''prime mover'', or ''final cause''. For the atomists questions should be answered with a mechanistic explanation ("What earlier circumstances caused this event?"), while their opponents search for explanations which, in addition to the material and mechanistic, also included the formal and teleological ("What purpose did this event serve?"). Modern science has focused on mechanistic questions, which have led to scientific knowledge, especially in physics, while teleological questions can be useful in biology, in adaptationist reasoning at providing proximate explanations, though the deeper evolutionary explanations are often held to be thoroughly mechanistic. The atomists looked exclusively for mechanistic questions, and only admitted mechanistic answers.

===Atomic hypothesis===
The theory of Democritus and Leucippus held that everything is composed of "atoms", which are physically, but not geometrically, indivisible; that between atoms, there lies empty space; that atoms are indestructible; have always been, and always will be, in motion; that there are an infinite number of atoms, and kinds of atoms, which differ in shape, and size. Of the mass of atoms, Democritus said "The more any indivisible exceeds, the heavier it is." But his exact position on weight of atoms is disputed.<ref name="Russell64"/>

Leucippus is widely credited with being the first to develop the theory of atomism, although [[Isaac Newton]] preferred to credit the obscure [[Mochus|Mochus the Phoenician]] (whom he believed to be the biblical Moses) as the inventor of the idea on the authority of [[Posidonius]] and [[Strabo]].<ref>Derek Gjertsen (1986), ''The Newton Handbook'', p.468.</ref> The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes, "This theologically motivated view does not seem to claim much historical evidence, however."<ref>Sylvia Berryman (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/#1 "Ancient Atomism"], ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. – Retrieved on 15 July 2009.</ref>

Democritus, along with  [[Leucippus]] and [[Epicurus]], proposed the earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms. They reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved.  Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pfeffer | first = Jeremy, I.  | coauthors = Nir, Shlomo | title = Modern Physics: An Introduction Text | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-86094-250-4 | page = 183}}</ref>    Using analogies from our [[empirical evidence|sense experience]]s, he gave a picture or an image of an atom that distinguished them from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts.  Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets.<ref>See ''testimonia'' DK 68 A 80, DK 68 A 37 and DK 68 A 43. See also {{cite book | last = Cassirer | first = Ernst  | title = An Essay on Man: an Introduction to the Philosophy of Human Culture | publisher = Doubleday & Co. | year = 1953 | id = ASIN B0007EK5MM |  page = 214}}</ref> The Democritean atom is an inert solid (merely excluding other bodies from its volume) that interacts with other atoms [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanically]]. In contrast, modern, quantum-mechanical atoms interact via electric and magnetic force fields and are far from inert.

The theory of the atomists appears to be more nearly aligned with that of modern science than any other theory of antiquity. However, the similarity with modern concepts of science can be confusing when trying to understand where the hypothesis came from. It is obvious that classical atomists would never have had a solid empirical basis for our modern concepts of atoms and molecules. [[Bertrand Russell]]  states that they just hit on a lucky hypothesis, only recently confirmed by evidence.<ref>Russell, p.66.</ref>
However, [[Lucretius]], describing atomism in his ''[[De rerum natura]]'', gives very clear and compelling empirical arguments for the original atomist theory. He observes that any material is subject to irreversible decay. Through time, even hard rocks are slowly worn down by drops of water. Things have the tendency to get mixed up: mix water with soil and you get mud, that will usually not un-mix by itself. Wood decays. However, we see in nature and technology that there are mechanisms to recreate 'pure' materials like water, air, and metals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The seed of an oak will grow out into an oak tree, made of similar wood as historical oak trees, the wood of which has already decayed. The conclusion is that many properties of materials must derive from something inside, that will itself never decay, something that stores for eternity the same inherent, indivisible properties. The basic question is: why has everything in the world not yet decayed, and how can exactly the same materials, plants, animals be recreated again and again? One obvious solution to explain how indivisible properties can be conveyed in a way not easily visible to human senses, is to hypothesise the existence of 'atoms'. These classical 'atoms' are nearer to our modern concept of 'molecule' than to the atoms of modern science. The other big point of classical atomism is that there must be a lot of open space between these 'atoms': the void. Lucretius gives reasonable arguments{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that the void is absolutely necessary to explain how gasses and liquids can change shape, flow, while metals can be molded, without changing the basic material properties.

===Void hypothesis===
The atomistic void hypothesis was a response to the paradoxes of [[Parmenides]] and [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult to answer arguments in favor of the idea that there can be no movement. They held that any movement would require a void—which is nothing—but a nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was "You say there 'is' a void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void." The position of Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be nothing there is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is ''something'', for instance light waves.

The atomists agreed that motion required a void, but simply ignored the argument of Parmenides on the grounds that motion was an observable fact. Therefore, they asserted, there must be a void. This idea survived in a refined version as Newton's theory of [[absolute space]], which met the logical requirements of attributing reality to not-being. Einstein's theory of relativity provided a new answer to Parmenides and Zeno, with the insight that space by itself is relative and cannot be separated from time as part of a generally curved space-time manifold. Consequently, Newton's refinement is now considered superfluous.<ref name="Russell69">Russell, pp.69–71.</ref>

===Epistemology===
[[File:Giordano, Luca Democritus ca 1600.jpg|thumb|''Democritus'' by Luca Giordano, ca. 1600]]
The knowledge of truth, according to Democritus, is difficult, since the perception through the senses is subjective. As from the same senses derive different impressions for each individual, then through the sense-impressions we cannot judge the truth. We can only interpret the sense data through the intellect and grasp the truth, because the truth is at the bottom.

:“And again, many of the other animals receive impressions contrary to ours; and even to the senses of each individual, things do not always seem the same. Which then, of these impressions are true and which are false is not obvious; for the one set is no more true than the other, but both are alike. And this is why Democritus, at any rate, says that either there is no truth or to us at least it is not evident.”<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' iv.1009 b 7.</ref>

:“Democritus says: By convention hot, by convention cold, but in reality atoms and void, and also in reality we know nothing, since the truth is at bottom.”<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 117]], [[#DL|Diogenes Laërtius]] ix.72.</ref>

There are two kinds of knowing, the one he calls “legitimate” (''gnesie'': genuine) and the other “bastard”. The “bastard” knowledge is concerned with the perception through the senses, therefore it is insufficient and subjective. The reason is that the sense-perception is due to the effluences of the atoms from the objects to the senses. When these different shapes of atoms come to us, they stimulate our senses according to their shape, and our sense-impressions arise from those stimulations.<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 135]], Theophrastus12, ''De Sensu'' 49–83.</ref>

The second sort of knowledge, the “legitimate” one, can be achieved through the intellect, in other words, all the sense-data from the “bastard” must be elaborated through reasoning. In this way one can get away from the false perception of the “bastard” knowledge and grasp the truth through the inductive reasoning. After taking into account the sense-impressions, one can examine the causes of the appearances, draw conclusions about the laws that govern the appearances, and discover the causality (''aetiologia'') by which they are related. This is the procedure of thought from the parts to the whole or else from the apparent to non-apparent (inductive reasoning). This is one example of why Democritus is considered to be an early scientific thinker. The process is reminiscent of that by which science gathers its conclusions.
:“But in the Canons Democritus says there are two kinds of knowing, one through the senses and the other through the intellect. Of these he calls the one through the intellect ‘legitimate’ attesting its trustworthiness for the judgement of truth, and through the senses he names ‘bastard’ denying its inerrancy in the discrimination of what is true. To quote his actual words: Of knowledge there are two forms, one legitimate, one bastard. To the bastard belong all this group: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The other is legitimate and separate from that. Then, preferring the legitimate to the bastard, he continues: When the bastard can no longer see any smaller, or hear, or smell, or taste, or perceive by touch, but finer matters have to be examined, then comes the legitimate, since it has a finer organ of perception.”<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 11]], [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.138.</ref>

:“In the Confirmations ... he says: But we in actuality grasp nothing for certain, but what shifts in accordance with the condition of the body and of the things (atoms) which enter it and press upon it.”<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 9]], [[#Sextus|Sextus]] vii.136.</ref>

:“Democritus used to say that 'he prefers to discover a causality rather than become a king of Persia'.”<ref>[[#Fr|Fr. 118]]</ref>

===Ethics and politics===
[[File:Bramante heracleitus and democritus.jpeg|thumb|left|''Crying [[Heraclitus]] and laughing Democritus'', from a 1477 Italian fresco, Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan.]]
The ethics and politics of Democritus come to us mostly in the form of maxims.  As such, the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] has gone as far to say that: "despite the large number of ethical sayings, it is difficult to construct a coherent account of Democritus' ethical views" and noting that there is a "difficulty of deciding which fragments are genuinely Democritean".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/#7 |title=Democritus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=15 October 2012}}</ref>

He says that "Equality is everywhere noble," but he is not encompassing enough to include women or slaves in this sentiment. Poverty in a democracy is better than prosperity under tyrants, for the same reason one is to prefer liberty over slavery. Those in power should "take it upon themselves to lend to the poor and to aid them and to favor them, then is there pity and no isolation but companionship and mutual defense and concord among the citizens and other good things too many to catalogue." Money when used with sense leads to generosity and charity, while money used in folly leads to a common expense for the whole society— excessive hoarding of money for one's children is avarice. While making money is not useless, he says, doing so as a result of wrongdoing is the "worst of all things." He is on the whole ambivalent towards wealth, and values it much less than self-sufficiency. He disliked violence but was not a pacifist: he urged cities to be prepared for war, and believed that a society had the right to execute a criminal or enemy so long as this did not violate some law, treaty, or oath.<ref name="Barnes87"/>

Goodness, he believed, came more from practice and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed that one should distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes are tied to the society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.<ref name="Barnes87"/>

=== Mathematics ===
[[Image:Cone 3d.png|thumb|250px|right|A right circular cone and an oblique circular cone]]
Democritus was also a pioneer of mathematics and geometry in particular. We only know this through citations of his works (titled  ''On Numbers'', ''On Geometrics'', ''On Tangencies'', ''On Mapping'', and ''On Irrationals'') in other writings, since most of Democritus' body of work did not survive the Middle Ages. Democritus was among the first to observe that a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] or [[pyramid]] has one-third the [[volume]] of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[prism (geometry)|prism]] respectively with the same base and height.

===Anthropology, biology, and cosmology===
His work on nature is known through citations of his books on the subjects, ''On the Nature of Man'', ''On Flesh'' (two books), ''On Mind, On the Senses'', ''On Flavors'', ''On Colors'',  ''Causes concerned with Seeds and Plants and Fruits'', and ''Causes concerned with Animals'' (three books).<ref name="Barnes87"/> He spent much of his life experimenting with and examining plants and minerals, and wrote at length on many scientific topics.<ref>[[#Petronius|Petronius ch. 88]].</ref> Democritus thought that the first [[humans]] lived an anarchic and animal sort of life, going out to forage individually and living off the most palatable herbs and the fruit which grew wild on the trees.  They were driven together into societies for fear of wild animals, he said. He believed that these early people had no language, but that they gradually began to articulate their expressions, establishing symbols for every sort of object, and in this manner came to understand each other. He says that the earliest men lived laboriously, having none of the utilities of life; clothing, houses, fire, domestication, and farming were unknown to them. Democritus presents the early period of mankind as one of learning by trial and error, and says that each step slowly led to more discoveries; they took refuge in the caves in winter, stored fruits that could be preserved, and through reason and keenness of mind came to build upon each new idea.<ref name="Barnes87"/><ref>[[#DS|Diodorus]] I.viii.1–7.</ref>

Democritus held that the Earth was round, and stated that originally the universe was composed of nothing but tiny atoms churning in chaos, until they collided together to form larger units—including the earth and everything on it.<ref name="Barnes87"/> He surmised that [[Cosmic pluralism|there are many worlds]], some growing, some decaying; some with no sun or moon, some with several. He held that every world has a beginning and an end, and that a world could be destroyed by collision with another world. To epitomize Democritus's cosmology, Russell calls on Shelley: "Worlds on worlds are rolling ever / From creation to decay, / Like the bubbles on a river / Sparkling, bursting, borne away."<ref>Russell, pp.71–72.</ref>
