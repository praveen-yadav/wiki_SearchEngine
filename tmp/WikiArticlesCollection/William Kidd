'''Captain William Kidd''' ([[circa|c.]] 1645 – 23 May 1701)<ref>{{cite web| year =2003| title =William Kidd| publisher =UXL Encyclopedia of World Biography| url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5229/is_2003/ai_n19152123| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] sailor who was tried and executed for [[piracy]] after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. Some modern historians deem his piratical reputation unjust, as there is evidence that Kidd acted only as a [[privateer]]. Kidd's fame springs largely from the sensational circumstances of his questioning before the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and the ensuing trial.  His actual depredations on the high seas, whether piratical or not, were both less destructive and less lucrative than those of many other contemporary pirates and privateers.

==Biography==
Captain William Kidd was either one of the most notorious pirates in the history of the world or one of its most unjustly vilified and prosecuted privateers in an age typified by the rationalisation of empire. Despite the legends and fiction surrounding this character, his actual career was punctuated by only a handful of skirmishes followed by a desperate quest to clear his name.

Kidd was born in Dundee, Scotland, January 1645. He gave the city as his place of birth and said he was aged 41 in testimony  under oath at the High Court of the Admiralty in October 1695 or 1694. Researcher Dr David Dobson later identified his baptism documents from Dundee in 1654. His father was  Captain John  Kyd, who was lost at sea. A local society supported the family financially {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.  Richard  Zacks in the biography The Pirate Hunter (2002) says Kidd came from Dundee. Reports that  Kidd came from Greenock have been dismissed by Dr. Dobson, who found neither the name Kidd nor Kyd in baptismal records.  The myth that his "father was thought to have been a Church of Scotland minister" is also discounted. There is no mention of the name in comprehensive Church of Scotland records for the period. A contrary view is presented here<ref>{{cite web| title =Pirates: William Kidd| publisher =Genealogy & Family History Achievements Heraldry and Research| url =http://www.achievements.co.uk/articles/william_kidd.html| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =WELCOME TO THE ULTIMATE CAPTAIN WILLIAM KIDD WEB SITE |url =http://www.pfrh.supanet.com/HISTORYBODY.htm| accessdate =13 December 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Kidd later settled in  the new colony of New York. It was here that he befriended many prominent colonial citizens, including three governors.  There is some information that suggests he was a seaman's apprentice on a pirate ship much earlier than his own more famous seagoing exploits.

The first records of his life date from 1689, when he was  a member of a French-English pirate crew that sailed in the Caribbean. Kidd and other members of the crew mutinied, ousted the captain of the ship, and sailed to the English colony of [[Nevis]]. There they renamed the ship the ''[[Blessed William]]''. Kidd became captain, either the result of an election of the ship's crew or because of appointment by Christopher Codrington, governor of the island of Nevis. Captain Kidd and the ''Blessed William'' became part of a small fleet assembled by Codrington to defend Nevis from the French, with whom the English were at war. In either case, he must have been an experienced leader and sailor by that time. As the governor did not want to pay the sailors for their defensive services, he told them they could take their pay from the French. Kidd and his men attacked the French island of Mariegalante, destroyed the only town, and looted the area, gathering for themselves something around 2,000 pounds Sterling.
During the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], on orders from the province of New York, [[Massachusetts]], Kidd captured an enemy [[privateer]], which duty he was commissioned to perform<ref>{{cite web| title =WILLIAM KIDD| publisher =Online Encyclopedia| url =http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/KHA_KRI/KIDD_WILLIAM.html| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> off the [[New England]] coast. Shortly thereafter, Kidd was awarded [[Pound sterling|£]]150 for successful privateering in the [[Caribbean]]. One year later, [[Robert Culliford|Captain Robert Culliford]], a notorious pirate, stole Kidd's ship while he was ashore at [[Antigua]] in the [[West Indies]]. In 1695, [[William III of England]] replaced the corrupt governor [[Benjamin Fletcher]], known for accepting bribes of one hundred dollars to allow illegal trading of pirate loot, with [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|Richard Coote]], Earl of Bellomont.<ref>{{cite web| date =2001-05 |title =Bellomont, Richard Coote, earl of| publisher =The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition| url =http://www.bartleby.com/65/be/Bellomon.html| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref>  In New York City, Kidd was active in the building of [[Trinity Church, New York]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Trinity Wall Street Historical Timeline |url =http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/history/?timeline| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref><ref name="trinity kidd blog">{{cite web | url=http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/news/blogs/the-archivists-mailbag/question-of-the-day-trinitys-very-own-pirate | title=Question of the Day: Trinity's Very Own Pirate? | publisher=Trinity Church | work=The Archivist's Mailbag | date=19 November 2008 | accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>

On 16 May 1691, Kidd married Sarah Bradley Cox Oort, an English woman in her early twenties, who had already been twice widowed and was one of the wealthiest women in New York, largely because of her inheritance from her first husband.<ref>Zacks, p. 82-83, 86.</ref>

===Preparing his expedition===
[[File:Captain Kidd in New York Harbor cph.3f06373.jpg|thumb|250px|''Captain Kidd in New York Harbor'', ca. 1920 painting by [[Jean Leon Gerome Ferris]]]]
On 11 December 1695, Belmont, who was now governing New York, [[Massachusetts]], and [[New Hampshire]], asked the "''trusty and well beloved Captain Kidd''"<ref name="Hamilton, 1961 p">Hamilton, (1961) p.?</ref> to attack [[Thomas Tew]], John Ireland, Thomas Wake, William Maze, and all others who associated themselves with pirates, along with any enemy French ships. This request, if turned down, would have been viewed as disloyalty to the crown, the perception of which carried much social stigma, making it difficult for Kidd to have done so. The request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].

Four-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], the Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]] and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]].  Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]].  This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and an acquaintance, Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]], orchestrated the whole plan and paid for the rest. Kidd had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The new ship, the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts" "The Real Captain Kidd| author =Frank R. Stockton| publisher =The Baldwin Online Children's Literature Project| url =http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=stockton&book=buccaneers&story=kidd| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> was well suited to the task of catching pirates; weighing over 284 [[burthen|tons burthen]], she was equipped with 34 [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|cannon]], oars, and 150 men. The oars were a key advantage as they enabled the ''Adventure Galley'' to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

{{quote |As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich as custom dictated.  The Navy yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd’s crew… responded with an astounding display of impudence—by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].<ref>Botting (1978) p.106</ref>}}

Because of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], this despite rampant protests.  Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission).  To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Among Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]], Hendrick van der Heul.  The quartermaster was considered 'second in command' to the captain in pirate culture of this era.  It is not clear, however, if Van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because Kidd was nominally a privateer.  Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been African or of African-American descent.  A contemporary source describes him as a "''small black Man''."  However, the meaning of this term is not certain as, in late seventeenth-century usage, the term ''negro'' would have been normally used, and the phrase "''black Man''" could mean either dark-skinned (but still "white") or black-haired.  If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest ranking black pirate so far identified.  Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel, and was never convicted of piracy.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Hunting for pirates===
In September 1696, Kidd [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew soon perished on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].  Kidd then sailed to the Strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] at the southern entrance of the [[Red Sea]], one of the most popular haunts of rovers on the [[Pirate Round]].  Here he again failed to find any pirates.  According to Edward Barlow, a captain employed by the [[English East India Company]], Kidd attacked a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] convoy here under escort by Barlow's [[East Indiaman]], and was repelled.  If the report is true, this marked Kidd's first foray into piracy.

As it became obvious his ambitious enterprise was failing, he became understandably desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, Kidd failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time the ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay on made constant [[coercion|open-threats]] of [[mutiny]].

[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd and his ship, the Adventure Galley, in [[New York Harbor]].]]
[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]
Kidd killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. While Kidd's gunner, William Moore, was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]], a Dutch ship appeared in sight.  Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger the Dutch-born King William.  Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, "If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more."  Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.<ref>Cordingly (1995), p.?</ref>

While seventeenth century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, outright murder was not permitted.  But Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had "good friends in England, that will bring me off for that."

===Accusations of piracy===
Acts of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and ''drubbed'' with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer to whom he had promised "thirty men or so".<ref name="Hamilton, 1961 p"/> Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On 30 January 1698, he raised French colours and took his greatest prize, an [[New Julfa|Armenian]] ship, the 400 ton ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Pirates of the High Seas – Capt. William Kidd| url =http://library.thinkquest.org/05aug/01841/kidd.html| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title ="Quedagh Merchant" (ship)| publisher =Encyclopedia Online| url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-486764/Quedagh-Merchant| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> which was loaded with [[satin]]s, [[muslin]]s, gold, silver, an incredible variety of [[East India]]n [[merchandise]], as well as extremely valuable silks. The captain of the ''Quedagh Merchant'' was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize.  When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to "pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices" for the "notorious piracies"<ref>Hamilton, (1961)</ref> they had committed.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd kept the French passes of the ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself.  While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep the ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo.  Renaming the seized merchantman the ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for Madagascar.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On 1 April 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. Here he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]] (the same man who had stolen Kidd’s ship years before), and his crew aboard the ''Mocha Frigate''.  Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford.  According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose very identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he "drank their Captain's health," swearing that "he was in every respect their Brother," and gave Culliford "a Present of an Anchor and some Guns."<ref>Charles Johnson (1728).  ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.</ref>  This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial.  The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd.''  According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill manned and ill equipped to take the ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came.  After the ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''.  However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd.  Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.<ref>Zacks, p. 185-86.</ref>

Both accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with the ''Adventure Galley.''  Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize.''{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Trial and execution===
[[File:Hanging of William Kidd.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Captain Kidd hanging in chains.]]
Prior to Kidd returning to New York City, he learned that he was a wanted pirate, and that several English [[men-of-war]] were searching for him.  Realizing that the ''Adventure Prize'' was a marked vessel, he cached it in the [[Caribbean Sea]] and continued toward New York aboard a sloop.  He deposited some of his treasure on [[Gardiners Island]], hoping to use his knowledge of its location as a bargaining tool.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Bellomont (an investor) was away in Boston, Massachusetts.  Aware of the accusations against Kidd, Bellomont was justifiably afraid of being implicated in piracy himself, and knew that presenting Kidd to England in chains was his best chance to save himself.  He lured Kidd into Boston with false promises of clemency,<ref>{{cite web| title =The Quest for the Armenian Vessel, Quedagh Merchant| publisher =AYAS Nautical Research Club| url =http://www.amarasonline.com/amaras/events/cillicia-flyer-1.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> then ordered him arrested on 6 July 1699. Kidd was placed in [[Boston Gaol (Massachusetts)|Stone Prison]], spending most of the time in [[solitary confinement]].  His wife, Sarah, was also imprisoned.  The conditions of Kidd's imprisonment were extremely harsh, and appear to have driven him at least temporarily insane.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

He was eventually (after over a year) sent to England for questioning by [[British Parliament|Parliament]].  The new Tory ministry hoped to use Kidd as a tool to discredit the Whigs who had backed him, but Kidd refused to name names, naively confident his patrons would reward his loyalty by interceding on his behalf. There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]] and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence.<ref>Zacks, p. 364.</ref>  He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder. He was found guilty on all charges (murder and five counts of piracy). He was hanged on 23 May 1701, at '[[Execution Dock]]', [[Wapping]], in London. During the execution, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd was hanged on the second attempt. His body was ''[[gibbet]]ed'' over the [[River Thames]] at Tilbury Point - as a warning to future would-be pirates - for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_piracy.htm|title=A brief history of piracy|publisher=Royal Navy Museum|accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref>

His associates  Richard Barleycorn, Robert Lamley, William Jenkins, Gabriel Loffe, Able Owens, and Hugh Parrot were convicted, but pardoned just prior to hanging at Execution Dock.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Kidd's [[British Whig Party|Whig]] backers were embarrassed by his trial. Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defence.  In particular, the two sets of French passes he had kept were missing at his trial.  These passes (and others dated 1700) resurfaced in the early twentieth century, misfiled with other government papers in a London building.<ref>{{cite book| author = Ralph Delahaye Paine| title = The Book of Buried Treasure: Being a True History of the Gold, Jewels, and Plate of Pirates, Galleons, Etc., which are Sought for to this Day| url = http://books.google.com/?id=XW0iYCM4q7QC&pg=PA124| year = 1911| publisher = Heinemann| isbn = | page = 124 }}</ref> These passes call the extent of Kidd's guilt into question. Along with the papers, many goods were brought from the ships and soon auctioned off as "pirate plunder." They were never mentioned in the trial.  Nevertheless, none of these items would have prevented his conviction for murdering Moore.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

As to the accusations of murdering Moore, on this he was mostly sunk on the testimony of the two former crew members, Palmer and Bradinham, who testified against him in exchange for pardons. A deposition Palmer gave when he was captured in Rhode Island two years earlier contradicted his testimony and may have supported Kidd's assertions, but Kidd was unable to obtain the deposition.

A [[Broadside (music)|broadside song]] ''Captain Kidd's Farewell to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament'' was printed shortly after his execution and popularised the common belief that Kidd had confessed to the false charges.<ref>The complete words of the original broadside song "Captain Kid's Farewel to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament, to the tune of Coming Down" are at [http://www.davidkidd.net/Captain_Kidd_Lyrics.html www.davidkidd.net/Captain_Kidd_Lyrics.html].</ref>

==Mythology and legend==
The belief that Kidd had left a buried [[treasure]] contributed considerably to the growth of his legend. The 1701 [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] song ''Captain Kid's Farewell to the Seas, or, the Famous Pirate's Lament''<ref>the complete words of the original song are at [http://www.davidkidd.net/CaptainKiddLyrics.html www.davidkidd.net/CaptainKiddLyrics.html], and also the genealogy of the  [http://www.davidkidd.net/CaptainKiddMusic.html historic tune.]</ref> lists "Two hundred bars of gold, and [[Rixdollar|rix dollars]] manifold, we seized uncontrolled". This belief made its contributions to literature in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Gold-Bug]]", [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Devil and Tom Walker]]'', [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and [[Nelson DeMille]]'s ''[[Plum Island (novel)|Plum Island]]''.  It also gave impetus to the never-ending treasure hunts conducted on [[Oak Island]] in Nova Scotia, in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], [[Long Island]] in New York where [[Gardiner's Island]] is located, [[Charles Island]] in Milford, [[Connecticut]], the [[Thimble Islands]] in [[Connecticut]], [[Norwalk Islands#Cockenoe Island|Cockenoe Island]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], [[Connecticut]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://blog.ctnews.com/kantor/2011/04/27/cockenoe-island-farm-distillery-power-plant-buried-treasure/|title = Cockenoe Island: Farm?

Captain Kidd did bury a small cache of treasure on [[Gardiners Island]] in a spot known as Cherry Tree Field; however, it was removed by Governor Bellomont and sent to England to be used as evidence against him.<ref>{{cite book| title =The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd| author =Richard Zacks| publisher =Hyperion| isbn =0-7868-8451-7| url =http://books.google.com/?id=8bu7WAHrd9kC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&vq=gardiners+island&dq=pirate+hunter |  accessdate =14 December 2007| year =2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Ralph Delahaye Paine| title = The Book of Buried Treasure: Being a True History of the Gold, Jewels, and Plate of Pirates, Galleons, Etc., which are Sought for to this Day| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tmFDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA304| year = 1911| publisher = Heinemann| isbn = | page = 304 }}</ref>

Kidd also visited [[Block Island]] around 1699, where he was supplied by Mrs. Mercy (Sands) Raymond, daughter of the mariner James Sands.  The story has it that, for her hospitality, Mrs. Raymond was bid to hold out her apron, into which Kidd threw gold and jewels until it was full.  After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to northern [[New London, Connecticut]] (later Montville), where she bought much land.  The Raymond family was thus said to have been "enriched by the apron".<ref>{{cite book |title=History of New London, Connecticut |last=Caulkins |first=Frances Manwaring |authorlink=Frances Manwaring Caulkins|year=1895 |page=293 }}</ref>

On [[Grand Manan]] in the [[Bay of Fundy]], as early as 1875, reference was made to searches on the West side of the island for treasure allegedly buried by Kidd during his time as a [[privateer]]. For nearly 200 years, this remote area of the island has been called "Money Cove".

In 1983, [[Cork Graham]] and Richard Knight went looking for Captain Kidd's buried treasure off the [[Vietnam]]ese island of [[Phú Quốc]].  Knight and Graham were caught, convicted of [[Illegal entry|illegally landing]] on Vietnamese territory, and assessed each a $10,000 [[fine (penalty)|fine]].  They were imprisoned for 11 months until they paid the fine.<ref name="Post12may">{{cite news|title=Tracking Captain Kidd's Treasure Puts Pair in Vietnamese Captivity|last=Branigin|first=William|date=12 May 1984|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
