'''Analcime''' or '''analcite''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''analkimos'' - "weak") is a white, grey, or colourless [[Silicate minerals|tectosilicate]] [[mineral]].  Analcime consists of hydrated [[sodium]] [[aluminium]] [[silicate]] in cubic [[crystal]]line form. Its [[chemical formula]] is [[sodium|Na]][[aluminium|Al]][[silicon|Si]]<sub>2</sub>[[oxygen|O]]<sub>6</sub>'''·'''[[water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]]. Minor amounts of [[potassium]] and [[calcium]] substitute for sodium. A [[silver]]-bearing synthetic variety also exists (Ag-analcite).

Analcime is usually classified as a [[zeolite]] mineral, but structurally and chemically it is more similar to the [[feldspathoid]]s. Analcime occurs as a primary mineral in analcime [[basalt]] and other alkaline [[igneous rocks]]. It also occurs as cavity and vesicle fillings associated with [[prehnite]], [[calcite]], and zeolites. 

Locations include the [[Cyclopean Islands]] east off [[Sicily]] and near [[Trentino]] in northern [[Italy]]; [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in [[Australia]]; [[Kerguelen Island]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]; in the [[Lake Superior]] copper district of [[Michigan]], Bergen Hill, [[New Jersey]], [[Golden, Colorado]], and at [[Searles Lake]], [[California]] in the [[United States]]; and at Cape Blomidon, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Mont Saint-Hilaire]], [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]; and in [[Iceland]].
