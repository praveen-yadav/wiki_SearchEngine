{{Politics of Burkina Faso}}
The '''Politics of Burkina Faso''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Burkina Faso]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. The party system is dominated by the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Political history==
In 1990, the [[Popular Front (Burkina Faso)|Popular Front]] held its first National Congress, which formed a committee to draft a national constitution. The constitution was approved by referendum in 1991. In 1992, [[Blaise Compaoré]] was elected president, running unopposed after the opposition boycotted the election because of Compaoré's refusal to accede to demands of the opposition such as a sovereign National Conference to set modalities. The opposition did participate in the following year's legislative elections, in which the [[ODP/MT]] won a majority of seats.

The government of the Fourth Republic includes a strong presidency, a prime minister, a Council of Ministers presided over by the president, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legislature and judiciary are independent but remain susceptible to outside influence.

In 1995, Burkina held its first multiparty municipal elections since independence. The president's ODP/MT won over 1,100 of some 1,700 councillor seats being contested.

In February 1996, the ruling ODP/MT merged with several small opposition parties to form the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]] (CDP). This effectively co-opted much of what little viable opposition to Compaoré existed. The remaining opposition parties regrouped in preparation for 1997 legislative elections and the 1998 presidential election. The 1997 legislative elections, which international observers pronounced to be substantially free, fair, and transparent, resulted in a large CDP majority—101 to 111 seats.

The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and may serve up to two terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the consent of the legislature.
The constitution of June 2, 1991, established a semi-presidential government with a parliament (Assemblée) which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of 5 years. The year 2000 saw a constitutional amendment reducing the presidential term from 7 to 5 years, which was enforced during the 2005 elections. Another change according to the amendment would have prevented sitting president [[Blaise Compaoré]] from being re-elected. However, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that because Compaoré was already a sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office, thereby clearing the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On November 13 Compaoré was reelected in a landslide due to a divided political opposition.

===Legislative branch===
The [[National Assembly of Burkina Faso|National Assembly]] (''Assemblée Nationale'') has 111 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]].
