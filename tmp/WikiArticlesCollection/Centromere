The '''centromere''' is the part of a [[chromosome]] that links [[sister chromatids]]. During [[mitosis]], [[Spindle apparatus|spindle fibers]] attach to the centromere via the [[kinetochore]].<ref name=Pollard>{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=T.D.|title=Cell Biology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-2255-8|pages=200–203}}</ref>   Centromeres were first defined as genetic loci that direct the behavior of chromosomes.  Their physical role is to act as the site of assembly of the [[kinetochore]] - a highly complex multiprotein structure that is responsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation - e.g. binding [[microtubules]] and signalling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes have adopted correct attachments  to the [[Spindle apparatus|spindle]], so that it is safe for cell division to proceed to completion (i.e. for cells to enter [[anaphase]]).<ref name=Pollard-2>{{cite book|last=Pollard|first=TD|title=Cell Biology|year=2007|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-4160-2255-8|pages=227–230}}</ref>  There are broadly speaking two types of centromeres.  "Point centromeres" bind to specific proteins that recognise particular DNA sequences with high efficiency.<ref name=Pluta>{{cite journal|last=Pluta|first=A.|coauthors=A.M. Mackay, A.M. Ainsztein, I.G. Goldberg & W.C. Earnshaw.|title=The centromere:  Hub of chromosomal activities.|journal=Science|year=1995|volume=270|pages=1591–1594|pmid=7502067|doi=10.1126/science.270.5242.1591|issue=5242}}</ref>  Any piece of DNA with the point centromere DNA sequence on it will typically form a centromere if present in the appropriate species.  The best characterised point centromeres are those of the budding yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. "Regional centromeres" is the term coined to describe most centromeres, which typically form on regions of preferred DNA sequence, but which can form on other DNA sequences as well.<ref name=Pluta />  The signal for formation of a regional centromere appears to be [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]]. Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' to humans, have regional centromeres.

Regarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted region of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where two identical [[sister chromatids]] are most closely in contact. When cells enter mitosis, the sister chromatids (which represent the two copies of each chromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication earlier in the cell cycle and packaged by histones and other proteins into chromatin) are linked all along their length by the action of the [[cohesin]] complex.  It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=sisterchromatidcohesion |title=Sister chromatid cohesion |date=May 15, 2011 |work=Genetics Home Reference |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]]}}</ref>

==Positions==<!-- Subsections of this section are linked in [[Lund's Amphibious Rat]]-->
Each chromosome has two arms, labeled p (the shorter of the two) and q (the longer). The p arm is named for "petit" meaning 'small'; the q arm is named q simply because it follows p in the alphabet. (According to the NCBI, "q" refers to the French word "queue" meaning 'tail'.) They can be connected in either metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric or telocentric manner.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Metacentric===
These are X-Shaped chromosomes,have centromere in the middle so that the two arms of the chromosomes are almost equal.

A chromosome is '''metacentric''' if its two arms are roughly equal in length. In a normal human karyotype, two chromosomes are considered metacentric: chromosomes 1 and 3. In some cases, a metacentric chromosome is formed by balanced translocation: the fusion of two [[#Acrocentric|acrocentric]] chromosomes to form one metacentric chromosome.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Educ/PolyMecaEng.html|title= Chromosomes, Chromosome Anomalies}}</ref>

===Submetacentric===
If arms' lengths are unequal, the chromosome is said to be '''submetacentric'''.<ref name="amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com/Thompson-Genetics-Medicine-Sixth-Edition/dp/0721669026</ref>

===Acrocentric===
If the p (short) arm is so short that it is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is '''acrocentric''' (the "[[:wiktionary:acro-|acro-]]" in acrocentric refers to the Greek word for "peak"). The [[human genome]] includes six acrocentric chromosomes: [[Chromosome 13 (human)|13]], [[Chromosome 14 (human)|14]], [[Chromosome 15 (human)|15]], [[Chromosome 21 (human)|21]], [[Chromosome 22 (human)|22]] and [[Y chromosome]].<ref name="amazon.com"/>

In an acrocentric chromosome the p arm contains genetic material including repeated sequences such as nucleolar organizing regions, and can be translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced [[Robertsonian translocation]]. The [[horse|domestic horse]] genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to two acrocentric chromosomes in the [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] but undomesticated [[Przewalski's horse]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=222–5 |doi=10.1159/000075753 |title=FISH analysis comparing genome organization in the domestic horse ''(Equus caballus)'' to that of the Mongolian wild horse ''(E. przewalskii)'' |year=2003 |last1=Myka |first1=J.L. |last2=Lear |first2=T.L. |last3=Houck |first3=M.L. |last4=Ryder |first4=O.A. |last5=Bailey |first5=E. |journal=Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume=102 |pmid=14970707 |issue=1–4}}</ref> This may reflect either fixation of a balanced Robertsonian translocation in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes; in this case, because more species are [[extant taxon|extant]], it is apparent that the evolutionary sequence is a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see [[Karyotype#Historical note]]).<ref name="amazon.com"/>

===Telocentric===
A '''telocentric''' chromosome's centromere is located at the terminal end of the chromosome. [[Telomeres]] may extend from both ends of the chromosome. For example, the standard [[house mouse]] karyotype has only telocentric chromosomes.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lee M. |last=Silver |year=1995 |chapter=Karyotypes, Chromosomes, and Translocations |chapterurl=http://www.informatics.jax.org/silver/chapters/5-2.shtml |title=Mouse Genetics: Concepts and Applications |pages=83–92 |isbn=978-0-19-507554-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=520–62 |doi=10.1038/nature01262 |title=Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome |year=2002 |last1=Chinwalla |first1=Asif T. |last2=Cook |first2=Lisa L. |last3=Delehaunty |first3=Kimberly D. |last4=Fewell |first4=Ginger A. |last5=Fulton |first5=Lucinda A. |last6=Fulton |first6=Robert S. |last7=Graves |first7=Tina A. |last8=Hillier |first8=Ladeana W. |last9=Mardis |first9=Elaine R. |journal=Nature |volume=420 |issue=6915 |pmid=12466850}}</ref> Humans do not possess telocentric chromosomes.

===Subtelocentric===
If the chromosome's centromere is located closer to its end than to its center, it may be described as '''subtelocentric'''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Holocentric===
With '''holocentric''' chromosomes, the entire length of the chromosome acts as the centromere. Examples of this type of centromere can be found scattered throughout the plant and animal kingdoms,<ref>{{cite journal |pages=F33–8 |doi= 10.1083/jcb.153.6.F33 |title=Here, There, and Everywhere: Kinetochore Function on Holocentric Chromosomes |year=2001 |last1=Dernburg |first1=A. F. |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |volume=153 |issue=6 |pmid=11402076 |pmc=2192025}}</ref> with the most well known example being the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.

==Sequence==
There are two types of centromeres.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1591–4 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5242.1591 |title=The Centromere: Hub of Chromosomal Activities |year=1995 |last1=Pluta |first1=A. F. |last2=MacKay |first2=A. M. |last3=Ainsztein |first3=A. M. |last4=Goldberg |first4=I. G. |last5=Earnshaw |first5=W. C. |journal=Science |volume=270 |issue=5242 |pmid=7502067}}</ref> In regional centromeres, [[DNA]] sequences contribute to but do not define function. Regional centromeres contain large amounts of DNA and are often packaged into [[heterochromatin]]. In most [[eukaryotes]], the centromere's DNA sequence consists of large arrays of repetitive DNA (e.g. [[satellite DNA]]) where the sequence within individual repeat elements is similar but not identical. In humans, the primary centromeric repeat unit is called α-satellite (or alphoid), although a number of other sequence types are found in this region.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |pages=75–94 |doi=10.1007/s00438-010-0553-4 |title=Centromere Identity: a challenge to be faced |year=2010 |last1=Mehta |first1=G. D. |last2=Agarwal |first2=M. |last3=Ghosh |first3=S. K. |journal=Mol. Genet. Genomics |volume=284 |issue=2 |pmid=20585957}}</ref>

Point centromeres are smaller and more compact. DNA sequences are both necessary and sufficient to specify centromere identity and function in organisms with point centromeres. In budding yeasts, the centromere region is relatively small (about 125 bp DNA) and contains two highly conserved DNA sequences that serve as binding sites for essential [[kinetochore]] proteins.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Inheritance==
Since centromeric DNA sequence is not the key determinant of centromeric identity in metazoans, it is thought that [[epigenetic inheritance]] plays a major role in specifying the centromere.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=273–82 |doi=10.1139/O08-135 |title=Epigenetic specification of centromeres |year=2009 |last1=Dalal |first1=Yamini |journal=Biochemistry and Cell Biology |volume=87 |pmid=19234541 |issue=1}}</ref> The daughter chromosomes will assemble centromeres in the same place as the parent chromosome, independent of sequence. It has been proposed that histone H3 variant CENP-A (Centromere Protein A) is the epigenetic mark of the centromere.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=3233–41 |doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.07.023 |title=Epigenetic specification of centromeres by CENP-A |year=2009 |last1=Bernad |first1=Rafael |last2=Sánchez |first2=Patricia |last3=Losada |first3=Ana |journal=Experimental Cell Research |volume=315 |issue=19 |pmid=19660450}}</ref> The question arises whether there must be still some original way in which the centromere is specified, even if it is subsequently propagated epigenetically. If the centromere is inherited epigenetically from one generation to the next, the problem is pushed back to the origin of the first metazoans.

==Structure==
The centromeric DNA is normally in a [[heterochromatin]] state, which is essential for the recruitment of the [[cohesin]] complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion after DNA replication as well as coordinating sister chromatid separation during anaphase. In this chromatin, the normal [[histone]] H3 is replaced with a centromere-specific variant, CENP-A in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=85–93 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddi008 |title=Variable and hierarchical size distribution of L1-retroelement-enriched CENP-A clusters within a functional human neocentromere |year=2004 |last1=Chueh |first1=A. C. |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=14 |pmid=15537667 |last2=Wong |first2=LH |last3=Wong |first3=N |last4=Choo |first4=KH |issue=1}}</ref> The presence of CENP-A is believed to be important for the assembly of the kinetochore on the centromere. CENP-C has been shown to localise almost exclusively to these regions of CENP-A associated chromatin. In human cells, the histones are found to be most enriched for H4K20me3 and H3K9me3<ref name="Rosenfeld_2009">{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-143 |title=Determination of enriched histone modifications in non-genic portions of the human genome |year=2009 |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Jeffrey A |last2=Wang |first2=Zhibin |last3=Schones |first3=Dustin E |last4=Zhao |first4=Keji |last5=Desalle |first5=Rob |last6=Zhang |first6=Michael Q |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=10 |pages=143 |pmid=19335899 |pmc=2667539}}</ref> which are known heterochromatic modifications.

In the yeast ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'' (and probably in other eukaryotes), the formation of centromeric heterochromatin is connected to [[RNAi]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1833–7 |doi=10.1126/science.1074973 |title=Regulation of Heterochromatic Silencing and Histone H3 Lysine-9 Methylation by RNAi |year=2002 |last1=Volpe |first1=T. A. |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5588 |pmid=12193640 |last2=Kidner |first2=C |last3=Hall |first3=IM |last4=Teng |first4=G |last5=Grewal |first5=SI |last6=Martienssen |first6=RA}}</ref> In nematodes such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', some plants, and the insect orders Lepidoptera and Hemiptera, chromosomes are "holocentric", indicating that there is not a primary site of microtubule attachments or a primary constriction, and a "diffuse" kinetochore assembles along the entire length of the chromosome.

==Centromeric aberrations==
In rare cases in humans, neocentromeres can form at new sites on the chromosome. There are currently over 90 known human neocentromeres identified on 20 different chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=261–82 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.009 |title=Neocentromeres: New Insights into Centromere Structure, Disease Development, and Karyotype Evolution |year=2008 |last1=Marshall |first1=Owen J. |last2=Chueh |first2=Anderly C. |last3=Wong |first3=Lee H. |last4=Choo |first4=K.H. Andy |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=82 |issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pages=617–26 |doi=10.1023/B:CHRO.0000036585.44138.4b |title=Chromosomal dynamics of human neocentromere formation |year=2004 |last1=Warburton |first1=Peter E. |journal=Chromosome Research |volume=12 |issue=6 |pmid=15289667}}</ref> The formation of a neocentromere must be coupled with the inactivation of the previous centromere, since chromosomes with two functional centromeres ([[Dicentric chromosome]]) will result in chromosome breakage during mitosis. In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally euchromatic and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether.

Centromere proteins are also the autoantigenic target for some [[anti-nuclear antibodies]], such as [[anti-centromere antibodies]].
