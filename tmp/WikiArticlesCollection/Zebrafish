The '''zebrafish''' (''Danio rerio'') is a tropical [[freshwater fish]] belonging to the minnow [[Family (biology)|family]] ([[Cyprinidae]]) of [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Cypriniformes]].<ref name="fishbase">{{FishBase species|genus=Danio|species=rerio||month=March|year=2007}}</ref> Native to the [[Himalayas|Himalayan region]], it is a popular [[Aquarium|aquarium fish]], frequently sold under the trade name '''zebra danio'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaticstoyourdoor.co.uk/Zebra-Danio.html|title=Zebra Danio|publisher=Aquatics To Your Door|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> The zebrafish is also an important vertebrate [[model organism]] in scientific research.

==Taxonomy==
The zebrafish is a [[derived trait|derived]] member of the genus ''[[Danio]]'', of the family [[Cyprinidae]]. It has a [[cladistics|sister-group]] relationship with ''[[Danio kyathit]]''.<ref name="Mayden">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21175 |title=Phylogenetic relationships of ''Danio'' within the order Cypriniformes: A framework for comparative and evolutionary studies of a model species |year=2007 |last1=Mayden |first1=Richard L. |last2=Tang |first2=Kevin L. |last3=Conway |first3=Kevin W. |last4=Freyhof |first4=Jörg |last5=Chamberlain |first5=Sarah |last6=Haskins |first6=Miranda |last7=Schneider |first7=Leah |last8=Sudkamp |first8=Mitchell |last9=Wood |first9=Robert M. |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution |volume=308B |issue=5 |pmid=17554749 |pages=642–54}}</ref> Zebrafish are also closely related to the genus ''[[Devario]]'', as demonstrated by a [[phylogenetic tree]] of close species.<ref name=Parichy2006>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800867 |title=Evolution of danio pigment pattern development |year=2006 |last1=Parichy |first1=D M |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=200–10 |pmid=16835593}}</ref> The zebrafish was referred to in scientific literature as ''Brachydanio rerio'' for many years until its reassignment to the genus ''Danio''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Zebrafish Book|url=http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html|publisher=ZFIN|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref>

==Distribution==
The zebrafish is native to the streams of the southeastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region,<ref name="Mayden"/> and is found in parts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Burma.<ref name="NAS factsheet">{{cite web |url=http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=505 |work=Nonindigenous Aquatic Species |title=Danio rerio |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date=June 14, 2013 |accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref> The species arose in the [[Ganges]] region in eastern India, and commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches, ponds, and slow-moving or [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] water bodies, including [[rice paddy|rice fields]].<ref name="beec" /> Zebrafish have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to parts of the United States, presumably by deliberate release or by escape from fish farms.<ref name="NAS factsheet"/>

==Description==
The zebrafish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal, blue stripes on the side of the body, which are reminiscent of a [[zebra]]'s stripes, and which extend to the end of the [[caudal fin]]. Its shape is [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] and laterally compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. The male is [[torpedo]]-shaped, with gold stripes between the blue stripes; the female has a larger, whitish belly and silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females will exhibit a small [[Fish anatomy#Reproductive system|genital papilla]] in front of the [[anal fin]] origin. The zebrafish can grow to {{convert|6.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, although it seldom grows larger than {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in captivity. Its lifespan in captivity is around two to three years, although in ideal conditions, this may be extended to five years.<ref name=beec/>

==Reproduction==
[[File:Zebrafish95-300.jpg|thumb|right|A juvenile zebrafish.]]
The approximate [[generation time]] for ''Danio rerio'' is three to four months. A male must be present for [[ovulation]] and [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of two to three days, laying hundreds of eggs in each [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]. Upon release, embryonic development begins; absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes ''D. rerio'' a convenient research model [[species]].<ref name=beec>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00030.x |title=The behaviour and ecology of the zebrafish, Danio rerio |year=2007 |last1=Spence |first1=Rowena |last2=Gerlach |first2=Gabriele |last3=Lawrence |first3=Christian |last4=Smith |first4=Carl |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=83 |pages=13–34 |pmid=18093234 |issue=1}}</ref>
[[File:Zebrafish Cycle.png|thumb|left|Diagram showing the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a zebrafish from fertilization to adulthood.]]
The zebrafish embryo develops rapidly – precursors to all major organs appear within 36 hours of fertilization, and hatching takes place 12–36 hours later, depending on the embryo's internal conditions and the external temperature, which is ideally {{convert|28.5|°C|°F}}. Swimming and feeding behavior begin about 36 hours later. The sex of juveniles cannot be distinguished except by dissection, and sex determinants are not clearly understood.

To encourage the fish to spawn, some researchers use a fish tank with a sliding bottom insert, which reduces the depth of the pool. The technique is most effective in the early morning, given that ovulation and spawning are enhanced by light. Researchers have been able to collect 10,000 embryos in 10 minutes using this method.<ref name=Spawning2012/> Male zebrafish are furthermore known to respond to more pronounced markings on females, i.e., "good stripes", but in a group, males will mate with whichever females they can find. What attracts females is not currently understood. The presence of plants, even plastic plants, also apparently encourages spawning.<ref name=Spawning2012>{{cite web|last=Dockser |first=Amy |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203436904577154962232874998.html |title=Birds Do It, Bees Do It, Even Zebrafish Do It—Just Too Little |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Feeding==
Zebrafish are [[omnivorous]], primarily eating [[zooplankton]], insects, insect [[larva]]e, and [[phytoplankton]], although they can eat a variety of other foods, such as worms and small [[crustacean]]s, if their preferred food sources are not readily available.<ref name=beec/> Most zebrafish accept common food flakes and [[tubifex worm]]s in the [[aquarium]].

==Aquarium care==
Zebrafish are hardy fish and considered good for beginner aquarists. Their enduring popularity can be attributed to their playful disposition,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00012.x |title=A call to fins! Zebrafish as a gerontological model |year=2002 |last1=Gerhard |first1=Glenn S. |last2=Cheng |first2=Keith C. |journal=Aging Cell |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=104–11 |pmid=12882339}}</ref> as well as their rapid breeding, aesthetics, cheap price, and broad availability. They also do well in schools or [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] of six or more, and interact well with other fish species in the aquarium. However, they are susceptible to ''[[Oodinium]]'' or velvet disease, [[microsporidia]] (''Pseudoloma neurophilia''), and ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species. Given the opportunity, adults eat hatchlings, which may be protected by separating the two groups with a net, breeding box or separate tank.

==Strains==
In late 2003, [[transgenic]] zebrafish that express [[green fluorescent protein|green]], red, and [[yellow fluorescent protein]]s became commercially available in the United States. The fluorescent strains are tradenamed [[GloFish]]; other cultivated varieties include 'golden', 'sandy', 'longfin' and 'leopard'.

The leopard danio, previously known as ''Danio frankei'', is a spotted colour [[morph (zoology)|morph]] of the zebrafish which arose due to a pigment mutation.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400757 |title=Spot pattern of leopard Danio is caused by mutation in the zebrafish connexin41.8 gene |year=2006 |last1=Watanabe |first1=Masakatsu |last2=Iwashita |first2=Motoko |last3=Ishii |first3=Masaru |last4=Kurachi |first4=Yoshihisa |last5=Kawakami |first5=Atsushi |last6=Kondo |first6=Shigeru |last7=Okada |first7=Norihiro |journal=EMBO reports |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=893–7 |pmid=16845369 |pmc=1559663}}</ref> [[Xanthochromism|Xanthistic]] forms of both the zebra and leopard pattern, along with long-finned subspecies, have been obtained via selective breeding programs for the aquarium trade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mills |first=Dick |title=Eyewitness Hnbk Aquarium Fish |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1993 |isbn=0-7322-5012-9 }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>

===Hybrids===
Hybrids between different ''Danio'' species may be fertile: for example, between ''D. rerio'' and ''D. nigrofasciatus''.<ref name=Parichy2006/>

==In scientific research==
[[Image:Zfishchroma.jpg|thumb|upright|Zebrafish [[chromatophore]]s, shown here mediating [[camouflage|background adaptation]], are widely studied by scientists.]]
[[Image:Zebrafish embryos.png|thumb|A zebrafish pigment mutant (bottom) produced by insertional [[mutagenesis]].<ref name=Parichy2006/> A wild-type embryo (top) is shown for comparison. The mutant lacks black [[pigment]] in its [[melanocyte]]s because it is unable to synthesize [[melanin]] properly.]]

''D. rerio'' is a common and useful [[model organism]] for studies of [[vertebrate]] development and [[gene]] function. Its use as a laboratory animal was pioneered by [[George Streisinger]] and colleagues at the [[University of Oregon]]. Its importance has been consolidated by successful large-scale forward [[genetic screen]]s (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens). The fish has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the [[Zebrafish Information Network]] (ZFIN). ''D. rerio'' is also one of the few fish species [[Animals in space|to have been sent into space]].

Research with ''D. rerio'' has yielded advances in the fields of [[developmental biology]], [[oncology]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004361 |title=Identifying Tumor Cell Growth Inhibitors by Combinatorial Chemistry and Zebrafish Assays |year=2009 |editor1-last=Isalan |editor1-first=Mark |last1=Xiang |first1=Jing |last2=Yang |first2=Hongbo |last3=Che |first3=Chao |last4=Zou |first4=Haixia |last5=Yang |first5=Hanshuo |last6=Wei |first6=Yuquan |last7=Quan |first7=Junmin |last8=Zhang |first8=Hui |last9=Yang |first9=Zhen |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e4361 |pmid=19194508 |pmc=2633036}}</ref> [[toxicology]],<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfi110 |title=Zebrafish as a Model Vertebrate for Investigating Chemical Toxicity |year=2005 |last1=Hill |first1=A.

===Model characteristics===
As a model biological system, the zebrafish possesses numerous advantages for scientists. Its [[genome]] has been [[whole genome sequencing|fully sequenced]], and it has well-understood, easily observable and testable developmental behaviors. Its [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] is very rapid, and its embryos are relatively large, robust, and transparent, and able to develop outside their mother.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Zebrafish Exposed |first1=Ralf |last1=Dahm |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=5 |year=2006 |pages=446–53 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-zebrafish-exposed}}</ref> Furthermore, well-characterized mutant strains are readily available.

Other advantages include the species' nearly constant size during early development, which enables simple [[staining]] techniques to be used, and the fact that its two-celled embryo can be fused into a single cell to create a [[homozygous]] embryo. The zebrafish is also demonstrably similar to mammalian models and humans in toxicity testing, and exhibits a diurnal sleep cycle with similarities to mammalian sleep behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050281 |title=Let Sleeping Zebrafish Lie: A New Model for Sleep Studies |year=2007 |last1=Jones |first1=Rachel |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=e281 |pmid=20076649 |pmc=2020498}}</ref>

===Regeneration===
Zebrafish have the ability to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] their fins, skin, heart and, in larval stages, brain.<ref name=Wade>{{cite news |title=Research Offers Clue Into How Hearts Can Regenerate in Some Species |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |work=[[New York Times]] |date=March 24, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/science/25heart.html|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref> Zebrafish heart muscle regeneration does not make use of [[stem cell]]s; instead, mature heart muscle cells regress to a stem cell-like state and redifferentiate.<ref name=Wade/> In 2011, the [[British Heart Foundation]] ran an advertising campaign publicising their intention to study the applicability of this ability to humans, by raising £50 million in research funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djFb8PGS34g |title=Mending Broken Hearts (2011) British Heart Foundation TV ad |publisher=[[British Heart Foundation]] via [[YouTube]] |date=January 31, 2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhf.org.uk/research/mending-broken-hearts-appeal/the-science.aspx?pid=p&sc_cid=MBH-EX-24&utm_source=MBH-AW&utm_medium=MBH-AW&utm_campaign=MBH-AW-G9_010211&gclid=CL2w_L2hhqcCFcgf4QodBA25eA |title=British Heart Foundation – The science behind the appeal |publisher=Bhf.org.uk |date=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref>

Zebrafish have also been found to regenerate [[photoreceptor cells]] and [[retina]]l neurons following injury, which has been shown to be mediated by the dedifferentiation and proliferation of [[Muller glia|Müller glia]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1624-07.2007 |title=Late-Stage Neuronal Progenitors in the Retina Are Radial Muller Glia That Function as Retinal Stem Cells |year=2007 |last1=Bernardos |first1=Rebecca L. |last2=Barthel |first2=Linda K. |last3=Meyers |first3=Jason R. |last4=Raymond |first4=Pamela A. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=27 |issue=26 |pages=7028–40 |pmid=17596452}}</ref> Researchers frequently [[amputate]] the dorsal and ventral tail fins and analyze their regrowth to test for mutations. It has been found that [[Histone methylation|histone demethylation]] occurs at the site of the amputation, switching the zebrafish's cells to an "active", regenerative, stem cell-like state.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0904132106 |laysummary=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091102171419.htm |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=November 2, 2009 |title=A histone demethylase is necessary for regeneration in zebrafish |year=2009 |last1=Stewart |first1=Scott |last2=Tsun |first2=Zhi-Yang |last3=Izpisua Belmonte |first3=Juan Carlos |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |pmid=19897725 |jstor=25593294 |pmc=2785262 |volume=106 |issue=47 |pages=19889–94}}</ref> In 2012, Australian scientists published a study revealing that zebrafish use a specialised [[protein]], known as [[fibroblast growth factor]], to ensure their [[spinal cord]]s heal without [[glial scar]]ring after injury.<ref name=Regen2012>{{cite journal |pmid=22649227 |laysummary=http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/biochemistry/article00366.html |laysource=Sci-News.com |laydate=June 1, 2012 |year=2012 |last1=Goldshmit |first1=Yona |last2=Sztal |first2=Tamar E. |last3=Jusuf |first3=Patricia R. |last4=Hall |first4=Thomas E. |last5=Nguyen-Chi |first5=Mai |last6=Currie |first6=Peter D. |title=Fgf-Dependent Glial Cell Bridges Facilitate Spinal Cord Regeneration in Zebrafish |volume=32 |issue=22 |pages=7477–92 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0758-12.2012 |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience}}</ref>

Another focus of zebrafish research is to understand how a gene called [[Hedgehog (gene)|Hedgehog]], a biological signal that underlies a number of human cancers, controls cell growth. In probing disorders of the nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders and deafness, researchers are using the zebrafish to understand how the genetic defects underlying these conditions cause functional abnormalities in the human brain, spinal cord and sensory organs. Researchers have also studied the zebrafish to gain new insights into the complexities of human musculoskeletal diseases, such as [[muscular dystrophy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/suppl_2/R265.full|title=The zebrafish as a model for muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy|work=Human Molecular Genetics|date=August 8, 2003|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

===Genetics===

====Gene expression====
Due to their short lifecycles and relatively large clutch sizes, zebrafish are a useful model for genetic studies. A common [[reverse genetics]] technique is to [[gene knockdown|reduce gene expression]] or modify [[Splicing (genetics)|splicing]] using [[Morpholino]] [[antisense]] technology. Morpholino [[oligonucleotide]]s (MO) are stable, synthetic [[macromolecules]] that contain the same [[nucleosides|bases]] as DNA or RNA; by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they reduce the [[gene expression|expression]] of specific genes. MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules,<ref name=blast2>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(85)90010-7 |title=Cell lineage of zebrafish blastomeres |year=1985 |last1=Kimmel |first1=Charles B. |last2=Law |first2=Robert D. |journal=Developmental Biology |volume=108 |pages=78–85 |pmid=3972182 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name=blast4>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0012-1606(85)90012-0 |title=Cell lineage of zebrafish blastomeres |year=1985 |last1=Kimmel |first1=Charles B. |last2=Law |first2=Robert D. |journal=Developmental Biology |volume=108 |pages=94–101 |pmid=3972184 |issue=1}}</ref> allowing diffusion between cells. 

A known problem with gene knockdowns is that, because the genome underwent a [[genome#Genome evolution|duplication]] after the divergence of [[ray-finned fish]]es and [[lobe-finned fish]]es, it is not always easy to silence the activity one of the two gene [[paralog]]s reliably due to [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] by the other paralog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/350352/|title=In Vivo Testing of MicroRNA-Mediated Gene Knockdown in Zebrafish|work=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|publisher=Hindawi|year=2012|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref> Despite the complications of the zebrafish [[genome]], a number of commercially available global platforms exist for analysis of both gene expression by [[expression profiling|microarrays]] and promoter regulation using [[ChIP-on-chip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14500831|title=Evaluation of gene expression measurements from commercial microarray platforms|work=Nucleic Acids Res.|publisher=NCBI|year=2003|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref>

====Genome sequencing====
The [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]] started the zebrafish genome sequencing project in 2001, and the full genome sequence of  the Tuebingen reference strain is publicly available at  the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)'s [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?term=danio%20rerio Zebrafish Genome Page]. The zebrafish reference genome sequence is annotated as part of the [[Ensembl]] [http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/Info/Index project], and is maintained by the [[Genome Reference Consortium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Genome Reference Consortium|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/|publisher=GRC|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, researchers at the [[Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology]] in [[Delhi]], India, announced the sequencing of the genome of a wild zebrafish strain, containing 1.7 billion genetic letters.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Decoding-the-Genome-Mystery/485122 "Decoding the Genome Mystery"]. ''[[Indian Express]]''. July 5, 2009. Retrieved February 5, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://genome.igib.res.in FishMap Zv8]. [[Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology]] (IGIB). Retrieved June 7, 2012.</ref> The genome of the wild zebrafish was sequenced at 39-fold coverage. Comparative analysis with the zebrafish reference genome revealed over 5 million single nucleotide variations and over 1.6 million insertion deletion variations. The zebrafish reference genome sequence was published by Kerstin Howe ''et al.'' in 2013.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12111.html "The zebrafish reference genome sequence and its relationship to the human genome"]. ''Nature'' ([[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1038/nature12111). 2013. Retrieved June 16, 2013.</ref>

====Mitochondrial DNA====
In October 2001, researchers from the [[University of Oklahoma]] published ''D. rerio's'' complete [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequence.<ref name=2001Journal>{{cite journal |first1=Richard E. |last1=Broughton |first2=Jami E. |last2=Milam |first3=Bruce A. |last3=Roe |title=The Complete Sequence of the Zebrafish (''Danio rerio'') Mitochondrial Genome and Evolutionary Patterns in Vertebrate Mitochondrial DNA |journal=Genome Research |pmid=11691861 |pmc=311132 |doi=10.1101/gr.156801 |doi_brokendate=November 15, 2012 |url=http://genome.cshlp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11691861 |year=2001 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=1958–67}}</ref> Its length is 16,596 base pairs. This is within 100 base pairs of other related species of fish, and it is notably only 18 pairs longer than the [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus'') and 21 longer than the [[carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio''). Its gene order and content are identical to the common [[vertebrate]] form of mitochondrial DNA. It contains 13 [[protein]]-coding genes and a noncoding control region containing the [[origin of replication]] for the heavy strand. In between a grouping of five [[tRNA]] genes, a sequence resembling vertebrate origin of light strand replication is found. It is difficult to draw evolutionary conclusions because it is difficult to determine whether base pair changes have adaptive significance via comparisons with other vertebrates' [[nucleotide]] sequences.<ref name=2001Journal/>

====Pigmentation genes====
In December 2005, a study of the ''golden'' strain identified the gene responsible for its unusual pigmentation as [[SLC24A5]], a [[Solution|solute]] carrier that appeared to be required for [[melanin]] production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The [[Orthologue|orthologous]] gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to strongly segregate fair-skinned Europeans and dark-skinned Africans.<ref>{{

====Transgenesis====
Transgenesis is a popular approach to study the function of genes in zebrafish. Construction of transgenic zebrafish is rather easy by a method using the Tol2 transposon system.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2004.06.005 |title=A Transposon-Mediated Gene Trap Approach Identifies Developmentally Regulated Genes in Zebrafish |year=2004 |last1=Kawakami |first1=Koichi |last2=Takeda |first2=Hisashi |last3=Kawakami |first3=Noriko |last4=Kobayashi |first4=Makoto |last5=Matsuda |first5=Naoto |last6=Mishina |first6=Masayoshi |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=7 |pages=133–44 |pmid=15239961 |issue=1}}</ref>

====Transparent adult bodies====
In 2008, researchers at [[Boston Children's Hospital]] developed a new strain of zebrafish, named Casper, whose adult bodies had transparent skin.<ref name=zviv>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.stem.2007.11.002 |laysummary=http://www.livescience.com/animals/080206-see-thru-fish.html |laysource=LiveScience |laydate=February 6, 2008 |title=Transparent Adult Zebrafish as a Tool for in Vivo Transplantation Analysis |year=2008 |last1=White |first1=Richard Mark |last2=Sessa |first2=Anna |last3=Burke |first3=Christopher |last4=Bowman |first4=Teresa |last5=Leblanc |first5=Jocelyn |last6=Ceol |first6=Craig |last7=Bourque |first7=Caitlin |last8=Dovey |first8=Michael |last9=Goessling |first9=Wolfram |journal=Cell Stem Cell |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=183–9 |pmid=18371439 |pmc=2292119}}</ref> This allows for detailed visualization of cellular activity, circulation, [[metastasis]] and many other phenomena. Because many gene functions are shared between fish and humans, the Casper strain is expected to yield insights into human diseases such as leukemia and other cancers.<ref name=zviv/> In January 2013, Japanese scientists genetically modified a transparent zebrafish specimen to produce a visible glow during periods of intense brain activity, allowing the fish's "thoughts" to be recorded as specific regions of its brain lit up in response to external stimuli.<ref name=ithinkz>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/watch-zebrafish-think-about-food|title=Researchers Capture A Zebrafish's Thought Process On Video|work=Popular Science|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref>

====Use in environmental monitoring====
In January 2007, Chinese researchers at [[Fudan University]] genetically modified zebrafish to detect [[oestrogen]] pollution in lakes and rivers, which is linked to male infertility.<ref name=ChinaOest>Song Houyan and Zhong Tao, professors at Fudan's molecular medicine lab, spent three years cloning estrogen-sensitive genes and injecting them into the fertile eggs of zebrafish. The modified fish turn green if they are placed into water that is polluted by estrogen.

==In medical research==

===Cancer===
Zebrafish have been used to make several transgenic models of cancer, including [[melanoma]], [[leukemia]], [[pancreatic cancer]] and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].

====Melanoma====
Zebrafish expressing mutated forms of either the BRAF or NRAS [[oncogene]]s develop melanoma when placed onto a p53 deficient background. [[Histology|Histologically]], these tumors strongly resemble the human disease, are fully transplantable, and exhibit large-scale genomic alterations. The BRAF melanoma model was utilized as a platform for two screens published in March 2011 in the journal ''Nature''. In one study, by Ceol, Houvras and Zon, the model was used as a tool to understand the functional importance of genes known to be amplified and overexpressed in human melanoma.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature09806 |title=The histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is recurrently amplified in melanoma and accelerates its onset |year=2011 |last1=Ceol |first1=Craig J. |last2=Houvras |first2=Yariv |last3=Jane-Valbuena |first3=Judit |last4=Bilodeau |first4=Steve |last5=Orlando |first5=David A. |last6=Battisti |first6=Valentine |last7=Fritsch |first7=Lauriane |last8=Lin |first8=William M. |last9=Hollmann |first9=Travis J. |journal=Nature |volume=471 |issue=7339 |pages=513–7 |pmid=21430779 |pmc=3348545}}</ref> One gene, SETDB1, markedly accelerated tumor formation in the zebrafish system, demonstrating its importance as a new melanoma oncogene. This was particularly significant because SETDB1 is known to be involved in the epigenetic regulation that is increasingly appreciated to be central to tumor cell biology. In another study, by White and Zon, an effort was made to therapeutically target the genetic program present in the tumor's origin [[neural crest]] cell using a chemical screening approach.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature09882 |title=DHODH modulates transcriptional elongation in the neural crest and melanoma |year=2011 |last1=White |first1=Richard Mark |last2=Cech |first2=Jennifer |last3=Ratanasirintrawoot |first3=Sutheera |last4=Lin |first4=Charles Y. |last5=Rahl |first5=Peter B. |last6=Burke |first6=Christopher J. |last7=Langdon |first7=Erin |last8=Tomlinson |first8=Matthew L. |last9=Mosher |first9=Jack |journal=Nature |volume=471 |issue=7339 |pages=518–22 |pmid=21430780}}</ref> This revealed that an inhibition of the DHODH protein (by a small molecule called leflunomide) prevented development of the neural crest stem cells which ultimately give rise to melanoma via interference with the process of transcriptional elongation. Because this approach would aim to target the "identity" of the melanoma cell rather than a single genetic mutation, leflunomide may have utility in treating human melanoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110323141838.htm|title=Arthritis Drug Could Help Beat Melanoma Skin Cancer, Study Finds|publisher=Science Daily|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate= November 15, 2012}}</ref>

===Cardiovascular disease===
In cardiovascular research, the zebrafish has been used to model [[Coagulation|blood clotting]], [[Angiogenesis|blood vessel development]], heart failure, and [[congenital heart defect|congenital heart and kidney disease]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15647335|title=Kidney development and disease in the zebrafish|publisher=NCBI|year=2005|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>

===Immune system===
In programmes of research into acute [[inflammation]], a major underpinning process in many diseases, researchers have established a zebrafish model of inflammation, and its resolution. This approach allows detailed study of the genetic controls of inflammation and the possibility of identifying potential new drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fishforscience.com/disease/inflammatory-disease|title=Investigating inflammatory disease using zebrafish|publisher=Fish For Science|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref>

===Repairing retinal damage===
Another notable characteristic of the zebrafish is that it possesses four types of [[cone cell]], with [[ultraviolet]]-sensitive cells supplementing the red, green and blue cone cell subtypes found in humans. Zebrafish can thus observe a very wide spectrum of colours. The species is also studied to better understand the development of the retina; in particular, how the cone cells of the retina become arranged into the so-called 'cone mosaic'. Zebrafish, in addition to certain other [[teleost]] fish, are particularly noted for having extreme precision of cone cell arrangement.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cne.22447 |title=Ontogeny of cone photoreceptor mosaics in zebrafish |year=2010 |last1=Allison |first1=W. Ted |last2=Barthel |first2=Linda K. |last3=Skebo |first3=Kristina M. |last4=Takechi |first4=Masaki |last5=Kawamura |first5=Shoji |last6=Raymond |first6=Pamela A. |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=518 |issue=20 |pages=4182–95 |pmid=20878782 |pmc=3376642}}</ref>

This study of the zebrafish's retinal characteristics has also extrapolated into medical enquiry. In 2007, researchers at [[University College London]] grew a type of zebrafish adult [[stem cell]] found in the eyes of fish and mammals that develops into [[neuron]]s in the retina. These could be injected into the eye to treat diseases that damage retinal neurons—nearly every disease of the eye, including [[macular degeneration]], [[glaucoma]], and [[diabetes]]-related blindness. The researchers studied Müller [[glial cells]] in the eyes of humans aged from 18 months to 91 years, and were able to develop them into all types of retinal neurons. They were also able to grow them easily in the lab. The stem cells successfully migrated into diseased rats' retinas, and took on the characteristics of the surrounding neurons. The team is working to develop the same approach in humans.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2006-0724 |laysource=[[The China Post]] |laydate=August 3, 2007 |laysummary=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/health/eye%20health/2007/08/03/116860/Zebra-fish.htm |title=MIO-M1 Cells and Similar Müller Glial Cell Lines Derived from Adult Human Retina Exhibit Neural Stem Cell Characteristics |year=2007 |last1=Lawrence |first1=Jean M. |last2=Singhal |first2=Shweta |last3=Bhatia |first3=Bhairavi |last4=Keegan |first4=David J. |last5=Reh |first5=Thomas A. |last6=Luthert |first6=Philip J. |last7=Khaw |first7=Peng T. |last8=Limb |first8=Gloria Astrid |journal=Stem Cells |volume=25 |issue=8 |pages=2033–43 |pmid=17525239}}</ref>

===Drug discovery===
As demonstrated through ongoing research programmes, the zebrafish model enables researchers not only to identify genes that might underlie human disease, but also to develop novel therapeutic agents in drug discovery programmes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fishforscience.com/ |title=Fish for Science |publisher=University of Sheffield |year=2011 |accessdate=March 19, 2011 }}</ref> Zebrafish embryos have proven to be a rapid, cost-efficient, and reliable [[Teratogen|teratology]] assay model.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bdrb.20223 |title=Development of a zebrafish embryo teratogenicity assay and quantitative prediction model |year=2010 |last1=Brannen |first1=Kimberly C. |last2=Panzica-Kelly |first2=Julieta M. |last3=Danberry |first3=Tracy L. |last4=Augustine-Rauch |first4=Karen A. |journal=Birth Defects Research Part B: Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology |volume=89 |pmid=20166227 |pages=66–77 |issue=1}}</ref>
