It has been designated as a [[terrorist organization]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], [[NATO]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], [[India]] and various other countries (see [[#Designation as terrorist organization|below]]). Al-Qaeda has carried out many attacks on non-Sunni Muslims,<ref>Democracy Promotion and Conflict-Based Reconstruction, Matthew Alan Hill - 2011, p 156</ref> non-Muslims,<ref>Darko Trifunovic & Jill Starr.

Al-Qaeda has attacked civilian and military targets in various countries, including the [[September 11 attacks]], [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] and the [[2002 Bali bombings]]. The U.S. government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the [[War on Terror]]. With the loss of key leaders, culminating in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]], al-Qaeda's operations have devolved from  actions that were controlled from the top-down, to actions by franchise associated groups, to actions of lone wolf operators.

==Organization==
Al-Qaeda's management philosophy has been described as "centralization of decision and decentralization of execution."<ref>al-Hammadi, Khalid, "The Inside Story of al-Qa'ida", part 4, ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', March 22, 2005</ref> It is thought that al-Qaeda's leadership, following the [[War on Terror]], has "become geographically isolated", leading to the "emergence of decentralized leadership" of regional groups using the al-Qaeda "brand".<ref>{{cite web|author=Aug 13, 2004 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html |title=Evolution of the al-Qaeda brand name |publisher=Atimes.com |date=August 13, 2004 |accessdate=March 22, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100411010338/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html| archivedate= April 11, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf |title=The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism&nbsp;– SPRING 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda's leadership. Although bin Laden still held considerable ideological sway over some Muslim extremists before his death, experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another. [[Marc Sageman]], a psychiatrist and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, said that al-Qaeda is now just a "loose label for a movement that seems to target the West". "There is no umbrella organisation. We like to create a mythical entity called [al-Qaeda] in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with."<ref name="FT Threat">{{Cite news|last=Blitz|first=James|journal=Financial Times|title=A threat transformed|date=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af31e344-0499-11df-8603-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}</ref>

This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with [[Tayseer Allouni]]:

<blockquote>"... this matter isn't about any specific person and... is not about the al-Qa`idah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one... and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa`idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa`idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation."<ref name=islamicawakening>{{cite web | url=http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=977&pageID=64 | title= A Discussion on the New Crusader Wars: Tayseer Allouni with Usamah bin Laden | work=IslamicAwakening.com}}</ref></blockquote>

Others, however, see al-Qaeda as an integrated network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas and has a powerful strategic purpose. [[Bruce Hoffman]], a terrorism expert at [[Georgetown University]], said "It amazes me that people don't think there is a clear adversary out there, and that our adversary does not have a strategic approach."<ref name="FT Threat"/>

Information mostly acquired from [[Jamal al-Fadl]] provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized. While the veracity of the information provided by al-Fadl and the motivation for his cooperation are both disputed, American authorities base much of their current knowledge of al-Qaeda on his testimony.<ref name="first informant">{{Harvnb|McGeary|2001}}.</ref>

[[Osama bin Laden]] was the most historically notable [[emir]], or commander, and Senior Operations Chief of al-Qaeda prior to his assassination on May 1, 2011 by US forces. [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], al-Qaeda's Deputy Operations Chief prior to bin Laden's death, assumed the role of commander, according to an announcement by al-Qaeda on June 16, 2011. He replaced [[Saif al-Adel]], who had served as interim commander.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/06/16/world/middleeast/AP-ML-Al-Qaida-Zawahri.html?hp |title="Al-Qaida Says Al-Zawahri Has Succeeded Bin Laden", June 16, 2011, Associated Press |work=The New York Times  |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=June 6, 2011}}</ref>

Bin Laden was advised by a [[Shura Council]], which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials to consist of 20–30 people.

[[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-official-al-qaidas-no-2-leader-atiyah-abd-al-rahman-killed-in-pakistan/2011/08/27/gIQABVppiJ_story.html |title=Al Qaidas No. 2 leader Atiyah Abd al-Rahman killed in Pakistan| work=The Washington Post | first=Dan | last=Balz | date=August 27, 2011 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

* {{Harvnb|Hoffman|2002}}.</ref> In the [[9/11 Commission Report]]'', it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30&nbsp;million-per-year to conduct its operations.
* The Law Committee reviews [[Sharia law]], and decides whether particular courses of action conform to it.
* The Islamic Study/''[[Fatwā|Fatwah]]'' Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.
* In the late 1990s, there was a publicly known Media Committee, which ran the now-defunct newspaper ''Nashrat al Akhbar (Newscast)'' and handled [[public relations]].
* In 2005, al-Qaeda formed [[As-Sahab]], a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials.

===Command structure===
When asked about the possibility of al-Qaeda's connection to the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]] in 2005, [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] [[Sir Ian Blair]] said: "Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and I think that is what has occurred here."<ref name='foxnewsblair'>{{Cite news| title=Cops: London Attacks Were Homicide Blasts | date= July 15, 2005| url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,162476,00.html |publisher=Fox News | accessdate =June 15, 2008 }}</ref>

On August 13, 2005, however, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, quoting police and [[MI5]] investigations, reported that the July 7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad.<ref>{{Cite news| title= London bombings: the truth emerges | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece | first=Jason | last=Bennetto | coauthors=Ian Herbert |work=The Independent |location=UK | date=August 13, 2005 | accessdate=December 3, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061026100045/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece| archivedate= October 26, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

What exactly al-Qaeda is, or was, remains in dispute. Author and journalist [[Adam Curtis]] argues that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contends the name "al-Qaeda" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the [[1998 US embassy bombings]] in East Africa:

<blockquote>The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term "al-Qaeda" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.<ref name="The Power of Nightmares">[http://www.archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmares ''The Power of Nightmares''], BBC Documentary.</ref></blockquote>

As a matter of law, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]], also known as the RICO statutes. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of [[Jamal al-Fadl]], who said he was a founding member of the organization and a former employee of bin Laden.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCloud|first=Kimberly|title=WMD Terrorism and Usama bin Laden |url=http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm|work=CNS Reports|publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies|accessdate=May 4, 2011|coauthors=Osborne, Matthew|date=March 7, 2001| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110506145417/http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm| archivedate= May 06 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack U.S. military establishments.<ref name="first informant"/><ref>{{Cite news

|accessdate=June 12, 2007}}</ref> Sam Schmidt, one of his defense lawyers, said:

<blockquote>There were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.<ref name="The Power of Nightmares"/></blockquote>

===Field operatives===
The number of individuals in the organization who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown.  Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden compound in 2011, show that the core Al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9243503/Secret-Osama-bin-Laden-files-reveal-al-Qaeda-membership.html Secret Osama bin Laden files reveal al Qaeda membership, The Telegraph accessed 26 July, 2013]</ref>  In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.<ref name="Cassidy">{{Harvnb|Cassidy|2006|p=9}}.</ref> As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders.<ref>{{cite web

According to the award-winning 2004 BBC documentary ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.<ref>{{Cite book

===Insurgent forces===
According to [[Robert Cassidy]], al-Qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was "organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces" in the Soviet-Afghan war.<ref name="Cassidy"/> It was made up primarily of foreign ''mujahideen'' from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global ''jihad''. Another group, approximately 10,000 strong, live in Western states and have received rudimentary combat training.<ref name="Cassidy"/>

Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as being "predominantly Arab," in its first years of operation, and now also includes  "other peoples" as of 2007.<ref>[http://www.meforum.org/article/1710 Jihad's New Leaders] by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Kyle Dabruzzi, ''Middle East Quarterly'', Summer 2007</ref> It has been estimated that 62% of al-Qaeda members have university education.<ref>{{cite web|author=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c841b52c-b2e7-4e41-b27e-33d10245b935&k=0 |title=Today's jihadists: educated, wealthy and bent on killing? |publisher=Canada.com |date=July 3, 2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Financing===
Some financing for al-Qaeda in the 1990s came from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden.<ref name="Forbes_May_5_2011">[http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/14/0914whoisobl.html Who is Bin Laden?] retrieved May 5, 2011</ref> By 2001 Afghanistan had become politically complex and mired. With many financial sources for al-Qaeda, Bin Laden's financing role may have become comparatively minor. Sources in 2001 could also have included [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Jamaa Al-Islamiyya]] and [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Islamic Jihad]], both associated with Afghan-based Egyptians.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2001/09/14/0914ladenmoney.html Cost of bin Laden] retrieved May 5, 2011</ref> Other sources of income in 2001 included the [[heroin trade]] and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries.<ref name="Forbes_May_5_2011" /> A [[WikiLeaks]] released memo from the United States Secretary of State sent in 2009 asserted that the primary source of funding of Sunni terrorist groups worldwide was Saudi Arabia.<ref>Eric Lichtbau and Eric Schmitt [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/world/middleeast/06wikileaks-financing.html Cash Flow to Terrorists Evades U.S. Efforts] ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 5, 2010</ref>

# Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on U.S. soil that results in massive civilian casualties.
# Incite local resistance to occupying forces.
# Expand the conflict to neighboring countries, and engage the U.S. and its allies in a long war of attrition.
# Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the U.S. and countries allied with the U.S. until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], but which did not have the same effect with the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]].
# The U.S. economy will finally collapse by the year 2020 under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places, making the worldwide economic system which is dependent on the U.S. also collapse leading to global political instability, which in turn leads to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda and a [[Wahhabi]] [[Caliphate]] will then be installed across the world following the collapse of the U.S. and the rest of the Western world countries.

Atwan also noted, regarding the collapse of the U.S., "If this sounds far-fetched, it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|downfall of the Soviet Union]]."<ref name=Atwan/>

==Name==
In Arabic, ''al-Qaeda'' has four syllables (''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qāʿidah}}'', {{IPA-ar|ælˈqɑːʕɪdɐ}} or {{IPA-ar|ælqɑːˈʕedæ|}}). However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name (the [[voiceless uvular plosive]] {{IPA|[q]}} and the [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] {{IPA|[ʕ]}}) are not [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] found in the English language, the closest naturalized [[English phonology|English pronunciations]] include {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|aɪ|d|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|eɪ|d|ə}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|k|ɑː|ˈ|iː|d|ə}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} al-Qaeda's name can also be [[transliteration|transliterated]] as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, el-Qaida, or al-Qaeda.<ref>[http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra Listen to the U.S. pronunciation] ([[RealPlayer]]).</ref>

The name comes from the Arabic noun ''qā'idah'', which means ''foundation'' or ''basis'', and can also refer to a [[military base]]. The initial ''al-'' is the Arabic [[article (grammar)|definite article]] ''the'', hence ''the base''.<ref>Arabic Computer Dictionary: English-Arabic, Arabic-English By Ernest Kay, Multi-lingual International Publishers, 1986.</ref>

Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with [[Al Jazeera]] journalist [[Tayseer Alouni]] in October 2001:
<blockquote>The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late [[Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri|Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri]] established the training camps for our ''[[mujahedeen]]'' against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html |title=Transcript of Bin Laden's October interview |publisher=CNN |date=February 5, 2002 |accessdate=October 22, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061206081331/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html| archivedate= December 06 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref></blockquote>

It has been argued that two documents seized from the [[Sarajevo]] office of the [[Benevolence International Foundation]] prove that the name was not simply adopted by the ''mujahid'' movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term "al-Qaeda".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|p=75}}. Wright indirectly quotes one of the documents, based on an exhibit from the "Tareek Osama" document presented in <span class="plainlinks">[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/bif/usarnaout10603prof.pdf ''United States v. Enaam M. Arnaout'']</span>.</ref>

Former British Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as "the database", and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of ''mujahideen'' militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.<ref>{{cite news|author=Robin Cook |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development |title=Robin Cook: The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= July 8, 2005|accessdate=May 8, 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110514051125/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development| archivedate= May 14, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In April 2002, the group assumed the name ''Qa'idat al-Jihad'', which means "the base of Jihad". According to [[Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies|Diaa Rashwan]], this was "apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|al-Jihad]] (Egyptian Islamist Jihad, or EIJ) group, led by [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s."<ref>"[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/op13.htm After Mombassa]", ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly|Al-Ahram Weekly Online]]'', January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619).

==Ideology==
{{See also|Qutbism}}
{{Islamism sidebar}}
The radical [[Islamist]] movement in general and al-Qaeda in particular developed during the [[Islamic revival]] and [[Islamism|Islamist movement]] of the last three decades of the 20th century, along with less extreme movements.

Some have argued that "without the writings" of Islamic author and thinker [[Sayyid Qutb]], "al-Qaeda would not have existed."<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=332}}.</ref> Qutb preached that because of the lack of ''[[sharia]]'' law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as ''[[jahiliyyah]]''.

To restore Islam, he said a vanguard movement of righteous Muslims was needed to establish "true [[Islamic state]]s", implement ''sharia'', and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences, such as concepts like socialism and nationalism. Enemies of Islam in Qutb's view included "treacherous Orientalists"<ref>{{Harvnb|Qutb|2003|pp=63, 69}}.</ref> and "world Jewry", who plotted "conspiracies" and "wicked[ly]" opposed Islam.

In the words of [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], a close college friend of bin Laden: <blockquote>Islam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=79}}.</ref></blockquote>

Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden's mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/qutb_milest_influence_obl.html |title=How Did Sayyid Qutb Influence Osama bin Laden? |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, then protégé, then personal lawyer, and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. "Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb's character and the torment he had endured in prison."<ref>Mafouz Azzam; cited in {{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=36}}.</ref> Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work ''Knights under the Prophet's Banner.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/milestones_qutb.html#footnote_24 |title=Sayyid Qutb's Milestones (footnote 24) |publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

One of the most powerful of Qutb's ideas was that many who said they were Muslims were not. Rather, they were [[apostate]]s. That not only gave jihadists "a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another Muslim," but made "it a religious obligation to execute" these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce ''sharia'' law.<ref>[http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism] DALE C.

==Religious compatibility==
[[Abdel Bari Atwan]] writes that:
{{quote|While the leadership's own theological platform is essentially [[Salafi]], the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings. Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with [[Wahhabism]], [[Shafi`i|Shafi'ism]], [[Maliki]]sm, and [[Hanafi]]sm. There are even some whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as [[Yunis Khalis]], one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin. He is a mystic who visits tombs of saints and seeks their blessings—practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought. The only exception to this pan-Islamic policy is [[Shi'ism]]. Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy. In Iraq it has openly declared war on the [[Badr Brigades]], who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.<ref name=AbdelBariAtwan>Abdel Bari Atwan.

==History==
{{Importance-section|date=May 2011}}
[[The Guardian]] has described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: beginnings in the late 1980s, a "wilderness" period in 1990–96, its "heyday" in 1996–2001, a network period from 2001 to 2005, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to today.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Jason Burke and Paddy Allen |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2009/sep/10/al-qaida-five-ages-terror-attacks |title=The five ages of al-Qaida |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=March 22, 2010  | date=September 11 attacks, 2009}}</ref>

The origins of al-Qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the [[Soviet War in Afghanistan]] (December 1979 – February 1989).<ref name="Cooley"/> The U.S. viewed the conflict in Afghanistan, with the Afghan [[Marxist]]s and allied Soviet troops on one side and the native Afghan ''mujahideen'', some of whom were radical Islamic militants, on the other, as a blatant case of Soviet expansionism and aggression. A CIA program called [[Operation Cyclone]] channeled funds through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency to the Afghan Mujahideen who were fighting the Soviet occupation.<ref name="1986-1992-CIA-AND-BRITISH-RECRUIT-AND-TRAIN-MILITANTS-WORLDWIDE-TO-HELP-FIGHT-AFGHAN-WAR">{{cite web

At the same time, a growing number of Arab ''mujahideen'' joined the ''jihad'' against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan Marxist regime]], facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the [[Maktab al-Khidamat]],<ref name=MAKTAB-AL-KHIDAMAT-GLOBALSECURITY>{{cite web

Together, these sources donated some $600&nbsp;million a year to jihad.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1984, [[Maktab al-Khidamat]] (MAK), or the "Services Office", a Muslim organization founded to raise and channel funds and recruit foreign ''mujahideen'' for the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, was established in Peshawar, Pakistan, by bin Laden and [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. MAK organized [[al-Qaeda safe house|guest houses]] in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. Bin Laden became a "major financier" of the ''mujahideen'', spending his own money and using his connections with "the Saudi royal family and the petro-billionaires of the Gulf" to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=19}}.

[[File:Omar Abdel-Rahman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Omar Abdel-Rahman]]]]
From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the U.S., the hub of which was the [[Al Kifah Refugee Center]] at the Farouq Mosque on [[Brooklyn]]'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were "double agent" [[Ali Mohamed]], whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called "bin Laden's first trainer,"<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html Cloonan ''Frontline'' interview], PBS, July 13, 2005.</ref> and "Blind Sheikh" [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], a leading recruiter of ''mujahideen'' for Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda evolved from MAK.

Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|p=35}}.</ref>

U.S. government financial support for the Afghan Islamic militants was substantial. Aid to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], an Afghan ''mujahideen'' leader and founder and leader of the [[Hezb-e Islami]] radical Islamic militant faction, alone amounted "by the most conservative estimates" to $600&nbsp;million. Later, in the early 1990s, after the U.S. had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar "worked closely" with bin Laden.<ref>Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, c2001., p.70-1</ref> In addition to receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of the lion's share of Saudi aid.<ref>Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: inside the secret world of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, c2001., p. 69</ref> There is evidence that the [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|CIA supported]] Hekmatyar's drug trade activities by giving him immunity for his opium trafficking, which financed the operation of his militant faction.<ref name=Rienzo>Interview with Alfred McCoy, November 9, 1991 by [[Paul DeRienzo]][http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/nugan_hand.html]</ref>

MAK and foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers, or "Afghan Arabs," did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan ''mujahideen'' fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that were never more than 2,000 foreign ''mujahideen'' in the field at any one time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=137}}.</ref> Nonetheless, foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.<ref name=THE-WAR-ON-TERROR-AND-THE-POLITICS-OF-VIOLENCE-IN-PAKISTAN>{{cite web

The Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. To the surprise of many, [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s communist Afghan government hung on for three more years, before being overrun by elements of the ''mujahideen''. With ''mujahideen'' leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance, chaos ensued, with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill-defined territories, leaving the country devastated.

===Expanding operations===
{{Editorial|date=May 2011}}
{{rquote|right|The correlation between the words and deeds of bin Laden, his lieutenants, and their allies was close to perfect—if they said they were going to do something, they were much more than likely to try to do it.

Toward the end of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] mission in Afghanistan, some ''mujahideen'' wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Israel and [[Kashmir]]. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations.

One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda, formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11, 1988, at Peshawar, Pakistan.<ref name=guardianobserverhistory/><ref name=THE-OSAMA-BIN-LADEN-I-KNOW>{{cite web

Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: "basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make His religion victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]'') to follow one's superiors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–134}}.</ref>

According to Wright, the group's real name wasn't used in public pronouncements because "its existence was still a closely held secret."<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.</ref> His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between "several senior leaders" of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.<ref name="RebellionWright">{{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}.</ref>

Bin Laden wished to establish non-military operations in other parts of the world; Azzam, in contrast, wanted to remain focused on military campaigns. After Azzam was assassinated in 1989, the MAK split, with a significant number joining bin Laden's organization.

In November 1989, [[Ali Mohamed]], a former special forces Sergeant stationed at [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became "deeply involved with bin Laden's plans."<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=181}}.</ref>

A year later, on November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of Ali Mohammed's associate [[El Sayyid Nosair]], discovering a great deal of evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080302005340/http://www.tkb.org/CaseHome.jsp?caseid=332 |title=Legal case profiles – USA v.

===Gulf War and the start of U.S. enmity===
{{Main|Gulf War}}

Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.

In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were well armed but far outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his ''mujahideen'' to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow U.S. and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Jehl | first = Douglas | title = A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked away | work=The New York Times | date = December 27, 2001 | pages = A1, B4 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html | accessdate =September 5, 2009}}</ref>

The deployment angered Bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the "land of the two mosques" ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.

===Sudan===
From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]], who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established camps where insurgents trained.

A key turning point for bin Laden, further pitting him against the Sauds, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]], which set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.</ref>

Zawahiri and the EIJ, who served as the core of al-Qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the Egyptian government, had bad luck in Sudan. In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful EIJ attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, [[Atef Sedki]]. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=186}}.</ref>

Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on March 5, 1994 Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden's passport; bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend, $7&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7000000|1994|r=-5}}}} today) a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=195}}.</ref><ref name=OSAMA-BIN-LADEN-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-HIS-POLITICAL-LIFE>{{cite web

In June 1995, an even more ill-fated [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad#Mubarak assassination attempt|attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak]] led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government.

According to [[Pakistani-American]] businessman [[Mansoor Ijaz]], the Sudanese government offered the [[Clinton Administration]] numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Those opportunities were met positively by Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]], but spurned when [[Susan Rice]] and counter-terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] persuaded National Security Advisor [[Sandy Berger]] to overrule Albright. Ijaz’s claims appeared in numerous [[Op-Ed]] pieces, including one in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05 |title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize|work=Los Angeles Times  |date=December 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 22, 2010 | first=Mansoor | last=Ijaz}}</ref> and one in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan [[Timothy M.

Several sources dispute Ijaz's claim, including the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the U.S. (the 9–11 Commission), which concluded in part: <blockquote>Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the U.S. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch4.htm |title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |publisher=Govinfo.library.unt.edu |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

===Refuge in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Taliban's rise to power|Afghan training camp}}

After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various ''mujahideen'' groups.

Throughout the 1990s, a new force began to emerge. The origins of the [[Taliban]] (literally "students") lay in the children of Afghanistan, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools ([[madrassa]]s) either in [[Kandahar]] or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

According to [[Ahmed Rashid]], five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]], a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.<ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2002">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2002}}.</ref> The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but largely attended by [[Afghan refugees]].<ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2002"/> This institution reflected [[Salafi]] beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Bin Laden's contacts were still laundering most of these donations, using "unscrupulous" Islamic banks to transfer the money to an "array" of charities which serve as front groups for al-Qaeda, or transporting cash-filled suitcases straight into Pakistan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Napoleoni|2003|pp=121–123}}; {{Harvnb|Akacem|2005}} "Napoleoni does a decent job of covering al-Qaida and presents some numbers and estimates that are of value to terrorism scholars"</ref> Another four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.

Many of the ''mujahideen'' who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord [[Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi]]'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing internecine strife between various factions, and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal, enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, conquered the capital city [[Kabul]] in September 1996.

After the Sudanese made it clear, in May 1996, that bin Laden would never be welcome to return,{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} Taliban-controlled Afghanistan—with previously established connections between the groups, administered with a shared militancy,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kronstadt|Katzman|2008}}.</ref> and largely isolated from American political influence and military power—provided a perfect location for al-Qaeda to relocate its headquarters. Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of [[055 Brigade|Brigade 055]], an elite part of the Taliban's army from 1997–2001. The Brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters, many veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen. In November 2001, as [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]] had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those that survived were thought to head into Pakistan along with bin Laden.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101011105-181591,00.html | work=Time | first=Daniel | last=Eisenberg | title=Secrets Of Brigade 055 | date=October 28, 2001}}</ref>

By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda,<ref>{{Cite news|author=Robertson, Nic|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview |title=CNN.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> while others cast doubt on this.<ref>Roggio, Bill [http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/10/taliban_have_not_spl.php Taliban have not split from al Qaeda: sources] October 7, 2008 ''The Long War Journal''</ref> According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.<ref>Partlow, Joshua.

===Call for global jihad===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Around 1994, the Salafi groups waging ''[[Salafist jihadism|jihad]]'' in Bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline. As they grew less and less aggressive, groups such as EIJ began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda decided to step in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist cells in Bosnia in late 1995.

At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for ''[[Jihadi international]]'', Muslims who believed that ''jihad'' must be fought on a global level. The concept of a "global Salafi ''jihad''" had been around since at least the early 1980s. Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land, at the same time, and with maximum carnage. This was, however, a fundamentally defensive strategy{{clarify|reason=contradictory sentences: minimum carnage would be fundamentally defensive, maximum carnage would not.|date=May 2011}}.

Al-Qaeda sought to open the "offensive phase" of the global Salafi ''jihad''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|pp=48, 51}}.</ref> Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for "solidarity with Islamic causes around the world", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Trofimov|2006|p=282}}.</ref>

===Fatwas===
[[File:AnschalgInZahran1996 KhobarTower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khobar Towers bombing]]]]
In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its ''jihad'' to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. Bin Laden issued a ''fatwa'' (binding religious edict),<ref>{{Cite news

In June 1996, the [[Khobar Towers bombing]] took place in [[Khobar, Saudi Arabia]], attributed by some to al-Qaeda, killing 19 Americans and one Saudi local, and wounding 372.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Abdel Bari Atwan |title=The Secret History of Al Qaeda |pages=168–169 |publisher=University of California Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-520-24974-7 |ref=harv}}</ref>

On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a ''fatwa'' calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies where they can, when they can.<ref>Summary taken from bin Laden's May 26, 1998 interview with American journalist [[John Miller (journalist)|John Miller]]. Most recently broadcast in the documentary ''Age of Terror'', part 4, with translations checked by Barry Purkis (archive researcher).</ref> Under the banner of the [[World Islamic Front|World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders]], they declared:

<blockquote>[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|title=Text of Fatwah Urging Jihad Against Americans|accessdate=May 15, 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060422210853/http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm| archivedate = April 22, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>

Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a ''fatwa''. However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ''[[ulema]]'' (which they saw as the paid servants of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' rulers), and took it upon themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Benjamin|Simon|2002|p=117}}.

A former FBI agent identifies Awlaki as a known "senior recruiter for al-Qaeda", and a spiritual motivator.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-recruiter-focus-fort-hood-killings-investigation/story?id=9045492 Chucmach, Megan, and Ross, Brian, "Al Qaeda Recruiter New Focus in Fort Hood Killings Investigation Army Major Nidal Hasan Was In Contact With Imam Anwar Awlaki, Officials Say," ''[[ABC News]]'', November 10, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009]</ref> Awlaki's sermons in the U.S. were attended by three of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] hijackers, as well as accused [[Fort Hood shooting|Fort Hood shooter]] [[Nidal Malik Hasan]]. U.S. intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009. On his website, Awlaki has praised Hasan's actions in the Fort Hood shooting.<ref name="abcnews.go.com">[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/fort-hood-shooter-contact-al-qaeda-terrorists-officials/story?id=9030873 Esposito, Richard, Cole, Matthew, and Ross, Brian, "Officials: U.S. Army Told of Hasan's Contacts with al Qaeda; Army Major in Fort Hood Massacre Used 'Electronic Means' to Connect with Terrorists," ''[[ABC News]]'', November 9, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009]</ref>

An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki "has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the U.S. [after 9/11], including plotting attacks against America and our allies.”<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/26/AR2008022603267_pf.html WashingtonPost.com]

Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.

Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Eichenwald | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Eichenwald | title = A Nation Challenged: The Money; Terror Money Hard to Block, Officials Find | work=The New York Times | date = December 10, 2001 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/10/world/a-nation-challenged-the-money-terror-money-hard-to-block-officials-find.html?scp=1&sq=A+NATION+CHALLENGED%3A+THE+MONEY%3B+Terror+Money+Hard+to+Block%2C+Officials+Find&st=cse&pagewanted=all| accessdate =May 4, 2011}}</ref>

===1992===
On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda's first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in [[Aden]], Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.

The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, [[Operation Restore Hope]]. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the U.S. the attack was barely noticed.

No Americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether, and they went on to Somalia as scheduled. However little noticed, the attack was pivotal as it was the beginning of al-Qaeda's change in direction, from fighting armies to killing civilians.<ref name=wright174>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=174}}.</ref> Two people were killed in the bombing, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured.

Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al-Qaeda's members, [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|1997}}.</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}

===1993 World Trade Center bombing===

{{Main|World Trade Center bombing}}

In 1993, [[Ramzi Yousef]] used a truck bomb to attack the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City. The attack was intended to break the foundation of Tower One knocking it into Tower Two, bringing the entire complex down.

Yousef hoped this would kill 250,000 people. The towers shook and swayed but the foundation held and he succeeded in killing only six people (although he injured 1,042 others and caused nearly $300&nbsp;million in property damage).<ref name=yousef>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=178}}; {{Harvnb|Reeve|1999}}.</ref><ref name=miis>{{cite web

After the attack, Yousef fled to Pakistan and later moved to [[Manila]]. There he began developing the [[Bojinka plot]] plans to implode a dozen American airliners simultaneously, to assassinate Pope [[John Paul II]] and President [[Bill Clinton]], and to crash a private plane into CIA headquarters. He was later captured in Pakistan.<ref name=yousef/>

None of the U.S. government's indictments against bin Laden have suggested that he had any connection with this bombing, but Ramzi Yousef is known to have attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. After his capture, Yousef declared that his primary justification for the attack was to punish the U.S. for its support for the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and made no mention of any religious motivations.<ref name=miis/>

In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate Clinton while the president was in [[Manila]] for the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the [[U.S. Secret Service]]. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Osama bin Laden came within minutes of killing Bill Clinton  |author=Tom Leonard |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=December 25, 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html |accessdate=December 25, 2009 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091225150252/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html| archivedate= December 25, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa resulted in upward of 300 deaths, mostly locals. A barrage of [[cruise missile]]s launched by the U.S. military in response devastated an al-Qaeda base in [[Khost]], Afghanistan, but the network's capacity was unharmed.

In October 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen bombed the missile [[destroyer]] ''[[USS Cole bombing|U.S.S. Cole]]'' in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself.

===September 11 attacks===

The September 11, 2001 attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history, killing approximately 3,000 people. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the [[World Trade Center]] towers, a third into [[The Pentagon]], and a fourth, originally intended to target the [[United States Capitol]], crashed in a field in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]].

The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden#1998 Fatwa|1998 ''fatwa'']] issued against the U.S. and its allies by military forces under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm|title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders| accessdate=June 16, 2010| date=February 23, 1998}}</ref> Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander [[Mohamed Atta]] as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], and [[Hambali]] as the key planners and part of the political and military command.

Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001 praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/| title=Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks| publisher=CNN| accessdate=July 6, 2006| date=September 17, 2001| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060705161654/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/| archivedate= July 05 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the U.S. was actively oppressing Muslims.<ref>{{Harvnb|Esposito|2002|p=22}}.</ref>

Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in '[[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]], [[Chechnya]], [[Kashmir]] and Iraq' and that Muslims should retain the 'right to attack in reprisal'. He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at women and children, but 'America's icons of military and economic power'.<ref>Hamid Miir 'Osama claims he has nukes: If U.S. uses N-arms it will get the same response' "Dawn: the Internet Edition" November 10, 2001</ref>

Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the U.S. The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack "might get out of hand".<ref name=AL-QAIDA-LEADERS-SAY-NUCLEAR-POWER-STATIONS-WERE-ORIGINAL-TARGETS>{{Cite news

==War on Terrorism==
{{Main|War on Terror}}
[[File:Anaconda-helicopter.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops in Afghanistan]]
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the U.S. government [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|decided to respond militarily]], and began to prepare its [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the U.S. attacked, it offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).

The [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the U.S. would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] responded by saying: "We know he's guilty. Turn him over",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20011015-NEWS-310159983| title=U.S. Jets Pound Targets Around Kabul| work=[[The Portsmouth Herald]]| date=October 15, 2001|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}</ref> and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] warned the Taliban regime: "Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/10/02/blair_war011002.html |title=Blair to Taliban: Surrender bin Laden or surrender power |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=October 3, 2001 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

Soon thereafter the U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] removed the Taliban government in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]].

As a result of the U.S. using its [[special forces]] and providing [[close air support|air support]] for the [[Northern Alliance]] [[infantry|ground forces]], both [[Taliban]] and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.
[[File:Khalid Shaikh Mohammed after capture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] after his arrest in [[Rawalpindi]], Pakistan, in March 2003.]]

Again, under the cover of intense [[aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombardment]], U.S. [[infantry]] and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering the al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant [[Taliban insurgency]] remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda's top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.

Debate raged about the exact nature of al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks, and after the U.S. invasion began, the [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]] also released a [[Videos of Osama bin Laden#December 13, 2001|videotape]] showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html| title=U.S. Releases Videotape of Osama Bin Laden| accessdate=July 4, 2006| date=December 13, 2001| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060625223529/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html| archivedate = June 25, 2006}}</ref> Although its authenticity has been questioned by some,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/september11/story/0,11209,619188,00.html| author=Morris, Steven| title=US urged to detail origin of tape|work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate=July 11, 2006| date=December 15, 2001 }}</ref> the tape appears to implicate bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks and was aired on many [[television channels]] all over the world, with an accompanying [http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/tape.transcript/ English translation] provided by the [[U.S. Defense Department]].

[[Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa]] has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, as well as supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.

Before the [[9/11 attacks]] and the [[U.S.]] invasion of [[Afghanistan]], recruits at Al-Qaeda training camps who had Western backgrounds were especially sought after by Al-Qaeda's military wing for conducting operations overseas. Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with [[Mohamed Atta]], an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the [[Hamburg Cell]]. [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Mohamed Atef]] would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the [[9/11 hijackers]]. Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that Al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan.<ref>http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/30/terrorism.september113 |title=Last words of a terrorist &#124; World news &#124; The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-10}}</ref>

Significantly, it was not until the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began training Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan.<ref name="palestinian operatives">{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=150}}.</ref> Rather, large groups such as [[Hamas]] and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]]—which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects—have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, as Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.<ref name="palestinian operatives"/>

===Internet===
Timothy L. Thomas claims that in the wake of its evacuation from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. As a result, the organization's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, encompassing financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, as well as information dissemination, gathering and sharing.<ref>Timothy Thomas, [http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/03spring/thomas.pdf "Al Qaeda and the Internet: The Danger of Cyberplanning"]. Retrieved February 14, 2007.</ref>

[[File:Abu Ayyub al-Masri 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]]]]
[[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]]’s al-Qaeda movement in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, both before and after the death of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] (the former leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]]), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]], has a regular [[web presence|presence on the Web]].
The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur [[Nick Berg]] being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of [[Paul Johnson (hostage)|Paul Johnson]], [[Kim Sun-il]], and [[Daniel Pearl]], were first posted on jihadist websites.

In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from Bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to [[Aljazeera|al Jazeera]] as he had done in the past.

Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the [[Saudi royal family]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2373884 |title=Bin Laden Identifies Saudi Arabia as the Enemy of Mujahideen Unity |author=Scheuer, Michael |month=January | year=2008 |work=Terrorism Focus |publisher=Jamestown Foundation}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Bin Laden's December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.

In the past, [[Alneda|Alneda.com]] and [[Jehad.net]] were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American [[Jon Messner]], but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.

The U.S. is currently attempting to extradite a British information technology specialist, [[Babar Ahmad]], on charges of operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Whitlock | first = Craig | authorlink = Craig Whitlock | title = Briton Used Internet As His Bully Pulpit | work=The Washington Post | date = August 8, 2005 | page = A1 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/07/AR2005080700890.html | accessdate=September 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Babar Ahmad Indicted on Terrorism Charges | publisher=United States Attorney's Office District of Connecticut | date = October 6, 2004 | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html|accessdate=May 29, 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060526115318/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html| archivedate = May 26, 2006}}</ref> Ahmad's extradition is opposed by various British Muslim organizations, such as the [[Muslim Association of Britain]].

====Online Communications====
In 2007, Al-Qaeda released [[Mujahedeen Secrets]], encryption software used for online and cellular communications. A later version, [[Mujahideen Secrets 2]], was released in 2008.<ref>http://nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html</ref>

===Aviation network===
Al-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including “several [[Boeing 727]] aircraft”, [[turboprops]] and [[executive jet]]s, according to a [[Reuters]] story. Based on a U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]] report, the story said that al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to 10 tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly [[kidnapping]] some Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gaynor |first=Tim |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60C3E820100113?type=politicsNews |title=Al Qaeda linked to rogue aviation network |agency=Reuters   |date= January 13, 2010|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}</ref>

==Alleged CIA involvement==
{{Main|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}} Experts debate whether or not the al-Qaeda attacks were [[blowback (intelligence)|blowback]] from the American CIA's "[[Operation Cyclone]]" program to help the Afghan [[Islamic mujahid movement|mujahideen]]. [[Robin Cook]], British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and Bin Laden were "a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies", and that "Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html|title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|author=Cook, Robin|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=July 8, 2005  | date=July 8, 2005| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050710025703/http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html| archivedate= July 10, 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Munir Akram]], [[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations]] from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in the [[New York Times]] on January 19, 2008:
<blockquote>The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/opinion/lweb22pakistan.html?_r=1&ref=opinion

A variety of sources—[[CNN]] journalist [[Peter Bergen]], [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani ISI]] Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as [[Vincent Cannistraro]]—deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or Bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.

Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight;<ref>{{Harvnb|Coll|2005|pp=145–146, 155–156}}.</ref> that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for American funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non-American, Muslim sources; that Americans could not have trained mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan; and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.

According to Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, the idea that "the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... [is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html|title= Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash|author=Bergen, Peter|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 15, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060821221916/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html| archivedate= August 21, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> But Bergen conceded that, in one "strange incident," the CIA appeared to give visa help to mujahideen-recruiter [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergen|2001|pp=72–73}}.</ref>

In his widely praised account of al-Qaeda, English journalist [[Jason Burke]] wrote:{{quote|It is often said that bin Laden was funded by the CIA. This is not true and, indeed, would have been impossible given the structure of funding that General Zia ul-Haq, who had taken power in Pakistan in 1977, had set up. A condition of Zia's cooperation with the American plan to turn Afghanistan into the Soviets' 'Vietnam' was that all American funding to the Afghan resistance had to be channelled through the Pakistani government, which in effect meant the Afghan bureau of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), the military spy agency. The American funding, which went exclusively to the Afghan mujahideen groups, not the Arab volunteers, was supplemented by Saudi government money and huge funds raised from mosques, non-governmental charitable institutions and private donors throughout the Islamic world.<ref>{{cite book |last= Burke |first= Jason |year= 2004 |origyear= 2003 |title= Al-Qaeda: The True Story of Radical Islam |edition= revised |location= London |publisher= Penguin |page= 59 }}</ref>}}

==Broader influence==
[[Anders Behring Breivik]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it "the most successful revolutionary movement in the world." While admitting different aims, he sought to "create a European version of al-Qaida."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2112701,00.html#ixzz1uHIlb0DH|title=Breivik Studied al-Qaeda Attacks|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2012|last=Ritter|first=Karl}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/world/europe/norway-anders-breivik-studied-al-qaeda.html|title=Norway: Militant Studied Al Qaeda|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>

==Criticism==
According to a number of sources there has been a "wave of revulsion" against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by "religious scholars, former fighters and militants" alarmed by al-Qaeda's [[takfir]] and killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially Iraq.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}. Quotes taken from {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|pp=106–107}} and {{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.</ref>

[[Noman Benotman]], a former Afghan Arab and militant of the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007 after persuading imprisoned senior leadership of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months later after "they were said to have renounced violence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AA64F530-BCA8-40B0-8226-22154CCD1032.htm |title=Libya releases scores of prisoners APRIL&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2008 |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=April 9, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, around the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and a couple of months before ''Rationalizing Jihad'' first appeared in the newspapers,<ref name="RebellionWright"/> the Saudi sheikh [[Salman al-Ouda]] delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him
<blockquote>My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?<ref name=theunraveling>{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.</ref></blockquote>

According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda has been slightly dropped for parts of the Muslim world in the years before 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/05/taking_stock_in_the_war_on_ter.html |title=Taking Stock of the War on Terror |publisher=Realclearpolitics.com |date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> The numbers supporting suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, for instance, have dropped by half or more in the last five years. In Saudi Arabia, only 10&nbsp;percent now have a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based [[think tank]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/12/17/saudi.poll/index.html |title=December 18, 2007 Poll: Most Saudis oppose al Qaeda |publisher=CNN  |date= December 18, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, the imprisoned [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]], an influential Afghan Arab, "ideological godfather of al-Qaeda", and former supporter of takfir, sensationally withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book ''[[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif#Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World|Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam]]'' (''Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World'').

Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group|LIFG]] completed a new "code" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled "Corrective Studies". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG's about face may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda's recruitment.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/09/libya.jihadi.code/ New jihad code threatens al Qaeda], Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank, ''[[CNN]]'', November 10, 2009</ref>
