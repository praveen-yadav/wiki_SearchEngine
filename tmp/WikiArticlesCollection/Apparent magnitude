The '''apparent magnitude''' ('''''m''''') of a celestial body is a measure of its [[brightness]] as seen by an observer on [[Earth]], adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The brighter the object appears, the lower the value of its [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]. Generally the [[visible spectrum]] (vmag) is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude, but other regions of the spectrum, such as the [[near-infrared]] [[J-band]], are also used. In the visible spectrum [[Sirius]] is the brightest star in the night sky, whereas in the near-infrared J-band, [[Betelgeuse]] is the brightest.

The scale now used to indicate magnitude originates in the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six ''magnitudes''. The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of first magnitude (''m'' = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude (''m'' = 6), the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]). This somewhat crude method of indicating the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'', and is generally believed to originate with [[Hipparchus]]. This original system did not measure the magnitude of the [[Sun]]. 

In 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a typical first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a typical sixth magnitude star; thus, a first magnitude star is about 2.512 times as bright as a second magnitude star. The [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]] is known as ''Pogson's Ratio''.<ref>[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857], [[Norman Robert Pogson|N. Pogson]], [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] Vol. 17, p. 12 (1856)</ref> Pogson's scale was originally fixed by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they first switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, and then switched to using tabulated zero points{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} for the measured fluxes.<ref>[http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1982lbor.book.....A&amp;db_key=AST Landolt-Börnstein: Numerical Data and Functional Relationships in Science and Technology - New Series " Gruppe/Group 6 Astronomy and Astrophysics " Volume 2 Schaifers/Voigt: Astronomy and Astrophysics / Astronomie und Astrophysik " Stars and Star Clusters / Sterne und Sternhaufen] [[Lawrence H. Aller|L. H. Aller]] ''et al.'', ISBN 3-540-10976-5 (1982)</ref> The magnitude depends on the wavelength band (see below).

The modern system is no longer limited to 6 magnitudes or only to visible light. Very bright objects have ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of –1.4. The modern scale includes the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]]. The full Moon has a mean apparent magnitude of –12.74<ref name="moon-fact"/> and the Sun has an apparent magnitude of –26.74.<ref name="sun-fact"/> The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] has located stars with magnitudes of 30 at visible wavelengths and the [[Keck telescopes]] have located similarly faint stars in the infrared.

== Calculations ==
[[File:VISTA Magellanic Cloud Survey view of the Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|[[30 Doradus]] image taken by [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]]. This [[nebula]] has an apparent magnitude of 8.]]

As the amount of light received actually depends on the thickness of the Earth's atmosphere in the line of sight to the object, the apparent magnitudes are adjusted to the value they would have in the absence of the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude. Note that brightness varies with distance; an extremely bright object may appear quite dim, if it is far away. Brightness varies [[inverse-square law|inversely with the square]] of the distance. The [[absolute magnitude]], ''M'', of a celestial body (outside the Solar System) is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were at 10 [[parsec]]s (~32.6 [[light years]]); that of a planet (or other Solar System body) is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 1 [[astronomical unit]] from both the [[Sun]] and [[Earth]]. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (yellow) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).<ref name="Bband">{{cite web

The apparent magnitude, ''m'', in the band, ''x'', can be defined as,

:<math>m_{x} - m_{x,0}= -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0} }\right)\,</math>,

where <math>F_x\!\,</math> is the observed [[flux]] in the band x, and <math>m_{x,0}</math> and <math>F_{x,0}</math> are a reference magnitude, and reference flux in the same band x, such as that of Vega.  An increase of 1 in the magnitude scale corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of <math> \approx 2.512 </math>.  Based on the properties of logarithms, a difference in magnitudes, <math>m_1 - m_2 = \Delta m</math>, can be converted to a variation in brightness as <math> F_2/F_1 \approx 2.512^{\Delta m} </math>.

=== Example: Sun and Moon ===
''What is the ratio in brightness between the Sun and the full moon?''

The apparent magnitude of the Sun is -26.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the full moon is -12.74 (dimmer).

'''Difference in magnitude''' : <math> x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00 </math>

'''Variation in Brightness''' : <math> v_b = 2.512^x = 2.512^{14.00} \approx 400,000 </math>

The Sun appears about 400,000 times brighter than the full moon.

===Magnitude Addition===

Sometimes, it might be useful to add magnitudes, for example, to determine the combined magnitude of a double star when the magnitude of the individual components are known. This can be done by setting an equation using the brightness (in linear units) of each magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

<math> 2.512^{-m_f} = 2.512^{-m_1} + 2.512^{-m_2} \!\ </math>

Solving for <math>m_f</math> yields

<math> m_f = -log_{2.512} \left(2.512^{-m_1} + 2.512^{-m_2} \right) \!\ </math>

where <math>m_f</math> is the resulting magnitude after adding <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math>. Note that the negative of each magnitude is used because greater intensities equate to lower magnitudes.

It is important to note that the scale is [[logarithm]]ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because [[Apparent_magnitude#History|Pogson's Ratio]] raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.
A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber-Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|author=E. Schulman and C. V. Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|page=1003|year=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}</ref>

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as '''visual magnitude'''.

Because cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within our Galaxy with a given [[absolute magnitude]], 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. This relationship does not apply for objects at very great distances (far beyond our galaxy), because a correction for [[general relativity]] must then be taken into account due to the non-Euclidean nature of space.

For planets and other Solar System bodies the apparent magnitude is derived from its [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]] and the distances to the Sun and observer.
