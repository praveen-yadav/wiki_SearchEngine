'''''Braveheart''''' is a 1995 [[List of historical drama films|historical drama]] [[war film]] directed by and starring [[Mel Gibson]]. Gibson portrays [[William Wallace]], a 13th-century Scottish warrior who led the Scots in the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] against King [[Edward I of England]]. The story is based on [[Blind Harry]]'s [[epic poem]] ''[[The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace]]'' and was [[film adaptation|adapted]] for the screen by [[Randall Wallace]]. It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.<ref name=histinac></ref>

The film was nominated for ten [[Academy Award]]s at the [[68th Academy Awards]] and won five including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

== Plot ==
In 1280, [[Edward I of England|King Edward "Longshanks"]] ([[Patrick McGoohan]]) invades and conquers [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] following the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland]] who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses the treachery of Longshanks, survives the death of his father and brother, and is taken abroad to [[Rome]] by his Uncle Argyle ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including [[Droit du seigneur|the right of the lord to have sex with a woman subject on her wedding night]]. When he returns home, Wallace ([[Mel Gibson]]) falls in love with his childhood friend, Murron MacClannough ([[Catherine McCormack]]), and they marry in secret so she does not have to spend a night in the bed of the English lord. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, as a consequence, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace slaughters the English garrison. Wallace sends the occupying garrison at [[Lanark]] back to England. 

This enrages Longshanks, and orders his son, [[Edward II of England]], to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at [[Battle of Stirling Bridge|Stirling]] and then sacks the city of York, killing Longshanks nephew and sending his head back. Wallace seeks the assistance of [[Robert the Bruce]] ([[Angus Macfadyen]]), the son of nobleman [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Elder]] ([[Ian Bannen]]) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife, [[Isabella of France]] ([[Sophie Marceau]]), to try to negotiate with Wallace hoping that Wallace will kill her in order to draw the French king to declare war. Wallace refuses the bribe sent with Isabella by Longshanks, but after meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored with him. Meanwhile, Longshanks prepares an army to invade Scotland. 

Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility that immediate action is needed to counter the threat and to take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay betray Wallace. The Scots lose the battle, and Hamish's father dies after the battle. As he charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, Wallace is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert. Remorseful, he gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English. Robert, intending to join Wallace and commit troops to the war, sets up a meeting with him in [[Edinburgh]]. However, Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace's child, intent on ending Longshanks line and ruling in his son's place. 

In [[London]], Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], Wallace refuses to beg for mercy and submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word "Mercy" and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts the word "Freedom!" and, impressed by the Scotsman's valour, the judge orders his death. Moments before being [[decapitation|decapitated]], Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him. In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.

== Production ==

Gibson's production company, [[Icon Productions]] had difficulty raising enough money even if he were to star in the film. [[Warner Bros.]] was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' sequel, which he refused. [[Paramount Pictures]] only agreed to American and Canadian distribution of ''Braveheart'' after [[20th Century Fox]] partnered for international rights.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117926430.html | title = Mel tongue-ties studios| author = Michael Fleming | publisher = |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] | date = 25 July 2005}}</ref>

While the crew spent six weeks shooting on location in Scotland, the major battle scenes were shot in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] using members of the [[Reserve Defence Forces|Irish Army Reserve]] as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras portray both armies. The opposing armies are made up of reservists, up to 1,600 in some scenes, who had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their drab uniforms for medieval garb.<ref>[http://www.unison.ie/meath_chronicle/stories.php3?ca=41&si=1031035&issue_id=9666 Braveheart 10th Chance To Boost Tourism In Trim]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}, Meath Chronicle, 28 August 2003. Retrieved 30 April 2007.</ref>

According to Gibson, he was inspired by the big screen epics he had loved as a child, such as [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' and [[William Wyler]]'s ''[[The Big Country]]''.

The film was shot in the [[anamorphic format]] with [[Panavision]] C- and E-Series lenses.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chris Probst | title=Cinematic Transcendence| journal=[[American Cinematographer]] | publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] | volume=77 | issue=6 | page=76 | location=[[Los Angeles, California]], United States | date=1 June 1996 | issn=0002-7928 }}</ref>

Gibson toned down the film's battle scenes to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[MPAA]], with the final version being rated R for "brutal [[medieval warfare]]."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.filmratings.com/ | title = Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA)

In addition to English being the film's primary language, [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]] are also spoken.

At a ''Braveheart'' Convention in 1997, held in [[Stirling]] the day after the [[Scottish Parliament#History|Scottish Devolution]] vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, ''Braveheart'' author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film. Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).

=== Cultural effects ===

[[Lin Anderson]], author of ''Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood'', credits the film with playing a significant role in affecting the [[Scottish political landscape]] in the mid to late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boztas |first=Senay |url=http://www.braveheart.info/news/2005/sunday_herald/2007-07-31/51063.html |title=Wallace movie ‘helped Scots get devolution’ – [Sunday Herald&#93; |publisher=Braveheart.info |date=31 July 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

=== Wallace Monument ===
[[File:BraveStatue 1200x1600.jpg|thumb|right|Tom Church's 'Freedom' statue.]]
In 1997, a 12-ton [[sandstone]] statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in ''Braveheart'' was placed in the car park of the [[Wallace Monument]] near [[Stirling]], [[Scotland]]. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a monumental mason from [[Brechin]],<ref name="courer">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2009/10/16/newsstory13954661t0.asp |work=[[The Courier]] |title=Wallace statue back at home of sculptor|accessdate=17 October 2009|date=16 October 2009}}</ref> included the word "Braveheart" on Wallace's shield.

After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as "among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/williamwallace/They-may-take-our-lives.2565370.jp |title=They may take our lives but they won't take Freedom |author=Kevin Hurley |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref> In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.<ref name="bbc_statue_removed">{{cite news |title=Wallace statue back with sculptor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/8310614.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref>

== Historical inaccuracy ==

Randall Wallace, the writer of the screenplay, has acknowledged [[Blind Harry]]'s 15th century [[epic poem]] ''The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie'' as a major inspiration for the film.<ref name=anderson>Anderson, Lin. ''Braveheart: From Hollywood to Holyrood''. Luath Press Ltd. (2005), p. 27.</ref> In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart."<ref name = anderson/> Although some incidents which are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scots nobles at the start), there are important aspects of the plot which are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabelle, although this may have been inspired by the play ''The Wallace: a triumph in five acts'' by [[Sydney Goodsir Smith]]).

Elizabeth Ewan describes ''Braveheart'' as a film which "almost totally [[anachronism|sacrifices historical accuracy]] for epic adventure".<ref name = "ewan">Ewan, Elizabeth. "Braveheart". American Historical Review 100, no. 4 (October 1995): 1219–21.</ref> The "brave heart" refers in Scottish history to that of [[Robert the Bruce]], and an attribution by [[William Edmondstoune Aytoun]], in his poem ''Heart of Bruce'', to [[Sir James the Good]]: ''"Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!"'', prior to Douglas's demise at the [[Battle of Teba]] in [[Andalusia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/0/9/4/10945/10945.htm |title=Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers and Other Poems / Aytoun, W.

Randall Wallace is very vocal about defending his script from historians who have dismissed the film as a Hollywood perversion of actual events. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In the DVD audio commentary of ''Braveheart'', Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more "cinematically compelling" than the historical fact or conventional mythos.

=== Ius Primae Noctis ===
In the film, [[Edward I of England|Edward Longshanks]], King of England, is shown invoking the right of [[Droit du seigneur|Ius Primae Noctis]], supposedly allowing the Lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serf's maiden daughters.  Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth, as one recent specialist has put it, "the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any."<ref>{{cite book|last=Classen|first=Albrecht|title=The medieval chastity belt: a myth-making process|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r_hncxYRQIoC&pg=PA147|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|page=151}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/weddings/customs/droit.asp |title=Urban legends website |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref>

=== Portrayal of William Wallace ===
As [[John Shelton Lawrence]] and [[Robert Jewett]] write, "Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland's most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to", summarized from Scots scholar [[Matt Ewart]]: 
{{Quote|Wallace was born into the gentry of Scotland; his father lived until he was 18, his mother until his 24th year; he killed the sheriff of [[Lanark]] when he was 27, apparently after the murder of his wife; he led a group of commoners against the English in a very successful battle at Stirling in 1297, temporarily receiving appointment as [[Guardian of Scotland|guardian]]; Wallace's reputation as a military leader was ruined in the same year of 1297, leading to his resignation as guardian; he spent several years of exile in France before being captured by the English at [[Glasgow]], this resulting in his trial for treason and his cruel execution.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawrence |first1=John Shelton |last2=Jewett |first2=Robert |title=The Myth of the American Superhero |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |year=2002 |isbn=0802849113 |page=163}}</ref> }}

[[Canitz|A.E. Christa Canitz]] writes about the historical William Wallace further: "[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointed [[Guardian of Scotland|Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland]], engaged in diplomatic correspondence with the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic cities]] of [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] and [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]]". She finds that in ''Braveheart'', "any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate."<ref name="Canitz">{{cite book | year=2005 | last=Canitz | first=A.

[[Colin McArthur]] writes that ''Braveheart'' "constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, [[nationalist]] [[guerrilla]] leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state."  Writing about ''Braveheart''{{'}}s "omissions of verified historical facts", McArthur notes that Wallace made "overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk", as well as "the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted to [[conscription]] and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve."<ref>{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Colin |year=1998 |chapter=''Braveheart'' and the Scottish Aesthetic Dementia |editor-first=Tony |editor-last=Barta |title=Screening the Past: Film and the Representation of History |publisher=Praeger |pages=167–187  |isbn=978-0-275-95402-4}}</ref>  Canitz posits that depicting "such lack of class solidarity" as the conscriptions and related hangings "would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable ''[[primus inter pares]]'' among his peasant fighters."<ref name="Canitz"/>

=== Portrayal of Isabella of France ===
In the film, [[Isabella of France]] is shown having an affair with Wallace prior to the [[Battle of Falkirk]]. She later tells Edward I that she is pregnant, implying that her son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], was a product of the affair. In actuality, Isabella was three years old and living in France at the time, was not married to Edward II until he was already king and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ewan | first=Elizabeth | date=October 1995 | title=Braveheart |journal=The American Historical Review | publisher=Indiana University Press | location=Bloomington | volume=100 |issue=4 | pages=1219–21 | issn=0002-8762 | oclc=01830326 | accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=White | first=Caroline | title=The 10 most historically inaccurate movies | publisher=The Times | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece | date=4 August 2009 | accessdate=2009-08-05 | location=London | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110615070116/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece | archivedate=15 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Portrayal of Robert the Bruce ===

[[Image:Brave mel.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mel Gibson as William Wallace wearing [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]].]]

[[Robert the Bruce]] did change sides between the Scots loyalists and the [[England|English]] more than once in the earlier stages of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and it is unlikely that he fought, per Fordun's Chronicle, on the English side at the [[Battle of Falkirk]]. Later, the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was not a spontaneous battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years.<ref name=traquair/>

=== Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward ===

The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his character for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], and as a religious man he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Edward died on campaign and not in bed at his home.<ref name=traquair/>

The depiction of the [[Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward II of England]]) as an [[effeminate|effeminate homosexual]] drew accusations of [[homophobia]] against Gibson. {{quote|We cut a scene out, unfortunately. . . where you really got to know that character [Edward II] and to understand his plight and his pain. . . . But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, 'When's this story going to start?'<ref>USA Today, May 24, 1995, “Gibson has faith in family and freedom” by Marco R. della Cava</ref>{{better source|date=October 2012}}}} The actual Edward II, who fathered five children by two different women, was rumoured to have had sexual affairs with men, including [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]] who lived on into the reign of Edward II. The Prince's male lover Phillip was loosely based on Piers Gaveston.

Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying,
{{quote|I'm just trying to respond to history. You can cite other examples – [[Alexander the Great]], for example, who conquered the entire world, was also a homosexual. But this story isn't about Alexander the Great. It's about Edward II.<ref>San Francisco Chronicle, 21 May 1995, “Mel Gibson Dons Kilt and Directs” by Ruth Stein</ref>}}

In response to Longshank's [[defenestration]] of the Prince's male lover Phillip, Gibson replied that "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody."<ref>{{citation

Gibson asserted that the reason that Longshanks kills his son's lover is because the king is a "[[Psychopathy|psychopath]]".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1995-05-25/film/icon/ | title=Icon: Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery | author=Matt Zoller Seitz | publisher= |work=Dallas Observer |date=May 25, 1995 | accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>  Gibson expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder.

== Accusations of anglophobia ==
The English media accused the film of harbouring [[Anglophobia]].

== Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack for ''Braveheart'' was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]], and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The soundtrack, comprising 77 minutes of background music taken from significant scenes in the film, was noticeably successful, and album co-producer Simon Rhodes produced a follow-up soundtrack in 1997 titled ''More Music from Braveheart''. International and French versions of the soundtrack have also been released. {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Several writers have noted the main theme song's resemblance to an earlier theme song for the 1991 [[anime]] series ''[[3x3 Eyes]]'', composed by [[Kaoru Wada]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=3x3 Eyes (1991)|url=http://www.usaanime.us/Reviews/3x3Eyes.htm|publisher=USA Anime|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Theron|title=3x3 Eyes DVDs 1 and 2|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/3x3-eyes/dvd-1|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=19 July 2012|date=14 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=3X3 Eyes: Perfect Collection – from Streamline/Orion|url=http://www.gamemonkeys.com/reviews/0/3x3eyes.htm|work=Game Monkeys Magazine|accessdate=19 July 2012|year=1999}}</ref>

Irish band [[Clannad]] wrote a theme tune for the film, entitled 'Croí Cróga' (meaning 'braveheart'). However, the track was not used in the soundtrack, but was released by Clannad on the album 'Lore'.
