The '''Accelerated Graphics Port''' (often shortened to '''AGP''') is a high-speed point-to-point channel for attaching a [[video card]] to a [[computer]]'s [[motherboard]], primarily to assist in the acceleration of [[3D computer graphics]]. Originally it was designed as a successor to [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] type connections. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of [[PCI Express]] (PCIe). By mid-2008, PCIe cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available.<ref>[http://news.softpedia.com/news/AGP-Almost-at-the-End-of-the-Road-87316.shtml AGP almost at the end, Softpedia]</ref>

==Advantages over PCI==
As computers increasingly became graphically oriented, successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]], a [[computer bus|bus]] with shared bandwidth. This led to the development of AGP, a "bus" dedicated to graphics adapters.

The primary advantage of AGP over PCI is that it provides a dedicated pathway between the slot and the processor rather than sharing the PCI bus. In addition to a lack of contention for the bus, the direct connection allows for higher clock speeds. AGP also uses sideband addressing, meaning that the [[address bus|address]] and [[data bus]]es are separated so the entire packet does not need to be read to get addressing information. This is done by adding eight extra 8-bit [[computer bus|buses]] which allow the graphics controller to issue new AGP requests and commands at the same time with other AGP data flowing via the main 32 address/data (AD) lines. This results in improved overall AGP data throughput.

In addition, to load a texture, a PCI graphics card must copy it from the system's RAM into the card's [[Video memory]], whereas an AGP card is capable of reading textures directly from system RAM using the [[graphics address remapping table]], which reapportions main memory as needed for [[Texture mapping|texture]] storage, allowing the graphics card to access them directly.<ref>[http://www.sysopt.com/features/mboard/article.php/3549951 What is AGP?], SysOpt, September 19, 2003.</ref> The maximum amount of system memory available to AGP is defined as the AGP [[Aperture (computer memory)|aperture]].

==History==
[[Image:AGP-Video-Card.jpg|thumb|An AGP card]]
The AGP slot first appeared on [[x86]] compatible system boards based on [[Socket 7]] Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] and [[Slot 1]] [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] [[Pentium II]] processors. Intel introduced AGP support with the i[[440LX]] Slot 1 chipset on August 26, 1997, and a flood of products followed from all the major system board vendors.<ref name=Intel440LXdata>[http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/290564.htm Intel 440LX AGPset], Intel, accessed October 18, 2007.</ref>

The first Socket 7 chipsets to support AGP were the [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] [[Apollo VP3]], [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] 5591/5592, and the [[Acer Laboratories Incorporated|ALI]] Aladdin V. Intel never released an AGP-equipped Socket 7 chipset. [[First International Computer|FIC]] demonstrated the first Socket 7 AGP system board in November 1997 as the ''FIC PA-2012'' based on the VIA Apollo VP3 chipset, followed very quickly by the ''EPoX P55-VP3'' also based on the VIA VP3 chipset which was first to market.<ref>Lal Shimpi, Anand. [http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=155&p=1 Chipset Guide (Socket 7)], Anandtech, August 1, 1997.</ref>

Early video chipsets featuring AGP support included the [[Rendition (company)|Rendition]] Vérité V2200, [[3dfx]] [[3dfx#Voodoo Banshee|Voodoo Banshee]], [[Nvidia]] [[RIVA 128]], [[3Dlabs]] PERMEDIA 2, [[Intel740|Intel i740]], [[ATI Rage|ATI Rage series]], [[Matrox]] Millennium II, and [[S3 ViRGE|S3 ViRGE GX/2]]. Some early AGP boards used graphics processors built around PCI and were simply bridged to AGP. This resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus, with the only improvement used being the 66&nbsp;MHz bus clock, with its resulting doubled bandwidth over PCI, and bus exclusivity. Examples of such cards were the Voodoo Banshee, Vérité V2200, Millennium II, and S3 ViRGE GX/2. Intel's i740 was explicitly designed to exploit the new AGP feature set. In fact it was designed to texture only from AGP memory, making PCI versions of the board difficult to implement (local board RAM had to emulate AGP memory.)

Microsoft first introduced AGP support into ''[[Windows 95]] OEM Service Release 2'' (OSR2 version 1111 or 950B) via the ''USB SUPPLEMENT to OSR2'' patch.<ref>[http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000145.htm Which version of Windows 95 supports AGP?], ComputerHope, accessed October 18, 2007.</ref> After applying the patch the Windows 95 system became ''Windows 95 version 4.00.950 B''. The first Windows NT-based operating system to receive AGP support was [[Windows NT 4.0]] with [[Service Pack]] 3, introduced in 1997. [[Linux]] support for AGP enhanced fast data transfers was first added in 1999 with the implementation of the [[AGPgart]] kernel module.

==Versions==

Upgraded registers include PCISTS, CAPPTR, NCAPID, AGPSTAT, AGPCMD, NISTAT, NICMD. New required registers include APBASELO, APBASEHI, AGPCTRL, APSIZE, NEPG, GARTLO, GARTHI.

There are various physical interfaces (connectors); see [[#Compatibility|Compatibility]] section.

===Official extensions===
[[File:NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti 4600 Mac.jpg|thumb|AGP graphics card ([[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]])]]
[[File:Quadro ELSA GLoria II Pro.jpg|thumb|AGP Pro graphics card]]

====AGP Pro====
It is an official extension for cards that required more electrical power. It is a longer slot with additional pins for that purpose. AGP Pro cards were usually workstation-class cards used to accelerate professional [[computer-aided design]] applications employed in the fields of architecture, machining, engineering, simulations, and similar fields.<ref>[http://www.motherboards.org/files/techspecs/apro_r11a.pdf AGP Pro 1.1a specification]</ref>

====64-bit AGP====
A [[64-bit]] channel was once proposed as an optional standard for AGP 3.0 in draft documents,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20010613041316/www.intel.com/technology/agp/downloads/agp8x_v091R_042401.pdf Draft AGP8× Interface Specification Rev. 0.91R]</ref> but it was dropped in the final version of the standard.

The standard allows 64-bit transfer for AGP8× reads, writes, and fast writes; 32-bit transfer for PCI operations.

===Unofficial variations===
A number of non-standard variations of the AGP interface have been produced by manufacturers.

====Internal AGP interface====
;Ultra-AGP, Ultra-AGPII: It is an internal AGP interface standard used by [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] for the north bridge controllers with integrated graphics. The original version supports same bandwidth as AGP 8×, while Ultra-AGPII has maximum 3.2GB/s bandwidth.

====PCI-based AGP ports====
:;AGP Express: Not a true AGP interface, but allows an AGP card to be connected over the legacy [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI bus]] on a [[PCI Express]] motherboard. It is a technology used on motherboards made by [[Elitegroup Computer Systems|ECS]], intended to allow an existing AGP card to be used in a new motherboard instead of requiring a PCIe card to be obtained (since the introduction of PCIe graphics cards few motherboards provide AGP slots). An "AGP Express" slot is basically a PCI slot (with twice the electrical power) with an AGP connector. It offers backward compatibility with AGP cards, but provides incomplete support<ref>[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051216142008/www.ecs.com.tw/ECSWeb/Support/agp.aspx?MenuID=0&LanID=0]</ref> (some AGP cards do not work with AGP Express) and reduced performance—the card is forced to use the shared PCI bus at its lower bandwidth, rather than having exclusive use of the faster AGP.
:;AGI: The ASRock Graphics Interface (AGI) is a proprietary variant of the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) standard. Its purpose is to provide AGP-support for ASRock motherboards that use chipsets lacking native AGP support. However, it is not fully compatible with AGP, and several video card chipsets are known not to be supported.
:;AGX: The [[Epox|EpoX]] Advanced Graphics eXtended (AGX) is another proprietary AGP variant with the same advantages and disadvantages as AGI. User manuals recommend not using AGP 8× ATI cards with AGX slots.
:;XGP: The [[Biostar]] Xtreme Graphics Port is another AGP variant, also with the same advantages and disadvantages as AGI and AGX.

====PCIe based AGP ports====
:;AGR: The [[Advanced Graphics Riser]] is a variation of the AGP port used in some PCIe motherboards made by [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] to offer limited backwards compatibility with AGP. It is, effectively, a modified PCIe slot allowing for performance comparable to an AGP 4×/8× slot,<ref>[http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=1806&page=2 MSI K8N Neo3-F Motherboard Review—What's an AGR video slot?]</ref> but does not support all AGP cards; the manufacturer published a list of some cards and chipsets that work with the modified slot.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081116224856/http://www.msi.com.tw/html/products/mainboard/agr/7135agr.pdf List of cards and chipsets that work with the MSI AGR port]</ref>

==Compatibility==
[[Image:AGP & AGP Pro Keying.svg|right|thumb|300px|Compatibility, AGP Keys on card (top), on slot (bottom)]]

AGP cards are [[Backward compatibility|backward]] and [[Forward compatibility|forward compatible]] within limits. 1.5 V-only keyed cards will not go into 3.3 V slots and vice versa, though "Universal" cards exist which will fit into either type of slot. There are also unkeyed "Universal" slots that will accept either type of card. When an AGP Universal card is plugged-into an AGP Universal slot, only the 1.5 V portion of the card is used. Some cards, like Nvidia's [[GeForce 6]] series (except the 6200) or ATI's [[Radeon X800]] series, only have keys for 1.5 V to prevent them from being installed in older mainboards without 1.5 V support. Some of the last modern cards with 3.3 V support were the Nvidia [[GeForce FX]] series (FX 5200, FX 5500, FX 5700, some FX 5800, FX 5900 and some FX 5950), Geforce 6 Series (6200, 6600/6600 LE/6600 GT only) and the ATI [[Radeon R300|Radeon 9500/9700/9800(R350)]] (but not 9600/9800(R360)). Some Geforce 6200 and Geforce 6600 cards will function with AGP 1.0 (3.3v) slots.

AGP Pro cards will not fit into standard slots, but standard AGP cards will work in a Pro slot. Motherboards equipped with a Universal AGP Pro slot will accept a 1.5 V or 3.3 V card in either the AGP Pro or standard AGP configuration, a Universal AGP card, or a Universal AGP Pro card.

Some cards incorrectly have dual notches, and some motherboards incorrectly have fully open slots, allowing a card to be plugged into a slot that does not support the correct signaling voltage, which may damage card or motherboard. Some incorrectly designed older 3.3 V cards have the 1.5 V key.

There are some proprietary systems incompatible with standard AGP; for example, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Power Macintosh]] computers with the [[Apple Display Connector]] (ADC) have an extra connector which delivers power to the attached display. Some cards designed to work with a specific [[CPU design|CPU architecture]] (e.g., PC, Apple) may not work with others due to [[firmware]] issues.

Mark Allen of Playtools.com made the following comments regarding Practical AGP Compatibility for AGP 3.0 and AGP 2.0:<ref>{{Cite web|last=Allen |first=Mark |title=AGP compatibility for sticklers |work=Video card information |url=http://www.playtool.com/pages/agpcompat/agp.html |publisher=PlayTool.com |date=2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121090056/http://www.playtool.com/pages/agpcompat/agp.html |archivedate=2012-12-21 |deadurl=no }}</ref>

<blockquote>"...nobody makes AGP 3.0 cards, and nobody makes AGP 3.0 motherboards. At least not any manufacturers I can find. Every single video card I could find which claimed to be an AGP 3.0 card was actually a universal 1.5V AGP 3.0 card. And every motherboard which claimed to be an AGP 3.0 motherboard turned out to be a universal 1.5V AGP 3.0 motherboard. It makes sense, if you think about it, because if anyone actually shipped a consumer-oriented product which supported only 0.8 volts, they would end up with lots of confused customers and a support nightmare. In the consumer market, you'd have to be crazy to ship a 0.8 volt only product."</blockquote>

==Power consumption==
{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}
Actual power supplied by an AGP slot depends upon the card used. The maximum [[Electric current|current]] drawn from the various rails is given in the specifications for the various versions. For example, if maximum current is drawn from all supplies and all voltages are at their specified upper limits,<ref name=agp3spec/> an AGP&nbsp;3.0 slot can supply up to 48.25&nbsp;[[watt]]s; this figure can be used to specify a power supply conservatively, but in practice a card is unlikely ever to draw more than 40&nbsp;W from the slot, with many using less. AGP Pro provides additional power up to 110&nbsp;W. Many AGP cards had additional power connectors to supply them with more power than the slot could provide.

==Legacy use==
By 2010 few new motherboards had AGP slots. No new motherboard chipsets were equipped with AGP support, but motherboards continued to be produced with older chipsets with support for AGP.

Graphics processors of this period use PCI-Express, a general-purpose (not restricted to graphics) standard that supports higher data transfer rates and [[Duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]]. To create AGP-compatible graphics cards, those chips require an additional PCIe-to-AGP bridge-chip to convert PCIe signals to and from AGP signals. This incurs additional board costs due to the need for the additional bridge chip and for a separate AGP-designed circuit board.

Various manufacturers of graphics cards continued to produce AGP cards for the shrinking AGP user-base. The first bridged cards were the GeForce 6600 and ATI Radeon X800 XL boards, released during 2004-5.<ref>Gasior, Geoff. [http://techreport.com/articles.x/7624 Nvidia's GeForce 6600 GT AGP graphics card: Bridging backwards], Tech Report, November 16, 2004.</ref><ref>Gasior, Geoff. [http://techreport.com/articles.x/8344 ATI's new AGP Radeons: A bridge is born], Tech Report, May 20, 2005.</ref> In 2009 AGP cards from Nvidia had a ceiling of the [[GeForce 7 Series]]. In 2011 [[DirectX]] 10-capable AGP cards from AMD vendors (Club 3D, HIS, Sapphire, Jaton, Visiontek, Diamond, etc.) included the [[Radeon R600|Radeon HD 2400, 3450, 3650]], [[Radeon R700|4350, 4650, and 4670]]. The HD 5000 AGP series mentioned in the catalyst software was never available. There were many problems with the AMD Catalyst 11.2 - 11.6 AGP hotfix drivers under Windows 7 with the HD 4000 series AGP video cards;<ref>[http://forums.amd.com/game/messageview.cfm?catid=279&threadid=152471&highlight_key=y&keyword1=agp AMD community forums]</ref> use of 10.12 or 11.1 AGP hotfix drivers is the recommended{{by whom|date=October 2011}} workaround. Several of the vendors listed above make available past versions of the AGP drivers.
