'''Amicable numbers''' are two different [[number]]s so related that the [[addition|sum]] of the [[proper divisor]]s of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an [[aliquot sequence]] of [[Periodic sequence|period]] 2. A related concept is that of a [[perfect number]], which is a number that equals the sum of ''its own'' proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. Numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as [[sociable number]]s.

For example, the smallest pair of amicable numbers is ([[220 (number)|220]], [[284 (number)|284]]); for the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.

The first few amicable pairs are: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368) {{OEIS|id=A063990}}.

== History ==
Amicable numbers were known to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], who credited them with many mystical properties. A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] mathematician [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (826–901). Other [[Arab]] mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti|al-Majriti]] (died 1007), [[Ibn Tahir al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]] (980–1037), and [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320). The [[Iran]]ian mathematician [[Muhammad Baqir Yazdi]] (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to [[René Descartes|Descartes]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Costello |first = Patrick  | title = New Amicable Pairs Of Type (2; 2) And Type (3; 2)  | journal = Mathematics of computation | volume = 72 | pages = 489–497 | publisher = American Mathematical Society  | date = 1 May 2002 | url = http://www.ams.org/mcom/2003-72-241/S0025-5718-02-01414-X/S0025-5718-02-01414-X.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2007 |issue=241 | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-02-01414-X}}
</ref> Much of the work of Eastern mathematicians in this area has been forgotten.

Thābit ibn Qurra's formula was rediscovered by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] (1601–1665) and [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (1596–1650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783). It was extended further by [[Walter Borho|Borho]] in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians. Euler also discovered dozens of new pairs. The second smallest pair, (1184, 1210), was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage B. Nicolò I. Paganini, having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sprugnoli|first=Renzo|title=Introduzione alla matematica: La matematica della scuola media|url=http://www.dsi.unifi.it/~resp/media.pdf|publisher=Universita degli Studi di Firenze: Dipartimento di Sistemi e Informatica|accessdate=21 August 2012|page=59|language=Italian|date=27 September 2005}}</ref>

As of 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. Exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10<sup>8</sup> in 1970, to 10<sup>10</sup> in 1986, 10<sup>11</sup> in 1993, and to a bound well over that today.

In 2007, there were almost 12,000,000 known amicable pairs.<ref>Jan Munch Pedersen [http://amicable.homepage.dk/knwnc2.htm Known Amicable Pairs]</ref>

== Rules for generation ==
While these rules do generate some pairs of amicable numbers, many other pairs are known, so these rules are by no means comprehensive.

===Thābit ibn Qurra theorem===
The '''Thābit ibn Qurra theorem''' is a method for discovering amicable numbers invented in the ninth century by the [[Arab]] [[mathematician]] [[Thābit ibn Qurra]].<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ThabitibnKurrahRule.html</ref>

It states that if
:''p'' = 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,
:''q'' = 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,
:''r'' = 9&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>2''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,
where ''n'' > 1 is an [[integer]] and ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are [[prime number]]s, then 2''<sup>n</sup>×p×q'' and 2''<sup>n</sup>×r'' are a pair of amicable numbers. This formula gives the pairs (220, 284) for ''n''=2, (17296, 18416) for ''n''=4, and (9363584, 9437056) for ''n''=7, but no other such pairs are known. Numbers of the form 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 are known as [[Thabit number]]s. In order for Ibn Qurra's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive Thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of ''n''.

To establish the theorem, Thâbit ibn Qurra proved nine [[lemmas]] divided into two groups. The first three lemmas deal with the determination of the aliquot parts of a natural integer. The second group of lemmas deals more specifically with the formation of perfect, abundant and deficient numbers.<ref name="Rashed">{{cite book|last=Rashed|first=Roshdi|title=The development of Arabic mathematics: between arithmetic and algebra.|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht, Boston, London|year=1994|volume=156|isbn=0-7923-2565-6|page=278,279}}</ref>

===Euler's rule===
''Euler's rule''' is a generalization of the Thâbit ibn Qurra theorem. It states that if
:''p'' = (2<sup>(n&nbsp;-&nbsp;m)</sup>+1)&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>''m''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,
:''q'' = (2<sup>(n&nbsp;-&nbsp;m)</sup>+1)&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,
:''r'' = (2<sup>(n&nbsp;-&nbsp;m)</sup>+1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;×&nbsp;2<sup>''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,
where ''n''>''m''> 0 are [[integer]]s and ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are [[prime number]]s, then 2<sup>n</sup>×p×q and 2<sup>n</sup>×r are a pair of amicable numbers. Thābit ibn Qurra's theorem corresponds to the case m=n-1. Euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for (m,n)=(1,8), (29,40) with no others being known. [[William Dunham (mathematician)|William Dunham]] in a video <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-DV26x6n_Q&t=37m An Evening with Leonhard Euler - YouTube]</ref> claims that Euler (1750) found 58 such pairs to make all the by then existing pairs 61.

== Regular pairs ==
Let (''m'', ''n'') be a pair of amicable numbers with ''m''<''n'', and write ''m=gM'' and ''n=gN'' where ''g'' is the [[greatest common divisor]] of ''m'' and ''n''. If ''M'' and ''N'' are both [[coprime]] to ''g'' and [[Square-free integer|square free]] then the pair (''m'', ''n'') is said to be '''regular''', otherwise it is called '''irregular''' or '''exotic'''. If (''m'', ''n'') is regular and ''M'' and ''N'' have ''i'' and ''j'' prime factors respectively, then (''m'', ''n'') is said to be of '''type''' (''i'', ''j'').

For example, with (''m'', ''n'') = (220, 284), the greatest common divisor is 4 and so M = 55 and N = 71. Therefore (220, 284) is regular of type (2, 1).

== Other results ==
In every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both [[Even and odd numbers|even]] or both odd. It is not known whether an even-odd pair of amicable numbers exists, but if it does, the even number must either be a square number or twice one, and the odd number must be a square number. Also, every known pair shares at least one common [[Divisor|factor]], higher than 1. It is not known whether a pair of [[coprime]] amicable numbers exists, though if any does, the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the two must be greater than 10<sup>67</sup>. Also, a pair of coprime amicable numbers cannot be generated by Thabit's formula (above), nor by any similar formula.

In 1955, [[Paul Erdős]] showed that the density of amicable numbers, relative to the positive integers, was 0.
