A '''Christmas tree''' is a decorated tree, usually an [[evergreen]] [[pinophyta|conifer]] such as [[spruce]], or [[pine]] or [[fir]], traditionally associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]].  An [[artificial Christmas tree]] is an object made to resemble such a tree, usually made from [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC).

The tree was traditionally decorated with edibles such as apples, nuts or dates. In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by [[candle]]s, which with [[electrification]] could also be replaced by [[Christmas lights]]. Today, there are a wide variety of [[Christmas ornament|traditional ornaments]], such as [[garland]], [[tinsel]], and [[candy cane]]s. An angel or star may be placed at the top of the tree to represent the host of angels or the [[Star of Bethlehem]] from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].

The custom of the Christmas tree developed in [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]] with predecessors that can be traced to the 16th and possibly the 15th century, in which "devout Christians brought decorated trees into their homes".<ref name="History.com">{{cite web |title=History of Christmas Trees |url=http://www.history.com/topics/history-of-christmas-trees |publisher=[[History (TV channel)|History]] |accessdate=15 December 2012 }}</ref> It acquired popularity beyond [[Germany]] during the second half of the 19th century.<ref name="Weber-Kellermann">{{cite book |author=Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann |title=Das Weihnachtsfest.

==History==

===Possible predecessors===
While it is clear that the modern Christmas tree originates in [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] and [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]], there are a number of speculative theories as to its ultimate origin. Its 16th-century origins are sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer [[Martin Luther]] who, according to the TV channel [[History (TV channel)|History]], "first added lighted candles to a tree."<ref name="History.com"/><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ikyr6IrlD5wC&pg=PA119 |author=Helen Haidle |title=Christmas Legends to Remember' |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-56292-534-5 |page=119 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YDx3g-05fNoC&lpg=PA22 |author=Debbie Trafton O'Neal, David LaRochelle |title=Before and After Christmas |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8066-4156-0 |page=22 }}</ref>

It is frequently traced to the symbolism of [[evergreen]] trees in pre-Christian winter rites, in particular through the story of [[Donar's Oak]] (though the oak tree is obviously not an evergreen) and the popularized story of [[Saint Boniface]] and the conversion of the German pagans.<ref>The story, not recounted in the ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' written in his time, appears in a [[BBC]] Devon website, "Devon Myths and Legends", and in a number of educational storybooks, including ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree: A Story to Color'' by Jenny Melmoth and Val Hayward (Warrington: Alfresco Books 1999 ISBN 1-873727-15-1), ''The Brightest Star of All: Christmas Stories for the Family'' by Carrie Papa (Abingdon Press 1999 ISBN 978-0-687-64813-9) and [http://books.google.com/books?id=BdEAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA207 "How Saint Boniface Kept Christmas Eve"] by Mary Louise Harvey in ''The American Normal Readers: Fifth Book'', 207-22. Silver, Burdett and Co. 1912.</ref>

According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "The use of evergreen trees, wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmastime."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Christmas tree |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115737/Christmas-tree }}</ref>

Alternatively, it is identified with the "[[tree of life (biblical)|tree of paradise]]" of medieval [[mystery play]]s that were given on 24 December, the commemoration and [[name day]] of [[Adam and Eve]] in various countries. In such plays, a tree decorated with apples (to represent the forbidden fruit) and wafers (to represent the [[Eucharist]] and redemption) was used as a setting for the play. Like the [[Nativity scene|Christmas crib]], the Paradise tree was later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as shiny red balls.<ref name="Dues"/><ref name="Karas"/><ref name="Lazowski">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HIhIPIYLQ6QC&pg=PA204 |author=Philip Lazowski |title=Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-88125-811-0 |pages=203–04 }}</ref><ref name="Foley">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XstmMVLDzIIC&pg=PA18 |author=Michael P.

The main prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans set up a paradise tree in their homes on December 24, the religious feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the [[Christmas pyramid]], a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star. By the 16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had merged, becoming the Christmas tree. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2003 }}</ref>

===Early evidence===
<big>'''Poland'''</big>
<gallery>
File:Plik:Podlaznik.jpg


There was an old pagan custom of suspending at the ceiling a branch of fir, spruce or pine called [[Podłaźniczka]] associated with [[Koliada]]. The branches were decorated with apples, nuts, cookies, colored paper, stars made of straw, ribbons and colored wafers. People believed in the tree magical powers linked with harvesting and success in the next year.
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, these traditions were almost completely replaced by the German custom of decorating the Christmas tree. [[File:Plik:Podlaznik.jpg|thumbnail]]
Customs of erecting decorated trees in wintertime can be traced to Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era [[guild]]s in [[Northern Germany]] and [[Livonia]]. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the apprentices and children. In [[Livonia]] (present-day [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]), in 1441, 1442, 1510 and 1514, the [[Brotherhood of Blackheads]] erected a tree for the holidays in their guild houses in [[Riga]] and Reval (now [[Tallinn]]). On the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall Square]] where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Friedrich Amelung |title={{lang|de|Geschichte der Revaler Schwarzenhäupter: von ihrem Ursprung an bis auf die Gegenwart: nach den urkundenmäßigen Quellen des Revaler Schwarzenhäupter-Archivs 1, Die erste Blütezeit von 1399–1557}} |trans_title={{lang|en|History of the Tallinn Blackheads: from their origins until the present day: from the testimonial sources of the Tallinn Blackheads archive. 1: The first golden age of 1399–1557}} |location=[[Tallinn|Reval]] |publisher=Wassermann |year=1885 }}</ref> A [[Bremen]] guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with "apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers" was erected in the guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.<ref name="Weber-Kellermann"/> In 1584, the pastor and chronicler [[Balthasar Russow]] in his ''{{lang|gml|Chronica der Provinz Lyfflandt}}'' (1584) wrote of an established tradition of setting up a decorated [[Picea abies|spruce]] at the market square where the young men "went with a flock of maidens and women, first sang and danced there and then set the tree aflame".

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], such trees are seen in the houses of upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic [[Nativity scene|Christmas cribs]]. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===18th to early 20th centuries===

====Germany====
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1871) 109.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|de|[[Die Gartenlaube]]}}'' (1871) showing "the German Christmas tree" (''{{lang|de|Der deutsche Weihnachtsbaum}}'') in a field hospital in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]].]]

By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper [[Rhineland]], but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles, expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th century.

Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The custom did eventually gain wider acceptance, beginning around 1815, by way of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officials who emigrated there following the [[Congress of Vienna]].

In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] and of ''{{lang|de|[[Gemütlichkeit]]}}'', especially among [[ethnic Germans|emigrants]] overseas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Johannes Marbach |title=Die heilige Weihnachtszeit nach Bedeutung, Geschichte, Sitten und Symbolen|language=German |trans_title=The holy Christmas season for meaning, history, customs and symbols |year=1859 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FXhEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA416 |page=416 |quote=''{{lang|de|Was ist auch eine deutsche Christenfamilie am Christabend ohne Christbäumchen?

A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Only at the start of the 20th century did Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit form.<ref name="Hermelink">{{cite book |author=Jan Hermelink |chapter=Weihnachtsgottesdienst |trans_chapter=Christmas worship |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WOrt4xXGSKcC&pg=PA290 |editor=Christian Grethlein |editor2=Günter Ruddat |title=Liturgisches Kompendium|language=German |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-525-57211-5 |page=290 }}</ref>

In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. [[Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] introduced the Christmas tree to [[Vienna]] in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the [[Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans|duchesse d'Orléans]]. In Denmark a Danish newspaper claims that the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] in 1865. He had published a fairy-tale called ''[[The Fir-Tree]]'' in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir-tree being used as a Christmas tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |work=Kristelig Dagblad |title=Danmarks første juletræ blev tændt i 1808 |date=December 17, 2008 }}</ref>

====Britain====
Although the tradition of decorating the home with evergreens was long established, the custom of decorating an entire small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago.  At the time of the [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]'s German-born queen, [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], introduced a Christmas tree at a party she gave for children in 1800.<ref>[http://www.thamesweb.co.uk/christmas/christmas_tree.html At Queen's Lodge, Windsor]</ref> The custom did not at first spread much beyond the royal family.<ref>In 1829 the diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Greville]], visiting [[Panshanger]] country house, describes three small Christmas trees "such as is customary in Germany" which [[Dorothea Lieven|Princess Lieven]] had put up. {{cite book|last=Hole|first=Christine|title=English Custom and Usage|year=1950|publisher=B.T.Batsford Ltd|location=London|pages=16}}</ref> Queen Victoria as a child was familiar with it and a tree was placed in her room every Christmas.

[[File:1870 ChristmasTree byEhninger HarpersBazaar.jpeg|thumb|upright|Illustration for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', published 1 January 1870.]]
The tradition was introduced to [[Canada]] in the winter of 1781 by [[Germans in the American Revolution|Brunswick soldiers]] stationed in the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] to garrison the colony against [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|American attack]].

Several cities in the United States with German connections lay claim to that country's first Christmas tree: [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]], claims that a Hessian soldier put up a Christmas tree in 1777 while imprisoned at the Noden-Reed House, while the "First Christmas Tree in America" is also claimed by [[Easton, Pennsylvania]], where German settlers purportedly erected a Christmas tree in 1816. In his diary, Matthew Zahm of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], recorded the use of a Christmas tree in 1821, leading Lancaster to also lay claim to the first Christmas tree in America.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Christmas |work=Gareth Marples |url=http://www.thehistoryof.net/the-history-of-christmas.html |accessdate=December 2, 2006 }}</ref> Other accounts credit [[Charles Follen]], a German immigrant to Boston, for being the first to introduce to America the custom of decorating a Christmas tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1996/12.12/ProfessorBrough.html |title=Professor Brought Christmas Tree to New England |date=December 12, 1996 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |work=[[Harvard Gazette|Harvard University Gazette]] }}</ref> [[August Imgard]], a German immigrant living in [[Wooster, Ohio]], is the first to popularise the practice of decorating a tree with [[candy cane]]s.

German immigrant Charles Minnegerode accepted a position as a professor of humanities at the [[College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1842, where he taught Latin and Greek. Entering into the social life of the Virginia Tidewater, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St. George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 |title=Charles Minnigerode (1814–1894) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Virginia |publisher=[[Virginia Foundation for the Humanities]] }}</ref>

The lyrics sung in the United States to the German tune ''{{lang|de|[[O Tannenbaum]]}}'' begin "O Christmas tree", giving rise to the mistaken idea that the [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|Tannenbaum}}'' (fir tree) means "Christmas tree", the German word for which is instead ''{{lang|de|Weihnachtsbaum}}''.

In [[Russia]], the Christmas tree was banned shortly after the [[October Revolution]] but then reinstated as a ''New-year spruce'' ({{lang|ru|Новогодняя ёлка, ''Novogodnyaya yolka''}}) in 1935. It became a fully secular icon of the [[New Year]] holiday, for example, the crowning star was regarded not as a symbol of Bethlehem Star, but as the [[Red star|Red Star]]. Decorations, such as figurines of airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, [[cosmonaut]]s, and characters of Russian fairy tales, were produced. This tradition persists after the fall of the USSR, with the [[Novy God|New Year holiday]] outweighing the Christmas (7 January) for a wide majority of Russian people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.levada.ru/27-04-2012/1-maya-sobirayutsya-prazdnovat-59-rossiyan |title=1 мая собираются праздновать 59% россиян |language=Russian|trans_title=May 1 going to celebrate 59% of Russians |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |language=Russian |quote=New Year is among the most important holidays for 81% of Russians, while Christmas is such only for 19%, ranking after [[Victory Day]], [[Easter]], [[International Women's Day]]. }}</ref>

The TV special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965) was influential on the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. [[Aluminum Christmas tree]]s were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the Charlie Brown show and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of Christmas. The term  ''Charlie Brown Christmas tree'', describing any poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV special, based on the appearance of [[Charlie Brown]]'s Christmas tree.{{citation needed |date=December 2012}}

====Public Christmas trees====
Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns, and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as the [[Macy's Great Tree]] in [[Atlanta]] (since 1948), the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] in [[Adelaide]].

This tradition grew into one of the most spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flashback Blog: The World's Largest Decorated Christmas Tree |work=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |date=December 3, 2009 |url=http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>

In some cities, a [[Festival of Trees]] is organized around the decoration and display of multiple trees as charity events. In some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]], where the City of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] presents a tree to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support of Norwegian resistance during the [[World War II|Second World War]]; in [[Boston]], where the tree is a gift from the province of [[Nova Scotia]], in thanks for rapid deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion|ammunition ship explosion]] that levelled the city of [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]]; and in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where the main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of [[Bergen]], in thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen from [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twintownbergen |title=Town twinning: Bergen, Norway |publisher=[[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle City Council]] }}</ref> Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to [[Washington, D.C.]] as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the US during World War II.<ref>{{cite news |title=DC: Christmas Tree Lighting at Union Station |url=http://www.norway.org/News_and_events/Christmas-2012/DC-Christmas-Tree-Lighting-at-Union-Station/ |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=December 2, 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Candle on Christmas tree 3.jpg|thumb|A candle on a Christmas tree]]
Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until [[Christmas Eve]] (24 December){{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than [[Twelve Days of Christmas|on the first of day of Christmas]], 23 December, and then removed the day after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck.{{Citation needed |date=December 2011}}

In many areas, it has become customary to set up one's Christmas tree at the beginning of the [[Advent]] season.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peter Mazar |title=School Year, Church Year: Customs and Decorations for the Classroom |year=2000 |publisher=Liturgy Training Publications |isbn=1568542402 |pages=161 }}</ref> Some families in the U.S. and Canada will put up a Christmas tree soon after American [[Thanksgiving]] (the fourth Thursday of November), and Christmas decorations can show up even earlier in retail stores, often the day after [[Halloween]] (31 October). Some households do not put up the tree until the second week of December, and leave it up until 6 January ([[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]). In Germany, traditionally the tree is put up on 24 December and taken down on 7 January, though many start one or two weeks earlier, and in Roman Catholic homes the tree may be kept until February 2 (Candlemas).{{why |date=December 2012}}{{citation needed |date=December 2012}}

In [[Italy]] and [[Argentina]], along with many countries in Latin America, the Christmas tree is put up on 8 December ([[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Conception day]]) and left up until 6 January. In Australia, the Christmas tree is usually put up on 1 December, which occurs about a week before the school summer holidays; except for South Australia, where most people put up their tree after the Adelaide Christmas Pageant in late November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nepaliaustralian.com/2011/12/01/when-is-the-right-time-to-put-up-the-christmas-tree/ |title=Putting up your christmas tree in Australia |publisher=Nepali Australia |accessdate=November 24, 2013 }}</ref> Some traditions suggest that Christmas trees may be kept up until no later than 2 February, the feast of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] (Candlemas), when the Christmas season effectively closes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html |title=Customs of the Weeks after Epiphany |publisher=Holy Trinity (German) Catholic Church, Boston |accessdate=December 2, 2012 }}</ref> Superstitions say that it is a bad sign if Christmas greenery is not removed by Candlemas Eve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/superstitions.asp |title=Christmas Superstitions |date=December 2006 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] }}</ref>

===Decoration===

[[File:Christmas tree bauble.jpg|thumb|A [[bauble]] decorating a Christmas tree]]
[[File:Christmas Tree Bear Decoration.png|right|150px|thumb|A toy bear Christmas decoration.]]
Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a speciality of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]] especially in [[Lauscha]] in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration. Lighting with electric lights ([[Christmas lights|fairy lights]]) is commonly done. A [[tree topper]], traditionally either an angel or a star, completes the ensemble.

Individuals' decorations typically include a mix of family traditions and personal tastes; even a small unattractive ornament, if passed down from a parent or grandparent, may come to carry considerable emotional value and be given a place of pride on the tree. Conversely, trees decorated by professional designers for department stores and other institutions will usually have a "theme"; a set of predominant colours, multiple instances of each type of ornament, and larger decorations that may be more complicated to set up correctly. Some churches decorate with [[Chrismon tree]]s, which use handmade ornaments depicting various [[Chrismon]] symbols.

Many people also decorate outdoor trees with food that birds and other wildlife will enjoy, such as garlands made from unsalted popcorn or cranberries, orange halves, and seed-covered [[suet]] cakes.

Because candles were used to light trees until electric bulbs came about, a mat (UK) or skirt (US) was often placed on the floor below the tree to protect it by catching the dripping candle [[wax]], and also to collect any needles that fell. Even when dripless candles, electric lights and artificial trees have been used, a skirt is still usually used as a decorative feature: among other things, it hides the [[Christmas tree stand]], which may be unsightly but which is an important safety feature of home trees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety in the holidays|url=http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/Christmastrees/farm-safety/|accessdate=25 November, 2013}}</ref> What began as ordinary cloth has now often become much more ornate, some having [[embroidery]] or being put together like a [[quilt]].

A [[nativity scene]], model train, or [[Christmas village]] may be placed on the mat or skirt. As Christmas presents arrive, they are generally placed underneath the tree on the tree skirt (depending on tradition, all Christmas gifts, or those too large to be hung on the tree, as in "presents on the tree" of the song "[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]").

Generally, the difference between a mat and skirt is simply that a mat is placed ''under'' the Christmas tree stand, while a skirt is placed ''over'' it, having a hole in the middle for the trunk, with a slot cut to the outside edge so that it can be placed around the tree (beneath the branches) easily. A plain mat of fabric or plastic may also be placed under the stand and skirt to protect the floor from scratches or water.

A Christmas tree stand is an object designed to support a cut, natural Christmas tree or an artificial Christmas tree. Christmas tree stands appeared as early as 1876 and have had various designs over the years. Those stands designed for natural trees have a water reservoir to hydrate the live tree. Artificial Christmas trees usually have a plastic or metal stand, with three legs shaping like a Y.

In the 1940s and 1950s [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow. Typically it would be sprayed all over the tree from the sides, which produced a look different from real snow, which settles in clumps atop branches. Flocking can be done with a professional sprayer at a tree lot (or an artificial tree's manufacturer), or at home from a spray can. This tradition seems to be most popular on the west coast and southern parts of the United States. Because flock contains flame retardants, a flocked tree can be placed in a public building in accordance with local [[fire safety]] codes.

In the late 1800s and, most probably, long before, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree. This family tradition eliminated killing and care of a live tree and needle drop in the house while providing a beautiful way of displaying ornaments. After Christmas, the cotton batting was unwrapped and stored with the Christmas presents and the branches were burnt or discarded. It is thought these home-made white trees at least, in part, inspired flocking popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s.

==Production==
{{See also|Christmas tree production}}
Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000 growers in America (a third of them "choose and cut" farms). In that same year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5 billion on Christmas trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apsnet.org/education/feature/1225tree/top.htm |title=The Christmas Tree |accessdate=December 8, 2006 |author=Gary A.

===Natural trees===
{{See also|Christmas tree cultivation}}
The most commonly used species are [[fir]] (''Abies''), which have the benefit of not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good foliage colour and scent; but species in other [[genus|genera]] are also used.

In northern [[Europe]] most commonly used are:

* [[Picea abies|Norway Spruce]] ''Picea abies'' (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
* [[Abies alba|Silver Fir]] ''Abies alba''
* [[Abies nordmanniana|Nordmann Fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana''
* [[Noble Fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Picea omorika|Serbian Spruce]] ''Picea omorika''
* [[Scots Pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone Pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Swiss Pine]] ''Pinus cembra''

In [[North America]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]] most commonly used are:

* [[Douglas-fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''
* [[Abies balsamea|Balsam Fir]] ''Abies balsamea''
* [[Fraser Fir]] ''Abies fraseri''
* [[Abies grandis|Grand Fir]] ''Abies grandis''
* [[Abies guatemalensis|Guatemalan Fir]] ''Abies guatemalensis''
* [[Noble Fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Abies magnifica|Red Fir]] ''Abies magnifica''
* [[Abies concolor|White Fir]] ''Abies concolor''
* [[Colorado Pinyon|Pinyon Pine]] ''Pinus edulis''
* [[Jeffrey Pine]] ''Pinus jeffreyi''
* [[Scots Pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone Pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island Pine]] ''Araucaria heterophylla''

Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|Giant Sequoia]], [[Leyland Cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey Cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern Juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|Blue Spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|White Spruce]]); but spruces (unlike firs) begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia Pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States, however its winter colour is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|Eastern White Pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island Pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the [[Pinus radiata|Monterey Pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany Woolly Bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.

Some trees, frequently referred to as "living Christmas trees", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title= Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=July 12, 2010 }}</ref> However when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] }}{{dead link |date=December 2012}}</ref>

European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=November 30, 2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 }}</ref> there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.

In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s. Almost all Christmas trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s agriculture census for 2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree market in America, {{convert|5717.09|km2|acre|0}} were planted in Christmas trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Specialty_Crops/speccrop.pdf |title=2007 Census of Agriculture: Specialty Crops (Volume 2, Subject Series, Part 8) |at=Table 1, page 1 |date=November 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] }}</ref>

The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a {{convert|2|m|ft|0|sing=on}} tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between 8 and 12 years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of 3–4 years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree farmer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de/Wissenswertes:_:35.html |title=Unsere kleine Baumschule — Wissenswertes |trans_title=Our little nursery: Trivia |language={{de icon}} |year=2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 }}</ref>

The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of concern among politicians and scientists over recent years. A 2004 study found that while in general artificial trees pose little health risk from [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]], there do exist "worst-case scenarios" where major health risks to young children exist.<ref name="maas">{{cite pmid|15628192}}.

==Secular vs. religious nature==

The Christmas tree's origins are uncertain, but it is associated with the celebration of the Christmas holidays, so there has been some amount of debate as to whether it should be considered a secular or a religious custom.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

* It has been rejected as a "pagan" tradition that should not be associated with the Christian religious celebration of Christmas.
* It has been rejected as a "Christian" tradition that should not be allowed to be endorsed in secular contexts in countries that have a [[separation of church and state]].
* As a custom arising in Protestant parts of Germany, it has been rejected as a "Protestant" custom in Catholic countries, detracting from the Mediterranean traditions of the [[Nativity scene|Christmas crib]].<ref name="Stenhouse"/>

[[Pope John Paul II]] introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in 1982. Although at first disapproved of by some as out of place at the centre of the Roman Catholic Church, the [[Vatican Christmas Tree]] has become an integral part of the Vatican Christmas celebrations,<ref name="Stenhouse">{{cite web |url=http://www.wantedinrome.com/news/2000419/christmas-the-vatican-christmas-tree.html |author=Margaret Stenhouse |title=The Vatican Christmas Tree |date=December 22, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 }}</ref> and in 2005 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke of it as part of the normal Christmas decorations in Catholic homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-14886?l=english |title=Pre-Christmas Reflection: May Our Spirits Open to the True Spiritual Light |publisher=Zenit News Agency |date=December 21, 2005 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 }}</ref> In 2004, Pope John Paul called the Christmas tree a symbol of Christ. This very ancient custom, he said, exalts the value of life, as in winter what is evergreen becomes a sign of undying life, and it reminds Christians of the "tree of life" of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:9}}, an image of Christ, the supreme gift of God to humanity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-11828?l=english |title=Christmas tree is symbol of Christ, says Pope — And a Sign of 'Undying Life' |publisher=Zenit News Agency |date=December 19, 2004 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 }}</ref> In the previous year he said: "Beside the crib, the Christmas tree, with its twinkling lights, reminds us that with the birth of Jesus the tree of life has blossomed anew in the desert of humanity. The crib and the tree: precious symbols, which hand down in time the true meaning of Christmas."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/messages/urbi/documents/hf_jp-ii_mes_20031225_urbi_en.html |title=''Urbi et Orbi'' message of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, Christmas 2003 |language=Latin|date=December 25, 2003 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 }}</ref>

''[[Chrismon]] trees'' are a varition developed in 1957 by a Lutheran laywoman in Virginia, as a specifically religious version appropriate for a church's Christmas celebrations.<ref>[http://www.chrismon.org/site/chrismon/about.htm Chrismon.org]</ref> They are typically decorated with items made from recycled materials.
