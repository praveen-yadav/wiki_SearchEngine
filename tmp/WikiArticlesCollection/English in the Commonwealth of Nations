The use of the [[English language]] in most [[List of members of the Commonwealth of Nations|member countries]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] was inherited from [[British Empire|British colonisation]]. English is spoken as a first or second language in most of the Commonwealth. In a few countries, such as [[Cyprus]] and [[Malaysia]], it does not have [[official language|official status]], but is widely used as a [[lingua franca]]. [[Mozambique]] is an exception - although English is widely spoken there, it is a former Portuguese colony which joined the Commonwealth in 1996.

Many regions, notably [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[Indian English|India]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[South African English|South Africa]], [[Malaysian English|Malaysia]], [[Brunei English|Brunei]], [[Singapore English|Singapore]] and the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], have developed their own native varieties of the language. As such, generalisations cannot be made about the various forms of English used by the various member nations of the Commonwealth.

Written English as used in the Commonwealth generally favours [[American and British English spelling differences|British as opposed to American spelling]], with some exceptions in [[Canadian English|Canada]], where there is a strong influence from neighbouring [[American English]], as well as in [[Australian English|Australia]].

The report of the Inter-Governmental Group on Criteria for Commonwealth Membership states that English is a symbol of Commonwealth heritage and unity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Native varieties ==
[[Southern Hemisphere]] native varieties of English began to develop during the 18th century, with the colonisation of Australasia and South Africa. [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] are closely related to each other, and share some similarities with [[South African English]]. The vocabularies of these dialects draw from both [[British English|British]] and [[American English]] as well as numerous native peculiarities.

[[Canadian English]] is a variety of [[North American English]]. It shares the same roots as the English of the United States because it was based on the immigration of [[British Loyalist]]s fleeing the [[American Revolution]] in the late eighteenth century{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. It was also influenced by Scottish, Irish and English immigration after the [[War of 1812]]. While the language has continued to change in all of these places{{Clarify|date=July 2012}}, modern Canadian English has taken significant vocabulary and spelling from the shared political and social institutions of Commonwealth countries.

=== The Caribbean ===
[[Caribbean English]] is influenced by the English-based [[Creole language|Creole]] varieties spoken, but they are not one and the same. There is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken, with a "Standard English" at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum and Creole languages at the other. These dialects have roots in 17th-century English and [[African language]]s; unlike most native varieties of English, West Indian dialects often tend to be syllable-timed rather than [[Timing (linguistics)|stress-timed]].

== Non-native varieties ==

Second language varieties of English in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] have often undergone "indigenisation"; that is, each English-speaking community has developed (or is in the process of developing) its own standards of usage, often under the influence of local languages. These dialects are sometimes referred to as ''New Englishes'' (McArthur, p.&nbsp;36); most of them inherited [[non-rhotic]]ity from Southern British English.

=== Africa ===
Several dialects of [[West African English]] exist, with a lot of regional variation and some influence from indigenous language.  West African English tends to be syllable-timed, and its phoneme inventory is much simpler than that of [[Received Pronunciation]]; this sometimes affects mutual intelligibility with native varieties of English. A distinctive [[East African English]] is spoken in countries such as [[Kenya]] or [[Tanzania]].

Small communities of native English speakers can be found in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]] and [[Namibia]]; the dialects spoken are similar to [[South African English]].

In countries such as [[Kenya]] -particularly in Nairobi and other cities where there is an expanding middle class- English is increasingly being used in the home as the first language, albeit with significant lexical influence from and secondary use of Swahili in a context of [[code-switching]].

=== Asia ===
[[South Asia]] has the world's largest English-speaking population with a certain percentage of people who speak English as their first or second language, although most speakers of [[Indian English]], [[Pakistani English]] etc. are not always first language speakers. [[South Asian English]] phonology is highly variable; stress, rhythm and intonation are generally different from those of native varieties. There are also several peculiarities at the levels of morphology, syntax and usage, some of which can also be found among educated speakers.

[[Southeast Asian English]] comprises [[Singapore English]], [[Malaysian English]] and [[Brunei English]]; it features some influence from [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] languages and dialects, and [[Indian English]]. There is also [[Philippine English]], but it is influenced by [[North American English]].

[[Hong Kong]] ceased to be part of the Commonwealth in 1997. Nonetheless, the English language still enjoys status as an official language, alongside the [[Chinese language]].
