[[File:Acetylene-3D-vdW.png|Alkyne|right|thumb|250px|A 3D model of ethyne ([[acetylene]]), the simplest alkyne]]
In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkyne''' is an [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[hydrocarbon]] which has at least one carbon—carbon [[triple bond]] between two [[carbon]] atoms.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/15818/alkyne Alkyne]. Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other [[functional group]]s form a [[homologous series]] with the general chemical formula {{Carbon}}<sub>n</sub>{{Hydrogen}}<sub>2n-2</sub>.  Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name ''acetylene'' also refers specifically to C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, known formally as [[ethyne]] using [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]]. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive.

==Chemical properties==
Alkynes are characteristically more [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] than alkenes.  Thus they add two equivalents of [[bromine]] whereas an alkene adds only one equivalent.  Other reactions are listed below. In some reactions, alkynes are less reactive than [[alkene]]s. For example, in a molecule with an -ene and an -yne group, addition occurs preferentially at the -ene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosser & Williams|title=Modern Organic Chemistry for A-level|year=1977|publisher=Collins|location=Great Britain|isbn=0003277402|page=82}}</ref> Possible explanations involve the two π-bonds in the alkyne delocalising, which would reduce the energy of the π-system{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} or the stability of the intermediates during the reaction.
They show greater tendency to [[Polymerization|polymerize]] or [[oligomer]]ize than alkenes do. The resulting polymers, called [[polyacetylene]]s (which do not contain alkyne units) are [[conjugated system|conjugated]] and can exhibit semiconducting properties.

==Structure and bonding==
In acetylene, the H–C≡C [[bond angle]]s are 180°. By virtue of this bond angle, alkynes tend to be rod-like.  Correspondingly, cyclic alkynes are rare.  [[Benzyne]] is highly unstable.  The C≡C bond distance of 121 [[picometer]]s is much shorter than the C=C distance in [[alkene]]s (134 pm) or the C-C bond in alkanes (153 pm).

Triple bonds are highlighted <span style="color:blue;">'''blue'''</span>.]]

The [[triple bond]] is very strong with a [[bond strength]] of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369 kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268 kJ/mol and the second pi-bond of 202 kJ/mol bond strength. Bonding usually discussed in the context of [[molecular orbital theory]], which recognizes the triple bond as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals.  In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are [[sp hybridized]]: they each have two unhybridized [[p orbital]]s and two [[Orbital hybridisation|sp hybrid orbitals]]. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp-sp [[sigma bond]]. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two [[pi bond]]s, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene. The two sp orbitals project on opposite sides of the carbon atom.

===Terminal and internal alkynes===
Internal alkynes feature carbon substituents on each acetylenic carbon.  Symmetrical examples include [[diphenylacetylene]] and [[3-hexyne]].

Terminal alkynes have the formula RC<sub>2</sub>H. An example is [[methylacetylene]] (propyne using IUPAC nomenclature).  Terminal alkynes, like [[acetylene]] itself, are mildly acidic, with p''K''<sub>a</sub> values of around 25.  They are far more acidic than alkenes and alkanes, which have p''K''<sub>a</sub> values of around 40 and 50, respectively. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes can be replaced by a variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes. The carbanions generated by deprotonation of terminal alkynes are called [[acetylide]]s.<ref name="de57">{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Daniel R.|title=Organic Chemistry Demystified|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-176797-2|pages=57|edition=2|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>

==Synthesis==
Commercially, the dominant alkyne is acetylene itself, which is used as a fuel and a precursor to other compounds, e.g., acrylates. Hundreds of millions of kilograms are produced annually by partial oxidation of [[natural gas]]:<ref name=Ullmann/>
: 2 CH<sub>4</sub>  + 3/2 O<sub>2</sub>  →  HC&equiv;CH + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O
Propyne, also industrially useful, is also prepared by [[thermal cracking]] of hydrocarbons.  Most other industrially useful alkyne derivatives are prepared from acetylene, e.g. via condensation with formaldehyde.<ref name=Ullmann>{{cite book |author=Peter Pässler, Werner Hefner, Klaus Buckl, Helmut Meinass, Andreas Meiswinkel, Hans-Jürgen Wernicke, Günter Ebersberg, Richard Müller, Jürgen Bässler, Hartmut Behringer, Dieter Mayer |chapter=Acetylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |date=October 15, 2008 |isbn= |pages= |doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_097.pub3 }}</ref>

Specialty alkynes are prepared by [[dehydrohalogenation]] of [[Vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] alkyl [[Halide|dihalides]] or vinyl halides.<ref>{{OrgSynth | prep = cv4p0763 | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 763 | year = 1963 | title = Phenylacetylene | author = Kenneth N. Campbell and Barbara K. Campbell}}</ref> Metal acetylides can be coupled with primary [[alkyl halide]]s.  Via the [[Fritsch-Buttenberg-Wiechell rearrangement]], alkynes are prepared from [[vinyl bromide]]s.  Alkynes can be prepared from [[aldehyde]]s using the [[Corey-Fuchs reaction]] and from aldehydes or [[ketone]]s by the [[Seyferth–Gilbert homologation]].  In the [[alkyne zipper reaction]], alkynes are generated from other alkynes by treatment with a strong base.

==Reactions==
Featuring a reactive [[functional group]], alkynes participate in many [[organic reaction]]s.

===Addition of hydrogen, halogens, and related reagents===
Alkynes characteristically undergo reactions that show that they are "doubly unsaturated," meaning that each alkyne unit is capable of adding two equivalents of H<sub>2</sub>, [[halogen]]s or related HX reagents (X = halide, pseudohalide, etc.).  Depending on catalysts and conditions, alkynes add one or two equivalents of hydrogen. [[Hydrogenation]] to the [[alkene]] is usually more desirable since alkanes are less useful:
:RC&equiv;CR'  +  H<sub>2</sub>   →   ''cis''-RCH=CR'H
The largest scale application of this technology is the conversion of acetylene to ethylene in refineries.  The steam cracking of alkanes affords a few percent acetylene, which is selectively hydrogenated in the presence of a [[palladium]]/[[silver]] catalyst.  For more complex alkynes, the [[Lindlar catalyst]] is widely recommended to avoid formation of the alkane, for example in the conversion of [[phenylacetylene]] to [[styrene]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | collvol = 5 | collvolpages = 880 | year = 1973 | prep = cv5p0880 | author = H. Lindlar and R. Dubuis | title = Palladium catalyst for partial reduction of acetylenes}}.</ref>

Similarly, [[halogenation]] of alkynes gives the vinyl dihalides or alkyl tetrahalides:

:RC&equiv;CR' + 2 Br<sub>2</sub>  → RCBr<sub>2</sub>CRBr<sub>2</sub>

The addition of nonpolar E-H bonds across C≡C is general for silanes, boranes, and related hydrides.  The [[hydroboration-oxidation reaction|hydroboration]] of alkynes gives vinylic boranes which oxidize to the corresponding [[aldehyde]] or ketone. In the [[thiol-yne reaction]] the substrate is a thiol.

[[Hydrohalogenation]] gives the corresponding [[vinyl halide]]s or alkyl dihalides, again depending on the number of equivalents of HX added.  The addition of water to alkynes is a related reaction except the initial [[enol]] intermediate converts to the ketone or aldehyde.  Illustrative is the hydration of [[phenylacetylene]] gives [[acetophenone]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Fukuda, Y.; Utimoto, K. | title = Effective transformation of unactivated alkynes into ketones or acetals with a gold(III) catalyst | journal = [[J.

===Cycloadditions and oxidation===
Alkynes undergo diverse [[cycloaddition]] reactions. Most notable is the [[Diels–Alder reaction]] with 1,3-[[diene]]s to give [[1,4-cyclohexadienes]].  This general reaction has been extensively developed and electrophilic alkynes are especially effective [[dienophile]]s.  The "cycloadduct" derived from the addition of alkynes to [[2-pyrone]] eliminates [[carbon dioxide]] to give the [[aromatic]] compound.  Other specialized cycloadditions include multicomponent reactions such as [[alkyne trimerisation]] to give [[aromatic]] compounds and the [2+2+1]cycloaddition of an alkyne, [[alkene]] and [[carbon monoxide]] in the [[Pauson–Khand reaction]].  Non-carbon reagents also undergo  cyclization, e.g. [[Azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition]] to give [[triazole]]s.  Cycloaddition processes involving alkynes are often catalyzed by metals, e.g. [[enyne metathesis]] and [[alkyne metathesis]], which allows the scrambling of carbyne (RC) centers:
:RC&equiv;CR + R'C&equiv;CR'  <math>\overrightarrow{\leftarrow}</math>  2 RC&equiv;CR'
Oxidative cleavage of alkynes proceeds via cycloaddition to metal oxides.  Most famously, [[potassium permanganate]] converts alkynes to a pair of [[carboxylic acid]]s.

===Reactions specific for terminal alkynes===
In addition to undergoing the reactions characteristic of internal alkynes, terminal alkynes are reactive as weak acids, with [[Acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] values (25) between that of [[ammonia]] (35) and [[ethanol]] (16). The acetylide [[conjugate base]] is stabilized as a result of the high s character of the sp orbital, in which the electron pair resides. [[Electron]]s in an s orbital benefit from closer proximity to the positively charged atom nucleus, and are therefore lower in energy.  Treatment of terminal alkynes with a [[strong base]] gives the corresponding [[metal acetylide]]s:
:RC&equiv;CH  +  MX  →   RC&equiv;CM  +  HX (MX = [[sodium amide|NaNH<sub>2</sub>]], [[N-Butyllithium|LiBu]],  [[Grignard reagent|RMgX]])
The reactions of alkynes with certain metal cations, e.g. Ag<sup>+</sup> also gives acetylides. Thus, few drops of [[Tollens reagent|diamminesilver(I) hydroxide]] (Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH) reacts with terminal alkynes signaled by formation of a white precipitate of the silver acetylide.
Acetylide derivatives are synthetically useful [[nucleophile]]s that participate in C-C bond forming reactions, as illustrated in the area called [[Carbonylation|"Reppe Chemistry"]].

In the [[Favorskii reaction]], terminal alkynes add to [[carbonyl]] compounds to give the [[hydroxyalkyne]].  [[Coupling reaction|Coupling]] of terminal alkynes to give di-alkynes is effected in the [[Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling]], [[Glaser coupling]], and the [[Eglinton coupling]] reactions. Terminal alkynes can also be coupled to aryl or vinyl halides as in the [[Sonogashira coupling]].

==Alkynes in nature and medicine==
According to Ferdinand Bohlmann, the first naturally occurring acetylenic compound, dehydromatricaria ester, was isolated from an ''Artemisia'' species in 1826. In the nearly two centuries that have followed, well over a thousand naturally occurring acetylenes have been discovered and reported. Polyynes, a subset of this class of natural products, have been isolated from a wide variety of plant species, cultures of higher fungi, bacteria, marine sponges, and corals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Annabelle L. K. Shi Shun; Rik R. Tykwinski| title = Synthesis of Naturally Occurring Polyynes| journal = Angew. Chem. Int.

Diynes and triynes, species with the linkage RC≡C-C≡CR' and RC≡C-C≡C-C≡CR' respectively, occur in certain plants (''[[Ichthyothere]]'', ''[[Chrysanthemum]]'', ''[[Cicuta]]'', ''[[Water dropwort|Oenanthe]]'' and other members of the [[Asteraceae]] and [[Apiaceae]] families). Some examples are [[cicutoxin]], [[oenanthotoxin]], [[falcarinol]] and [[carotatoxin]]. These compounds are highly bioactive, e.g. as [[nematocide]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lam, Jørgen |title=Chemistry and biology of naturally-occurring acetylenes and related compounds (NOARC): proceedings of a Conference on the Chemistry and Biology of Naturally-Occurring Acetylenes and Related Compounds (NOARC) |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=0-444-87115-2 }}</ref>  1-Phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne is illustrative of a naturally occurring triyne.

Alkynes occur in some pharmaceuticals, including the contraceptive [[norethynodrel]]. A carbon–carbon triple bond is also present in marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral [[Efavirenz]] and the antifungal [[Terbinafine]].  Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne").  These compounds, e.g. [[calicheamicin]], are some of the most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a "warhead."  Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the [[Bergman cyclization]], generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.<ref>{{cite journal | author = S. Walker; R.
