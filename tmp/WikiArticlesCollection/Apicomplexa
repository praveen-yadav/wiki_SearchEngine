The '''Apicomplexa''' — also called '''Apicomplexia''' — are a large group of [[parasitic]] [[protist]]s, most of which possess a unique [[organelle]], a type of [[plastid]] called an [[apicoplast]], and an ''apical complex'' structure involved in penetrating a host's cell. They are unicellular, spore-forming, and exclusively<ref>{{cite book |author=Jadwiga Grabda |title=Marine fish parasitology: an outline |page=8 |year=1991 |publisher=VCH |isbn=0-89573-823-6 }}</ref> parasites of animals. Motile structures such as [[flagellum|flagella]] or [[pseudopod]]s are present only in certain [[gamete]] stages. This is a diverse group including organisms such as the [[coccidia]], [[gregarine]]s, [[piroplasm]]s, [[haemogregarine]]s, and [[Plasmodiidae|plasmodia]]. Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include, but are not limited to:
 	
* [[Babesiosis]] (''[[Babesia]]'')	
* [[Malaria]] (''[[Plasmodium]]'')	
* Forms of [[coccidiosis]] including:	
** [[Cryptosporidiosis]] (''[[Cryptosporidium parvum]]'')	
** [[Cyclosporiasis]] (''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]'')	
** [[Isosporiasis]] (''[[Isospora belli]]'')
** [[Toxoplasmosis]] (''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'')

The name of the taxon ''Apicomplexa'' is derived from two [[Latin]] words — ''apex'' (top) and ''complexus'' (infolds) — and refers to a set of [[organelle]]s in the [[sporozoite]]. The older taxon '''Sporozoa''' was created by SChrevel in 1971 and grouped the ''Apicomplexa'' together with the [[Microsporidia]] and [[Myxosporida]]. This grouping is no longer regarded as biologically valid and its use is discouraged.<ref name="urlIntroduction to the Apicomplexa">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/apicomplexa.html |title=Introduction to the Apicomplexa |work= |accessdate=2009-05-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090420123252/http://ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/apicomplexa.html| archivedate= 20 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Phylogenetic relations==
This has rarely been studied at the subclass level. Morrison using molecular date has shown that the haemosporidia are related to the gregarines and that the piroplasms and coccidians are sister groups.<ref name=Morrison2009>Morrison DA (2009) Evolution of the Apicomplexa: where are we now? Trends Parasitol 25 (8) 375-382</ref> Other studies suggest that the haemosporidia and the piroplasma appear to be sister clades and are more closely related to the coccidians than to the gregarines. <ref name=Templeton2010>Templeton TJ, Enomoto S, Chen WJ, Huang CG, Lancto CA, Abrahamsen MS, Zhu G (2010) A genome-sequence survey for ''Ascogregarina taiwanensis'' supports evolutionary affiliation but metabolic diversity between a Gregarine and ''Cryptosporidium''.

Transposons appear to be rare in this phylum but have been identified in the genera ''[[Ascogregarina]]'' and ''[[Eimeria]]''.<ref name=Templeton2010>Templeton TJ, Enomoto S, Chen WJ, Huang CG, Lancto CA, Abrahamsen MS, Zhu G (2010) A genome-sequence survey for ''Ascogregarina taiwanensis'' supports evolutionary affiliation but metabolic diversity between a Gregarine and ''Cryptosporidium''. Mol Biol Evol 27(2):235-48. doi: 10.1093/molbev/msp226</ref>

==General morphological features==

All members of this phylum have an infectious stage - the sporozoite - which possess three distinct structures in an apical complex. The apical complex consists of a set of spirally arranged [[microtubule]]s (the conoid), a secretory body (the [[rhoptry]]) and one or more [[polar ring]]s. Additional slender electron-dense secretory bodies ([[microneme]]s) surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present. It is this structure that gives the phylum its name.

A further group of spherical organelles are distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the apical complex and are known as the dense granules. These typically have a mean diameter of about 0.7 micrometers. Secretion of the dense-granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the parasitophorous vacuole and persists for several minutes.

Other morphological findings that are common to all members of this phylum include:

*The [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]] is [[haploid]].
*[[Flagella]]e are found only in the motile gamete. These are posteriorly directed and vary in number (usually one to three).
*[[Basal body|Basal bodies]] are present. Although hemosporidians and piroplasmids have normal triplets of [[microtubule]]s in their basal bodies and coccidians and gregarines have 9 singlets. 	
*The [[mitochondria]] have tubular [[cristae]].
*A [[Golgi apparatus]] is present.
*[[Centriole]]s, [[chloroplast]]s, ejectile organelles and inclusions are absent.
*Colourless [[plastid]]s are present in some species.
*The cell is surrounded by a [[pellicle (biology)|pellicle]] of three membrane layers (the alveolar structure) penetrated by micropores.

Replication:

*[[Mitosis]]: usually closed with an intranuclear spindle; in some species it is open at the poles
*Cell division: usually by [[schizogony]]
*[[Meiosis]]: Occurs in the [[zygote]]

Other features common to this phylum are a lack of cilia, sexual reproduction, use of micropores for feeding, movement by body flexion or gliding and the production of oocysts containing sporozoites as the infective form.

==General features==

Within this phylum there are three groups - coccidians, gregarines and haemosporidians. The coccidians and gregarines appear to be relatively closely related.

''Perkinsus '' while once considered a member of this phylum has  been moved to a new phylum - ''[[Perkinsozoa]].

===Gregarines===

The gregarines are generally parasites of [[annelid]]s, [[arthropod]]s and mollusks. They are often found in the [[Gut (anatomy)|gut]]s of their hosts but may invade the other tissues. In the typical gregarine life cycle a [[trophozoite]] develops within a host cell into a schizont. This then divides into a number of [[merozoite]]s by [[schizogony]]. The [[merozoite]]s are released by lysing the host cell which in turn invade other cells. At some point in the [[apicomplexan life cycle]], [[gametocytes]]s are formed. These are released by lysis of the host cells which group together. Each gametocyte forms multiple [[gamete]]s. The gametes fuse with another to form [[oocyst]]s. The oocysts leave the host to be taken up by a new host.

===Coccidians===

Coccidians are generally parasites of [[vertebrate]]s. Like gregarines they are commonly parasites of the [[epithelial]] cells of the gut but may infect other tissues. 

The coccidian life cycle involves merogony, gametogony and sporogony. While similar to that of the gregarines it differs in [[zygote]] formation. Some trophozoites enlarge and become [[macrogamete]] while others divide repeatedly to form [[microgamete]]s (anisogamy). The microgametes are motile and must reach the macrogamete to fertilize it. The fertilized macrogamete forms a zygote which in its turn forms an oocyst which is normally released from the body. Syzygy when it occurs involves markedly anisogamous gametes. The life cycle is typically haploid with the only diploid stage occurring in the zygote which is normally short lived.

;Differences between the coccidia and the gregarines

The main difference between the coccidians and the gregarines is in the gamonts. In the coccida these are small, intracellular and without [[epimerite]]s or [[mucron]]s. In the gregarines these are large, extracellular and posses epimerites or mucrons.

A second difference between the coccidia and the gregarines also lies in the gamonts. In the coccidia a single gamonts becomes a macrogametocyte while in the gregarines the gamonts give rise to multiple gametocytes.

===Haemosporidia===

The Haemosporidians have more complex life cycles that alternate between an arthropod and a vertebrate host. The trophozoite parasitises [[erythrocyte]]s or other tissues in the vertebrate host. Microgametes and macrogametes are always found in the blood. The gametes are taken up by the insect vector during a blood meal. The microgametes migrate within the gut of the insect vector and fuse with the macrogametes. The fertilized macrogamete now becomes an [[ookinete]] which penetrates the body of the vector. The ookinete then transforms into an oocyst and divides initially by meiosis and then by mitosis ([[haplontic life cycle]]) to give rise to the [[sporozoite]]s. The sporozoites escape from the oocyst and migrate within the body of the vector to the salivary glands where they are injected into the new vertebrate host when the insect vector feeds again.

== Evolution ==

All members of this phylum are parasitic and evolved from a free living ancestor. This life style probably evolved at the time of the divergence of dinoﬂagellates and apicomplexans.<ref name=Kuvardina2002>Kuvardina ON, Leander BS, Aleshin VV, Mylnikov AP, Keeling PJ, Simdyanov TG (2002) The phylogeny of colpodellids (Alveolata) using small subunit rRNA gene sequences suggests they are the free living sister group to apicomplexans. J Eukaryot Microbiol 49: 498—504</ref><ref name=Leander2002>Leander BS, Keeling PJ (2003) Morphostasis in alveolate evolution. Trends Ecol Evol 18: 395—402</ref> Further evolution of this phylum has been estimated to have occurred  ~{{Mya|800}}.<ref name=Escalante1995>Escalante AA, Ayala FJ (1995) Evolutionary origin of ''Plasmodium'' and other Apicomplexa based on ribosomal-RNA genes. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92: 5793—5797</ref> The oldest extant clade is thought to be the archigregarines.<ref name="Kuvardina2002"/> 

Many ''Coccidiomorpha'' have an [[intermediate host]] as well as a primary host, and the evolution of hosts proceeded in different ways and at different times in these groups. For some coccidiomorphs, the original host has become the intermediate host while in others it has become the definitive host. In the genera ''[[Aggregata]]'', ''[[Atoxoplasma]]'', ''[[Cystoisospora]]'', ''[[Schellackia]]'' and ''[[Toxoplasma]]'' the original is now definitive while in ''[[Akiba (protozoa)|Akiba]]'', ''[[Babesiosoma]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', ''[[Haemogregarina]]'', ''[[Haemoproteus]]'', ''[[Hepatozoon]]'', ''[[Karyolysus]]'', ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'', ''[[Plasmodium]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'' and ''[[Theileria]]'', the original hosts are now intermediate.

Similar strategies to increase the likelihood of transmission have evolved in multiple genera. Polyenergid [[oocyst]]s and tissue cysts are found in representatives of the orders [[Protococcidiorida]] and [[Eimeriida]]. [[Hypnozoite]]s are found in ''[[Karyolysus lacerate]]'' and most species of ''[[Plasmodium]]''; transovarial transmission of parasites occurs in life cycles of ''[[Karyolysus]]'' and ''[[Babesia]]''.

Horizontal gene transfer appears to have occurred early on in this phylum's evolution with the transfer of a histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) modifier, Set8, from an animal host to the ancestor of apicomplexans.<ref name=Kishore2013>Kishore SP, Stiller JW, Deitsch KW (2013) Horizontal gene transfer of epigenetic machinery and evolution of parasitism in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and other apicomplexans. BMC Evol Biol 13(1):37</ref> A second gene - H3K36 methyltransferase (Ashr3 in [[plant]]s) - may have also be horizontally transferred.

Most members have a complex life-cycle, involving both asexual and sexual reproduction.  Typically, a host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites (similar to [[entosis]]), which divide to produce ''[[sporozoite]]s'' that enter its cells.  Eventually, the cells burst, releasing ''[[merozoites]]'' which infect new cells.  This may occur several times, until ''gamonts'' are produced, forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts.  There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.

The apical complex includes [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s called [[rhoptries]] and [[microneme]]s, which open at the anterior of the cell.  These secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells.  The tip is surrounded by a band of [[microtubule]]s, called the ''polar ring'', and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the ''conoid''.<ref name=coccidiaworld>{{cite web

| format = Online database }}</ref>   Over the rest of the cell, except for a diminished mouth called the micropore, the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli, forming a semi-rigid pellicle.

The presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the [[alveolate]]s.  Several related flagellates, such as ''[[Perkinsus marinus|Perkinsus]]'' and ''[[Colpodella]]'' have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the [[dinoflagellate]]s.  They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.

Another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single [[plastid]], called the [[apicoplast]], surrounded by either 3 or four membranes.  Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis, and it appears to be necessary for survival.  Plastids are generally considered to share a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence generally points to an origin from [[red algae]] rather than [[green alga|green]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 2004 | volume = 91 | pages = 1481–1493 | title = Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts | author = Patrick J.

The Apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the Sporozoa, a group for parasitic protozoans without flagella, pseudopods, or cilia. Most of the Apicomplexa are motile however.  The other main lines were the [[Ascetosporea]], the [[Myxozoa]] (now known to be derived from [[animal]]s), and the [[Microsporidia]] (now known to be derived from [[fungus|fungi]]).  Sometimes the name Sporozoa is taken as a synonym for the Apicomplexa, or occasionally as a subset.

== Blood-borne genera ==
Within the Apicomplexa there are three suborders of parasites. 

* suborder [[Adeleorina]] - 8 genera
* suborder [[Haemosporina]] - all genera in this suborder
* suborder [[Eimeriorina]] - 2 genera (''[[Lankesterella]]'' and ''[[Schellackia]]'')

Within the ''Adelorina'' are species that infect [[invertebrate]]s and others that infect [[vertebrate]]s.  

The ''Haemosporina'' includes the [[malaria]] parasites and their relatives. 

The ''Eimeriorina'' - the largest suborder in this phylum - the life cycle involves both sexual and asexual stages. The asexual stages reproduce by [[schizogony]]. The male gametocyte produces a large number of gametes and the [[zygote]] gives rise to an [[oocyst]] which is the infective stage. The majority are monoxenous (infect one host only) but a few are heteroxenous (life cycle involves two or more hosts).

Both the number of families in this later suborder is debated with the number of families being between one and twenty depending on the authority and the number of genera being between nineteen and twenty five. This somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs awaits resolution with DNA based methods.

== Disease genomics ==
As noted above, many of the apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of human and domestic animals. In contrast to [[bacteria]]l pathogens, these apicomplexan parasites are [[eukaryotes|eukaryotic]] and share many metabolic pathways with their animal hosts. This fact makes therapeutic target development extremely difficult – a drug that harms an apicomplexan parasite is also likely to harm its human host. Currently there are no effective [[vaccine]]s available for most diseases caused by these parasites. Biomedical research on these parasites is challenging because it is often difficult, if not impossible, to maintain live parasite cultures in the laboratory and to genetically manipulate these organisms. In recent years, several of the apicomplexan species have been selected for [[genome sequencing]]. The availability of [[genome]] sequences provides a new opportunity for scientists to learn more about the [[evolution]] and biochemical capacity of these parasites. The predominant source of this genomic information is the [[EuPathDB]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://eupathdb.org |title=EuPathDB |work= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref>family of websites, which currently provide specialised services for ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species ([[PlasmoDB]]),<ref>{{pmid|12519984}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://plasmodb.org |title=PlasmoDB |work= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> [[coccidia]]ns ([[ToxoDB]]),<ref>{{pmid|12519989}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://toxodb.org |title=ToxoDB |work= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> [[piroplasms]] ([[PiroplasmaDB]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://piroplasmadb.org |title=PiroplasmaDB |work= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> and ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' species ([[CryptoDB]]).<ref>{{pmid|16381902}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cryptodb.org |title=CryptoDB |work= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> One possible target for drugs is the plastid, and in fact existing drugs such as [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline]]s which are effective against apicomplexans seem to operate against the plastid.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1128/AAC.00394-06 | year = 2006 | month = September | author = Dahl, El; Shock, Jl; Shenai, Br; Gut, J; Derisi, Jl; Rosenthal, Pj | title = Tetracyclines specifically target the apicoplast of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 3124–31 | pmid = 16940111 | pmc = 1563505 | journal = Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy | url = http://aac.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16940111 | format = Free full text }}</ref>

Most apicomplexans have an [[apicoplast]], (a non-photosynthetic plastid) and [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]]  and [[nuclear genome]]s, although ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' species and [[gregarines]] are possible exceptions as they are thought to have lost their plastids after the diverging [[last common ancestor]] of apicomplexans{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

==History==
The first apicomplexan protozoan was seen by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] who in 1674 saw [[oocyst]]s of ''[[Eimeria stiedae]]'' in the [[gall bladder]] of a [[rabbit]]. The first member of the [[phylum]] to be named (by Dufour in 1828) was ''[[Gregarina ovata]]'' in [[earwig]]s. Since then many more have been identified and named. During the quarter century 1826-1850, 41 species and 6 genera of Apicomplexa were named. In the quarter century 1951-1975, 1873 new species and 83 new genera were added.

==Taxonomy==
The field of classifying Apicomplexa is in flux and classification has changed throughout the years since it was formally named in 1970.<ref name="Levine1970" />

===1987===
By 1987 a comprehensive survey of the phylum was completed: in all, 4516 species and 339 genera had been named. They consisted of{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}:
* the gregarines (subclass [[Gregarinasida]]) with 1624 named species and 231 named genera
* the hemogregarines (family [[Haemogregarinidae]]) with 399 species and 4 genera
* the eimeriorins (order [[Eimeriorida]]) with 1771 species and 43 genera
* the hemospororids (order [[Haemosporasina]]) with 444 species and 9 genera
* the piroplasmids (order [[Piroplasmorida]]) with 173 species and 20 genera
* and a few others (105 species and 32 genera)

Although there has been considerable revision of this phylum (the order Haemosporidia now has 17 genera rather than 9) it seems likely these numbers are still approximately correct.

===Jacques Euzéby (1988)===
[[Jacques Euzéby]] in 1988<ref name="Euzéby1988">Euzéby, J. (1988) Comparative Medical Protozoology, Vol. 3: Apicomplexa, 2: Haemosporidioses, Part 1: Plasmodiids, Haemoproteids, "Piroplasms" (general characters)</ref> created a new class [[Haemosporidiasina]] by merging subclass [[Piroplasmasina]] and suborder [[Haemospororina]].
*Subclass [[Gregarinasina]] (the gregarines)
*Subclass [[Coccidiasina]]

** Suborder [[Eimeriorina]] (the eimeriorins)
*Subclass [[Haemosporidiasina]]
** Order [[Achromatorida]]
** Order [[Chromatorida]]

The division into Achromatorida and Chromatorida although proposed on morphological grounds may have a biological basis as the ability to store [[haemozoin]] appears to have evolved only once.<ref name=Martinsen2008>Martinsen ES, Perkins SL, Schall JJ (2008) A three-genome phylogeny of malaria parasites (''Plasmodium'' and closely related genera): evolution of life-history traits and host switches.

===Roberts and Janovy (1996)===
Roberts and Janovy in 1996 divided the phylum into the following subclasses and suborders (omitting classes and orders):<ref>{{cite book | author=Roberts, L., Janovy, J. | year=1996 | title=Foundations of Parasitology, 5th edition | publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers, Dubuque, Iowa}}</ref>
*Subclass [[Gregarinasina]] (the gregarines)
*Subclass [[Coccidiasina]]
** Suborder [[Adeleorina]] (the adeleorins)
** Suborder [[Eimeriorina]] (the eimeriorins)
** Suborder [[Haemospororina]] (the haemospororins)
*Subclass [[Piroplasmasina]] (the piroplasms)
These form the following five taxonomic groups:
# The gregarines are generally one-host parasites of invertebrates.
# The adeleorins are one-host parasites of invertebrates or vertebrates, or two-host parasites that alternately infect haematophagous (blood-feeding) invertebrates and the blood of vertebrates.
# The eimeriorins are a diverse group that includes one host species of invertebrates, two-host species of invertebrates, one-host species of vertebrates and two-host species of vertebrates. The eimeriorins are frequently called the coccidia. Somewhat confusingly this term is often used to include the adeleorins.
# Haemospororins often known as the malaria parasites, are two-host Apicomplexa that parasitize blood-feeding dipteran flies and the blood of various tetrapod vertebrates.
# Piroplasms where all the species included are two-host parasites infecting ticks and vertebrates.
