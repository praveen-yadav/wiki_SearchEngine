The '''General Conference on Weights and Measures''' ({{lang-fr|Conférence générale des poids et mesures}} - '''CGPM''') is the senior of the three [[Inter-governmental organizations]] established in 1875 under the terms of the [[Metre Convention]] ({{lang-fr|Convention du Mètre}}) to represent the interests of member states.  The treaty, which also set up two further bodies, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Comité international des poids et mesures}}- CIPM) and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] ({{lang-fr|Bureau international des poids et mesures}} -  BIPM), was drawn up to coordinate international [[metrology]] and to coordinate the development of the [[metric system]].

The conference meets in [[Sèvres]] (south-west of Paris) every four to six years. Initially it was only concerned with the [[kilogram]] and the [[metre]], but in 1921 the scope of the treaty was extended to accommodate all physical measurements and hence all aspects of the [[metric system]]. In 1960 the 11th CGPM approved the ''[[Système International d'Unités]]'', usually known as "SI".

==Establishment==
On 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the ''Convention du Mètre'' ([[Metre Convention]])<ref>{{cite web

|title = Convention du mètre
|language = French
|publisher = [[Bureau international des poids et mesures]] (BIPM)
|postscript = 1875 text plus 1907 and 1921 amendments

|accessdate = 22 March 2011}}</ref>
*[[Conférence générale des poids et mesures]] (CGPM), an intergovernmental conference of official delegates of member nations and the supreme authority for all actions;
*[[Comité international des poids et mesures]] (CIPM), consisting of selected scientists and [[metrologist]]s, which prepares and executes the decisions of the CGPM and is responsible for the supervision of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;
*[[Bureau international des poids et mesures]] (BIPM), a permanent laboratory and world centre of scientific metrology, the activities of which include the establishment of the basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities and maintenance of the international prototype standards.

The CGPM acts on behalf of the governments of its members.  In so doing, it appoints members to the CIPM, receives reports from the CIPM which it passes on to the governments and national laboratories on member states, examines and where appropriate approves proposals from the CIPM in respect of changes to the International System of Units (SI), approves the budget for the BIPM (over €10 million in 2012) and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the BIPM.<ref>{{cite web

===Membership criteria===
The CGPM recognises two classes of membership - full membership for those states that wish to participate in the activities of the BIPM and associate membership for those countries or economies<ref group = Note>As of 2012, the only "economy" that was an associate member was CARICOM (Caribbean Community) - its membership comprising [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]],   [[Barbados]],   [[Saint Lucia]], [[Belize]],   [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]],  [[Dominica]],   [[Suriname]],  [[Grenada]],  [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and  [[Guyana]].  [[Jamaica]], although also a member of CARICOM, is an associate of the CGPM in its own right.</ref> that only wish to participate in the [[Mutual recognition agreement|MRA]] program. Associate members have observer status at the CGPM. Since all formal liaison between the convention organisations and national governments is handled by the member state's ambassador to France,<ref group = Note>In the case of France, the French Foreign Minister</ref> it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with France,<ref>{{cite web

Of the twenty countries that attended the Conference of the Metre in 1875, representatives of seventeen signed the convention on 20 May 1875.<ref group = Note>[[Argentina]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Belgium]], [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]], Denmark, [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Peru]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], [[Sweden and Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ottoman Empire]], United States and [[Venezuela]].</ref>  In April 1884 HJ Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the United Kingdom. [[Ole Jacob Broch|Broch]], director of the BIPM replied that he was not authorised to perform any such calibrations for non-member states. On 17 September 1884, the British Government signed the convention on behalf of the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book

|width="90%" |The [[Kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]] (IPK), a cylinder made of [[platinum]]-[[iridium]]  and the [[International Prototype Metre]], an X-cross-section bar also made from platinum-iridium were selected by lot from batches manufactured by the British firm [[Johnson Matthey]].  Working copies of both artifacts were also selected by lot and other copies distributed to member nations, again by lot. The prototypes and working copies were deposited at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (Bureau international des poids et mesures), [[Sèvres]], France.

The [[Celsius|degree Celsius]] was selected from three names in use as the name of the unit of temperature. The symbol l (lowercase L) <!--symbols for units of measure never italic--> was adopted as symbol for litre. Both the comma and dot on a line are accepted as decimal marker symbols. Symbols for the [[stere]] and second changed [http://www.bipm.org/jsp/en/ViewCGPMResolution.jsp?CGPM=9&RES=7]. The universal return to the [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]] numbering system was proposed but not adopted.

|The second was redefined as duration of 9&nbsp;192&nbsp;631&nbsp;770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]]-133 atom at a temperature of 0 K. The ''Degree Kelvin'' renamed ''kelvin'' and the candela redefined.
