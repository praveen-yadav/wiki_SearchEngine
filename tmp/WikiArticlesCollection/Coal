[[File:Coal bituminous.jpg|thumb|Bituminous coal]]
'''Coal''' (from the Old English term ''col'', which has meant "mineral of fossilized carbon" since the 13th century)<ref>{{OEtymD|coal}}</ref> is a [[combustible]] black or brownish-black [[sedimentary rock]] usually occurring in [[stratum|rock strata]] in layers or veins called '''coal beds<!-- redirected term title-->''' or '''coal seams'''. The harder forms, such as [[anthracite|anthracite coal]], can be regarded as [[metamorphic rock]] because of later exposure to elevated temperature and [[pressure]]. Coal is composed primarily of [[carbon]] along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly  [[hydrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Blander|first=M|title=Calculations of the Influence of Additives on Coal Combustion Deposits|url=http://www.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/Volumes/Vol34-2.pdf|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=17 December 2011|page=315}}</ref>

Throughout history, coal has been used as an energy resource, primarily burned for the production of electricity and/or heat, and is also used for industrial purposes, such as refining metals. A [[fossil fuel]], coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into [[peat]], which in turn is converted into [[lignite]], then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly [[anthracite]]. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over a long period.

Coal is the largest source of energy for the [[Electricity generation|generation of electricity]] worldwide, as well as one of the largest worldwide [[anthropogenic]] sources of [[carbon dioxide]] releases. In 1999 world gross [[carbon dioxide emissions]] from coal usage were 8,666 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.<ref>{{Cite journal| url  = http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110523215823/http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/carbon.html|title = International Energy Annual 2006| year =  2008| publisher =  [[Energy Information Administration]]| archivedate = 23 May 2011}}, see data tables</ref> Coal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt-hour generated, which is almost double the approximately 1100 pounds of carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant per megawatt-hour generated. Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the fuel mix in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have fallen. Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.<ref>Nuwer, Rachel (2012-08-17).

Coal is extracted from the ground by [[coal mining]], either underground by [[shaft mining]], or at ground level by [[open pit mining]] extraction. Since 1983 the world top coal producer has been [[China]].<ref name="BPReview2011"/> In 2011 China produced 3,520 millions of tonnes of coal – 49.5% of 7,695 millions tonnes world coal production. In 2011 other large producers were [[United States]] (993 millions tonnes), [[India]] (589), [[European Union]] (576) and Australia (416).<ref name="BPReview2011"/> In 2010 the largest exporters were Australia with 328 million tonnes (27.1% of world coal export) and [[Indonesia]] with 316 millions tonnes (26.1%),<ref name=ei/> while the largest importers were [[Japan]] with 207 million tonnes (17.5% of world coal import), China with 195 million tonnes (16.6%) and [[South Korea]] with 126 million tonnes (10.7%).<ref name=eim/>

== Formation ==
[[File:Struktura chemiczna węgla kamiennego.svg|thumb|Example chemical structure of coal]]
At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried under the soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water.  This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization.<ref>

The wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous]] Period provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.  The exception is the coal gap in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], where coal is rare.  Coal is known from [[Precambrian]] strata, which predate land plants — this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.<ref name="Tyler1957">{{cite doi|10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[1293:ACFPUH]2.0.CO;2}}</ref><ref name="Mancuso1981">{{cite doi|10.2113/gsecongeo.76.4.951}}</ref>

As geological processes apply [[pressure]] to dead [[biotic material]] over time, under suitable conditions it is transformed successively into:
* [[Peat]], considered to be a precursor of coal, has industrial importance as a fuel in some regions, for example, Ireland and Finland. In its dehydrated form, peat is a highly effective absorbent for fuel and oil spills on land and water. It is also used as a conditioner for soil to make it more able to retain and slowly release water.
* [[Lignite]], or brown coal, is the lowest rank of coal and used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation. [[jet (lignite)|Jet]], a compact form of lignite, is sometimes polished and has been used as an ornamental stone since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]].
* [[Sub-bituminous coal]], whose properties range from those of lignite to those of bituminous coal, is used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation and is an important source of light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s for the [[chemical synthesis]] industry.
* [[Bituminous coal]] is a dense sedimentary rock, usually black, but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material; it is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation, with substantial quantities used for heat and power applications in manufacturing and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]].
* "Steam coal" is a grade between bituminous coal and anthracite, once widely used as a fuel for [[steam locomotive]]s. In this specialized use, it is sometimes known as "sea-coal" in the US.<ref>[[Funk and Wagnalls]], quoted in {{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=sea-coal}}</ref> Small steam coal (dry small steam nuts or DSSN) was used as a fuel for domestic [[water heating]].
* [[Anthracite]], the highest rank of coal, is a harder, glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial [[space heating]]. It may be divided further into metamorphically altered bituminous coal and "petrified oil", as from the deposits in Pennsylvania.
* [[Graphite]], technically the highest rank, is difficult to ignite and is not commonly used as fuel — it is mostly used in pencils and, when powdered, as a [[lubricant]].

The classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles. However, the exact classification varies between countries. According to the German classification, coal is classified as follows:<ref>Eberhard Lindner; Chemie für Ingenieure; Lindner Verlag Karlsruhe, S. 258</ref>

The middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the English-language sub-bituminous to bituminous coal, while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite, but more inclusive (US anthracite has < 6% volatiles).

[[Cannel coal]] (sometimes called "candle coal") is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content. It consists primarily of "[[exinite]]" [[maceral]]s, now termed "liptinite".

===Hilt's law===
{{main|Hilt's law}}
[[Hilt's law]] is a geological term that states that, in a small area, the deeper the coal, the higher its rank (grade). The law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical, but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.

An experimental way of coal combustion is in the form of [[coal-water slurry fuel]] (CWS), which was well-developed in Russia since the days of the [[Soviet Union]]. CWS significantly reduces emissions, improving the heating value of coal. Other ways to use coal are [[cogeneration|combined heat and power cogeneration]] and [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|an MHD topping cycle]].

The total known deposits recoverable by current technologies, including highly polluting, low-energy content types of coal (i.e., lignite, bituminous), is sufficient for many years.{{how many|date=May 2012}} However, consumption is increasing and [[peak coal|maximal production could be reached]] within decades (see [[Coal#World coal reserves|world coal reserves]], below).

===Coking coal and use of coke===
{{Main|Coke (fuel)}}
[[File:Coke Ovens Abercwmboi.jpg|right|thumb|Coke oven at a [[smokeless fuel]] plant in [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom]]]]
Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together. Metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a [[reducing agent]] in smelting [[iron]] ore in a [[blast furnace]].<ref>[http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html Blast furnace steelmaking cost model]. Steelonthenet.com. Retrieved on 24 August 2012.</ref> The result is [[pig iron]], and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make [[steel]]. The coking coal should be low in [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]], so they do not migrate to the metal.

The coke must be [[Coke strength after reaction|strong enough]] to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. However, the alternative route is [[direct reduced iron]], where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]], light oils, and [[coal gas]].

[[Petroleum coke]] is the solid residue obtained in [[oil refining]], which resembles coke, but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

===Gasification===
{{Main|Coal gasification|Underground coal gasification}}
Coal gasification can be used to produce [[syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas. This syngas can then be converted into transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]. This technology is currently used by the [[Sasol]] chemical company of [[South Africa]] to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas. Alternatively, the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes, such as powering a [[hydrogen economy]], making ammonia, or upgrading fossil fuels.

During gasification, the coal is mixed with [[oxygen]] and [[steam]] while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules [[oxidize]] the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing [[hydrogen]] gas (H<sub>2</sub>). This process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of [[town gas]].

: C (''as Coal'') + O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → H<sub>2</sub> + CO

If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the [[water gas shift reaction]], where more hydrogen is liberated.

: CO + H<sub>2</sub>O → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

In the past, coal was converted to make coal gas ([[town gas]]), which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.

===Liquefaction===
{{Main|Coal liquefaction}}

Coal can also be converted into [[synthetic fuel]]s equivalent to [[gasoline]] or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] by several different processes. In the direct liquefaction processes, the coal is either [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] or [[carbonization|carbonized]]. Hydrogenation processes are the [[Bergius process]],<ref>{{Cite journal| first = Robert|last= Haul| title = Friedrich Bergius (1884–1949)| page =  62 |journal = Chemie in unserer Zeit| publisher =  VCH-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH| volume= 19|date= April 1985}}</ref> the SRC-I and SRC-II (Solvent Refined Coal) processes and the NUS Corporation hydrogenation process.<ref name=handbook2>

</ref> In the process of low-temperature [[carbonization]], coal is coked at temperatures between 360 and 750°C (680 and 1,380°F). These temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar. The coal tar is then further processed into fuels. Alternatively, coal can be converted into a gas first, and then into a liquid, by using the Fischer-Tropsch process. An overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Höök, M., Aleklett, K.|url=http://www.tsl.uu.se/uhdsg/Publications/CTL_Article.pdf |doi=10.1002/er.1596|title=A review on coal-to-liquid fuels and its coal consumption|year=2010|journal=International Journal of Energy Research|volume=34|issue=10|pages=848}}</ref>

Coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions in the conversion process. If coal liquefaction is done without employing either [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technologies or biomass blending, the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from [[crude oil]]. If CCS technologies are employed, reductions of 5–12% can be achieved in [[Coal to liquids|Coal to Liquid (CTL)]] plants and up to a 75% reduction is achievable when co-gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass (30% biomass by weight) in coal/biomass-to-liquids plants.<ref>

=== Refined coal ===
{{Main|Refined coal}}
Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Depending on the situation, precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

===Industrial processes {{anchor|Industrial processes}}===
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of [[foundry sand]]. While the molten metal is in the [[Molding (process)|mould]], the coal burns slowly, releasing [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=P.

==Cultural usage==
Coal is the [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|official state mineral]] of [[Kentucky]].<ref name="Kentucky mineral">{{cite web|url=http://sos.ky.gov/kids/all/symbols/mineral.htm|title=Kentucky: Secretary of State – State Mineral|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> and the official state rock of [[Utah]];<ref name="Utah rock">{{cite web|url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/rock.html|title=Utah State Rock – Coal|work=Pioneer: Utah's Online Library|publisher=Utah State Library Division|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> both [[US state]]s have a historic link to coal mining.

Some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from [[Santa Claus]] for Christmas in their [[christmas stocking]]s instead of presents.

It is also customary and considered lucky in Scotland and the North of England to give coal as a gift on New Year's Day. This occurs as part of [[First-Foot]]ing and represents warmth for the year to come.

==Coal as a traded commodity==
In North America, Central [[Appalachia]]n coal [[futures contract]]s are currently traded on the [[NYMEX|New York Mercantile Exchange]] (trading symbol ''QL''). The trading unit is {{convert|1550|ST|t}} per contract, and is quoted in U.S. dollars and cents per ton. Since coal is the principal fuel for generating electricity in the United States, coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the [[Electrical power industry|electric power industry]] an important tool for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[risk management]].<ref>{{cite web | title=NYMEX.com: Coal | url=http://www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080312083033/http://www.nymex.com/coa_fut_descri.aspx| archivedate=2008-03-12| accessdate=16 January 2008}}</ref>

In addition to the NYMEX contract, the [[IntercontinentalExchange|IntercontinentalExchange (ICE)]] has European (Rotterdam) and South African (Richards Bay) coal futures available for trading.

== Economic aspects ==
Coal (by liquefaction technology) is one of the [[backstop resources]] that could limit escalation of [[oil prices]] and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under [[peak oil]]. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel,<ref>{{cite news | title=Diesel Fuel News: Ultra-clean fuels from coal liquefaction: China about to launch big projects – Brief Article | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYH/is_15_6/ai_89924477 |accessdate=9 September 2005 | work=Diesel Fuel News | first=Jack | last=Peckham | year=2002}}</ref> with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to [[oil sand]] projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.

In China, due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector, coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below $40 per barrel.<ref>{{cite news |author=Tingting, Si and Jing, Li  | title=Coal-to-liquids project rescheduled to launch in early 2009 | url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/12/content_7300666.htm |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2008 |newspaper=China Daily}}</ref> This is probably because China prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil, instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves. As oil prices were increasing during the first half of 2009, the coal liquefaction projects in China were again boosted, and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of $40.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sasol, Shenhua Group May Complete Coal-to-Fuel Plant by 2013 | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a.MSdPvb0Ep8|accessdate=10 January 2009 | work=Bloomberg | date=7 January 2009}}</ref>

=== World coal reserves ===
The 948 billion short tons of recoverable coal reserves estimated by the Energy Information Administration are equal to about 4,196 BBOE (billion [[barrel of oil equivalent|barrels of oil equivalent]]).<!-- (948,000*0.907186*4.879) --><ref>{{cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Recoverable Reserves | url=http://205.254.135.7/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&pid=7&aid=6 | accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> The amount of coal burned during 2007 was estimated at 7.075 billion short tons, or 133.179 quadrillion BTU's.<ref>{{cite web | title=EIA International Energy Statistics : Coal : Consumption | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=1&pid=1&aid=2 |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> This is an average of 18.8 million BTU per short ton. In terms of heat content, this is about {{convert|57000000|oilbbl}} of oil equivalent per day.<!-- 133179 trillion BTUs = 20820 MBoe, /365--> By comparison in 2007, natural gas provided {{convert|51000000|oilbbl}} of oil equivalent per day, while oil provided {{convert|85800000|oilbbl|m3}} per day.

[[BP|British Petroleum]], in its 2007 report, estimated at 2006 end that there were 147 years [[reserves-to-production ratio]] based on ''proven'' coal reserves worldwide. This figure only includes reserves classified as "proven"; exploration drilling programs by mining companies, particularly in under-explored areas, are continually providing new reserves. In many cases, companies are aware of coal deposits that have not been sufficiently drilled to qualify as "proven". However, some nations haven't updated their information and assume reserves remain at the same levels even with withdrawals. Speculative projections predict that global [[peak coal]] production may occur sometime around 2025 at 30 percent above current production, depending on future coal production rates.<ref>[http://www.energywatchgroup.org/fileadmin/global/pdf/EWG_Report_Coal_10-07-2007ms.pdf ''Coal: Resources and Future Production''], Energy Watch group, 28 March 2007 (revised 10 July 2007)</ref>

Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed reserves; coal is mined in over 100 countries, and on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. The largest reserves are found in the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Australia]] and [[India]]. Note the table below.
