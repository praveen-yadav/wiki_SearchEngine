{{Tanakh OT}}
:''For the attributed author of the '''Book of Obadiah''', see [[Obadiah]].''

The canonical Book of Obadiah is an ''oracle'' concerning the divine judgment of [[Edom]] and the restoration of [[Israel]].<ref>Coogan, M.“A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 315</ref> The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book in the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref>Nelson's Compact Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1978, p. 191, ISBN 0-8407-5636-4</ref>

In [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], its authorship is attributed to a [[prophet]] who lived in the ''[[Assyria]]n Period'' and named himself in the first verse, [[Obadiah]]. His name means “servant of Yehowah”. 

In Christianity, the book of Obadiah is classified as a [[minor prophet]] of the [[Old Testament]], due to its short length. 

In Judaism, Obadiah is considered a “later prophet” and this [[Masoretic Text]] is chronologically placed in the [[Tanakh]] under the section [[Nevi'im]] in the last category called ''The Twelve Prophets''.

== Content ==
The book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of [[Edom]],{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:1,4,18|NKJ|v.1,4,18}} a mountain dwelling nation{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:8,9,19,21|NKJV|v.8,9,19,21}} whose ''Founding Father'' was [[Esau]].{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:6|NKJ|v.6}}
Obadiah describes an encounter with [[Yahweh|God]] who addresses Edom’s arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of [[Jacob]].{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:10|NKJ|v.10}}

The western half of ancient Edom is the [[Negev]] desert all the way to Eilat, all part of modern Israel. The eastern half is possessed by the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.  In the days of Obadiah, the Edomites lived along the cliffs and mountaintops of the arid land south of the Dead Sea, all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea. There was very little in the way of arable land, so the Edomites made their living supporting (and controlling) the main caravan route between [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Babylon]] that passed through their whole land.

Throughout most of the history of Judah, Edom was controlled absolutely from Jerusalem as a vassal state. 
Among the heathen great powers, Edom was held in low regard. Obadiah said that the high elevation of their dwelling place in the mountains of Seir had gone to their head, and they had puffed themselves up in pride. ''"Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD."''

In 597 BCE Nebuchadnezzar II sacked Jerusalem, carted away the King of Judea and installed a puppet ruler. The Edomites helped the Babylonians loot the city.  Obadiah, writing this prophesy around 590 BCE, suggests the Edomites should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. ''"In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. . . Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity."''

Obadiah said in  judgement God would wipe out the house of Esau forever, and not even a remnant would remain. The Edomites' land would be possessed by Egypt and they would cease to exist as a people. But the Day of the Lord was at hand for all nations, and someday the Jews would return from their exile and possess the land of Edom.

==Scholarly issues==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}

===Dating Obadiah===
The date of composition is disputed and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieu. The date of composition must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. [[Edom]] is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853 – 841 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of Jehoram (recorded in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 8:20–22 and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 21:8–20 in the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]]) and 605 – 586 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was attacked by [[Nebuchadrezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzer]] of [[Babylon]], which led to the Babylonian exile of [[Israel]] (recorded in [[Psalm]] 137). The earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Elijah]] as reflected in 1 Kings, Chapter 18, Verses 1–16.  In particular, 1 Kings 18:7–8 reads: And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

The later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], both of whom were prophets in the respective time periods. The later period appears to be the scholarly consensus{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} as Obadiah 1–9 parallels [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 49:7–22. The passage in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BC), and therefore Obadiah 11–14 seems to refer to the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzer]] (586 BC). It is more likely{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} that Obadiah and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us than [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source. There is also much material found in Obadiah 10–21 which [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably. Despite everything, however, there are some{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} who support both dates and even some{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} who support dates other than the two major possibilities presented. Any date for the composition of Obadiah must be held tentatively.

===Contrast with Amos===
In verse eighteen, it says that once judgment has been carried out, “There will be no survivors from the house of Esau” (NIV). So, according to Obadiah there will not remain even a remnant after [[Edom]]’s judgment; This is in contrast to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 9:12, where Amos refers to such a remnant, however, it is stated that their possession will be given to [[Israel]]. Some scholars have suggested that [[Book of Amos|Amos]]’s reference to [[Edom]] is symbolic of all nations who were once enemies of [[Israel]] and not meant to literally mean Edomites in the flesh. This is certainly the perspective of [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] as he recites the passage from [[Book of Amos|Amos]] in [[Book of Acts|Acts]] 15:17. [[Edom]] is symbolic of the remnant of men and Gentiles who will eventually bear God’s name. Moreover, Frederick A. Tatford in ''Prophet of [[Edom]]’s Doom'' says that Obadiah’s prophecy is fulfilled today as there is currently no trace of anyone who may be identified as a fleshly Edomite.

===Sepharad===
''See main article: [[Sepharad]]''

The identity of the land of '''Sepharad''', mentioned only here in this verse in the Bible, {{Bibleref2|Obadiah|1:20|NIV|Obadiah 1:20}}, is currently unknown. It is also unknown whether or not Sepharad is a city, district or territory. The only clues for its possible existence are [[Persia]]n inscriptions that refer to two places called "[[Saparda]]": one area in [[Medes|Media]] and another in [[Asia Minor]], debated to be [[Sardis]].

==Scriptural Parallels==
The exact expression "the Day of the Lord”, from Obadiah 1:15, has been used by other authors throughout the ''Old'' and ''New Testaments'', as follows:

'''[[Old Testament]]:'''
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 2, 13, 34, 58, [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 46:10, [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:22, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 13:5, [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1, 2, 3, [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:18, 20, [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 1, 2, [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 14:1, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] 4:5

'''[[New Testament]]:'''
* 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 2 Peter 3:10, Acts 2:20, 1 Corinthians 5:5, 2 Corinthians 1:14

For other parallels, compare Obadiah 1:1–8 with [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 49:7–16.

==An American Fundamentalist Protestant Christian View==
The overwhelming theme found in Obadiah is the destruction of enemies of God’s people. Unlike other prophets, Obadiah does not present a “turn or burn” {{Clarify|date=July 2013}} message, simply a message of inevitable [[destiny|doom]] as a consequence of previous actions. A [[Christian]] with a knowledge of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] would say that although God’s grace and forgiveness abound in situations, there are consequences which result from bad decisions. Obadiah shows that judgment falls even within the family of God, as [[Israel]] and [[Edom]] descended from twin brothers, Jacob and Esau. His purpose{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} was to make it known that according to his God, if members of the same family were to treat each other in the same manner as [[Edom]] treated the Israelites, they too may be subject to the wrath of God.

In relating to theme of [[Obadiah]], it is important to underscore the “punishment” theme this book outlines against Edom. W.J. Deane and J.R. Thomson write this valid conclusion, “The Book of Obadiah is occupied with one subject – the punishment of Edom for its cruel and unbrotherly love conduct towards Judah...”<ref>Deane, W.J. & Thomson, J.R., The Book of Obadiah, The Pulpit Commentary, Vol. 14 Amos – Malachi. Eds. Spence, H.D.M. & Exell, Joseph S., Eerdmans: Grand Rapids (1981). p.1</ref> One can link this idea of punishment to one of the major prophets “[[Ezekiel]]” who “...interprets the exile to Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalem as deserved punishments for the sins of those who themselves committed them.”<ref>Coogan, M.“A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 319</ref>  Verses 3–7<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Obadiah+1 |title=oremus Bible Browser : Obadiah 1 |publisher=Bible.oremus.org |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref> in Obadiah explain to the reader the reason for the punishment theme, “Confidence in one’s power, intelligence, allies, or the topographical features of one’s territory is often mentioned as an attribute of those who foolishly confront the Lord and are consequently punished.”<ref>Henshaw, R.A. (revised by Zvi, Ehud Ben), The HarperCollins Study Bible. Ed. Attridge, H.W., HarperOne; New York. p. 1230</ref> Although destruction is vital to understanding Obadiah, it is of note to understand the destruction being a consequence of action.
