The '''Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit''', also known as the '''Stealth Bomber''', is an American [[strategic bomber]], featuring low observable [[stealth aircraft|stealth]] technology designed for penetrating dense [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defenses]]; it is able to deploy both [[conventional weapons|conventional]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The bomber has a crew of two and can drop up to eighty {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}}-class [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] [[GPS]]-guided bombs, or sixteen {{convert|2400|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[B83 nuclear bomb]]s. The B-2 is the only aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface [[Standoff missile|standoff weapon]]s in a stealth configuration.

Development originally started under the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) project during the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]], and its performance was one of the reasons for his cancellation of the [[B-1 Lancer]]. ATB continued during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program as well. Program costs rose throughout development. Designed and manufactured by [[Northrop Grumman]] with assistance from [[Boeing]], the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737&nbsp;million (in 1997 dollars).<ref name=Gao>[http://www.fas.org/man/gao/nsiad97181.htm "B-2 Bomber: Cost and Operational Issues Letter Report, 14 August 1997, GAO/NSIAD-97-181."] ''United States General Accounting Office'' (GAO). Retrieved: 13 September 2009.</ref> Total [[procurement]] costs averaged $929&nbsp;million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support.<ref name=Gao/> The total program cost including development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.1&nbsp;billion per aircraft in 1997.<ref name=Gao/>

Because of its considerable [[Capital cost|capital]] and [[Operating cost|operating]] costs, the [[megaproject|project]] was controversial in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and among the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The winding-down of the [[Cold War]] in the latter portion of the 1980s dramatically reduced the need for the aircraft, which was designed with the intention of penetrating Soviet airspace and attacking high-value targets. During the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress slashed plans to purchase 132 bombers to 21. In 2008, a B-2 was destroyed in [[Andersen Air Force Base B-2 accident|a crash shortly after takeoff]], and the crew ejected safely.<ref>Rolfsen, Bruce.

Retrieved: 13 September 2009.</ref> A total of 20 B-2s remain in service with the [[United States Air Force]]. 

The B-2 is capable of all-altitude attack missions up to 50,000&nbsp;ft, with a range of more than 6,000 nautical miles unrefuelled and over 10,000 nautical miles with one refueling.  Though originally designed primarily as a nuclear bomber, it was first used in combat to drop conventional [[bomb]]s on [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]] in 1999, and saw continued use during the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]].<ref name = B-2_AF_fact_sheet />

==Development==

===Origins===
In the mid-1970s, the search for a new U.S. [[strategic bomber]] to replace the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] was underway, to no avail. First the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|B-70]] and then the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1A]] were canceled after only prototypes of each aircraft were built. The B-70 was intended to fly above and beyond defensive [[interceptor aircraft]], only to find these same attributes made it especially vulnerable to [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs). The B-1 attempted to avoid SAMs by flying close to the ground to use terrain to mask its radar signature, only to face a new generation of interceptors with [[look-down/shoot-down]] capabilities that could attack them from above.<ref>Donald 2004, p. 120.</ref>

By the mid-1970s, it was becoming clear that there was a different way to avoid missiles ''and'' intercepts; known today as "[[Stealth aircraft|stealth]]"; the concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed radar signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although such possibilities existed, such as human observation, their relatively short detection range allowed most aircraft to fly undetected by defenses, especially at night.<ref>Rao, G.A. and S.P. Mahulikar. "Integrated review of stealth technology and its role in airpower". ''Aeronautical Journal'', v. 106 (1066), 2002, pp. 629–641.</ref>

In 1974, [[DARPA]] requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest [[radar cross-section]] of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars.<ref>Crickmore and Crickmore 2003, p. 9.</ref> Initially, [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] were selected for further development. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] had experience in this field due to developing the [[Lockheed A-12]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]], which included a number of stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in [[Radar-absorbent material|radar-absorbing paint]]. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a "faceted" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with "the hopeless diamond", a model Lockheed built to test the concept.<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm "Stealth Aircraft."] ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission,'' 2003. Retrieved: 5 November 2012.</ref>

Plans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed (XST) project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing.  Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the [[Have Blue]] program.<ref>Griffin and Kinnu 2007, pp. 14–15.</ref>

===ATB program===
By 1976, these programs progressed to where a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter was aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled.<ref>Withington 2006, p. 7.</ref> Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]] in 1979, [[Ronald Reagan]] repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In return, on 22 August 1980, the [[Carter administration]] publicly disclosed that the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.<ref name=goodall>Goodall 1992, {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>

The Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) began in 1979.<ref name=Pace_p20-27>Pace 1999, pp. 20–27.</ref> Full development of the [[black project]] followed, and was funded under the code name "[[Aurora (aircraft)|Aurora]]".<ref name=Rich/> After the evaluations of the companies' proposals, the ATB competition was narrowed to the [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]]/[[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]/[[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] teams with each receiving a study contract for further work.<ref name=Pace_p20-27/> Both teams used flying wing designs.<ref name=Rich/> Northrop had prior experience developing the [[Northrop YB-35|YB-35]] and [[Northrop YB-49|YB-49]] flying wing aircraft.<ref>Donald 2003, p. 13.</ref> The Northrop design was larger while the Lockheed design included a small tail.<ref name=Rich>Rich and Janos 1994, {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> In 1979, designer [[Hal Markarian]] produced a sketch of the aircraft, that bore considerable similarities to the final design.<ref>Sweetman 1991, pp. 21, 30.</ref>  The Air Force originally planned to procure 165 of the ATB bomber.<ref name="Nat_Museum_B-2_factsheet1"/>

The Northrop/Boeing team's ATB design was selected over the Lockheed/Rockwell design on 20 October 1981.<ref name=Pace_p20-27/><ref name=Spick_p339>Spick 2000, p. 339.</ref>  The Northrop design received the designation B-2 and the name "Spirit". The bomber's design was changed in the mid-1980s when the mission profile was changed from high-altitude to low-altitude, terrain-following. The redesign delayed the B-2's first flight by two years and added about US$1&nbsp;billion to the program's cost.<ref name=goodall/> An estimated US$23&nbsp;billion was secretly spent for [[research and development]] on the B-2 by 1989.<ref>Van Voorst, Bruce.

Both during development and in service, there has been considerable importance placed to the security of the B-2 and its technologies. Staff working on the B-2 in most, if not all, capacities have to achieve a level of special-access clearance, and undergo extensive background checks carried out by a special branch of the Air Force.<ref>Vartaebedian, Ralph.

For the manufacturing, a former Ford automobile assembly plant in [[Pico Rivera, California]], was acquired and heavily rebuilt; the plant's employees were sworn to complete secrecy regarding their work. To avoid the possibility of suspicion, components were typically purchased through [[front company|front companies]], military officials would visit out of uniform, and staff members were routinely subjected to [[polygraph]] examinations. The secrecy extended so far that access to nearly all information on the program by both [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) and virtually all members of Congress itself was severely limited until mid-1980s.<ref>Atkinson, Rick.

In 1984, a [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] employee, [[Thomas Patrick Cavanaugh|Thomas Cavanaugh]] was arrested for attempting to sell [[classified information]] to the [[Soviet Union]]; the information was taken from Northrop's Pico Rivera, California factory.<ref>AP.

Retrieved: 13 September 2009.</ref> Cavanaugh was eventually sentenced to life in prison and released on parole in 2001.

The B-2 was first publicly displayed on 22 November 1988 at Air Force [[Plant 42]], [[Palmdale, California]], where it was assembled. This viewing was heavily restricted, and guests were not allowed to see the rear of the B-2. However, ''[[Aviation Week & Space Technology|Aviation Week]]'' editors found that there were no airspace restrictions above the presentation area and took photographs of the aircraft's then-secret [[planform]] and suppressed engine exhausts from the air, to the USAF's disappointment. The B-2's first public flight was on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale.<ref name=Pace_p29-36>Pace 1999, pp. 29–36.</ref>

In October 2005, [[Noshir Gowadia]], a design engineer who worked on the B-2's propulsion system, was arrested for selling B-2 related classified information to foreign countries.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070222093416/http://honolulu.fbi.gov/pressrel/2005/goodwin102605.htm "Press Release."] ''FBI Honolulu.''

===Program costs and procurement===
A procurement of 132 aircraft was planned in the mid-1980s, but was later reduced to 75.<ref name=Pace_p75-76>Pace 1999, pp. 75–76.</ref> By the early 1990s, the Soviet Union dissolved, effectively eliminating the Spirit's primary Cold War mission. Under budgetary pressures and Congressional opposition, in his 1992 [[State of the Union Address]], President [[George H.W. Bush]] announced B-2 production would be limited to 20 aircraft.<ref>[http://www.c-span.org/executive/transcript.asp?cat=current_event&code=bush_admin&year=1992 "President George H. Bush's State of the Union Address."]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''c-span.org'', 28 January 1992. Retrieved: 13 September 2009.</ref> In 1996, however, the Clinton administration, though originally committed to ending production of the bombers at 20 aircraft, authorized the conversion of a 21st bomber, a [[prototype]] test model, to Block 30 fully operational status at a cost of nearly $500&nbsp;million.<ref>Graham, Bradley. "US to add one B-2 plane to 20 plane fleet." ''Washington Post'', 22 March 1996, p. A20.</ref>

In 1995, Northrop made a proposal to the USAF to build 20 additional aircraft with a [[flyaway cost]] of $566&nbsp;million each.<ref name=Ency_Mod_Mil>Eden 2004, pp. 350–353.</ref>

The program was the subject of public controversy for its cost to American taxpayers. In 1996, the [[Government Accountability Office|General Accounting Office]] (GAO) disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers "will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis", costing over three times as much as the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] (US$9.6&nbsp;million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H ($US6.8&nbsp;million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's 172&nbsp;ft (52.4&nbsp;m) wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, particularly its "low-observable" stealthy skins.<ref>Capaccio, Tony. "The B-2's Stealthy Skins Need Tender, Lengthy Care." ''Defense Week'', 27 May 1997, p. 1.</ref><ref>''US General Accounting Office'' September 1996, pp. 53, 56.</ref> Maintenance costs are about $3.4&nbsp;million a month for each aircraft.<ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20100614.aspx "The Gold Plated Hangar Queen Survives."] ''Strategyworld.com,'' 14 June 2010. Retrieved: 8 April 2011.</ref>

The total "military construction" cost related to the program was projected to be US$553.6&nbsp;million in 1997 dollars. The cost to procure each B-2 was US$737&nbsp;million in 1997 dollars, based only on a fleet cost of US$15.48&nbsp;billion.<ref name=Gao/> The procurement cost per aircraft as detailed in GAO reports, which include spare parts and software support, was $929&nbsp;million per aircraft in 1997 dollars.<ref name=Gao/>

The total program cost projected through 2004 was US$44.75&nbsp;billion in 1997 dollars. This includes development, procurement, facilities, construction, and spare parts. The total program cost averaged US$2.13&nbsp;billion per aircraft.<ref name=Gao/>  The B-2 may cost up to $135,000 per flight hour to operate in 2010, which is about twice that of the B-52 and B-1.<ref name="axe20120326">Axe, David.

=== Opposition ===
In its consideration of the fiscal year 1990 defense budget, the House Armed Services Committee trimmed $800&nbsp;million from the B-2 [[research and development]] budget, while at the same time staving off a motion to end the project. Opposition in committee and in Congress was mostly broad and bipartisan, with Congressmen [[Ron Dellums]] (D-CA), [[John Kasich]] (R-OH), and [[John G. Rowland]] (R-CT) authorizing the motion to end the project, others in the Senate, such as [[Jim Exon]] (D-NE) and [[John McCain]] (R-AZ), also opposing the project.<ref name=Schmitt>Schmitt, Eric. [http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/14/us/key-senate-backer-of-stealth-bomber-sees-it-in-jeopardy.html?pagewanted=1 "Key Senate Backer of Stealth Bomber Sees It in Jeopardy."] ''The New York Times'', 14 September 1991. Retrieved: 23 July 2009.</ref>

The escalating cost of the B-2 program and evidence of flaws in the aircraft's ability to elude detection by radar,<ref name=Schmitt/> were among factors that drove opposition to continue the program. At the peak production period specified in 1989, the schedule called for spending US$7&nbsp;billion to $8&nbsp;billion per year in 1989 dollars, something Committee Chair [[Les Aspin]] (D-WI) said "won't fly financially."<ref name=Sorenson_p168>Sorenson 1995, p. 168.</ref> In 1990, the Department of Defense accused Northrop of using faulty components in the [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]]; the threat posed by bird ingestion potentially damaging engine fan blades also required redesigning.<ref>"Moisture in sensors led to stealth bomber crash, Air Force report says." ''Kansas City Star'', 5 June 2008.</ref>

In time, a number of prominent members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including former Democratic presidential nominee [[John Kerry]], who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991 and 1992 while a U.S. Senator, representing [[Massachusetts]]. By 1992, Republican President [[George H.W. Bush]] called for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.factcheck.org/zell_millers_attack_on_kerry_a_little.html "Zell Miller's Attack on Kerry: A Little Out Of Date."] ''FactCheck.org'', 4 October 2004. Retrieved: 26 October 2004.</ref> In October 1995, former [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[Michael E. Ryan|General Mike Ryan]], and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General [[John Shalikashvili]], strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft,<ref>Bender, Brian and John Robinson. "More Stealth Bombers Mean Less Combat Power". ''Defense Daily'', 5 August 1997, p. 206.</ref> and that the military had greater priorities in spending a limited budget.<ref>''US General Accounting Office'' September 1996, p. 70.</ref>

Some B-2 advocates argued that procuring twenty additional aircraft would save money because B-2s would be able to deeply penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and use low-cost, short-range attack weapons rather than expensive standoff weapons. However, in 1995, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), and its Director of National Security Analysis, found that additional B-2s would reduce the cost of expended munitions by less than US$2&nbsp;billion in 1995 dollars during the first two weeks of a conflict, in which the Air Force predicted bombers would make their greatest contribution; a small fraction of the US$26.8&nbsp;billion (in 1995 dollars) life cycle cost that the CBO projected an additional 20 B-2s would cost.<ref>''US General Accounting Office'' September 1996, p. 72.</ref>

In 1997, as [[Ranking Member]] of the [[U.S. House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] and National Security Committee, Congressman [[Ron Dellums]] (D-CA), a long-time opponent of the bomber, cited five independent studies and offered an amendment to that year's defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers to the existing 21 aircraft; the amendment was narrowly defeated.<ref name=Amendment>[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/970623-b2.htm "Debate on Dellums Amendment to 1998 Defense Authorization Act."] ''fas.org'', 23 June 1997.</ref> Nonetheless, Congress did not approve funding for the purchase of any additional B-2 bombers.

===Further developments===
A number of upgrade packages have been applied to the B-2. In July 2008, the B-2's onboard computing architecture was extensively redesigned, it now incorporates a new integrated processing unit (IPU) that communicates with systems throughout the aircraft via a newly installed [[fibre optic]] network; a new version of the operational flight program software was also developed, with legacy code converted from the [[JOVIAL]] programming language used beforehand to standard [[C (programming language)|C]].<ref>McKinney, Brooks.

===Overview===
The B-2 Spirit was developed to take over the USAF's vital penetration missions, able to travel deep into enemy territory to deploy their ordnance, which could include [[nuclear weapon]]s.<ref name = "croddy 341-2">Croddy and Wirtz 2005, pp. 341–342.</ref> The B-2 is a [[flying wing]] aircraft, meaning it has no fuselage or tail.<ref name = "croddy 341-2"/> The blending of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the B-2 significant advantages over previous bombers. Low observability provides a greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing both range and field of view for onboard sensors. The U.S. Air Force reports its range as approximately {{convert|6000|nmi|mi km|lk=in}}.<ref name=B-2_AF_fact_sheet/><ref name=Spick_p340-1>Spick 2000, pp. 340–341.</ref> At cruising altitude the B-2 [[aerial refueling|refuels]] every six hours, taking on up to 50 tons of fuel at a time.{{r|chiles201309}}

[[File:US Air Force B-2 Spirit.jpg|thumb|left|Side view of a B-2 Spirit]]
Due to the aircraft's complex flight characteristics and design requirements to maintain very-low visibility to multiple means of detection, both the development and construction of the B-2 required pioneering use of [[computer-aided design]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing|manufacturing]] technologies.<ref name = "croddy 341-2"/><ref>Sweetman 2005, pp. 73–74.</ref> Northrop Grumman is the B-2's prime contractor; other contributing subcontractors include [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]], [[Raytheon]] (formerly [[Hughes Aircraft]]), [[General Electric Aircraft Engines|G.E.]] and [[Vought Aircraft Industries|Vought Aircraft]].<ref name=B-2_AF_fact_sheet/> The B-2 bears a resemblance to earlier Northrop aircraft, the [[Northrop YB-35|YB-35]] and [[Northrop YB-49|YB-49]] were both flying wing bombers that had been cancelled in development in the early 1950s;<ref name = "boyne 466">Boyne 2002, p. 466.</ref> allegedly for political reasons.<ref>Fitzsimons 1978, p. 2282.</ref>

===Avionics and systems===
In order to make the B-2 more effective than any previous bomber, it has integrated many advanced and modern avionics systems into its design, these have been modified and improved in light of the switch to conventional warfare missions. The B-2 features the [[low probability of intercept]] [[AN/APQ-181]] multi-mode radar, a fully digital navigation system that is integrated with [[terrain-following radar]] and [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) guidance, and a Defensive Management System (DMS) to inform the flight crew against possible threats.<ref name = POGO/> The onboard DMS is capable of automatically assessing the detection capabilities of identified threats and indicated targets.<ref name = "sweetman 73">Sweetman 2005, p. 73.</ref>

For safety and fault-detection purposes, an on-board test system is interlinked with the majority of avionics on the B-2 to continuously monitor the performance and status of thousands of components and consumables; it also provides post-mission servicing instructions for ground crews.<ref>Siuru 1993, p. 118.</ref> In 2008, many of the standalone distributed computers on board the B-2, including the primary flight management computer, were being replaced by a single integrated system.<ref>Page, Lewis. [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/11/stealth_bomber_upgrades/ "Upgrade drags Stealth Bomber IT systems into the 90s."] ''The Register'', 11 July 2008.</ref>

In addition to periodic software upgrades and the introduction of new radar-absorbent materials across the fleet, the B-2 has had several major upgrades to its avionics and combat systems. For battlefield communications, both [[Link-16]] and a high frequency satellite link have been installed, compatibility with various new munitions has been undertaken, and the AN/APQ-181 radar's operational frequency was shifted in order to avoid interference with other operator's equipment.<ref name = POGO/> The upgraded radar features entirely replaced arrays by those of a newer design, the AN/APQ-181 is now an [[Active Electronically Scanned Array]] (AESA) radar.<ref>[http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/apq181/ "AN/APQ-181 Radar System."] ''Raytheon''. Retrieved: 11 August 2012.</ref>

===Flight controls===
[[File:20061027-6 b2cockpit-1-515h.jpg|thumb|Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] sits inside a B-2's cockpit with pilot Capt. Luke Jayne during a visit to Whiteman AFB in 2006.]]

In order to address the inherent flight instability of a [[flying wing]] aircraft, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled [[fly-by-wire]] flight control system, that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs in order to maintain aircraft stability.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2008, p. 397.</ref> The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via [[pitot tube|pitot]]-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional [[pitot tube]]s which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities.<ref>Moir and Seabridge 2008, pp. 256–258.</ref> The flight actuation system incorporates both hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed with a high level of redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.<ref>[http://www.moog.com/markets/aircraft/military-aircraft/special-mission/flight-control-actuation-system-integrator-for-the-b-2-spirit/ "Flight Control Actuation System Integrator for the B-2 Spirit."] ''Moog,'' Retrieved: 11 August 2012.</ref>

Northrop had investigated several means of applying directional control that would least infringe on the aircraft's radar profile, eventually settling on a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust.<ref name = "sweetman 73"/> Engine thrust became a key element of the B-2's aerodynamic design process early on; thrust not only affects drag and lift but pitching and rolling motions as well.<ref>Chudoba 2001, p. 76.</ref> Four pairs of control surfaces are located along the wing's trailing edge; while most surfaces are used throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, the inner elevons are normally only in use at slow speeds, such as landing.<ref name = "chudoba 201-2">Chudoba 2001, pp. 201–202.</ref> To avoid potential contact damage during takeoff and to provide a nose-down pitching attitude, all of the elevons remain drooped during takeoff until a high enough airspeed has been attained.<ref name = "chudoba 201-2"/>

===Stealth===
{{asof|2013|09}} no missile has ever been fired at a B-2.{{r|chiles201309}} Its low-observable, or "stealth", characteristics enable the undetected penetration of sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses and to attack even heavily defended targets. This stealth comes from a combination of reduced acoustic, infrared, visual and radar signatures to evade the various detection systems that could be used to detect and be used to direct attacks against an aircraft. The majority of the B-2 is made out of a carbon-graphite [[composite material]] that is stronger than steel and lighter than aluminium. Perhaps most crucially, it also absorbs a significant amount of radar energy;<ref name = "boyne 466"/> reportedly, the B-2 has a radar signature of about 0.1&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>.<ref>Richardson 2001, p. 57.</ref> The bomber does not always fly stealthily; when nearing air defenses pilots "stealth up" the B-2, the details of which are secret. The aircraft disappears from radar, except briefly when the bomb bay opens. The bomber remains vulnerable, however, to visual interception by fighters.{{r|chiles201309}}

[[File:B2 Spirit closeup.JPEG|thumb|left|The B-2's engines are buried within its wing to conceal the engines' fans and minimize their exhaust signature]]
In contrast to the flat surfaces of the earlier [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117 Nighthawk]], the B-2 is composed of many curved and rounded surfaces across its exposed airframe to deflect radar beams. Additional reduction in its radar signature was achieved by the use of various [[radar-absorbent material]]s (RAM) to absorb and neutralize radar beams. The B-2's clean, low-drag [[flying wing]] configuration not only gives it exceptional range but is also beneficial to reducing its radar profile.<ref name = "croddy 341-2"/><ref>Siuru 1993, pp. 114–115.</ref> Although it is normal for most large aircraft to leak fuel, the B-2 is assembled with unusually tight tolerances to avoid leaks as they could increase its radar signature.{{r|tirpak199604}}

Another design feature is the placement of the engines, which are buried within the B-2's wing to conceal the engines' fans and minimize thermal visibility of the exhaust.<ref name = "tucker 177"/><ref>Croddy and Wirtz 2005, p. 342.</ref> The original design had tanks for a [[contrail]]-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a contrail sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude.<ref>Gosnell, Mariana.

Retrieved: 13 September 2009.</ref> ''Spirit of Kansas'' had been operated by the [[393rd Bomb Squadron]], [[509th Bomb Wing]], [[Whiteman Air Force Base]], [[Missouri]], and had logged 5,176 flight hours. It was the first crash of a B-2. The two person crew ejected safely from the aircraft and survived the crash. The aircraft was completely destroyed, a [[Aviation accidents and incidents|hull loss]] valued at US$1.4&nbsp;billion.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-05-371843035_x.htm "Air Force: Sensor moisture caused 1st B-2 crash."] ''USA Today'', 5 June 2008.

Retrieved: 1 December 2010.</ref> The cause of the crash was later determined to be moisture in the aircraft's Port Transducer Units during air data calibration, which distorted the information being sent to the bomber's air data system. As a result, the flight control computers calculated an inaccurate airspeed, and a negative angle of attack, causing the aircraft to pitch upward 30 degrees during takeoff.<ref>[http://archive.is/20120604211733/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123101727 "B-2 accident report released."] ''US Air Force,'' 6 June 2008.

In February 2010, another serious incident involving a B-2 occurred at Andersen AFB. The aircraft involved was AV-11 ''Spirit of Washington''. The aircraft was severely damaged by fire while on the ground and underwent 18 months of temporary repairs in order to enable it to fly back to the mainland for more comprehensive repairs.<ref name="pacificnewscenter.com">Keerigan, Kevin.

No operational B-2s have been retired by the Air Force to be put on display. B-2s have made periodic appearances on ground display at various [[air show]]s.

B-2 test article (s/n AT-1000), the second of two built without engines or instruments for static testing, was placed on display in 2004 at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]].<ref name="nationalmuseum.af.mil">[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=422 "Factsheet: Northrop B-2 Spirit."] ''National Museum of the United States Air Force.''
