{{Anthropology}}

'''Cultural anthropology''' is a branch of [[anthropology]] focused on the study of [[culture|cultural variation]] among humans and in contrast to the [[social anthropology]] perceives the cultural variation more as an independent "variable" than the dependent one.

A variety of methods, including [[participant observation]], often called [[fieldwork]] because it involves the anthropologist spending an extended period of time at the research location, but also [[interviews]] and [[Statistical survey|surveys]] are part of anthropological methodology.<ref>"In his earlier work, like many anthropologists of this generation, Levi-Strauss draws attention to the necessary and urgent task of maintaining and extending the empirical foundations of anthropology in the practice of fieldwork.": In Christopher Johnson, ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NIJHaX0u-hUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Claude Levi-Strauss: the formative years]'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p.31</ref>

One of the earliest articulations of the anthropological meaning of the term "culture" came from Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] who writes on the first page of his 1897 book: "Culture, or civilization, taken in its broad, ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."<ref>[[Edward Burnett Tylor|Tylor, Edward]]. 1920 [1871]. ''[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VxZMk2PEUsoC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Primitive Culture]''. Vol 1. New York: J.P. Putnam’s Sons.</ref> The term "civilization" later gave way to definitions by [[V. Gordon Childe]], with culture forming an umbrella term and civilization becoming a particular kind of culture.<ref>Sherratt, Andrew V. "Gordon Childe: Archaeology and Intellectual History", Past and Present, No. 125. (Nov., 1989), pp. 151–185.</ref>

The anthropological concept of "culture" reflects in part a reaction against earlier Western [[discourse]]s based on an opposition between "[[culture]]" and "[[nature]]", according to which some human beings lived in a "state of nature".{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Anthropologists have argued that culture ''is'' "human nature", and that all people have a capacity to classify [[experience]]s, encode classifications symbolically (i.e. in [[language]]), and teach such abstractions to others.

Since humans acquire culture through the [[learning]] processes of [[enculturation]] and [[socialization]], people living in different places or different circumstances develop different cultures. Anthropologists have also pointed out that through culture people can adapt to their environment in non-genetic ways, so people living in different environments will often have different cultures. Much of anthropological theory has originated in an appreciation of and interest in the tension between the local (particular cultures) and the global (a universal human nature, or the web of connections between people in distinct places/circumstances).<ref>[[Giulio Angioni]] (2011). ''Fare dire sentire: l'identico e il diverso nelle culture''. Nuoro: il Maestrale</ref>

The rise of cultural anthropology occurred within the context of the late 19th century, when questions regarding which cultures were "primitive" and which were "civilized" occupied the minds of not only [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], but many others. [[Colonialism]] and its processes increasingly brought European thinkers in contact, directly or indirectly with "primitive others."<ref>Rosaldo, Renato. ''Culture and Truth''. 1993. Beach Press.</ref> The relative status of various humans, some of whom had modern advanced technologies that included engines and telegraphs, while others lacked anything but face-to-face communication techniques and still lived a Paleolithic lifestyle, was of interest to the first generation of cultural anthropologists.

Parallel with the rise of cultural anthropology in the United States, [[social anthropology]], in which ''sociality'' is the central concept and which focuses on the study of social statuses and roles, groups, institutions, and the relations among them, developed as an academic discipline in Britain. An umbrella term socio-cultural anthropology makes reference to both cultural and social anthropology traditions.<ref>Campbell, D.T.

==Theoretical foundations==

===The critique of evolutionism===
Anthropology is concerned with the lives of people within different parts of the world, particularly in relation to the discourse of [[belief]]s and practices. In addressing this question, ethnologists in the 19th century divided into two schools of thought. Some, like [[Grafton Elliot Smith]], argued that different groups must somehow have learned from one another, however indirectly; in other words, they argued that cultural traits spread from one place to another, or "[[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffused]]".
[[File:Cultural evolution.PNG|thumb|left|300px|In the [[unilineal evolution]] model at left, all cultures progress through set stages, while in the [[multilineal evolution]] model at right, distinctive culture histories are emphasized.]]

Other ethnologists argued that different groups had the capability of creating similar beliefs and practices independently. Some of those who advocated "independent invention", like [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], additionally supposed that similarities meant that different groups had passed through the same stages of [[cultural evolution]] (See also [[classical social evolutionism]]). Morgan, in particular, acknowledged that certain forms of society and culture could not possibly have arisen before others. For example, industrial farming could not have been invented before simple farming, and metallurgy could not have developed without previous non-smelting processes involving metals (such as simple ground collection or mining). Morgan, like other 19th century social evolutionists, believed there was a more or less orderly progression from the primitive to the civilized.

20th-century anthropologists largely reject the notion that all human societies must pass through the same stages in the same order, on the grounds that such a notion does not fit the empirical facts. Some 20th-century [[ethnologists]], like [[Julian Steward]], have instead argued that such similarities reflected similar adaptations to similar environments (see [[cultural evolution]]). Although 19th-century ethnologists saw "diffusion" and "independent invention" as mutually exclusive and competing theories, most ethnographers quickly reached a consensus that both processes occur, and that both can plausibly account for cross-cultural similarities. But these ethnographers also pointed out the superficiality of many such similarities. They noted that even traits that spread through diffusion often were given different meanings and function from one society to another. Analyses of large human concentrations in big cities, in multi-disciplinar studies by [[Ronald Daus]], show how new methods may be applied to the understanding of man living in a global world and how it was caused by the action of extra-European nations,  so high-lighting the role of [[Ethics]] in modern anthropology.

Accordingly, most of these anthropologists showed less interest in comparing cultures, generalizing about human nature, or discovering universal laws of cultural development, than in understanding particular cultures in those cultures' own terms. Such ethnographers and their students promoted the idea of "[[cultural relativism]]", the view that one can only understand another person's beliefs and behaviors in the context of the culture in which he or she lived or lives.

Others, such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] (who was influenced both by American cultural anthropology and by French [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheimian]] [[sociology]]), have argued that apparently similar patterns of development reflect fundamental similarities in the structure of human thought (see [[structuralism]]). By the mid-20th century, the number of examples of people skipping stages, such as going from hunter-gatherers to post-industrial service occupations in one generation, were so numerous that 19th-century evolutionism was effectively disproved.<ref>Diamond, Jared. Guns, Germs and Steel.</ref>

===Cultural relativism===
{{main|Cultural relativism}}
Cultural relativism is a principle that was established as [[axiom]]atic in [[anthropology|anthropological]] research by [[Franz Boas]] and later popularized by his students.  Boas first articulated the idea in 1887: "...civilization is not something absolute, but ... is relative, and ... our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes."<ref>Franz Boas 1887 "Museums of Ethnology and their classification" ''Science'' 9: 589</ref> Although, Boas did not coin the term, it became common among anthropologists after Boas' death in 1942, to express their synthesis of a number of ideas Boas had developed. Boas believed that the sweep of cultures, to be found in connection with any sub-species, is so vast and pervasive that there cannot be a relationship between culture and [[Race (classification of humans)|race]].<ref>http://www.utpa.edu/faculty/mglazer/theory/cultural_relativism.htm</ref> Cultural relativism involves specific [[epistemology|epistemological]] and methodological claims.  Whether or not these claims require a specific [[ethics|ethical]] stance is a matter of debate. This principle should not be confused with [[moral relativism]].

Cultural relativism was in part a response to Western [[ethnocentrism]].   Ethnocentrism may take obvious forms, in which one consciously believes that one's people's arts are the most beautiful, values the most virtuous, and beliefs the most truthful.  Franz Boas, originally trained in [[physics]] and [[geography]], and heavily influenced by the thought of Kant, Herder, and von Humboldt, argued that one's culture may mediate and thus limit one's perceptions in less obvious ways. This understanding of culture confronts anthropologists with two problems: first, how to escape the unconscious bonds of one's own culture, which inevitably bias our perceptions of and reactions to the world, and second, how to make sense of an unfamiliar culture.  The principle of cultural relativism thus forced anthropologists to develop innovative methods and heuristic strategies.

==Foundational thinkers ==
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumbnail|left|Edward Burnett Tylor]]
Boas and his students realized that if they were to conduct scientific research in other cultures, they would need to employ methods that would help them escape the limits of their own ethnocentrism.  One such method is that of [[ethnography]]: basically, they advocated living with people of another culture for an extended period of time, so that they could learn the local language and be enculturated, at least partially, into that culture.

In this context, cultural relativism is of fundamental methodological importance, because it calls attention to the importance of the local context in understanding the meaning of particular human beliefs and activities.  Thus, in 1948 Virginia Heyer wrote, "Cultural relativity, to phrase it in starkest abstraction, states the relativity of the part to the whole.  The part gains its cultural significance by its place in the whole, and cannot retain its integrity in a different situation."<ref>Heyer, Virginia 1948 "In Reply to Elgin Williams" in ''American Anthropologist'' 50(1) 163-166</ref>

=== Lewis Henry Morgan===
[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

=== Franz Boas, founder of the modern discipline ===
 [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the "Father of American Anthropology"]]

[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.<ref>Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.</ref> Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.

[[File:Margaret Mead (1901-1978).jpg|thumbnail|Margaret Mead (1901-1978)]]
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

===Kroeber, Mead & Benedict===
Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

=== Wolf, Sahlins, Mintz & political economy ===
{{main|Political Economy in anthropology|Eric Wolf|Marshall Sahlins|Sidney Mintz}}
In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some anthropologists, such as Lloyd Fallers and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]], focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche—an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]].

[[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and George Dalton challenged standard [[neoclassical economics]] to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work. Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including [[Psychological anthropology#Cognitive Anthropology|cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis.

In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]];<ref>Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld.</ref> [[Marxism]] became an increasingly popular theoretical approach in the discipline.<ref>Nugent, Stephen ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&title_type=tka&year_from=1998&year_to=2007&database=1&pageSize=20&index=4 Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism]'' The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13)</ref> By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''[[Europe and the People Without History]]'', have been central to the discipline. In the 1980s books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and [[hegemony]] into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again), who drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. [[Jean Comaroff|Jean]] and [[John Comaroff]] produced a whole generation of anthropologists at the University of Chicago that focused on these themes. Also influential in these issues were [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], the critical theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]].<ref name="Lewis">Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294(199809)2%3A100%3A3%3C716%3ATMOAAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100:" 716-731</ref>

=== Geertz, Schneider & interpretive anthropology ===
{{main|Clifford Geertz|David M. Schneider}}
Many anthropologists reacted against the renewed emphasis on materialism and scientific modelling derived from Marx by emphasizing the importance of the concept of culture. Authors such as [[David Schneider (anthropologist)|David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. Geertz was to state:

{{Quotation| "Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning."|Clifford Geertz<ref>{{cite book|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|title=The Interpretation of Cultures|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|pages=5}}</ref>}}

Geertz's interpretive method involved what he called "[[thick description]]." The cultural symbols of rituals, political and economic action, and of kinship, are "read" by the anthropologist as if they are a document in a foreign language. The interpretation of those symbols must be re-framed for their anthropological audience, i.e. transformed from the "experience-near" but foreign concepts of the other culture, into the "experience-distant" theoretical concepts of the anthropologist. These interpretations must then be reflected back to its originators, and its adequacy as a translation fine-tuned in a repeated way, a process called the [[Hermaneutics|hermaneutic circle]]. Geertz applied his method in a number of areas, creating programs of study that were very productive. His analysis of "religion as a cultural system" was particularly influential outside of anthropology. David Schnieder's cultural analysis of American kinship has proven equally influential.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="Balinese Cockfights and the Seduction of Anthropology" in Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=17–28}}</ref>  Schneider demonstrated that the American folk-cultural emphasis on "blood connections" had an undue influence on anthropological kinship theories, and that kinship is not a biological characteristic but a cultural relationship established on very different terms in different societies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carsten|first=Janet|title=After Kinship|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=18–20}}</ref>

Prominent British symbolic anthropologists include [[Victor Turner]] and [[Mary Douglas]].

=== The Post-modern turn ===
In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, in particular how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by Feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics.<ref>Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref> Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theorizing and methods became ''de rigueur'' as part of the 'post-modern moment' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more interpretative and reflexive,<ref name="Janiewski2005p200">Dolores Janiewski, Lois W. Banner (2005) ''Reading Benedict / Reading Mead: Feminism, Race, and Imperial Visions'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=-rUHcVdEuIkC&pg=PA200 p.200] quotation: {{quotation|Within anthropology's "two cultures"—the positivist/objectivist style of comparative anthropology versus a reflexive/interpretative anthropology—Mead has been characterized as a "humanist" heir to Franz Boas's historical particularism—hence, associated with the practices of interpretation and reflexivity [...]}}</ref> explicitly addressing the author's methodology, cultural, gender and racial positioning, and their influence on his or her ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously.<ref>Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-50</ref> Currently anthropologists pay attention to a wide variety of issues pertaining to the contemporary world, including [[globalization]], [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]], [[indigenous rights]], [[virtual communities]], and the anthropology of [[industrial society|industrialized societies]].

==Methods==
Modern cultural anthropology has its origins in, and developed in reaction to, 19th century "[[ethnology]]", which involves the organized comparison of human societies. Scholars like [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[James Frazer|J.G. Frazer]] in [[England]] worked mostly with materials collected by others – usually missionaries, traders, explorers, or colonial officials – earning them the moniker of "arm-chair anthropologists".

=== Participant Observation ===
{{main|Participant observation}}
Participant observation is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly cultural anthropology, less so in [[sociology]], [[communication studies]], and [[social psychology]]. Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time. The method originated in the [[field work|field research]] of social anthropologists, especially  Bronislaw Malinowski in Britain, the students of [[Franz Boas]] in the United States, and in the later urban research of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] of sociology.

Such research involves a range of well-defined, though variable methods: informal interviews, direct [[observation]], [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in the life of the group, [[Focus group|collective discussions]], analyses of [[Primary source|personal documents]] produced within the group, [[Reflexivity (social theory)|self-analysis]], results from activities undertaken off or online, and [[Life history (sociology)|life-histories]]. Although the method is generally characterized as [[qualitative research]], it can (and often does) include [[Quantitative research|quantitative dimensions]]. Traditional participant observation is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations. An extended research time period means that the researcher is able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the individuals, community, and/or population under study. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like [[taboo]] behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time. A strength of observation and interaction over extended periods of time is that researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say—and often believe—should happen (the [[formal system]]) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.<ref name="DeWalt">DeWalt, K. M., DeWalt, B. R., & Wayland, C. B. (1998). "Participant observation." In H. R. Bernard (Ed.), ''Handbook of methods in cultural anthropology.'' Pp: 259-299. Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press.</ref>

=== Ethnography ===
{{main|Ethnography}}
In the 20th century, most cultural and social anthropologists turned to the crafting of [[ethnography|ethnographies]]. An ethnography is a piece of writing about a people, at a particular place and time. Typically, the anthropologist lives among people in another society for a period of time, simultaneously [[participant observation|participating in and observing]] the social and cultural life of the group.

Numerous other ethnographic techniques have resulted in ethnographic writing or details being preserved, as cultural anthropologists also curate materials, spend long hours in libraries, churches and schools poring over records, investigate graveyards, and decipher ancient scripts. A typical ethnography will also include information about physical geography, climate and habitat. It is meant to be a holistic piece of writing about the people in question, and today often includes the longest possible timeline of past events that the ethnographer can obtain through primary and secondary research.

[[Bronisław Malinowski]] developed the ethnographic method, and [[Franz Boas]] taught it in the [[United States]]. Boas' students such as [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Margaret Mead]] drew on his conception of culture and [[cultural relativism]] to develop cultural anthropology in the United States. Simultaneously, Malinowski and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A.R. Radcliffe Brown]]´s students were developing [[social anthropology]] in the United Kingdom. Whereas cultural anthropology focused on symbols and values, social anthropology focused on social groups and institutions. Today socio-cultural anthropologists attend to all these elements.

In the early 20th century, socio-cultural anthropology developed in different forms in [[Europe]] and in the United States. European "[[social anthropologists]]" focused on observed social behaviors and on "social structure", that is, on [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] among social [[role]]s (for example, husband and wife, or parent and child) and social [[institution]]s (for example, [[anthropology of religion|religion]], [[economic anthropology|economy]], and [[political anthropology|politics]]).

American "cultural anthropologists" focused on the ways people expressed their view of themselves and their world, especially in [[symbol]]ic forms, such as [[art]] and [[Mythology|myths]]. These two approaches frequently converged and generally complemented one another. For example, [[kinship]] and [[leadership]] function both as symbolic systems and as social institutions. Today almost all socio-cultural anthropologists refer to the work of both sets of predecessors, and have an equal interest in what people do and in what people say.

=== Cross-cultural comparison ===

One means by which anthropologists combat ethnocentrism is to engage in the process of cross-cultural comparison. It is important to test so-called "human universals" against the ethnographic record. Monogamy, for example, is frequently touted as a universal human trait, yet comparative study shows that it is not. 
The [[Human Relations Area Files]], Inc. (HRAF) is a research agency based at [[Yale University]]. Since 1949, its mission has been to encourage and facilitate worldwide [[Cross-cultural studies|comparative studies]] of human culture, society, and behavior in the past and present. The name came from the Institute of Human Relations, an interdisciplinary program/building at Yale at the time. The Institute of Human Relations had sponsored HRAF’s precursor, the ''Cross-Cultural Survey'' (see [[George Peter Murdock]]), as part of an effort to develop an integrated science of human behavior and culture. The two eHRAF databases on the Web are expanded and updated annually. ''eHRAF World Cultures'' includes materials on cultures, past and present, and covers nearly 400 cultures.  The second database, ''eHRAF Archaeology'', covers major archaeological traditions and many more sub-traditions and sites around the world.

Comparison across cultures includies the industrialized (or de-industrialized) West. Cultures in the more traditional [[standard cross-cultural sample]] of small scale societies are:

=== Multi-sited Ethnography ===
Ethnography dominates socio-cultural anthropology. Nevertheless, many contemporary socio-cultural anthropologists have rejected earlier models of ethnography as treating local cultures as bounded and isolated. These anthropologists continue to concern themselves with the distinct ways people in different locales experience and understand their [[human life|lives]], but they often argue that one cannot understand these particular ways of life solely from a local perspective; they instead combine a focus on the local with an effort to grasp larger political, economic, and cultural frameworks that impact local lived realities. Notable proponents of this approach include [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]], [[George Marcus]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Ronald Daus]].

A growing trend in anthropological research and analysis is the use of multi-sited ethnography, discussed in George Marcus' article, "Ethnography In/Of the World System: the Emergence of Multi-Sited Ethnography". Looking at culture as embedded in macro-constructions of a global social order, multi-sited ethnography uses traditional methodology in various locations both spatially and temporally. Through this methodology, greater insight can be gained when examining the impact of world-systems on local and global communities.

Also emerging in multi-sited ethnography are greater interdisciplinary approaches to fieldwork, bringing in methods from cultural studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and others. In multi-sited ethnography, research tracks a subject across spatial and temporal boundaries. For example, a multi-sited ethnography may follow a "thing," such as a particular commodity, as it is transported through the networks of global capitalism.

Multi-sited ethnography may also follow ethnic groups in [[diaspora]], stories or rumours that appear in multiple locations and in multiple time periods, metaphors that appear in multiple ethnographic locations, or the biographies of individual people or groups as they move through space and time. It may also follow conflicts that transcend boundaries. An example of multi-sited ethnography is [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]]' work on the international black market for the trade of human organs. In this research, she follows organs as they are transferred through various legal and illegal networks of capitalism, as well as the rumours and urban legends that circulate in impoverished communities about child kidnapping and organ theft.

Sociocultural anthropologists have increasingly turned their investigative eye on to [[western culture|"Western" culture]]. For example, [[Philippe Bourgois]] won the [[Margaret Mead Award]] in 1997 for ''In Search of Respect'', a study of the entrepreneurs in a Harlem crack-den. Also growing more popular are ethnographies of professional communities, such as laboratory researchers, [[Wall Street]] investors, law firms, or [[information technology]] (IT) computer employees.<ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/expand?pub=infobike://mcb/161/1995/00000008/00000003/art00003&unc=  Dissertation Abstract]</ref>
