The '''Antarctic''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɑr|k|t|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɑr|t|ɪ|k}})<ref>The word was originally pronounced without /k/, but the [[spelling pronunciation]] has become the more common one. The "c" was originally added for etymological reasons and was then misunderstood as not being silent.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}</ref> is a [[polar region]], specifically the [[region]] around the [[Earth]]'s [[South Pole]], opposite the [[Arctic]] region around the [[North Pole]]. The Antarctic comprises the continent of [[Antarctica]] and the [[ice shelf|ice shelves]], waters, and [[island]] territories in the [[Southern Ocean]] situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]].<ref>[http://www.scar.org/ Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]</ref>  The region covers some 20% of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], of which 5.5% (14 million km<sup>2</sup>) is the surface area of the continent itself.

== Geography ==
The maritime part of the region constitutes the area of application of the international [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), where for technical reasons the Convention uses an approximation of the Convergence line by means of a line joining specified points along [[Circle of latitude|parallels of latitude]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians of longitude]].<ref>[http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/e/e_pubs/bd/pt1.pdf Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]</ref>  The implementation of the Convention is managed through an international Commission headquartered in [[Hobart]], Australia, by an efficient system of annual [[fishing]] quotas, licenses and international inspectors on the fishing vessels, as well as [[satellite]] surveillance.

Most of the Antarctic region is situated south of 60°S latitude parallel, and is governed in accordance with the international legal regime of the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].<ref>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/anttrty.jsp Antarctic Treaty]</ref>  The Treaty area covers the continent itself and its immediately adjacent islands, as well as the [[archipelago]]s of the [[South Orkney Islands]], [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Peter I Island|Peter&nbsp;I Island]], [[Scott Island]] and [[Balleny Islands]].

The islands situated between 60°S latitude parallel to the south and the [[Antarctic Convergence]] to the north, and their respective {{convert|200|nmi|km|adj=on}} [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]s fall under the national jurisdiction of the countries that possess them: [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (United Kingdom; also an [[European Union|EU]] [[Overseas Countries and Territories#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas territory]]), [[Bouvet Island]] (Norway), and [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard and McDonald Islands]] (Australia).  

[[Kerguelen Islands]] (France; also an EU Overseas territory) are situated in the Antarctic Convergence area, while the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Hornos Island]] with [[Cape Horn]], [[Diego Ramírez Islands]], [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]], [[Macquarie Island]], [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] and [[Île Saint-Paul|Saint Paul]] Islands, [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], and [[Gough Island]] and [[Tristan da Cunha|Tristan da Cunha group]] remain north of the Convergence and thus outside the Antarctic region.

== Wildlife ==
A variety of animals live in Antarctica for at least some of the year, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/index.php|title=Antarctic Wildlife|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council - British Antarctic Survey|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Education/Kids/Read-it/Polar-eyes/About-Antarctica/Antarctic-wildlife.aspx|title=Antarctic wildlife|publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|author=Vanessa Woods|date=2011-10-14|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref>
* [[Pinniped|Seals]]
* [[Penguin]]
* [[South Georgia Pipit]]s
* [[Albatross]]es
* [[Antarctic Petrel]]s
* [[Whale]]s
* Fish, such as [[Antarctic icefish]], [[Antarctic Toothfish]]
* [[Squid]], including the [[colossal squid]]
* [[Antarctic krill]]

Most of the Antarctic continent is permanently covered by ice and snow; less than 1% of the land is exposed. There are only two species of flowering plant, [[Antarctic hair grass]] and [[Antarctic pearlwort]], but a range of [[moss]]es, [[liverwort]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[macrofungi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|title=Plants of Antarctica|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council - British Antarctic Survey|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref>

== Society ==
The first Antarctic land discovered was the island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia]], visited by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] merchant [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675. Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent of [[Antarctica]] is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]''. The first human born in the Antarctic was [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]] born on 8 October 1913 in [[Grytviken]], South Georgia.  

The Antarctic region had no [[indigenous population]] when first discovered, and its present inhabitants comprise a few thousand transient [[science|scientific]] and other personnel working on tours of duty at the several dozen [[List of research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] maintained by various countries.  However, the region is visited by more than 40,000<ref>[http://image.zenn.net/REPLACE/CLIENT/1000037/1000116/application/pdf/touristsbynationality_total2.pdf IAATO tourist statistics 2007/08]</ref> tourists annually, the most popular destinations being the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] area (especially the [[South Shetland Islands]]) and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#Geography|South Georgia Island]].

In December 2009, the growth of [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], with consequences for both the ecology and the safety of the travellers in its great and remote wilderness, was noted at a conference in New Zealand by experts from signatories to the [[Antarctic Treaty]]. The definitive results of the conference would be presented at the Antarctic Treaty states' meeting in Uruguay in May 2010.<ref>[http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/5976 Antarctic Nations Considering New Controls On Ships Amid Tourism Explosion.] Ray Lilley, The Associated Press, December 8, 2009.</ref>

== Conservation ==
The Antarctic hosts the world largest [[protected area]] comprising 1.07 million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protection Area created in 2012.<ref>[http://www.sgisland.gs/download/MPA/MPA%20Plan%20v1.01%20Feb%2027_12.pdf SGSSI Marine Protection Area (Management Plan).]</ref><ref>[http://www.goodplanet.info/eng/Zones/Etat-du-monde/Pays2/Danemark2 Good Planet: Denmark.] Largest protected area in the world.</ref>

== Time zones ==
{{main|Time in Antarctica}}
Because Antarctica surrounds the South Pole, it is theoretically located in all [[time zone]]s. For practical purposes, time zones are usually based on [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|territorial claims]] or the time zone of a station's owner country or supply base.
