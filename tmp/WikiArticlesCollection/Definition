[[File:Blacks-Law-Dictionary.jpg|thumb|right|340px|A definition attempts to explain a word using other words. This is sometimes challenging. Common dictionaries contain lexical, descriptive definitions, but there are various types of definition - all with different purposes and focuses.]]

A '''definition''' is a statement that explains the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a term (a [[word]], [[phrase]], or other set of [[symbol]]s).<ref> Depending on the domain of discourse, for example in a translation or a review, a definition serves to set the scene. In mathematics, a definition serves to sharpen, clarify, or point out the objects of discourse. </ref> The term to be defined is the ''[[wikt:definiendum|definiendum]]''. The term may have many different senses and multiple meanings. For each meaning, a ''[[wikt:definiens|definiens]]'' is a cluster of words that defines that term (and clarifies the speaker's intention). As an example: To successfully define the word "Vegan", the definiendum (the word "Vegan" itself) must be given a definiens (actually vegan has at least two definiens: One is "someone who avoids using animal products", and another definiens is "someone from a place called [[Vega, Norway]]").

A definition will vary in aspects like precision or popularity (e.g. globally, the word "[[Vegan]]" rarely refers to the definiens "someone from [[Vega, Norway]]"). There are also different types of definitions with different purposes and focuses (e.g. intensional, extensional, descriptive, [[Stipulative definition|stipulative]], and so on). 

A chief difficulty in the management of  definitions is the necessity of using other terms that are already understood or whose definitions are easily obtainable or demonstrable (e.g. a need, sometimes, for ostensive definitions).

A [[dictionary definition]] typically contains additional details about a word, such as an [[etymology]] and the language or languages of its origin, or obsolete meanings. 

==Basic considerations==
In formal languages like mathematics, a "stipulative" definition guides a specific discussion. A stipulative definition can only be disproved by showing a logical  contradiction.<ref>http://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/swartz/definitions.htm#part5.1</ref> A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition. On the other hand, a "descriptive" definition can be shown to be "right" or "wrong" with reference to general usage.

A ''[[precising definition]]'' extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) of a term for a specific purpose by including additional criteria, which narrow the set of things that meet the definition.

[[Charles Stevenson|C.L. Stevenson]] has identified ''[[persuasive definition]]'' as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the "true" or "commonly accepted" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are "legal" or "coercive" — their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.<ref>Stevenson, C.L., ''Ethics and Language'', Connecticut 1944</ref>

==Intension and extension==
{{Main|Intension|Extension (semantics)}}

An ''[[intensional definition]]'', also called a ''coactive'' definition, specifies the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for a thing being a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by [[Genus-differentia definition|genus and differentia]], is an intensional definition.

An ''[[extensional definition]]'', also called a ''denotative'' definition, of a concept or term specifies its ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. It is a list naming every [[object (philosophy)|object]] that is a member of a specific [[Set (mathematics)|set]].

Thus, the "[[seven deadly sins]]" can be defined ''intensionally'' as those singled out by [[Pope Gregory I]] as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An ''extensional'' definition would be a list of the seven. In contrast, while an intensional definition of "[[Prime Minister]]" might be "the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of government in a parliamentary system", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who future prime ministers will be.

One important form of the extensional definition is ''[[ostensive definition]]''. This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. So you can explain who ''Alice'' (an individual) is by pointing her out to me; or what a ''rabbit'' (a class) is by pointing at several and expecting me to 'catch on'. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].<ref>''Philosophical investigations'', Part 1 §27-34</ref>

An ''[[enumerative definition]]'' of a concept or term is an ''[[extensional definition]]'' that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that fall under the concept or term in question.  Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===''Divisio'' and ''partitio''===
''Divisio'' and ''partitio'' are [[Classics|classical]] terms for definitions. A ''partitio'' is simply an intensional definition. A ''divisio'' is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of [[subset]]s of a set, in the sense that every member of the "divided" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of ''divisio'' lists all sets whose only member is a member of the "divided" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list ''members'', and not sets.<ref>Katerina Ierodiakonou, "The Stoic Division of Philosophy", in ''Phronesis: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy'', Volume 38, Number 1, 1993 , pp. 57-74.</ref>

==Definition by genus and differentia==
{{Main|Genus–differentia definition}}
A '''genus–differentia definition''' is a type of [[intensional definition]], and it is composed by two parts:

# '''a [[genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the differentia''': The portion of the new definition that is not provided by the genera.
For example, consider these two definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.
Those definitions can be expressed as a genus and 2 '''differentiae''':
# ''a genus'': A plane figure.
# ''2 differentiae'':
#* ''the differentia for a triangle'': that has 3 straight bounding sides.
#* ''the differentia for a quadrilateral'': that has 4 straight bounding sides.

When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. For instance, given the following:
* ''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.
* ''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
both of these definitions of 'square' are equally acceptable:
* ''a square'': a rectangle that is a rhombus.
* ''a square'': a rhombus that is a rectangle.
Thus, a 'square' is a member of both the genus 'rectangle' and the genus 'rhombus'. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):
* ''a square'': a rectangle and a rhombus.
or completely equivalently:
* ''a square'': a rhombus and a rectangle.

===Rules for definition by genus and differentia===
{{Main|Fallacies of definition}}

Certain rules have traditionally been given for this particular type of definition.<ref>Copi 1982 pp 165-169</ref><ref name="Joyce, Ch. X">Joyce, Ch. X</ref><ref>Joseph, Ch. V</ref>
#A definition must set out the essential attributes of the thing defined.
#Definitions should avoid circularity.  To define a horse as 'a member of the species ''equus''' would convey no information whatsoever.  For this reason, Locking{{specify|date=November 2010}} adds that a definition of a term must not consist of terms which are synonymous with it.  This would be a circular definition, a ''circulus in definiendo''.  Note, however, that it is acceptable to define two relative terms in respect of each other.  Clearly, we cannot define 'antecedent' without using the term 'consequent', nor conversely.
#The definition must not be too wide or too narrow.  It must be applicable to everything to which the defined term applies (i.e. not miss anything out), and to nothing else (i.e. not include any things to which the defined term would not truly apply).
#The definition must not be obscure.  The purpose of a definition is to explain the meaning of a term which may be obscure or difficult, by the use of terms that are commonly understood and whose meaning is clear.  The violation of this rule is known by the Latin term ''obscurum per obscurius''.  However, sometimes scientific and philosophical terms are difficult to define without obscurity. (See the definition of [[Free will]] in Wikipedia, for instance).
#A definition should not be negative where it can be positive.  We should not define 'wisdom' as the absence of folly, or a healthy thing as whatever is not sick.  Sometimes this is unavoidable, however.  We cannot define a point except as 'something with no parts', nor blindness except as 'the absence of sight in a creature that is normally sighted'.

===Essence===
{{Main|Essence}}

In classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. [[Aristotle]] had it that an object's essential attributes form its "essential nature", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.<ref>[[Posterior Analytics]], Bk 1 c. 4</ref>

The idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' essence, originating with Aristotle. In a passage from the [[Posterior Analytics]],<ref>[[Posterior Analytics]] Bk 2 c. 7</ref> he says that we can know the meaning of a made-up name (he gives the example 'goat stag'), without knowing what he calls the 'essential nature' of the thing that the name would denote, if there were such a thing.  This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the ''quid nominis'' or 'whatness of the name', and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the ''quid rei'' or 'whatness of the thing'. (Early modern philosophers like Locke used the corresponding English terms 'nominal essence' and 'real essence'). The name '[[hobbit]]', for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a ''quid nominis''. But we could not know the real nature of hobbits, even if there were such things, and so we cannot know the real nature or ''quid rei'' of hobbits. By contrast, the name 'man' denotes real things (men) that have a certain ''quid rei''. The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that thing must have in order that the name apply to it.

This leads to a corresponding distinction between ''nominal'' and ''real'' definition. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means, i.e. which says what the 'nominal essence' is, and is definition in the classical sense as given above.  A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or ''quid rei'' of the thing.

This preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. [[Analytic philosophy]] in particular is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] described it as "a hopelessly muddle-headed notion".<ref>''A history of Western Philosophy'', p. 210</ref> 

More recently [[Kripke semantics|Kripke's]] formalisation of [[possible world]] semantics in [[modal logic]] led to a new approach to [[essentialism]]. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are ''necessary'' to it, they are those things it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as [[rigid designator]]s.

==Recursive definitions==
A [[recursive definition]], sometimes also called an ''inductive'' definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way.  Normally this consists of three steps:
# At least one thing is stated to be a member of the set being defined; this is sometimes called a "base set".
# All things bearing a certain relation to other members of the set are also to count as members of the set. It is this step that makes the definition [[Recursion|recursive]].
# All other things are excluded from the set

For instance, we could define [[natural number]] as follows (after [[Peano axioms|Peano]]): 
# "0" is a natural number.
# Each natural number has a unique successor, such that:
#* the successor of a natural number is also a natural number;
#* distinct natural numbers have distinct successors;
#* no natural number is succeeded by "0".
# Nothing else is a natural number.

So "0" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience we can call "1". In turn, "1" will have exactly one successor, which we would call "2", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves [[self-reference]]. Although this sort of definition involves a form of [[Circular definition|circularity]], it is not [[Vicious circle principle|vicious]], and the definition has been quite successful.

==Working definitions==
A working definition is chosen for an occasion and may not fully conform with established or authoritative definitions. Not knowing of established definitions would be grounds for selecting or devising a working definition. Or it refers to a definition being developed; a tentative definition that can be tailored to create an authoritative definition.

==Limitations of definition==
Given that a [[natural language]] such as [[English language|English]] contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon [[primitive notion]]s. If every term of every ''definiens'' must itself be defined, "where at last should we stop?"<ref>Locke, ''Essay'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=0OoNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA33&dq=%22where+at+last+should+we+stop%22+inauthor:locke&lr=&as_brr=0 Bk. III, Ch. iv, 5]</ref><ref>This problem parallels the [[diallelus]], but leads to scepticism about meaning rather than knowledge.</ref> A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of [[lexical definition]]s, must resort to [[Symbol grounding|circularity]].<ref>Generally [[Lexicography|lexicographers]] seek to avoid circularity wherever possible, but the definitions of words such as "the" and "a" use those words and are therefore circular. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/the] [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/a] Lexicographer [[Sidney I. Landau]]'s essay "''Sexual Intercourse in American College Dictionaries''" provides other examples of circularity in dictionary definitions. (McKean, p. 73-77)</ref><ref>An exercise suggested by [[J. L. Austin]] involved taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. Then, iterating this process until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a "family circle" of words relating to the key concept.<br>(''[http://www.ditext.com/austin/plea.html A plea for excuses]'' in Philosophical Papers. Ed. [[J. O. Urmson]] and [[Geoffrey Warnock|G. J. Warnock]]. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1961. 1979.)</ref><ref>In the game of [[Vish (game)|Vish]], players compete to find circularity in a dictionary.</ref>

Many philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] claimed that the highest genera (the so-called ten ''generalissima'') cannot be defined, since we cannot assign any higher genus under which they may fall.  Thus we cannot define [[being]], unity and similar concepts.<ref name="Joyce, Ch. X" /> [[John Locke|Locke]] supposes in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''<ref>Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iv</ref> that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition.  More recently [[Bertrand Russell]] sought to develop a formal language based on [[Logical atomism|logical atoms]]. Other philosophers, notably [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' that what counts as a "simple" in one circumstance might not do so in another.<ref>See especially ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' Part 1 §48</ref> He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: "As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one",<ref>He continues: "Whereas an explanation may indeed rest on another one that has been given, but none stands in need of another - unless ''we'' require it to prevent a misunderstanding. One might say: an explanation serves to remove or to avert a misunderstanding - one, that is, that would occur but for the explanation; not every one I can imagine." [[Philosophical Investigations]], Part 1 §87, italics in original</ref> claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed when we need to avoid misunderstanding.

Locke and [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] also argued that we cannot define [[Principle of individuation|individuals]].  We learn names by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used.<ref>This theory of meaning is one of the targets of the [[private language argument]]</ref>  This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has "fallen under our notice".<ref>Locke, ''Essay'', Bk. III, Ch. iii, 3</ref>  Russell offered his [[theory of descriptions]] in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a [[definite description]] that "picks out" exactly one individual. [[Saul Kripke]] pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to [[modal logic|modality]], in his book ''Naming and Necessity''.

There is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the ''definiens'' can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case.<ref>''Philosophical Investigations</ref> The examples he used include ''game'', ''number'' and ''family''. In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a [[family resemblance]]. For terms such as these it is notat possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the ''use'' of the term. i need to be learn always mathe as coordinat geometry•

==In medicine==
In [[medical dictionaries]], definitions should to the greatest extent possible be:
*simple and easy to understand,<ref name=McPherson1998>{{cite pmid|9714637}}</ref> preferably even by the general public;<ref name=Morse1992>{{cite doi|10.1001/jama.1992.03490080086030|noedit}}</ref>
*useful clinically<ref name=Morse1992/> or in related areas where the definition will be used;<ref name=McPherson1998/>
*specific,<ref name=McPherson1998/> that is, by reading the definition only, it should ideally not be possible to refer to any other entity than the definiendum;
*measurable;<ref name=McPherson1998/>
*reflecting current scientific knowledge.<ref name=McPherson1998/><ref name=Morse1992/>
