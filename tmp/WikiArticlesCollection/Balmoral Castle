'''Balmoral Castle''' {{IPAc-en|b|æ|l|ˈ|m|ɒr|əl}} is a large [[estate house]] in [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire#Royal Deeside|Royal Deeside]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland. It is located near the village of [[Crathie]], {{convert|6.2|mi}} west of [[Ballater]] and {{convert|6.8|mi}} east of [[Braemar]]. Balmoral has been one of the [[List of British royal residences|residences]] of the [[British Royal Family]] since 1852, when it was purchased by [[Queen Victoria]] and her [[Prince Consort|consort]], [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. It remains the private property of the monarch, and is not part of the [[Crown Estate]]. 

Balmoral Estate was acquired under Prince Albert's name not Queen Victoria's. Had the Queen purchased it the estate's revenues would have been required to go to Parliament and the public purse in accord with the 1760 Civil List Act. Furthermore the estate is not owned by the monarch but rather by Trustees under Deeds of Nomination and Appointment. These are technicalities, perhaps, but very important ones in regards to land ownership and liabilities. <ref name=Wightman>{{cite book|last=Wightman|first=Andy|title=The Poor Had No Lawyers|year=2011|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|page=113}}</ref> 

Soon after the estate was purchased the existing house was found to be too small. It was demolished, and the current Balmoral Castle was completed in 1856. The architect was [[William Smith (architect)|William Smith]] of Aberdeen, although his designs were amended by Prince Albert. The castle is an example of [[Scots Baronial]] architecture, and is classified by [[Historic Scotland]] as a [[category A listed]] building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=51460 |title=Balmoral Castle: Listed Building Report |publisher=[[Historic Scotland]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

The Balmoral [[Estate (land)|Estate]] has been added to by successive members of the Royal Family, and now covers an area of about {{convert|49000|acre|ha}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/ |title=Welcome to Balmoral |publisher=Balmoral Estates |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> It is a working estate, including [[Red Grouse|grouse moors]], forestry, and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer, [[Highland cattle]], and ponies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/estate.htm |title=Balmoral Estate |publisher=Balmoral Estates |accessdate=23 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref>

==History==
[[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] of Scotland (1316–1390) had a [[hunting|hunting lodge]] in the area. A house at Balmoral was built by Sir William Drummond in 1390.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whichcastle.com/aberdeenshire/balmoralcastle.htm |title=Balmoral Castle, Aberdeenshire |publisher=www.whichcastle.com |date= |accessdate=4 December 2010}}</ref> The estate is recorded in 1451 as "Bouchmorale", and was later tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the [[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly|1st Earl of Huntly]]. A [[tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]] was built on the estate by the Gordons.<ref name=garden>{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/heritage/gardens/gardenssearchmoreinfo.htm?s=balmoral&r=&bool=0&PageID=2252&more_info=Site |title=Balmoral Castle: Site History |work=An Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=23 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> In 1662 the estate passed to Charles Farquharson of [[Inverey]], brother of [[John Farquharson, 3rd of Inverey|John Farquharson]], the "Black Colonel". The Farquharsons were [[jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathisers, and James Farquharson of Balmoral was involved in both the 1715 and 1745 [[Jacobite risings|rebellions]], and was wounded at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1746)|Battle of Falkirk]] in 1746. His estates were [[wikt:forfeit|forfeit]], and passed to the Farquharsons of [[Braemar|Auchendryne]].<ref name=gordon>{{cite book |author=[[Seton Gordon|Gordon, Seton]] |title=Seton Gordon's Cairngorms : an anthology |publisher=Whittles |year=2009 |chapter=The Country of Balmoral |pages=141–142 |isbn=978-1-904445-88-3}}</ref> In 1798, [[James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife]], acquired Balmoral, and leased the castle. Sir Robert Gordon, a younger son of the [[George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen|3rd Earl of Aberdeen]], acquired the lease in 1830 and made major alterations to the castle, with baronial-style extensions designed by [[John Smith (architect)|John Smith]] of Aberdeen.<ref name=garden/>

===Royal acquisition===

[[File:balmoral by queen.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Balmoral Castle, painted by Queen Victoria in 1854 during its construction]]

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland in 1842, five years after her accession and two years after their marriage. They stayed at [[Edinburgh]], and at [[Taymouth Castle]] in [[Perthshire]], the home of the [[John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane|Marquess of Breadalbane]].<ref name=garden/> They returned in 1844 to stay at [[Blair Castle]], and in 1847 when they rented Ardverikie by [[Loch Laggan]].<ref>Millar, pp.23,31</ref> The latter trip was extremely rainy, which led [[James Clark (physician)|Sir James Clark]], the Queen's physician, to recommend [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Deeside]] for its more healthy climate.<ref>Millar, p.39</ref>

Sir Robert Gordon died in 1847, and the lease on Balmoral reverted to Lord Aberdeen. In February 1848 it was decided that Prince Albert would acquire the remaining part of the lease on Balmoral, together with its furniture and staff, and the couple arrived for their first visit on 8 September 1848.<ref>Millar, pp.40–41</ref> Victoria found the house "small but pretty",<ref>Millar, p.41</ref> and recorded in her diary that: "All seemed to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils".<ref name=gordon/>

The house was quickly found to be too small, and John and William Smith were commissioned in 1848 to design new offices, cottages and other ancillary buildings.<ref name=millar55/> Improvements to the woodlands, gardens and estate buildings were also being made, assisted by the landscape gardener James Beattie and the painter [[james Giles (painter)|James Giles]].<ref name=garden/> After seeing a [[corrugated iron]] cottage at the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], Prince Albert ordered a pre-fabricated iron building for Balmoral from E. T. Bellhouse & Co., to serve as a temporary ballroom and dining room.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/bellhouse/chapter4.pdf |title=E.T. Bellhouse and Co. Engineers and Iron Founders |work=David Bellhouse and Sons, Manchester |author=Bellhouse, David |year=2000 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> It was in use by 1 October 1851, and served as a ballroom until completion of the new ballroom in 1856.<ref name="Millar, p.59">Millar, p.59</ref> Major additions to the old house were considered in 1849,<ref name=millar55>Millar, p.55</ref> but by then negotiations were under way to purchase the estate from the trustees of the deceased Earl Fife. The sale was completed in November 1851, the price being £32,000, and Prince Albert formally took possession the following autumn.<ref name=garden/><ref name=millar56>Millar, p.56</ref> The neighbouring estate of [[Birkhall]] was bought at the same time, and the lease on [[Abergeldie Castle|Abergeldie]] secured.

===Construction of the new house===
The programme of improvement culminated during early 1852 with the decision to commission a new, larger house, from William Smith.<ref name=millar56/> The son of John Smith, designer of the earlier castle, William Smith was City Architect of [[Aberdeen]] from 1852. On learning of the commission, [[William Burn]] sought an interview with the Prince, apparently to complain that Smith had plagiarised his work in the past. However, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201859 |title=William Smith II |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects 1840–1980 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> William Smith's designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows.<ref>Millar, p.57</ref> Construction began during summer 1853, on a site some {{convert|100|yd}} north-west of the original building, which was considered to have a better outlook.<ref>Millar, pp.56–57</ref> Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 28 September 1853, during the annual autumn visit.<ref>Millar, p.58</ref> By the autumn of 1855, the royal apartments were ready, though the tower was still under construction and the servants had to be lodged in the old house.<ref name="Millar, p.59"/> The new house was completed in 1856, and the old castle was subsequently demolished.<ref name=garden/>

Balmoral Castle is built from [[granite]] quarried at Invergelder on the estate,<ref>{{cite book |title=Scotland's Gardens |author=Little, G. A. |publisher=Spur Books |year=1981 |isbn=0-7157-2091-0}}</ref> and comprises two main blocks, each arranged around a courtyard. The south-western block contains the main rooms, while the north-eastern contains the service wings. At the south-east is an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} tall clock tower topped with turrets,<ref name=glendinning/> one of which has a balustrade similar to a feature at [[Castle Fraser]].<ref name=fenwick>{{cite book |author=Fenwick, Hubert |title=Scotland's Historic Buildings |isbn=0-7091-4497-0 |publisher=Robert Hale |year=1974}}</ref> The architecture of the new house is considered to be somewhat dated for its time, being similar in style to the demolished castle of the 1830s, in contrast to the richer forms of [[Scots Baronial]] being developed by William Burn and others during the 1850s.<ref name=glendinning>{{cite book |author=Glendinning, Miles |author2=MacKechnie, Aonghus |author3=MacInnes, Ranald |title=A History of Scottish Architecture |page=270 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=0-7486-0849-4 |year=1996}}</ref> As an exercise in Scots Baronial, it is sometimes described as being too ordered, pedantic, and even [[Architecture of Germany|Germanic]], as a result of Prince Albert's influence on the design.<ref name=fenwick/> However, the purchase of a Scottish estate by Victoria and Albert, and their adoption of Scottish architectural style, was very influential for the ongoing revival of [[Highland culture]]. The royals decorated Balmoral with tartans and attended [[highland games]] at Braemar; Queen Victoria expressed an affinity for Scotland, even professing herself to be a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Devine, T.M. |title=The Scottish Nation 1700–2000 |publisher=Penguin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-14-102769-2}}</ref> Added to the work of [[Sir Walter Scott]], this was a major factor in promoting the adoption of [[Highland culture]] by [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland Scots]]. Historian Michael Lynch comments that "the Scottishness of Balmoral helped to give the monarchy a truly British dimension for the first time".<ref>{{cite book |author=Lynch, Michael |work=Scotland: A New History |publisher=Pimlico |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-7126-9893-1}}</ref>

===Victoria and Albert at Balmoral===
[[File:BalmoralCastle1900.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Balmoral, c.1890–1900]]
Even before the completion of the new house, the pattern of the royal couple's life in the Highlands was soon established. Albert spent many days shooting deer and game, while Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily. In 1849 the diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] described their life at Balmoral as like that of gentry rather than royalty.<ref>Millar, p.44</ref> Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings and its staff. Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including [[Edwin Landseer|Edwin]] and [[Charles Landseer]], [[Carl Haag]], [[William Wyld]], [[William Henry Fisk]], and many others.<ref>Millar, ''passim''</ref> The couple took great interest in their staff, and set up a lending library. During the 1850s, new plantations were established around the house, and exotic conifers were planted in the grounds. Prince Albert had an active role in these improvements, overseeing the design of [[parterre]]s, the diversion the main road north of the river via a new bridge, and plans for farm buildings.<ref name=garden/> These included a [[model farm|model dairy]] which he developed during 1861, the year of his death. It was completed by Victoria, who subsequently built several monuments to her husband on the estate. These included an obelisk, and a large statue of Albert by [[William Theed]], inaugurated in 1867.<ref>Millar, p.102</ref>

After Albert's death, Victoria spent increasing periods at Balmoral, staying up to four months a year during early summer and autumn. Few further changes were made to the grounds, with the exception of the monuments and cottages built during the remainder of the 19th century.<ref name=garden/> It was during this period that Victoria began to depend on her servant [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]], a local [[ghillie]] from Crathie who became one of her closest companions during her long mourning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Balmoral Castle was the birthplace of [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria Eugenie of Spain]], a granddaughter of Queen Victoria.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In September 1896, Victoria welcomed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] to Balmoral. Four years later Victoria made her last visit, three months before her death on 22 January 1901.

===After Victoria===
[[File:EdwardVII at Balmoral.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Edward VII]] relaxing at Balmoral Castle, photographed by his wife, Alexandra]]
After Victoria's death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits. [[George V]] had substantial improvements done during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle.<ref name=garden/>

Balmoral is a private property and, unlike the monarch's [[official residence]]s, is not the property of [[the Crown]]. Ownership of Balmoral, along with [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk, was inherited by [[Edward VIII]] on his accession in 1936. However, when he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] later the same year, he retained ownership. A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham were purchased by Edward's brother and successor to the Crown, [[George VI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/SandringhamHouse/History.aspx |title=Sandringham House: History |work=The official website of The British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

Since the 1950s, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] has also added herbaceous borders and a water garden. During the 1980s new staff buildings were built close to the castle.<ref name=garden/>

==The estate==
[[File:The Balmoral Castle, Scotland.jpg|thumb|North-west corner of Balmoral Castle]]

Balmoral Estate is within the [[Cairngorms National Park]], and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar [[National Scenic Area (Scotland)|National Scenic Area]].<ref name=cons>{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/conservation.htm |title=Conservation |publisher=Balmoral Estates |accessdate=23 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> The {{convert|49000|acre|adj=on}} estate contains a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee Valley]] to open mountains. There are seven [[Munro]]s (hills in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft}}) in the estate, the highest being [[Lochnagar]] at {{convert|3789|ft}}. The mountain was the setting for a children's story, ''[[The Old Man of Lochnagar]]'', told originally by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] to his younger brothers, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]], and published in 1980 with royalties accruing to [[The Prince's Trust]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?category=292&object=1101076&row=94&detail=about |title=The Old Man of Lochnagar, 1980 |publisher=The Royal Collection |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

The areas of Lochnagar and Ballochbuie were designated in 1998 by the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] as [[Special Protection Areas]] (SPA) under the European Union (EU) [[Birds Directive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/SPA/UK9002281.pdf |title=Lochnagar SPA: Standard Data Form |publisher=[[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/SPA/UK9002781.pdf |title=Ballolchbuie SPA: Standard Data Form |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee}}</ref> Ballochbuie is also protected as a [[Special Area of Conservation]] by the EU [[Habitats Directive]], as "one of the largest remaining continuous areas of native [[Caledonian Forest]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0030030 |title=Ballolchbuie SAC: Site Details |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee}}</ref> In addition, there are four [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] on the estate.<ref name=cons/>

In 1931, the castle gardens were first opened to the public, and are now open daily between April and the end of July, after which the Queen arrives for her annual stay.<ref name=mail>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-357891/Castle-siege-tourists-keeps-Queen-bay.html |title=Castle siege by tourists keeps Queen at bay |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=2 August 2005}}</ref> The ballroom is the only room in the castle which can be viewed by the public.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/admissions.htm |title=2011 Admission Charges |publisher=Balmoral Estate |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

The Royal Family employs about 50 full-time and 50–100 part-time staff to maintain the working estate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/employment.htm |title=Employment |publisher=Balmoral Estates |accessdate=23 January 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> A [[Single malt whisky|malt whisky]] distillery located on the Balmoral Estate produces the [[Royal Lochnagar Single Malt]] whisky.

Other properties on the estate include [[Birkhall]], formerly home to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother]], and used now by Prince Charles and the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]] for their summer holidays.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/residences/birkhall/ |title=Birkhall |work=The Prince of Wales official website |publisher=Household of HRH The Prince of Wales |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> Craigowan Lodge is used regularly by the Queen's friends and family, and has also been used by the Queen while Balmoral Castle is being prepared.<ref name=mail/> Six smaller properties on the estate are let as [[holiday cottage]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/availability.htm |title=Current Availability |publisher=Balmoral Estates |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

===Craigowan Lodge===

'''Craigowan Lodge''' is a seven-bedroom stone house about a mile from the main castle in Balmoral.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.streetvi.com/en/map/gb/419235-Craigowan-Lodge/#/point/57.040842/-3.238704/0/0/0/ |title=Panorama of Lodge }}</ref>

It is more rustic than the castle, and was often the home of Charles and Diana when they visited. Now it is usually a home for very important guests.

In the obituary of [[Prince Michael Andreevich of Russia|Michael Andreevich Romanoff]], the highest-ranking member of the Russian imperial family at the time of his death in 2008, it was noted that his family spent most of World War II at Craigowan Lodge.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4922121.ece |title=Michael Andreevich Romanoff: member of the Russian imperial family | location=London | work=The Times |date=11 October 2008}}</ref>

The Lodge has been in the news periodically since 2005, because the Queen often spends the first few days of her summer holiday in the lodge. Each weekend in the summer the castle is a lucrative source of income from visiting tourists, and the Queen sometimes arrives at Balmoral before the tourist visiting season is over.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-357891/Castle-siege-tourists-keeps-Queen-bay.html |title=Castle siege by tourists keeps Queen at bay | location=London | work=Daily Mail |first=Jonathan |last=Brocklebank |date=2 August 2005}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
The Queen was in residence at Balmoral at the time of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997. Her private discussions with Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] were dramatised in [[Stephen Frears]]' film ''[[The Queen (film)|The Queen]]'' (2006). The 1997 film ''[[Mrs. Brown (film)|Mrs. Brown]]'' was also based on events at Balmoral, although in both films substitute locations were used: [[Blairquhan Castle]] in ''The Queen''; and [[Duns Castle]] in ''Mrs Brown''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436697/locations |title=Filming locations for ''The Queen'' |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119280/locations |title=Filming locations for ''Mrs Brown'' |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>

==Banknotes==
Since 1987 an illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|£100 notes]] issued by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]].<ref name="scotbanks">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_royal_bank_of_scotland.php|title=Current Banknotes : Royal Bank of Scotland|publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers|accessdate=17 October 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081003071445/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_royal_bank_of_scotland.php| archivedate= 3 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
