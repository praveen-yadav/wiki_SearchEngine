Known as "the Natural State", the diverse regions of Arkansas offer residents and tourists a variety of opportunities for outdoor recreation.

Arkansas is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|29th largest in square miles]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|32nd most populous]] of the [[50 United States]]. The capital and most populous city is [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], located in the central portion of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, including the [[Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area]] and [[Fort Smith metropolitan area]], is also an important population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the eastern part of the state is [[Jonesboro]]. 

The [[Territory of Arkansas]] was [[admitted to the Union]] as the 25th state on June 15, 1836.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Cash |first= Marie |title= Arkansas Achieves Statehood |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 2 | date= December 1943 }}</ref> Arkansas withdrew from the United States and joined the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Upon returning to the Union, the state would continue to suffer due to its earlier reliance on [[slavery]] and the [[plantation economy]], causing the state to fall behind economically and socially. [[White American|White]] rural interests continued to dominate the state's politics until [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|the Civil Rights movement]] in the mid-20th century. Arkansas began to diversify its economy following [[World War II]] and now relies on its service industry as well as aircraft, poultry, steel and tourism in addition to cotton and rice. 

The [[culture of Arkansas]] is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants and athletic venues across the state.  Despite a plethora of cultural, economic, and recreational opportunities, Arkansas is often stereotyped as a "poor, banjo-picking hillbilly" state, a reputation dating back to early accounts of the territory by frontiersmen in the early 1800s.  Arkansas's enduring image has earned the state "a special place in the American consciousness"{{Sfn | Blevins | 2009 | p = 4}}, but it has in reality produced such prominent figures as [[William Fulbright]], [[Bill Clinton]], [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Sam Walton]]<ref>{{cite web |last= Parker |first= Suzy |title= Arkansas's hillbilly image persists into 21st century |location= Little Rock, AR |date= September 25, 2011 |publisher = Reuters }}</ref>and [[Johnny Cash]].<ref>Cash, Johnny and Carr, Patrick  (1997) ''Johnny Cash the Autobiography'', Harper Collins.

==Etymology==
The name Arkansas derives from the same root as the name for the [[state of Kansas]]. The [[Kaw (tribe)|Kansa]] tribe of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] are closely associated with the [[Sioux]] tribes of the [[Great Plains]].  The word “Arkansas” itself is a French pronunciation (“Arcansas”) of a [[Quapaw]] (a related “Kaw” tribe) word, ''akakaze'', meaning “land of downriver people” or the [[Sioux language|Sioux]] word ''akakaze'' meaning “people of the south wind”. The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881, after a dispute between two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en |ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}} {{respell|ar|KAN|zəs}} and the other wanted {{IPAc-en |ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}} {{respell |AR|kən-saw}}.{{Refn | name="Arkansas" | group = "lower-alpha" | The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ən|s|ɔː}}, {{IPAc-en|ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either "Arkansans" or "Arkansawyers". In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed the following concurrent resolution, now Arkansas Code 1 April 105:<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm | type = official text | title = Code | place = AR, [[United States of America|US]] | publisher = Assembly | issue = 1‐4‐105 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>
{{Quote |<p>Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.</p>
<p>And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.</p>
<p>Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final "s" silent, the "a" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of "a" in "man" and the sounding of the terminal "s" is discouraged by Arkansans.</p>}}
Citizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en |ɑr|ˈ|k|æ|n|z|ə|s|_|ˈ|r|ɪ|v|ər}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.}}

In 2007, the state legislature passed a non-binding resolution declaring the possessive form of the state's name to be ''Arkansas's'', which has been followed increasingly by the state government.<ref>{{cite web |last= Gambrell |first= John |url= http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2007/mar/13/senate-gives-support-possessive-form-arkansas/ |title= Senate gives support to possessive form of Arkansas |publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]] |date= March 13, 2007 |accessdate= June 28, 2012 }}</ref>

===Boundaries===
Arkansas borders [[Louisiana]] to the south, [[Texas]] to the southwest, [[Oklahoma]] to the west, [[Missouri]] to the north, and [[Tennessee]] and [[Mississippi]] on the east. The [[United States Census Bureau]] classifies Arkansas as a [[Southern United States|southern]] state, sub-categorized among the [[West South Central States]].<ref name="wsc" /> The [[Mississippi River]] forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in [[Clay County, Arkansas|Clay]] and [[Greene County, Arkansas|Greene]], counties where the [[St. Francis River]] forms the western boundary of the [[Missouri Bootheel]], and in many places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where its original legal designation. The state line along the Mississippi River is indeterminate along much of the eastern border with Mississippi due to these meanders.<ref>{{Cite map |publisher = DeLorme |title = Arkansas Atlas and Gazetteer |edition = Second }}</ref>

===Terrain===
Arkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest half and the lowlands of the southeastern half.<ref>Smith 1989, p. 15.</ref> The highlands are part of the Southern Interior Highlands, including [[The Ozarks]] and the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. The southern lowlands include the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] and the [[Arkansas Delta]].<ref>Smith 1989, pp. 15-17.</ref> This dual split is somewhat simplistic, however, and thus usually yields to general regions named northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, or central Arkansas. These directionally named regions are also not defined along county lines and are also broad. Arkansas has seven distinct natural regions: the Ozark Mountains, Ouachita Mountains, [[Arkansas River Valley]], Gulf Coastal Plain, [[Crowley's Ridge]], and the Arkansas Delta, with [[Central Arkansas]] sometimes included as a blend of multiple regions.<ref>{{cite web |title= Arkansas Regions |url= http://www.arkansasheritage.com/discover/natural_environments/regions.aspx |work= Discover Arkansas History |publisher= The Department of Arkansas Heritage |accessdate= June 28, 2012 }}</ref>

The southeastern part of Arkansas along the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] is sometimes called the Arkansas Delta. This region is a flat landscape of [[River delta|rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding]] of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas. The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as [[Crowley's Ridge]]. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from {{convert|250|to|500|ft|m}} above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.<ref>Smith 1989, p. 19.</ref>

Northwest Arkansas is part of the [[Ozark Plateau]] including the Ozark Mountains, to the south are the Ouachita Mountains, and these regions are divided by the [[Arkansas River]]; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands.<ref>Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 6.</ref> These mountain ranges are part of the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]] region, the only major mountainous region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= Ozark Mountains |publisher= Encyclopedia Britannica |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/437144/Ozark-Mountains |accessdate= January 2, 2013 }}</ref> The highest point in the state is [[Mount Magazine]] in the [[Ouachita Mountains]];<ref>{{cite web |title= Arkansas’s Highpoint Information |url= http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/!userfiles/pdfs/MM%20Highpoint%20bro%2005.pdf |format= PDF |publisher= [[Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism]] |accessdate= January 2, 2013 }}</ref> it rises to {{convert|2753|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name="sh" />

===Hydrology===
[[File:Buffalo National River.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Buffalo National River]], one of many attractions that give the state's nickname ''The Natural State''.]]
Arkansas has many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs within or along its borders. Major tributaries of the Mississippi River include the Arkansas River, [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]], and [[St. Francis River]].<ref name="Federal Writers 1987, p. 8">Federal Writers' Project 1987, p. 8.</ref> The Arkansas is fed by the [[Mulberry River (Arkansas)|Mulberry River]], and [[Fourche La Fave River|Fourche LaFave River]] in the Arkansas River Valley, which is also home to [[Lake Dardanelle]].

Arkansas is home to many [[List of caves in Arkansas|caves]], such as [[Blanchard Springs Caverns]]. More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters, have been cataloged by the State Archeologist.

===Climate===
[[File:Devil's Den bridge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Devil's Den State Park]] is a popular state park in [[Washington County, Arkansas|Washington County]] for enjoying autumn foliage.]]
Arkansas generally has  a [[humid subtropical climate]], which borders on [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the [[Gulf of Mexico]], Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas has hot, humid summers and cold, slightly drier winters. In [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], the daily high temperatures average around {{convert|93|°F|°C|abbr=on}} with lows around {{convert|73|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in July. In January highs average around {{convert|51|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and lows around {{convert|32|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. In [[Siloam Springs, Arkansas|Siloam Springs]] in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are {{convert|89|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|67|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and in January the average high and lows are {{convert|44|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and {{convert|23|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

Arkansas is known for extreme weather and many storms. A typical year will see thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf States]], Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. A few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a [[tropical cyclone|tropical system]] which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.

==History==
{{Main|History of Arkansas}}

===Early Arkansas through territorial period===
[[File:Chromesun toltec mounds photo01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tumulus|Burial mounds]], such as this one at [[Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park]] in northeast Arkansas, became more common during the [[Woodland Period]].]]
Prior to European settlement of North America, Arkansas was inhabited by the [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] people. Explorers to visit the state include [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, [[Jacques Marquette]] and [[Louis Jolliet]] in 1673, and [[Robert La Salle]] and [[Henri de Tonti]] in 1681.<ref>{{cite web |last= Sabo III |first= George |title= First Encounters, Hernando de Soto in the Mississippi Valley, 1541-42 |url=http://arkarcheology.uark.edu/indiansofarkansas/index.html?pageName=First%20Encounters |date= December 12, 2008 |accessdate= May 3, 2012 }}</ref><ref>Fletcher 1989, p. 26.</ref> Originally a Quapaw village, [[Arkansas Post National Memorial|Arkansas Post]] was the first European settlement upon its establishment by de Tonti in 1686, in the name of King [[Louis XIV of France]].<ref name="ce">Arnold 1992, p. 75.</ref> As Europeans settled the east coast, many other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes were relocated to Arkansas. Settlers, including fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century. These people used Arkansas Post as a home base and [[entrepôt]].<ref name="ce" /> During the colonial period, Arkansas changed hands between [[France]] and [[Spain]] following the [[Seven Years' War]], although neither showed interest in the remote settlement of Arkansas Post.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 82.</ref> In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the [[American Revolutionary War]], a brief [[Battle of Arkansas Post (American Revolutionary War)|siege]] of the post by British Captain [[James Colbert (Indian trader)|James Colbert]], with the assistance of [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Din |first= Gilbert C. |title= Arkansas Post in the American Revolution |work= The Arkansas Historical Quarterly |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association |date= Spring 1981 |volume= 40 |pages= 17–28 }}</ref> The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the [[Illinois language|Illinois]] tribe's name for the [[Quapaw]] people, who lived downriver from them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302b&L=ads-l&P=7800 |title=Linguist list 14.4 |publisher=Listserv.linguistlist.org |date=February 11, 2003 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Arkansas" group = "lower-alpha" />

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] to the United States in 1803, including all of Arkansas, in a transaction known today as the [[Louisiana Purchase]], although French soldiers remained at [[Arkansas Post National Memorial|Arkansas Post]].

===Statehood, Civil War and Reconstruction===
[[File:Lakeport Plantation, Lake Village, Chicot County, Arkansas.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lakeport Plantation]] south of [[Lake Village, Arkansas|Lake Village]] is the only remaining antebellum plantation house in Arkansas on the Mississippi River. Built ca. 1859, the [[cotton]] industry in southern Arkansas allowed many planters to rise to prominence.]]
When Arkansas applied for statehood, the slavery issue was again raised in [[Washington DC]]. Congress eventually approved the [[Arkansas Constitution]] after a 25 hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836 as the 25th state and the 13th [[slave state]], having a population of about 60,000.<ref>Scroggs 1961, p. 243.</ref> Arkansas immediately struggled with taxation to support its new state government, a problem made worse by [[Holford Bonds|a state banking scandal]] and worse yet by the [[Panic of 1837]]. In early antebellum Arkansas, the southeast Arkansas economy grew rapidly on the backs of slaves. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1860 US Census, University of Virginia]. Retrieved March 21, 2008.</ref> However, plantation agriculture would ultimately set the state and region behind the nation for decades.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 135.</ref> The growth of southeast Arkansas also caused a rift to form between the northwest and southeast.<ref name="bol">Bolton 1999, p. 22.</ref>

Many politicians were elected to office from [[The Family (Arkansas politics)|the Family]], the Southern rights political force in antebellum Arkansas, but the populace generally wanted to avoid a civil war. Arkansas voted to remain in the Union when the gulf states seceded in early 1861.<ref name="bol" /> Arkansas did not secede until [[Abraham Lincoln]] demanded Arkansas troops be sent to [[Fort Sumter]] to quell [[Battle of Fort Sumter|the rebellion there]]. The following month a state convention voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name="bol" /> Arkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the [[Mississippi River]] and surrounding Southern states. The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union General [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year, forcing the Confederate capital to move to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863-1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, guerrilla warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 200.</ref> Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of unpopular programs like a draft, high taxes, and martial law.

Under the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868. The Republican controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though disenfranchising all former Confederates, who were mostly Democrats), a public education system, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The state soon came under almost exclusive control of the [[Radical Republicans]], (those who moved in from the North being derided as "[[carpetbaggers]]" based on allegations of corruption), and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]] they presided over a time of great upheaval and racial violence in the state between Republican state militia and the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

In 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]] to disperse his militant supporters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276 |title=Brooks-Baxter War – Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070929091926/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2276| archivedate= September 29, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified re-enfranchising former Confederates.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Some early 20th century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.<ref>William D.

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 they amended the state constitution to include a [[poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, and forced them from electoral rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] were passed.<ref>[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&issue_id=36&page=3 "White Primary" System Bars Blacks from Politics – 1900", ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3.

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of [[Germans|German]], [[Slovaks|Slovak]], and Irish immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the [[Prairie]], and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from [[Ulster]].

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown ''v.'' Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'']] in 1954, the [[Little Rock Nine]] brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=723 |title=Little Rock Nine – Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate=August 24, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070929115012/http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?search=1&entryID=723| archivedate= September 29, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Bill Clinton]], the 42nd President of the United States, was born in [[Hope, Arkansas]]. Before his presidency, Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd [[Governor of Arkansas]], a total of nearly 12 years.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Arkansas was 2,949,132 on July 1, 2012, a 1.1% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=PopEstUS>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2012/index.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico:  April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]]|work=2012 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=December 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>

As of 2012, Arkansas has an estimated population of 2,949,132.<ref name=census/> From fewer than 15,000 in 1820, Arkansas's population grew to 52,240 during a special census in 1835, far exceeding the 40,000 required to apply for statehood.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 106.</ref> Following statehood in 1836, the population doubled each decade until the [[1870 United States Census|1870 Census]] conducted following the Civil War. The state recorded growth in each successive decade, although slowing until recording losses in the [[1950 United States Census|1950]] and [[1960 United States Census|1960 Censuses]]. This outmigration was a result of multiple factors, including mechanization on the farm reducing the number of laborers needed and young educated people leaving the state due to a lack of non-farming industry in the state.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Holley |first= Donald |title= Leaving the Land of Opportunity: Arkansas and the Great Migration |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 64 |pages= 247–248 |date= Autumn 2005 |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association }}</ref> Arkansas again began to grow, recording positive growth rates ever since and exceeding the 2 million mark during the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Resident Population Data |publisher= United States Census Bureau |url= http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php |accessdate= July 4, 2012 }}</ref> Arkansas's current rate of change, age distributions, and gender distributions mirror national averages.

===Ancestry===
In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 80.1% White (74.2% non-Hispanic [[Non-Hispanic Whites|White]]), 15.6% [[African American|Black]] or African American, 0.9% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.3% Asian, and 1.8% from Two or More Races. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] or Latinos of any race made up 6.6% of the population.<ref name=census>{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/05000.html |title=Arkansas QuickFacts | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}</ref>

As of 2011, 39.0% of Arkansas's population younger than age 1 were minorities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html|title=Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot|last=Exner|first=Rich|date=June 3, 2012|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}</ref>

European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern [[Ozarks]] and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]], Protestants from [[Ireland]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]] lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] before the American Revolution. [[English American|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] immigrants settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of [[English American|English]] stock are found throughout the state.<ref>[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.633–639</ref>

The principal ancestries of Arkansas's residents in 2010 were surveyed to be the following:<ref>{{cite web |author= American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url= http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_CP02&prodType=table |title= Arkansas – Selected Social Characteristics in the United States |year= 2010 |publisher= [[American Community Survey]] |accessdate= July 4, 2012 }}</ref>

* 1.7% [[Dutch American|Dutch]]
* 1.6% [[Italian American|Italian]]
* 1.6% [[Scottish American|Scottish]]
* 1.3% [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]]

Many of the people of American ancestry have some English descent and some have Scotch-Irish descent. Their families have been in the state so long, in many cases since before statehood, that they choose to identify simply as having American ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry. Many people who identify themselves as Irish descent are in fact of Scotch-Irish descent.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&pg=PA57&dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas' population (over the age of five) spoke only English at home. About 4.5% of the state's population spoke Spanish at home. About 0.7% of the state's population spoke any other [[Indo-European language]]s. About 0.8% of the state's population spoke an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]], and 0.2% spoke other languages.

===Religion===
Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the [[Bible Belt]] and is predominantly Protestant. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] with 661,382; the [[United Methodist Church]] with 158,574; non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 129,638; and the [[Catholic Church]] with 122,662. However, there are some residents of the state who live by other religions such as [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/05/rcms2010_05_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives &#124; State membership Report |publisher=www.Thearda.com |accessdate=November 07, 2013}}</ref>

Once a state with a cashless society in the uplands and [[Plantation economy|plantation]] agriculture in the lowlands, Arkansas's economy has evolved and diversified to meet the needs of today's consumer. The state's gross domestic product (GDP) was $105 billion in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title= Graph: Total Gross Domestic Product by State for Arkansas |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |url= http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=ARNGSP |date= January 1, 2011 |accessdate= September 11, 2012 }}</ref> Six [[Fortune 500]] companies are based in Arkansas, including the world's #1 retailer, [[Walmart]].<ref name="f500" >{{ cite web |title= Fortune 500 |publisher= Forbes |url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2013/full_list/index.html?iid=F500_sp_full |year= 2013 |accessdate= May 26, 2013 }}</ref> The [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] in 2010 was $36,027, ranking forty-fifth in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Graph: Per Capita Personal Income in Arkansas |publisher= Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis |url= http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=ARPCPI |date= January 1, 2011 |accessdate= September 11, 2012 }}</ref> The three-year [[median household income]] from 2009-11 was $39,806, ranking forty-ninth in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Table H-8B.

===Industry and commerce===
Arkansas's earliest industries were fur trading and agriculture. Although approximately 3% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector,<ref>{{cite web |title= Selected Economic Characteristics 2006-2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates |publisher= United States Census Bureau |url= http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_5YR_DP03&prodType=table |year= 2011 |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}</ref> it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking 13th in the nation in the value of products sold.<ref name="agcensus">{{cite web |work= Census of Agriculture |title= Arkansas State Profile |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |url= http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/County_Profiles/Arkansas/cp99005.pdf |year= 2007 |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}</ref> The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of rice, [[broiler]]s, and turkeys,<ref>U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ''Poultry -- Production and Value, 2010 Summary'', data indicates Arkansas led the nation in 2008, 2009, and 2010, in both broilers and turkeys.</ref> and ranks in the top three for [[cotton]], [[pullets]], and aquaculture (catfish).<ref name="agcensus" /> Forestry remains strong in the [[Arkansas Timberlands]], and the state ranks fourth nationally and first in the South in softwood lumber production.<ref name="agcensus">{{cite web |first= Matthew H. |last= Pelkki |title= An Economic Assessment of Arkansas’ Forest Industries: Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st Century |publisher= University of Arkansas-Monticello School of Forest Resources, Arkansas Forest Resources Center, University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture |url= http://arkansasagnews.uark.edu/afrc-007.2.1-20.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= October 4, 2012 }}</ref> In recent years, automobile parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states.

Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname "The Natural State" was originally created for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still used to this day. The state maintains [[List of Arkansas state parks|52 state parks]] and the [[National Park Service]] maintains seven properties in Arkansas, including the nation's first National Park, [[Hot Springs National Park]]. The completion of the [[William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library]] in Little Rock has drawn many visitors to the city and revitalized the nearby [[Little Rock River Market District|River Market District]]. Many cities also hold festivals which draw tourists to the culture of Arkansas such as [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]], [[Ozark Folk Center|Ozark Folk Festival]], [[Toad Suck Daze]], and [[Tontitown, Arkansas|Tontitown Grape Festival]].

{{Main|Culture of Arkansas}}
The culture of Arkansas is available to all in various forms, whether it be architecture, literature, or fine and performing arts. The state's culture also includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Sports are also very important to the culture of Arkansas, ranging from football, baseball, and basketball to hunting and fishing. Perhaps the best-known piece of Arkansas's culture is the stereotype of its citizens as shiftless hillbillies.<ref>Arnold et al 2002, p. 115.</ref> The reputation began when the state was characterized by early explorers as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves.<ref>Blevins 2009, p. 15.</ref> The most enduring icon of Arkansas's hillbilly reputation is  the ''[[Edward Washburn|The Arkansas Traveller]]'', a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s.<ref>Blevins 2009, p. 30.</ref> Although intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions.<ref>Sutherlin 1996, p. 20.</ref> The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the [[Little Rock Nine]] adding to Arkansas's enduring image.<ref>Sutherlin 1996, p. 17.</ref>

Art and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy. [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] is the most popular with 604,000 visitors in 2012, its first year.<ref>{{cite web |title= 600K visitors later, Crystal Bridges turns 1 |last= Bartels |first= Chuck |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/600K-visitors-later-Crystal-Bridges-is-1-year-old-4030447.php |date= November 12, 2012 |accessdate= November 18, 2012 |publisher= Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}</ref> The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art.<ref>{{cite web |title= Crystal Bridges art museum is reshaping Wal-Mart's hometown |last= Reynolds |first= Chris |publisher= Chicago Tribune |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/la-tr-arkansas-20121014,0,3925043.story?page=2 |date= October 14, 2012 |accessdate= November 18, 2012 }}</ref> Several historic town sites have been restored as Arkansas [[List of Arkansas state parks|state parks]], including [[Historic Washington State Park]], [[Powhatan Historic State Park]], and [[Davidsonville Historic State Park]]. 

Arkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the [[blues]] heritage of [[West Memphis, Arkansas|West Memphis]] and [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena-West Helena]] to [[rockabilly]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and folk music from the Ozarks. Festivals such as the [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]] and [[Bikes, Blues, and BBQ]] pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The [[Ozark Folk Festival]] in [[Mountain View, Arkansas|Mountain View]] is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' by [[Maya Angelou]] and ''[[A Painted House]]'' by [[John Grisham]] describe the culture at various time periods.

===Sports and recreation===

Sports are an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in and spectating various events throughout the year. One of the oldest sports in Arkansas is hunting. The state created the [[Arkansas Game and Fish Commission]] in 1915 to regulate and enforce hunting.<ref>{{cite web |last= Griffee |first= Carol |title= Odyssey Of Survival, A History of the Arkansas Conservation Sales Tax |page= 10 |url= http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= September 16, 2012 }}</ref> Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting [[duck]] in the [[Mississippi flyway]] and [[deer]] across the state.<ref name="Sutherlin 1996, p. 164">Sutherlin 1996, p. 164.</ref> Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.<ref name="Sutherlin 1996, p. 164"/>

Fishing has always been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of [[Norfork Dam]], the [[Norfork Tailwater]] and the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] have become a destination for [[trout]] fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas|Bull Shoals]], [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas|Hot Springs Village]], and [[Fairfield Bay, Arkansas|Fairfield Bay]] have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The [[Buffalo National River]] has been preserved in its natural state by the [[National Park Service]] and is frequented by fly fishers annually. 

Football, especially collegiate football, has always been important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings. The [[University of Arkansas]] first fielded a team in [[1894 Arkansas Cardinals football team|1894]] when football was a very dangerous game. [[Calling the Hogs]] is a cheer that shows support for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks|Razorbacks]], one of the two FBS teams in the state. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of the state. Following the [[Little Rock Nine]] integration crisis at [[Little Rock Central High School]], Arkansans looked to the successful Razorback teams in the following years to repair the state's reputation. Although the University of Arkansas is based in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], the Razorbacks have always played at least two games per season at [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock]] in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas. [[Arkansas State University]] joined the University of Arkansas in the Football Bowl Subdivision in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. However, the two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas' policy of not playing intrastate games.<ref>{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}</ref> Six of Arkansas' smaller colleges play in the [[Great American Conference]], with [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] playing in the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] and [[University of Central Arkansas]] competing in the [[Southland Conference]].

Baseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular since before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886-1920s. Today, two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey-Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in the [[Texas League]].

Arkansas also benefits from the use of its rivers for commerce. The [[Mississippi River]] and [[Arkansas River]] are both major rivers. The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] maintains the [[McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System]], allowing barge traffic up the Arkansas River to the [[Port of Catoosa]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. 

There are four airports with commercial service: [[Little Rock National Airport]], [[Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport]], [[Fort Smith Regional Airport]], and [[Texarkana Regional Airport]], with [[List of airports in Arkansas|dozens of smaller airports in the state]].

==Law and government==
{{Main|Politics and government of Arkansas}}
As with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are [[term-limited]] to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term.<ref>{{ cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term Limits in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |work= Joint Project on Term Limits |page= 1 |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= February 3, 2013 }}</ref>

Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 general election.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.<ref>{{cite web |title= Office of Lieutenant Governor |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5722 |date= February 28, 2011 |publisher= The Pryor Center |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture |accessdate= January 6, 2013 }}</ref>

===Legislative===
{{Main|Arkansas General Assembly}}
The [[Arkansas General Assembly]] is the state's [[bicameral]] bodies of legislators, composed of the [[Arkansas Senate|Senate]] and [[Arkansas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate contains 35 members from districts of approximately equal population. These districts are redrawn decennially with each US census, and in election years ending in "2", the entire body is put up for reelection. Following the election, half of the seats are designated as two-year seats and will be up for reelection again in two years, these "half-terms" do not count against a legislator's term limits. The remaining half serve a full four-year term. This staggers elections such that half the body is up for re-election every two years and allows for complete body turnover following redistricting.<ref>{{ cite web |last= Greenberg |first= Dan |url= http://arkansaseconomics.org/policy/050105.html |title= The Dangers of Diluting Term Limits |publisher= Arkansas Policy Center |accessdate= February 3, 2012 }}</ref> Arkansas voters selected a 21-14 Republican majority in the Senate in 2012. Arkansas House members can serve a maximum of three two-year terms. House districts are redistricted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment. Following the 2012 elections, Republicans gained a 51-49 majority in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web |title= Republicans Take Control of Arkansas House, Senate |url= http://5newsonline.com/2012/11/13/republicans-take-control-of-arkansas-house-senate/ |first= Mallory |last= Cooke |publisher= [[KFSM-TV]] |accessdate= January 8, 2013 }}</ref>

The Republican Party [[majority]] status in the Arkansas State House of Representatives following the 2012 elections is the party's first since 1874. Arkansas was the last state of the old Confederacy to never have Republicans control either chamber of its house since the Civil War.<ref name="sen" >{{cite web |title= Arkansas Senate flips; first time since Reconstruction |date= November 7, 2012 |publisher= The Courier |url= http://www.couriernews.com/view/full_story/20738303/article-Arkansas-Senate-flips--first-time-since-Reconstruction |accessdate= January 8, 2013 }}</ref>

Following the term limits changes, studies have show that lobbyist have become less influential in state politics, but legislative staff, not subject to term limits, have acquired additional power and influence due to the high rate of elected official turnover.<ref>{{ cite web |last1= English |first1= Art |last2= Weberg |first2= Brian |title= Term Limits in the Arkansas General Assembly: A Citizen Legislature Responds |year= 2005 |publisher= National Conference of State Legislatures |work= Joint Project on Term Limits |url= http://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/documents/jptl/casestudies/Arkansasv2.pdf |format= PDF |pages=33–34 |accessdate= February 3, 2013 }}</ref>

===Judicial===
{{Main|Courts of Arkansas}}
Arkansas's judicial branch has five court systems: [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], [[Arkansas Court of Appeals]], Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.

Most cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. There are currently 25 state district court judges presiding over 15 districts, with more districts to be created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no [[appeal|right of appeal]] from the Court of Appeals to the high court. However, the Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.

The Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court's decisions can be appealed to only the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

===Federal===
One of Arkansas's U.S. Senators is Democrat [[Mark Pryor]], and the other one is Republican [[John Boozman]]. The state has four seats in [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. All four seats are held by Republicans: [[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] ([[Arkansas's 1st congressional district|1st district]]), [[Tim Griffin]] ([[Arkansas's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]]), [[Steve Womack]] ([[Arkansas's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]]), and [[Tom Cotton]] ([[Arkansas's 4th congressional district|4th district]]).<ref name="sw">{{cite web |title= New Arkansas Rep.

Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]] brought national attention to the state with a long speech at the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] endorsing [[Michael Dukakis]]. Pundits suggested the speech would ruin Clinton's political career, but instead, Clinton won the Democratic nomination for President the following cycle. Presenting himself as a "New Democrat" and using incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Read my lips: no new taxes|broken promise]] against him, Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).

Most Republican strength lies mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected two Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]] and [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]. Prior to 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and [[Virginia]]) during the first decade of the 21st century.

In 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2012, Republicans won election for all four House seats.  Arkansas holds the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed of military veterans ([[Rick Crawford]] - [[Army]]; [[Tim Griffin]] - [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]; [[Steve Womack]] - Army [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], [[Tom Cotton]]- Army).

Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the [[Arkansas Constitution]] Arkansas is a [[right to work state]], its voters passed a ban on [[same-sex marriage]] with 75% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning abortion in the event ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' is ever overturned.
