'''Argo Navis''' (or simply '''Argo''') was a large [[constellation]] in the southern sky that has since been divided into three constellations. It represented the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship used by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in [[Greek mythology]].  The abbreviation was "Arg" and the genitive was "Argus Navis".

Argo Navis is the only one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] that is no longer officially recognized as a constellation. It was unwieldy due to its enormous size: were it still considered a single constellation, it would be the largest of all. In 1752, the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] subdivided it into [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] (the [[keel]], or the hull, of the ship), [[Puppis]] (the [[poop deck]], or [[stern]]), [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] (the [[sail]]s), and, according to some,<ref>John Scalzi (2008) Rough Guide to the Universe, p. 240 (ISBN 9781405383707)</ref><ref>David H. Kelley, et al. (2011) Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy , p. 12 (9781441976246)</ref><ref>Emily Winterburn (2009) The Stargazer's Guide, p. 124 (ISBN 9780061976377)</ref><ref>Carole Stott, et al. (2006) Eyewitness Companions: Astronomy, p. 210 (ISBN 9780756648459</ref> [[Pyxis]] (the compass, formerly the mast). When Argo Navis was split, its [[Bayer designation]]s were also split. Carina has the α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.

The constellation [[Pyxis]] (the [[mariner's compass]]) occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of Argo's mast (called [[Malus (constellation)|Malus]]). While its Bayer designations are separate from those of Carina, Puppis and Vela, having its own α, β and γ, for example, various modern authorities hold that Pyxis was in fact part of the Greek conception of Argo Navis.<ref>See Scalzi, Kelley, Winterburn, supra.</ref>

The [[Maori people|Maori]] had several names for what was the constellation Argo, including ''Te Waka-o-Tamarereti'', ''Te Kohi-a-Autahi'', and ''Te Kohi''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=279}}
