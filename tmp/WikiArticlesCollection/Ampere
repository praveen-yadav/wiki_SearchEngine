In practical terms, the ampere is a measure of the amount of [[electric charge]] passing a point in an electric circuit per unit time, with {{val|6.241|e=18}} [[electron]]s (or one [[coulomb]]) per second, constituting one ampere.<ref>{{Citation | author-link = David Bodanis| last = Bodanis | first = David | year = 2005 | title = Electric Universe | place = New York | publisher = Three Rivers Press | ISBN = 978-0‐307‐33598‐2}}</ref>

The practical definition may lead to confusion with the definition of the [[coulomb]] (i.e., 1 ampere-second) and the [[ampere-hour]] (A·h), but in practical terms this means that measures of a constant current (e.g., the nominal flow of charge per second through a simple circuit) will be defined in amperes (e.g., "a 20 mA circuit") and the flow of charge through a circuit over a period of time will be defined in coulombs (e.g., "a variable-current circuit that flows a total of 10 coulombs over 5 seconds"). In this way, amperes can be viewed as a flow rate, i.e. number of (charged) particles transiting per unit time, and coulombs simply as the number of particles.

The [[SI]] unit of charge, the [[coulomb]], "is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere".<ref>{{Citation | publisher = [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf | title = The International System of Units (SI) | edition = 8th | page = 144 | format = PDF}}.</ref> Conversely, a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second:
:<math>\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s.</math>
In general, charge ''Q'' is determined by steady current ''I'' flowing for a time ''t'' as ''Q'' = ''It''.

== History ==
The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS system]] electromagnetic unit of current (now known as the [[abampere]]), the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML | title = A short history of the SI units in electricity | publisher = Montclair | last = Kowalski | first = L}}.</ref> The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[International System of Units|MKSA system]] would be conveniently sized.

The "international ampere" was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118000}} grams of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm | title = History of the ampere | publisher = Sizes}}</ref> Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is 0.99985&nbsp;A.

== Realization ==
The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a [[watt balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.<ref name = "Electrical quantities">{{Citation | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html | title = SI brochure | chapter = Appendix 2: Practical realization of unit definitions: Electrical quantities | publisher = BIPM}}.</ref>

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10<sup>7</sup>, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.<ref name= "Electrical quantities" />

== Proposed future definition ==
{{Main|New SI definitions}}
Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been proposed to define the ampere in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges.<ref name = "Beyond" />  Since a [[coulomb]] is approximately equal to {{val |6.2415093|e=18}} [[elementary charge]]s (such as [[electron]]s), one ampere is approximately equivalent to {{val|6.2415093|e=18}} elementary charges moving past a boundary in one second, or the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charges in coulombs.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e | publisher = NIST | place = USA | title = Physics | contribution = Value}}.</ref> The proposed change would define 1 A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The [[New SI definitions|new definition]] is expected to be formally proposed at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2014.<ref>{{cite press release

== Everyday examples ==
{{main|Orders of magnitude (current)}}
The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watt]]s) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== Portable gadgets ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1&nbsp;mW at 1.4&nbsp;V): 0.7&nbsp;mA

=== Motor vehicles – 12 V DC ===
A typical motor vehicle has a 12&nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Instrument panel light (typically 2&nbsp;W): 166&nbsp;mA.
*Headlights (typically 60&nbsp;W): 5&nbsp;A each.
*Starter Motor (typically 1–2&nbsp;kW): 80-160&nbsp;A

=== North American domestic supply – 120 V AC ===
Most United States, Canada and Mexico domestic power suppliers run at 120&nbsp;V.

Household [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&nbsp;A or 20&nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&nbsp;W): 290&nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&nbsp;W): 500–830&nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&nbsp;kW): 16.6&nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&nbsp;kW): 38.3&nbsp;A

=== European domestic supply – 230 V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230&nbsp;V, so the current drawn by a particular European appliance (in Europe) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance.<ref group="Note">The formula for power is given by
:<math>
P(t) = I(t) \cdot V(t) \,
</math>
so it follows that if the voltage is doubled and the power remains the same, the current will be halved.</ref>

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*22-inch/56-centimeter Portable Television (35&nbsp;W): 150&nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&nbsp;W): 250–450&nbsp;mA
*Compact Fluorescent Lamp (13–30&nbsp;W): 58–112&nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&nbsp;kW): 9&nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&nbsp;kW): 20&nbsp;A
