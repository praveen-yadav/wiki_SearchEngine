The '''Territory of the Ashmore and Cartier Islands''' is an [[States and territories of Australia|external territory]] of Australia consisting of two groups of small low-lying uninhabited tropical islands in the Indian Ocean situated on the edge of the [[continental shelf]] north-west of Australia and south of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Rote Island|Rote]].

==Geography==
The territory includes Ashmore Reef (West, Middle, and [[East Island (Ashmore and Cartier Islands)|East]] Islets) and [[Cartier Islands|Cartier Island]] (70&nbsp;km east) with a total area of {{convert|199.45|km²|0|abbr=on}} within the [[reef]]s and including the [[lagoons]], and 114,400 m² of dry land. They have a total of {{convert|74.1|km|0|abbr=on}} of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the reef. There are no ports or harbours, only offshore anchorage.

Nearby Hibernia Reef, {{convert|42|km|0|abbr=on}} Northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the territory, but belongs to Western Australia.<ref>[http://www.statoids.com/uau.html States of Australia] Retrieved 2011-06-23</ref> It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

Cartier Island Marine Reserve includes the entire sand cay of Cartier Island, the reef surrounding it, the ocean for a {{convert|7.2|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} radius around the island, and {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seafloor. It was proclaimed in 2000.

*Ashmore Reef {{convert|155.40|km²|0|abbr=on}} area within reef (including lagoon)
**West Islet, 51,200 m² land area;
**Middle Islet, 21,200 m² land area;
**East Islet, 25,000 m² land area;
*Cartier Reef (44.03&nbsp;km² area within reef (including lagoon)
**Cartier Island, 17,000 m² land area;


==Government==
The territory is administered from [[Canberra]] by the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport, which is also responsible for the administration of the territories of [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], the [[Coral Sea Islands]], [[Jervis Bay Territory]] and [[Norfolk Island]].<ref name="AussieAG">{{cite web| author =  Assistant Director, Territories and Disaster Reconstruction Division | title = Territories of Australia | url = http://www.regional.gov.au/territories | publisher= Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport | date= 16 June 2012 | accessdate = 7 February 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080206093322/http://www.regional.gov.au/territories| archivedate= 6 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the 2010 Federal Election, administrative responsibility for Territories was transferred from the Attorney General's Department to the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport. Defence of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the [[Royal Australian Navy]], [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]]. The islands are visited by seasonal caretakers.

Ashmore Reef is called ''Pulau Pasir'' by Indonesians, and considered part of [[Rote Ndao Regency]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province.<ref>[http://wikimapia.org/5889136/Pulau_Pasir_Kabupaten_Rote_Ndao_district_Nusa_tenggara_Timur_province_INDONESIA Ashmore Reef, Ashmore and Cartier Islands (external territory of Australia)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the [[Rote Island]] language, it is called ''Nusa Solokaek''.

On 21 October 2002 the nature reserve was recognised as a wetland of international importance when it was designated Ramsar Site 1220 under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].<ref name=ARL>Annotated Ramsar List.</ref>

=== Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve ===
[[Image:Cartier Island.png|thumb|right|Cartier Island and surrounding reef ([[NASA]] satellite image)]]

The [[Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve]]<ref name="DSEWPC">[http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mpa/ashmore/index.html ''Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve and Cartier Island Marine Reserve'', Australian Government, Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities]</ref> was established in August 1983 and covers {{convert|583|km2}}. It is of significant [[biodiversity]] value as it is in the flow of the [[Indonesian Throughflow]] ocean current from the Pacific Ocean through [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] to the Indian Ocean.{{cn|date=August 2013}} It is also in a surface current west from the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Timor Sea]].

The Reserve comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of [[sea snake]]s, a population of [[Dugong]] that may be genetically distinct, a diverse [[marine invertebrate]] fauna, and many [[endemism|endemic]] species, especially of sea snakes and [[mollusc]]s. There are feeding and nesting sites for [[Loggerhead Turtle|Loggerhead]], [[Hawksbill turtle|Hawksbill]] and [[Green Turtle]]s.  It is classified as an [[Important Bird Area]]  and has 50,000 breeding pairs of various kinds of [[seabird]]s.  A high abundance and diversity of [[sea cucumber]]s, [[over-exploitation|over-exploited]] on other reefs in the region, is present, with 45 species recorded.<ref name=ARL/>

A memorandum of understanding between the Australian and Indonesian governments allows Indonesian fishermen access to their traditional fishing grounds within the region, subject to limits.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

=== Cartier Island Marine Reserve ===
The [[Cartier Island Marine Reserve]]<ref name="DSEWPC" /> was established in June 2000 and covers {{convert|172|km2}}.

==Economy and migration==
There is no economic activity in the Territory. As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for [[people smugglers]] transporting [[asylum seekers]] to Australia<ref>[http://insideindonesia.org/edit66/anita4.htm Inside Indonesia]{{dead link|date=July 2012}} Anita Roberts "Don't let them drown" ''Inside Indonesia'' Apr–Jun 2001, vol. 64</ref> despite its only [[water well|well]]s being infected with [[cholera]] or contaminated and [[potable water|undrinkable]].<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/NAVYNEWS/editions/1999/06_28_99/story03.htm Bizarre Happenings at Reef], [[Royal Australian Navy]] News, 28 June 1999, accessed 29 July 2010</ref> Once they had landed on Ashmore, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian territory and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. As Australia was not the country of first asylum for these "[[boat people]]", the Australian Government did not consider that it had a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the practice such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces, and finally excising Ashmore and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]]. Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.
