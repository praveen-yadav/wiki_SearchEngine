'''Abimelech''' (also spelled '''Abimelek''' or '''Avimelech'''; {{Hebrew Name 2|אֲבִימֶלֶךְ|אֲבִימָלֶךְ|Avimélekh|Avimálekh|ʼĂḇîméleḵ|ʼĂḇîmāleḵ|"father/leader of a king; my father/leader, a king"}}) was a common name of the [[Philistine]] [[monarch|kings]].

Abimelech was most prominently the name of a polytheistic<ref>{{cite book|last=Benamozegh|first=Elia|title=Israel and Humanity|year=1995|publisher=Paulist Press International|isbn=978-0809135417|coauthors=Maxwell Luria|page=104}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Victor P.|title=Exodus: An Exegetical Commentary|year=2012|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0801031830|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vUry0cGNR_IC&pg=PT1003&lpg=PT1003&dq=Abimelech{{!}}Abimilek+polytheism#v=onepage&q=Abimelech{{!}}Abimilek%20polytheism&f=false}}</ref> king of [[Gerar]] who is mentioned in two of the three [[wife-sister narratives in Genesis]].  The [[Haggada]] identifies them as separate people, the second being the first Abimelech's son, and that his original name was Benmelech ("son of the King") but changed his name to his father's. At the time of the [[Amarna tablets]] (mid-14th century BC), there was an Egyptian governor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] named [[Abimilki]], who is sometimes speculated to be connected with one or more of the biblical Abimelechs.

==Etymology==
Abimelech's name has three main translations, though none treats the name as being completely Hebrew, and all are slightly contorted. The first is ''my father is king'', which could be considered simply as a generic title given to a [[crown prince]].  This is supported in the Haggada when "Benmelech" son of Abimelech changes his name to Abimelech when he becomes king.  The other two are more interesting,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} both essentially being ''my father is MLK'', with [[Moloch|MLK]] being the reference found elsewhere in the Bible in prohibitions such as ''do not pass your children through the fire to MLK'', in which case the following possibilities arise:
*MLK refers to a major [[Canaan]]ite deity probably named ''[[Moloch]]'', in which case ''Abimelech'' means ''my father is Moloch''{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} - a reference to belief in semi-divine kings; or
*MLK refers to a type of (probably human) sacrifice probably named ''Molk'', so that ''Abimelech'' signifies ''my father is a sacrifice''{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} - a reference to Abimelech being pious.

==Other people with this name==
Apart from the kings of Gerar, the Bible also records this name for:
*[[Abimelech (Judges)]], proclaimed king after the death of his father Gideon ({{bibleverse||Judges|9:1-6|HE}}).
*The son of [[Abiathar]], and [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priest]] in the time of David ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|18:16|HE}}). In the parallel passage, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|8:17|HE}}, the name is given as [[Ahimelech]]; most authorities consider this the more correct reading.
*The king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] better known as [[Achish]], referred to as Abimelech or Achimelech in the title of {{bibleverse||Psalm|34|HE}}.
*Abimélech, [[Satrap]] of [[Gaza]] is a character (baritone) in [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' opera ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Weimar, 1877)
