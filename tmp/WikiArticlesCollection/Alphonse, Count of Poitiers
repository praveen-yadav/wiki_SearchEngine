'''Alphonse''' or '''Alfonso''' (11 November 1220 – 21 August 1271) was the [[Count of Poitou]] from 1225 and [[Count of Toulouse]] (as '''Alphonse II''') from 1249.

Born at [[Poissy]], Alphonse was a son of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], [[King of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]]. He was a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]] and an older brother of [[Charles I of Sicily]]. In 1229, his mother, who was [[regent]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]], forced the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] on [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]] after his rebellion.<ref>Jackson. p. 64.</ref> It stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry [[Joan of Toulouse]], daughter of [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]], and so in 1237 Alphonse married her.<ref>Fawtier. p. 123.</ref> Since she was Raymond's only child, they became rulers of [[Toulouse]] at Raymond's death in 1249.

By the terms of his father's will he received an ''[[appanage]]'' of [[Poitou]] and [[Rulers of Auvergne|Auvergne]]. He won the [[battle of Taillebourg]] in the [[Saintonge War]] with his brother Louis IX, against a revolt allied with king Henry III of England.

Alphonse took part in two crusades with his brother, St Louis, in 1248 (the [[Seventh Crusade]]) and in 1270 (the [[Eighth Crusade]]). For the first of these, he raised a large sum and a substantial force, arriving in [[Damietta]] on 24 October 1249, after the town had already been captured.<ref>Strayer. pp. 496-7.</ref> He sailed for home on 10 August 1250.<ref>Strayer. p. 505.</ref> His father-in-law had died while he was away, and he went directly to Toulouse to take possession.<ref>Hallam. p. 218.</ref> There was some resistance to his accession as count, which was suppressed with the help of his mother Blanche of Castile who was acting as regent in the absence of Louis IX.<ref name="wptmus">Hallam. p. 258.</ref> The county of Toulouse, since them, was joined to the Alphonse's ''appanage''.

In 1252, on the death of his mother, Blanche of Castile, Alphonse was joint regent with [[Charles of Anjou]] until the return of Louis IX.  During that time he took a great part in the campaigns and negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1259, under which King [[Henry III of England]] recognized his loss of continental territory to [[France]] (including [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], and [[Poitou]]) in exchange for France withdrawing support from English rebels.

Aside from the crusades, Alphonse stayed primarily in Paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials work, and a constant stream of messages.<ref>Petit-Dutaillis. pp. 299-300.</ref> His main work was on his own estates. There he repaired the evils of the [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian war]] and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. The charter known as "Alphonsine," granted to the town of [[Riom]], became the code of public law for [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]. Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money.  He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of [[Jew]]s, when he did so in Poitou in 1249.

When Louis IX again engaged in a crusade (the [[Eighth Crusade]]), Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother.<ref>Strayer. p. 511.</ref> This time, however, he did not return to France, dying while on his way back, probably at [[Savona]] in Italy, on 21 August 1271. He had been appointed a Knight of the '''[[Order of the Ship and the Mussel|Order of the Ship]] by his brother.

==Death and Legacy==
Alphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands. One possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another that they should be redistributed to his family. The latter was claimed by Charles of Anjou, but in 1283 [[Parlement]] decided that the County of Toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs.<ref name="wptmus"/> Alphonse's wife Joan (who died five days after Alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of [[Raymond VII]], Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Provençal and French law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. But, her will was invalidated by Parlement in 1274<ref name="wptmus"/> One specific bequest in Alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the [[Comtat Venaissin]] to the [[Holy See]], was allowed, and it became a [[Papal States|Papal territory]], a status that it retained until 1791.
