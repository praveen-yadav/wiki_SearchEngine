'''Titus''' was an early Christian leader, a companion of [[Paul the Apostle]], mentioned in several of the [[Pauline epistles]]. He is believed to be a gentile converted by Paul to Christianity and, according to tradition, was consecrated by him as Bishop of the Island of Crete. Titus brought a fundraising letter from Paul to Corinth, to collect for the poor in Jerusalem. Later, on Crete, Titus appointed presbyters in every city and remained there into his old age, dying in the city of Candia (modern Heraklion).<ref> Smith, William. ''Smith’s Bible Dictionary'' 11th printing, November 1975. New Jersey: Fleming H. Revel Company. Pp. 701 – 702.</ref>

==Life==

He appears to have been a [[Gentile]] – for Paul sternly refused to have him [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]], because Paul believed Christ's gospel freed believers from the requirements of the [[613 Mitzvot]] &mdash; and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles. At a later period, Paul's epistles place him with Paul and [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] at [[Ephesus]], whence he was sent by Paul to [[Corinth, Greece]] for the purpose of obtaining the contributions of the church there on behalf of the poor Christians at Jerusalem.<ref>{{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|8:6}}; {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|12:18}}</ref> He rejoined Paul when he was in [[Macedon]], and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth.<ref>{{Bibleverse-nb|2|Corinthians|7:6-15}}</ref> After this his name is not mentioned until after Paul's first imprisonment, when he was engaged in the organization of the church in [[Crete]], where Paul had left him for this purpose.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Titus|1:5}}</ref> The last notice of him is in {{Bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:10}}, where he leaves Paul in Rome in order to travel to [[Early centers of Christianity#Salona|Dalmatia]]. The [[New Testament]] does not record his death.

According to tradition, Paul ordained Titus bishop of [[Gortyn]] in Crete. He died in the year 107, aged about 95.

It has been argued that the name "Titus" in 2 Corinthians and Galatians is nothing more than an informal name used by Timothy, implied already by the fact that even though both are said to be long-term close companions of Paul, they never appear in common scenes.<ref>Fellows, Richard G. "Was Titus Timothy?" ''Journal for the Study of the New Testament'' '''81''' (2001):33-58.</ref> The theory proposes that a number of passages—1 Cor. 4:17, 16.10; 2 Cor. 2:13, 7:6, 13-14, 12:18; and Acts 19.22—all refer to the same journey of a single individual, Titus-Timothy. [[2 Timothy]] seems to dispute this, by claiming that Titus has gone to Dalmatia.<ref>cf 2 Timothy 4:10</ref> The fact that Paul made a point of circumcising Timothy (Acts 16:3) but refused to circumcise Titus (Gal. 2:3) indicates that they are different men.

The feast day of Titus was not included in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]. When added in 1854, it was assigned to 6 February.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 86</ref> In 1969, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] assigned the feast to 26 January so as to celebrate the two disciples of Paul, Titus and Timothy, on the day after the feast of the [[Conversion of St. Paul]].<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 116</ref> The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] celebrates these two, together with [[Silas]], on the same date. The [[Orthodox Church]] commemorates him on 25 August and on 4 January.

His relics, now consisting of only his skull, are venerated in the Church of St. Titus, [[Heraklion]], Crete to which it was returned in 1966<ref name="The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997">[http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/titus.htm The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997]</ref> after being removed to Venice during the Turkish occupation.

St. Titus is the patron saint of the United States Army Chaplain Corps. The Corps has established the Order of Titus Award. According to the Department of Defense, the "Order of Titus award is the only award presented by the Chief of Chaplains to recognize outstanding performance of ministry by chaplains and chaplain assistants. The Order of Titus is awarded for meritorious contributions to the unique and highly visible Unit Ministry Team Observer Controller Program. The award recognizes the great importance of realistic, doctrinally guided combat ministry training in ensuring the delivery of prevailing religious support to the American Soldier." <ref>Lake Union Journal. http://www.lakeunionherald.org/103/3/41852.html.</ref>
