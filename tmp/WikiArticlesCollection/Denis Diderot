'''Denis Diderot''' ({{IPA-fr|dəni didʁo|lang}}) (5 October 1713 – 31 July 1784) was a French philosopher, [[art critic]], and writer. He was a prominent person during the [[Age of the Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' along with [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

Diderot also contributed to literature, notably with ''[[Jacques the Fatalist|Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'' (''Jacques the Fatalist and his Master''), which emulated [[Laurence Sterne]] in challenging conventions regarding novels and their structure and content,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} while also examining philosophical ideas about [[free will]]. Diderot is also known as the author of the dialogue, ''[[Rameau's Nephew|Le Neveu de Rameau]]'' (''Rameau's Nephew''), upon which many articles and sermons about consumer desire have been based.

==Biography==
Denis Diderot was born in [[Langres]], [[Province of Champagne|Champagne]], and began his formal education at the [[Society of Jesus|jesuitic]] ''Collège jésuite'' in Langres.

[[File:Langres - Ancien collège Jésuite.jpg|thumb|''Collège jésuite'' in Langres]]
His parents were [[Didier Diderot]] (1685–1759) a [[Cutlery|cutler]], ''maître coutelier'' and his wife Angélique Vigneron (1677–1748). Three of five siblings survived to adulthood, Denise Diderot (1715–1797) and their youngest brother Pierre-Didier Diderot (1722–1787), and finally their sister Angélique Diderot (1720–1749).

In 1732 he earned a master of arts degree in philosophy.  Then he entered the [[Collège d'Harcourt]] in Paris. He abandoned the idea of entering the clergy and decided instead to study law. His study of law was short-lived however and in 1734 Diderot decided to become a writer. Because of his refusal to enter one of the learned professions, he was disowned by his father, and for the next ten years he lived a bohemian existence.

In 1742 he befriended [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Then in 1743 he further alienated his father by marrying [[Anne-Toinette Champion|Antoinette Champion]] (1710–1796), a devout Roman Catholic. The match was considered inappropriate due to Champion's low social status, poor education, fatherless status and lack of a dowry. She was about three years older than Diderot. The marriage, in October 1743 produced one surviving child, a girl. Her name was Angélique, after both Diderot's dead mother and sister. The death of his sister, a nun, from overwork in the convent may have affected Diderot's opinion of religion. She is assumed to have been the inspiration for his novel about a nun, ''[[La Religieuse (novel)|La Religieuse]]'', in which he depicts a woman who is forced to enter a monastery where she suffers at the hands of the other nuns in the community.

Diderot had affairs with the writer [[Madeleine de Puisieux]] and with [[Louise-Henriette Volland|Sophie Volland]] (1716–1784). His letters to Sophie Volland contain some of the most vivid of all the insights that we have of the daily life of the philosophic circle of Paris during this time period.

Though his work was broad and rigorous, it did not bring Diderot riches. He secured none of the posts that were occasionally given to needy men of letters; he could not even obtain the bare official recognition of merit which was implied by being chosen a member of the [[Académie française]]. When the time came for him to provide a [[dowry]] for his daughter, he saw no alternative than to sell his library. When Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]] heard of his financial troubles she commissioned an agent in Paris to buy the library. She then requested that the philosopher retain the books in Paris until she required them, and act as her librarian with a yearly salary. Between 1773 and 1775, Diderot spent a few months at the empress's court in [[Saint Petersburg]].

Diderot died of gastrointestinal problems in Paris on 30 July 1784, and was buried in the city's [[Église Saint-Roch]]. His heirs sent his vast library to Catherine II, who had it deposited at the [[National Library of Russia]]. He has several times been denied burial in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] with other French notables,<ref>{{cite web |title=In the Panthéon|url=http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/on-history/in-the-pantheon.php?page=all|publisher=Lapham's Quarterly |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> but the French government did recently announce the possibility of memorializing him in this fashion, on the 300th anniversary of his birth (October 2013). For the moment, however, this idea seems to have been tabled.<ref>{{cite news |last=Curran|first=Andrew S.|title=Diderot, an American Exemplar?

== Early works ==
{{French literature sidebar}}

Diderot's earliest works included a translation of [[Temple Stanyan]]'s ''History of Greece'' (1743); with two colleagues, [[François-Vincent Toussaint]] and [[Marc-Antoine Eidous]], he produced a translation of [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]]'s ''Medicinal Dictionary''<ref>Mark Twain, "A Majestic Literary Fossil", originally from ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine'', vol. 80, issue 477, pp. 439–44, February 1890. [http://www.harpers.org/AMajesticLiteraryFossil.html Online] at ''Harper's'' site. Accessed 24 September 2006.</ref> (1746–1748); at about the same time he published a free rendering of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]'s ''Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit'' (1745), with some original notes of his own. In 1746 he wrote his first original work: the ''Pensées philosophiques'',<ref>Bryan Magee. The Story of Philosophy. DK Publishing, Inc., New York: 1998. p. 124</ref> and he added to this a short complementary essay on the sufficiency of [[Natural theology|natural religion]]. He then composed a volume of bawdy stories ''[[Les bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1748); in later years he repented this work.
In 1747 he wrote the ''Promenade du sceptique'', an [[allegory]] pointing first at the extravagances of Catholicism; second, at the vanity of the pleasures of the world which is the rival of the church; and third, at the desperate and unfathomable uncertainty of the philosophy which professes to be so high above both church and world.

Diderot's celebrated ''[[Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient]]'' ("Letter on the Blind") (1749), introduced him to the world as a daringly original thinker. The subject is a discussion of the interrelation between man's reason and the [[knowledge]] acquired through perception (the [[sense|five senses]]). The title, "Letter on the Blind For the Use of Those Who See", also evoked some ironic doubt about who exactly were "the blind" under discussion. In the essay a blind English mathematician named Saunderson argues that since knowledge derives from the senses, then mathematics is the only form of knowledge that both he and a sighted person can agree about. It is suggested that the blind could be taught to read through their sense of touch (a later essay, ''Lettre sur les sourds et muets'', considered the case of a similar deprivation in the [[deaf]] and [[speech disorder|mute]]). What makes the ''Lettre sur les aveugles'' so remarkable, however, is its distinct, if undeveloped, presentation of the theory of [[Genetic variability|variation]] and [[natural selection]].<ref>Diderot's contemporary, also a Frenchman, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]–who in 1745 was named Head of the Prussian Academy of Science under [[Frederic the Great]]– was developing similar ideas. These proto-evolutionary theories were by no means as thought out and systematic as those of [[Charles Darwin]] a hundred years later.</ref>

<blockquote>This powerful essay ... revolves around a remarkable deathbed scene in which a dying blind philosopher, Saunderson, rejects the arguments of a [[Divine Providence|providential]] God during his last hours. Saunderson's arguments are those of a Neo-[[Spinoza|Spinozist]], [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalist]], and [[Fatalist]], using a sophisticated notion of the [[Spontaneous generation|self-generation]] and natural evolution of species without Creation or supernatural intervention. The notion of [[Materialism|"thinking matter"]] is upheld and the "[[argument from design]]" discarded ... as hollow and unconvincing. The work appeared anonymously ... and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities. Diderot, who had been under police surveillance since 1747, was swiftly identified as the author ... and was imprisoned for some months at [[Vincennes]], where he was visited almost daily by [[Rousseau]], at the time his closest and most assiduous ally.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750.'' ([[Oxford University Press]]. 2001, 2002), p. 710</ref></blockquote>

After signing a letter of submission and promising never to write anything prejudicial against the religion again (with the result that his most controversial works were henceforth published only after his death), Diderot was released from the dungeons of the [[Vincennes]] fortress after three months. In collaboration with [[d'Alembert]], he subsequently embarked on his greatest project, The ''[[Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers]]''.

== Encyclopédie ==
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|Title page of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'']]
{{Main|Encyclopédie}}

[[André Le Breton]], a bookseller and printer, approached Diderot with a project for the publication of a translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]' ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' into French, first undertaken by the Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]], and followed by the German [[Gottfried Sellius]]. Diderot accepted the proposal, and transformed it. He persuaded Le Breton to publish a new work, which would consolidate ideas and knowledge from the [[Republic of Letters]]. The publishers found capital for a larger enterprise than they had first planned. [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] was persuaded to become Diderot's colleague; and permission was procured from the government.

In 1750 an elaborate prospectus announced the project, and in 1751 the first volume was published. This work was unorthodox and advanced for the time. Diderot stated that "An encyclopedia ought to make good the failure to execute such a project hitherto, and should encompass not only the fields already covered by the academies, but each and every branch of human knowledge." Comprehensive knowledge will give "the power to change men's common way of thinking."<ref>Examples are Diderot's articles on Asian philosophy and religion; see [[Urs App]]. ''The Birth of Orientalism''. Philadelphia: [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2010 (ISBN 978-0-8122-4261-4), pp. 133–87.</ref> The work combined scholarship with information on trades. Diderot emphasized the abundance of knowledge within each subject area. Everyone would benefit from these insights.

Diderot's work, however, was mired in controversy from the beginning; the project was suspended by the courts in 1752. Just as the second volume was completed accusations arose, regarding seditious content, concerning the editor's entries on religion and natural law. Diderot was detained and his house was searched for manuscripts for subsequent articles. But the search proved fruitless as no manuscripts could be found. They were hidden in the house of an unlikely confederate–[[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Chretien de Lamoignon Malesherbes]], the very official who ordered the search. Although Malesherbes was a staunch absolutist -- loyal to the monarchy -- he was sympathetic to the literary project. Along with his support, and that of other well-placed influential confederates, the project resumed. Diderot returned to his efforts only to be constantly embroiled in controversy.

These twenty years were to Diderot not merely a time of incessant drudgery, but harassing persecution and desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the ''Encyclopédie'', in which they saw a rising stronghold for their philosophic enemies. By 1757 they could endure it no longer. The subscribers had grown from 2,000 to 4,000, a measure of the growth of the work in popular influence and power. The ''Encyclopédie'' threatened the governing social classes of France (aristocracy) because it took for granted the justice of [[religious tolerance]], [[freedom of thought]], and the value of science and industry. It asserted the doctrine that the main concern of the nation's government ought to be the nation's common people. It was believed that the ''Encyclopédie'' was the work of an organized band of conspirators against society, and that the dangerous ideas they held were made truly formidable by their open publication. In 1759, the ''Encyclopédie'' was formally suppressed. The decree did not stop the work, which went on, but its difficulties increased by the necessity of being clandestine. [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] withdrew from the enterprise and other powerful colleagues, including [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], declined to contribute further to a book which had acquired a bad reputation.

Diderot was left to finish the task as best he could. He wrote several hundred articles, some very slight, but many of them laborious, comprehensive, and long. He damaged his eyesight correcting proofs and editing the manuscripts of less competent contributors. He spent his days at workshops, mastering manufacturing processes, and his nights writing what he had learned during the day. He was incessantly harassed by threats of police raids. The last copies of the first volume were issued in 1765. At the last moment, when his immense work was drawing to an end, he encountered a crowning mortification: he discovered that the bookseller, fearing the government's displeasure, had struck out from the proof sheets, after they had left Diderot's hands, all passages that he considered too dangerous. The monument to which Diderot had given the labor of twenty long and oppressive years was irreparably mutilated and defaced. It was 12 years, in 1772, before the subscribers received the final 28 folio volumes of the ''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers'' since the first volume had been published.

Although the ''Encyclopédie'' was Diderot's monumental piece, he was the author of many other works that sowed nearly every field of intellectual interest with new and creative ideas. He wrote sentimental plays, ''[[Le Fils naturel]]'' (1757) and ''[[le père de famille]]'' (1758), accompanying them with essays on theatrical theory and practice, including "Les Entretiens sur ''Le Fils Naturel''" (Conversations on ''The Natural Son''), in which he announced the principles of a new drama: the 'serious genre', a realistic midpoint between comedy and tragedy that stood in opposition to the stilted conventions of the classical French stage. His [[art criticism]] was also highly influential. Diderot's ''Essais sur la peinture'' was described by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], as "a magnificent work, which speaks even more helpfully to the poet than to the painter, though to the painter too it is as a blazing torch."
[[File:Un dîner de philosophes.Jean Huber.jpg|thumb|350px|''Un dîner de philosophes'' painted by [[Jean Huber Voltaire]]. Denis Diderot is the third from the right]]
Diderot's most intimate friend was the [[philologist]] [[Friedrich Melchior Grimm]]. They were brought together by their friend in common at that time, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Grimm wrote newsletters to various high personages in Germany, reporting the happenings of art and literature in Paris, then the intellectual capital of Europe. Diderot helped Grimm between 1759 and 1779, by writing an account of the annual exhibitions of paintings in the [[Paris Salon]]. These reports are highly readable pieces of art criticism. According to [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], they initiated the French into a new way of laughing, and introduced people to the mystery and purport of colour by ideas. "Before Diderot," [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël]] wrote, "I had never seen anything in pictures except dull and lifeless colours; it was his imagination that gave them relief and life, and it is almost a new sense for which I am indebted to his genius." [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] was Diderot's favorite contemporary artist.<ref>[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–25. ISBN 0-8014-9218-1</ref> Greuze's most characteristic pictures were the rendering in colour of the same sentiments of domestic virtue and the [[pathos]] of common life, which Diderot had attempted to represent upon the stage.

Diderot was above all things interested in the life of individuals. He did not care about the abstract life of the race, but the incidents of individual character, the fortunes of a particular family, the relations of real and concrete motives in this or that special case. He was delighted with the enthusiasm of a born [[casuist]] in curious puzzles of right and wrong, and in devising a conflict between the generalities of ethics and the conditions of an ingeniously contrived practical dilemma. Diderot's interest expressed itself in [[didactic]] and sympathetic form.  However, in two of his most remarkable pieces, this interest is not sympathetic, but ironic. ''[[Jacques le fataliste]]'' (written in 1773, but not published until 1792 in German and 1796 in French) is similar to ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'' and ''The Sentimental Journey''. His dialogue ''[[Le Neveu de Rameau]]'' ([[Rameau]]'s Nephew) is a "farce-tragedy" reminiscent of the ''Satires'' of [[Horace]]. A favorite classical author of Diderot's, Horace's words ''Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis'' are quoted at the top of the ''Nephew''. Diderot's intention in writing the dialogue is disputed; whether it is merely a satire on contemporary manners, or a reduction of the theory of [[Individualism|self-interest]] to an absurdity, or the application of [[irony]] to the ethics of ordinary convention, or a mere setting for a discussion about music, or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human original. Whatever its intent, it is a remarkable conversation, representing an era that held the art of conversation in the highest regard.

The writing and publication history of the ''Nephew'' is likewise a bit mysterious. Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime, but there is every indication it was of continual interest to him. Though the original draft was written in 1761, he made additions to it year after year until his death twenty-three years later. Goethe's translation (1805) was the first introduction of ''Le Neveu de Rameau'' to the European public. After executing it, he gave back the original French manuscript to [[Friedrich Schiller]], from whom he had it. No authentic French copy of it appeared until the writer had been dead for forty years (1823). Diderot's miscellaneous pieces range from a graceful trifle like the ''Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre'' (''Regrets for my Old Dressing Gown'') up to ''[[Le rêve de D'Alembert]]'', where he plunges into the depths of the controversy as to the ultimate constitution of [[matter]] and the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)|meaning of life]]. Diderot was not a coherent and systematic thinker, but rather "a philosopher in whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another" ([[Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz|Rosenkranz]]). He did not develop a comprehensive system of [[materialism]], but he may have made some contributions to the atheistic materialist works of his friend [[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, baron d'Holbach]].

=== Fourth wall ===
Diderot introduced the concept of the [[fourth wall]], the imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled [[box set (theatre)|box set]] in a [[proscenium]] theatre, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play.<ref name="Bell">{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Elizabeth S. |title=Theories of Performance |year=2008 |publisher=Sage |location=Los Angeles | isbn = 978-1-4129-2637-9 |page=203 }}.</ref><ref name="Wallis">{{cite book |last=Wallis |first=Mick |last2=Shepherd |first2=Simon |title=Studying plays |year=1998 |publisher=Arnold |location=London | isbn = 0-340-73156-7 |page=214 }}.</ref><ref name="Abelman">{{Cite book |last=Abelman |first=Robert |title=Reaching a critical mass: a critical analysis of television entertainment |year=1998 |publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, N.J. | isbn = 0-8058-2199-6 |pages=8–11 }}.</ref>

== Philosophy ==
As a philosopher, Diderot speculated on [[free will]] and held a completely [[Materialism|materialistic]] view of the universe; he suggested all human behavior is determined by [[heredity]]. He therefore warned his fellow philosophers against an overemphasis on mathematics and against the blind optimism that sees, in the growth of physical knowledge, an automatic social and human progress. As such, he rejected the [[Idea of Progress]]. In his opinion, the aim of progressing through technology was doomed to fail. He founded his philosophy on experiment and the study of probabilities. He wrote several articles and supplements concerning gambling, mortality rates, and inoculation against smallpox for the ''Encyclopédie.'' There, he discreetly but firmly refuted d'Alembert's technical errors and personal positions on probability.

In his youth, Diderot was originally a follower of [[Voltaire]] and his [[Deism|deist]] ''Anglomanie'', but gradually moved away from this line of thought towards [[materialism]] and [[atheism]], a move which was finally realised in 1747 in the philosophical debate in the second part of his ''[[La Promenade du sceptique]]'' (1747).<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''Enlightenment Contested'', Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 791, 818.</ref>

== Historiography ==
The major biography in English remains Arthur Wilson, ''Diderot'' (1972). However many new approaches have appeared in recent years, especially by such scholars as Wilda Anderson, Kurt Ballstadt, Daniel Brewer, Jay Caplan, Andrew Clark, Elisabeth de Fontenay, Rosalina de la Carrera, Julie Candler Hays, Thomas M. Kavanagh, Walter Rex, and Pierre Saint-Amand.<ref>See Andrew H. Clark, ''Diderot’s Part'' (Ashgate, 2008)</ref>
