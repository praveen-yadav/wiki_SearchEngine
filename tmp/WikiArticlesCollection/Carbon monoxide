'''Carbon monoxide''' ([[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]]) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to humans and animals when encountered in higher concentrations, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable, short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level [[ozone]].

Carbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a [[triple bond]] that consists of two [[covalent bond]]s as well as one [[Dipolar bond|dative]] covalent bond. It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]], and [[isoelectronic]] with the [[cyanide]] ion and molecular [[nitrogen]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl]].

Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of [[carbon]]-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), such as when operating a [[stove]] or an [[internal combustion engine]] in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide.<ref>Thompson, Mike. [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/co/coh.htm Carbon Monoxide – Molecule of the Month], Winchester College, UK.</ref> [[Coal gas]], which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as [[blast furnace|iron smelting]], still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KQqLicqcTM8C&pg=PA36|page=36|title=Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving from Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean-Energy Future|author=Ayres, Robert U. and Ayres, Edward H. |publisher=Wharton School Publishing|year=2009|isbn=0-13-701544-5}}</ref>

Worldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reactions in the [[troposphere]] that generate about 5{{e|12}} kilograms per year.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.176.4032.290|title=Carbon Monoxide Balance in Nature|year=1972|last1=Weinstock|first1=B.|last2=Niki|first2=H.|journal=Science|volume=176|pages=290–2|pmid=5019781|issue=4032|bibcode = 1972Sci...176..290W }}</ref> Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, and other forms of combustion.

In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

==History==
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) first recorded that burning coals emanated toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smouldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician [[Galen]] (129–199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled.<ref>Penney, David G. (2000) [http://books.google.com/books?id=XsnPIfP0oBcC&pg=PA5 ''Carbon Monoxide Toxicity''], CRC Press, p. 5, ISBN 0-8493-2065-8.</ref> In 1776, the [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] de Lassone produced CO by heating [[zinc oxide]] with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was [[hydrogen]], as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] by the Scottish chemist [[William Cumberland Cruikshank]] in the year 1800.<ref>Cruickshank, W. (1801) [http://books.google.com/books?id=t4tEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false "Some observations on different hydrocarbonates and combinations of carbone with oxygen, etc. in reply to some of Dr. Priestley's late objections to the new system of chemistry,"] ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts'' [a.k.a.

During [[World War II]], a [[Wood gas|gas mixture]] including carbon monoxide was used to keep [[motor vehicle]]s running in parts of the world where [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] were scarce. External (with a few exceptions) charcoal or [[wood gas generator]]s were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and small amounts of other gases produced by [[gasification]] was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as [[wood gas]]. Carbon monoxide was also used on a small scale during [[the Holocaust]] at some [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|Nazi extermination camp]]s, the most notable by [[gas van]]s in [[Chelmno extermination camp|Chelmno]], and in the [[Action T4]] "[[euthanasia]]" program.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_04R6DoPxLoC&pg=PT323|page=323|title=A history of modern Germany, 1800–2000|author=Kitchen, Martin |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=1-4051-0041-9}}</ref>

==Molecular properties==
Carbon monoxide has a [[molar mass]] of 28.0, which makes it slightly lighter than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8. According to the [[ideal gas law]], CO is therefore less dense than air. Neither gas is "ideal", however, so neither exactly has the densities predicted by the ideal gas law.

The [[chemical bond|bond]] length between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8 [[picometre|pm]].<ref name=gilliam>{{Cite journal|author=Gilliam, O. R.; Johnson, C. M. and Gordy, W. |title=Microwave Spectroscopy in the Region from Two to Three Millimeters|year=1950|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=78|issue=2|pages=140|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.140|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..140G }}</ref><ref>{{CRC91|page=9–33}}</ref> This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>), which has a similar bond length and nearly the same [[molecular mass]].

The [[ground state|ground]] [[electronic state]] of carbon monoxide is a [[singlet state]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Highly Excited Triplet States of Carbon Monoxide| first=C. R. |last=Vidal|date=28 June 1997 |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060828201131/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html|archivedate=2006-08-28|accessdate= August 16, 2012}}</ref> since there are no unpaired electrons.

===Bonding and dipole moment===
Carbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 [[valence electron]]s in carbon monoxide. To satisfy the [[octet rule]] for the carbon, the two atoms form a [[triple bond]], with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or [[dipolar bond]]. This causes a C ← O [[Chemical polarity|polarization]] of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C → O polarization, since oxygen is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ- remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small [[bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.122 [[Debye|D]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Scuseria | first1=Gustavo E. | last2=Miller | first2=Michael D. | last3=Jensen | first3=Frank | last4=Geertsen | first4=Jan |title=The dipole moment of carbon monoxide|journal=J.

The molecule is therefore asymmetric: oxygen has more electron density than carbon, and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative. By contrast, the [[isoelectronic]] dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment.

If carbon monoxide acts as a [[Metal carbonyl|ligand]], the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end, depending on the structure of the [[coordination complex]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lupinetti | first1 = Anthony J. | last2 = Fau | first2 = Stefan | last3 = Frenking | first3 = Gernot | last4 = Strauss | first4 = Steven H. | title = Theoretical Analysis of the Bonding between CO and Positively Charged Atoms| journal = J.

The [[oxidation state]] of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count, carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.

===Atmospheric presence===
[[File:Carbon Monoxide.ogv|thumb|300px|The streak of red, orange, and yellow across [[South America]], [[Africa]], and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in this animation points to high levels of carbon monoxide on September 30, 2005.]]
[[File:Carbon Monoxide concentrations in spring..jpg|thumb|Carbon Monoxide concentrations in Northern Hemisphere spring as measured with the MOPITT instrument.]]

Carbon monoxide is present in small amounts in the atmosphere, chiefly as a product of [[volcano|volcanic activity]] but also from natural and man-made fires (such as [[forest fires|forest]] and [[bushfire]]s, burning of [[crop residue]]s, and [[sugarcane]] fire-cleaning). The burning of [[fossil fuels]] also contributes to carbon monoxide production. Carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high [[pressure]]s in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kcllhZcy53cC&pg=PA243|page=243|title=Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors|author=Sigel, Astrid and Sigel, Roland K. O. |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2009|isbn=1-84755-915-8}}</ref> Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Carbon monoxide has an indirect [[radiative forcing]] effect by elevating concentrations of [[methane]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] [[ozone]] through chemical reactions with other atmospheric constituents (e.g., the [[hydroxyl]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], OH<sup>'''.'''</sup>) that would otherwise destroy them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gnaNHeU4rgQC&pg=PA106|page=106|title=Global climate change linkages: acid rain, air quality, and stratospheric ozone|author=White, James Carrick  ''et al.''|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=0-444-01515-9}}</ref> Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]]. Carbon monoxide concentrations are both short-lived in the atmosphere and spatially variable.

In the [[atmosphere of Venus]] carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 [[nanometre|nm]].

Due to its long lifetime in the mid-troposphere, carbon monoxide is also used as tracer of transport for pollutant plumes.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5194/acp-10-10655-2010 | title = IASI carbon monoxide validation over the Arctic during POLARCAT spring and summer campaigns | year = 2010 | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = Law | first2 = K.

===Urban pollution===
Carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).

Large CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1002/grl.50704}}</ref>

====Role in ground-level ozone formation====
{{Main|Tropospheric Ozone}}
Carbon monoxide is, along with [[aldehydes]], part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form [[photochemical smog]]. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (<sup>•</sup>OH) to produce a radical intermediate <sup>•</sup>HOCO, which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O<sub>2</sub> to form [[peroxy]] radical (HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002JD002415|title=Potential for photochemical ozone formation in the troposphere over the North Atlantic as derived from aircraft observationsduring ACSOE|year=2002|author=Reeves, Claire E.; Penkett, Stuart A.; Bauguitte, Stephane; Law, Kathy S.; Evans, Mathew J.; Bandy, Brian J.; Monks, Paul S.; Edwards, Gavin D.; Phillips, Gavin; Barjat, Hannah; Kent, Joss; Dewey, Ken; Schmitgen, Sandra; Kley, Dieter|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=107|pages=4707|issue=D23|bibcode = 2002JGRD..107.4707R }}</ref> Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO) to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>) and hydroxyl radical. NO<sub>2</sub> gives O(<sup>3</sup>P) via photolysis, thereby forming O<sub>3</sub> following reaction with O<sub>2</sub>.
Since hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of NO<sub>2</sub>, the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is:
:CO + 2O<sub>2</sub> + hν → CO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>
(where hν refers to the [[photon]] of light absorbed by the NO<sub>2</sub> molecule in the sequence)

Although the creation of NO<sub>2</sub> is the critical step leading to low level [[ozone]] formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.<ref name=NA>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=QkErAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA23|page=23|title=Ozone and other photochemical oxidants|publisher=National Academies|year=1977|isbn=0-309-02531-1}}</ref>

===Indoor pollution===
In closed environments, the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products.<ref name="cpsc">U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission, [http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html Carbon Monoxide Questions and Answers], accessed 2009-12-04</ref> However, according to the Florida Department of Health, "every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning"<ref name=EPHT>{{cite web|url=http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |title=Tracking Carbon Monoxide |publisher=Environmental Public Health Tracking – Florida Dept. of Health}}</ref> These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and [[gas heater|gas]] and [[kerosene heater|kerosene]] room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20101204014524/http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/NPDSPoisonData/AnnualReports/tabid/125/Default.aspx "AAPCC Annual Data Reports 2007"]. American Association of Poison Control Centers.</ref> In 2005, the CPSC reported 94 generator-related carbon monoxide poisoning deaths.<ref name="cpsc" /> Forty-seven of these deaths were known to have occurred during power outages due to severe weather, including [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name="cpsc" /> Still others die from carbon monoxide produced by non-consumer products, such as cars left running in attached garages. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.<ref>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, [http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showCarbonMonoxideLanding.action Carbon Monoxide Poisoning], accessed 2009-12-04</ref>

===Blood presence===
Carbon monoxide is absorbed through breathing and enters the blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs. Normal circulating levels in the blood are 0% to 3%, and are higher in smokers. Carbon monoxide levels cannot be assessed through a physical exam. Laboratory testing requires a blood sample (arterial or venous) and laboratory analysis on a CO-Oximeter. Additionally, a noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) test method from Pulse CO-Oximetry exists and has been validated compared to invasive methods.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Roth D., Herkner H., Schreiber W., Hubmann N., Gamper G., Laggner A.N., Havel C.|title=Accuracy of Noninvasive Multiwave Pulse Oximetry Compared With Carboxyhemoglobin From Blood Gas Analysis in Unselected Emergency Department Patients|pmid=21459480|url=http://www.osuem.com/education/journalClub/accuracy+of+noninvasive+multiwave+pulse+ox.pdf|year=2011|volume=58|issue=1|pages=74–9|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2010.12.024|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine}}</ref>

===Astrophysics===
Outside of Earth, carbon monoxide is the second-most common molecule in the [[interstellar medium]], after [[molecular hydrogen]]. Because of its asymmetry, the carbon monoxide molecule produces far brighter [[spectral lines]] than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect. Interstellar CO was first detected with [[radio telescope]]s in 1970. It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires [[space telescopes]]. Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the [[molecular cloud]]s in which most [[star formation|stars form]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy & Astrophysics | year=1991 | volume=29 | pages=195 | author=Combes, Françoise | title=Distribution of CO in the Milky Way | doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.29.090191.001211 | bibcode=1991ARA&A..29..195C}}</ref>

==Production==
Many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide's production.<ref>Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 200. ISBN 0-12-352651-5.</ref>

===Industrial production===
A major industrial source of CO is [[producer gas]], a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. The initially produced CO<sub>2</sub> equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with carbon to give CO is described as the [[Boudouard reaction]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Higman, C; van der Burgt, M | title = Gasification | publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 12 | isbn = 0-7506-7707-4}}</ref> Above 800 °C, CO is the predominant product:

:CO<sub>2</sub> + C → 2 CO (ΔH = −221 kJ/mol)

Another source is "[[water gas]]", a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of [[steam]] and carbon:

:H<sub>2</sub>O + C → H<sub>2</sub> + CO (ΔH = +131 kJ/mol)

Other similar "[[syngas|synthesis gas]]es" can be obtained from [[natural gas]] and other fuels.

Carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal [[oxide]] [[ore]]s with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:

:MO + C → M + CO

Since CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) [[entropy]] of reaction. The [[Ellingham diagram]] shows that CO formation is favored over CO<sub>2</sub> in high temperatures.

===Laboratory preparation===
Carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[formic acid]], for example with [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name="koch" /><ref name
="coleman" /> Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered [[zinc]] metal and [[calcium carbonate]], which releases CO and leaves behind [[zinc oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]:

:Zn + CaCO<sub>3</sub> → ZnO + CaO + CO

==Coordination chemistry==
{{Main|metal carbonyl}}

[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-HOMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]] of CO is a σ [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]
[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-LUMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]] of CO is a π*[[antibonding]] [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]

Most metals form [[coordination complex]]es containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide [[ligands]]. This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate [[back-donation]] from the metal d<sub>xz</sub>-orbital, to the π*[[molecular orbital]] from CO. The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO, also donates electron density to the d<sub>x²−y²</sub> on the metal to form a [[sigma bond]]. This electron donation is also exhibited with the [[cis effect]], or the labilization of CO ligands in the cis position. In [[nickel carbonyl]], Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and [[nickel]] metal at room temperature. For this reason, nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide (corrosion). [[Nickel carbonyl]] decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method is used for the industrial purification of [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Mond L, Langer K, Quincke F| title= Action of carbon monoxide on nickel| journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|year=1890| pages=749–753|doi = 10.1039/CT8905700749| volume= 57}}</ref>

In nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls, the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal; the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal. In these situations, carbon monoxide is called the '''carbonyl''' [[ligand]]. One of the most important metal carbonyls is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>:

[[Image:IronPentacarbonylStructure.png|150px|Structure of iron pentacarbonyl.]]
[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-3D-balls.png|120px|Iron pentacarbonyl.]]

Many metal-CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, [[iridium(III) chloride|iridium trichloride]] and [[triphenylphosphine]] react in boiling [[2-Methoxyethanol|2-methoxyethanol]] or [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] to afford [[Vaska's complex|IrCl(CO)(PPh<SUB>3</SUB>)<SUB>2</SUB>]].

Metal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using [[infrared spectroscopy of metal carbonyls|infrared spectroscopy]].

==Organic and main group chemistry==
In the presence of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with [[alkenes]] to form [[carboxylic acids]] in a process known as the Koch–Haaf reaction.<ref name = koch>{{OrgSynth|author=Koch, H.; Haaf, W.|title=1-Adamantanecarboxylic Acid|year=1973|collvol=5|collvolpages=20|prep=cv5p0020}}</ref> In the [[Gattermann–Koch reaction]], [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|arenes]] are converted to [[benzaldehyde]] derivatives in the presence of [[aluminium chloride|AlCl<sub>3</sub>]] and [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]].<ref name = coleman>{{OrgSynth|title=''p''-Tolualdehyde|author=Coleman, G. H. and Craig, David |collvol=2|collvolpages=583|year=1943|prep=cv2p0583}}</ref> Organolithium compounds (e.g. [[butyl lithium]]) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.

Although CO reacts with [[carbocation]]s and [[carbanion]]s, it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts.<ref>Chatani, N.; Murai, S. "Carbon Monoxide" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}</ref>

With main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. [[halogenation|Chlorination]] of CO is the industrial route to the important compound [[phosgene]]. With [[borane]] CO forms an adduct, H<sub>3</sub>BCO, which is [[isoelectronic]] with the [[acylium]] cation [H<sub>3</sub>CCO]<sup>+</sup>. CO reacts with [[sodium]] to give products resulting from C-C coupling such as [[acetylenediol|sodium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|Na|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}. It reacts with molten [[potassium]] to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, [[acetylenediol|potassium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|K|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}, [[benzenehexol|potassium benzenehexolate]] 6{{chem|K|+}} {{chem|C|6|O|6|6-}},<ref name="wbuechIV">{{cite journal | last1 = Büchner | first1 = W. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = E. | title = Zur Kenntnis der sogenannten "Alkalicarbonyle" IV[1] Über die Reaktion von geschmolzenem Kalium mit Kohlenmonoxid | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume =47 |issue =6 |pages =1415–1423 | year = 1964 |doi=10.1002/hlca.19640470604}}

The compounds [[cyclohexanehexone]] or triquinoyl (C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) and [[cyclopentanepentone]] or leuconic acid (C<sub>5</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide.

At pressures of over 5 [[pascal (unit)|gigapascals]], carbon monoxide converts into a [[polycarbonyl|solid polymer of carbon and oxygen]].  This is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is a powerful explosive.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150659a007|title=New phases and chemical reactions in solid carbon monoxide under pressure|year=1984|last1=Katz|first1=Allen I.|last2=Schiferl|first2=David|last3=Mills|first3=Robert L.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|pages=3176|issue=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/cm0524446|title=Pressure-Induced Polymerization of Carbon Monoxide: Disproportionation and Synthesis of an Energetic Lactonic Polymer|year=2006|last1=Evans|first1=W.

==Uses==

===Chemical industry===
Carbon monoxide is an [[industrial gas]] that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elschenbroich |first1=C. |last2=Salzer |first2=A. |title=Organometallics: A Concise Introduction |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=3-527-28165-7}}</ref> Large quantities of [[aldehydes]] are produced by the [[hydroformylation]] reaction of [[alkene]]s, carbon monoxide, and H<sub>2</sub>. Hydroformylation is coupled to the [[Shell Higher Olefin Process]] to give precursors to [[detergent]]s.

[[Phosgene]], useful for preparing isocyanates, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes, is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and [[chlorine]] gas through a bed of porous [[activated carbon]], which serves as a [[catalyst]].  World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann's| author1 = Wolfgang Schneider | author2 =  Werner Diller | title = Phosgene | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_411}}</ref>
:CO + Cl<sub>2</sub> → COCl<sub>2</sub>
[[Methanol]] is produced by the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows [[coal]] or biomass to be converted to diesel.

In the [[Monsanto process]], carbon monoxide and [[methanol]] react in the presence of a homogeneous [[rhodium]] [[catalyst]] and [[hydroiodic acid]] to give [[acetic acid]]. This process is responsible for most of the industrial production of [[acetic acid]].

An industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].

===Meat coloring===
Carbon monoxide is used in [[modified atmosphere]] packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with [[myoglobin]] to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment [[metmyoglobin]]. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat.<ref name="Meatsci1999_SORHEIM">{{Cite journal|author=Sorheim, S, Nissena, H, Nesbakken, T|title=The storage life of beef and pork packaged in an atmosphere with low carbon monoxide and high carbon dioxide|journal=Journal of Meat Science|year=1999|pages=157–164|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0309-1740(98)00163-6}}</ref> Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.

The technology was first given "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) status by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling. In 2004 the FDA approved CO as primary packaging method, declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor.<ref name="Meatsci2005_eilert">{{Cite journal|author=Eilert EJ|title=New packaging technologies for the 21st century|journal=Journal of Meat Science |year=2005|pages=122–127|volume=71|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.003}}</ref> Despite this ruling, the process remains controversial for fears that it masks spoilage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/article.asp?id=644&sub=sub1|author= Huffman, Randall D. |title=Low-Oxygen Packaging with CO: A Study in Food Politics That Warrants Peer Review|publisher=FoodSafetyMagazine.com|accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref> In 2007 a bill<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.3115:|title=Carbon Monoxide Treated Meat, Poultry, and Seafood Safe Handling, Labeling, and Consumer Protection Act (Introduced in House)|work=The Library of Congress}}</ref> was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] to label modified atmosphere carbon monoxide packaging as a color additive, but the bill died in subcommittee.

===Medicine===
In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,<ref name = verma/><ref name="nytimes.com" /> as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.<ref name="Li2009" /> However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.

There is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.<ref name="nytimes.com" />

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}</ref>

===Lasers===

Carbon monoxide has also been used as a [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in high-powered infrared [[laser]]s.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1117/2.1201112.004016}}</ref>
