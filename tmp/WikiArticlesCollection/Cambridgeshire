'''Cambridgeshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ʃ|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|m|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ʃ|ɪər}}; also known, archaically, as the '''County of Cambridge'''; abbreviated '''Cambs.''') is a [[Counties of England|county]] in [[England]], bordering [[Lincolnshire]] to the north, [[Norfolk]] to the northeast, [[Suffolk]] to the east, [[Essex]] and [[Hertfordshire]] to the south, and [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]] to the west.  The city of [[Cambridge]] is the [[county town]]. Modern Cambridgeshire was formed from the historic counties of Cambridgeshire and [[Huntingdonshire]], together with the [[Isle of Ely]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]]; it contains most of the region known as [[Silicon Fen]].

Cambridgeshire is [[Twin towns|twinned]] with [[Viersen (district)|Kreis Viersen]] in [[Germany]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cambridgeshire}}
Cambridgeshire is noted as the site of some of the earliest known [[Neolithic]] permanent settlements in the [[United Kingdom]], along with sites at [[Fengate]] and [[Balbridie]].

Cambridgeshire was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as "Grantbridgeshire" (or rather ''Grentebrigescire'') (cf the river Granta).
Covering a large part of [[East Anglia]], Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications.  In 1888 when [[county council]]s were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for
*the area in the south around Cambridge, and
*the liberty of the [[Isle of Ely]].
In 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely]].<ref>The Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Order 1964 (SI 1964/366), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)]], ''Report and Proposals for the East Midlands General Review Area'' (Report No.3), 31 July 1961 and ''Report and Proposals for the Lincolnshire and East Anglia General Review Area'' (Report No.9), 7 May 1965</ref>
Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] this merged with the county to the west, [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]] (which had itself been created in 1965 by the merger of [[Huntingdonshire]] with the [[Soke of Peterborough]] – previously a part of [[Northamptonshire]] which had its own county council).  The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.<ref>[[wikisource:The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972]] (SI 1972/2039) Part 5: County of Cambridgeshire</ref>

Since 1998, the [[City of Peterborough]] has been a separately administered area, as a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]], but is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]], and functions such as policing and the fire service.<ref>[http://www.legialtion.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878 The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon & Thurrock, Blackburn & Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling & Rushcliffe, Dartford & Gravesham, Gillingham & Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton & Warrington, Huntingdonshire & Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995</ref>

In 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's [[county flower]] as the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]].

A great quantity of [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds from the [[Stone Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] were made in [[East Cambridgeshire]]. Most items were found in [[Isleham]].

The [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]] (or [[Cambridgeshire Regiment|Fen Tigers]]) county based army unit fought in South Africa, First World War and Second World War.

Due to its flat terrain and proximity to the continent, many airfields were built for [[RAF Bomber Command]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], and the [[USAAF]] during the Second World War.  In recognition of this, the only American Second World War burial ground in England is located in Madingley [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]].

Most English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a [[Tyke (dialect)|Tyke]] from [[Yorkshire]] and a [[Yellowbelly (Lincolnshire)|Yellowbelly]] from [[Lincolnshire]]; the traditional [[nickname]]s for people from Cambridgeshire are 'Cambridgeshire Camel' or 'Cambridgeshire Crane', referring to the wildfowl which were once abundant in the fens. The term 'Fenners' has been applied to those who come from the flat country to the north of Cambridge; however in recent times this term is considered to be abusive and its use is now less widespread.

Original historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by [[Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies]].

==Climate==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
Cambridgeshire has a maritime temperate climate which is broadly similar to the rest of the United Kingdom, though it is drier than the UK average due to its low altitude and easterly location, the prevailing southwesterly winds having already deposited moisture on higher ground further west. Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to Cambridgeshire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover. It reaches 25C on around 10 days each year, and is comparable to parts of Kent and East Anglia.

==Culture==

===Sports===
Association Football (the biggest sport in the world) was invented in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire on what is now known as Parker's Piece in the middle of town.  This is the earliest version of Association Football that has ever existed and the rules still exist today.  Folklore dictates that there are 11 men on each team because when the game was invented, there were eleven trees on either side of Parker's Piece.  In commemoration of the creation of Football; a statue is to be raised in the middle of the park where the game was invented.  Despite this however, the "home" of football is said to be Wembley, London for two reasons.  1) It is in the capital city of England and 2) It is where England's national team play.
