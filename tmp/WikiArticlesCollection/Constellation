In modern [[astronomy]], a '''constellation''' is an internationally defined area of the [[celestial sphere]]. These areas are grouped around [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] (which themselves are generally referred to in non-technical language as "constellations"), which are patterns formed by prominent stars within apparent proximity to one another on Earth's [[night sky]].

There are also numerous [[former constellations|historical constellations]] not recognized by the IAU or constellations recognized in regional traditions of astronomy or [[astrology]], such as [[Chinese constellation|Chinese]], [[Indian astronomy|Hindu]] and [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy|Australian Aboriginal]].

==Terminology==
The [[Late Latin]] term ''constellātiō'' can be translated as "set with stars".
The term was first used in [[astrology]], of asterisms that supposedly exerted influence, attested in [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (4th century).
In [[Middle English|English]] the term was used from the 14th century, also in astrology, of conjunctions of [[planet (astrology)|planets]].
The modern astronomical sense of "area of the celestial sphere around a specific asterism" dates to the mid 16th century.

Colloquial usage does not distinguish the senses of "asterism" and "area surrounding an asterism". The modern system of constellations used in astronomy focuses primarily on constellations as grid-like segments of the celestial sphere rather than as patterns, while the term for a star-pattern is [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. For example, the asterism known as the [[Big Dipper]] corresponds to the seven brightest stars of the larger IAU constellation of [[Ursa Major]].

The term [[circumpolar constellation]] is used for any constellation that, from a particular latitude on Earth, never sets below the horizon. From the [[north pole]], all constellations north of the [[celestial equator]] are circumpolar constellations. In the northern latitudes, the informal term ''equatorial constellation'' has sometimes been used for constellations that lie to the south of the circumpolar constellations.<ref name=steele1884/> Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations can include those that lie entirely between declinations 45° north and 45° south,<ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/> or those that pass overhead between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. They generally include all constellations that intersect the celestial equator.

==History==
{{further|Former constellations|History of the constellations}}
The current list of 88 constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] since 1922 is based on the 48 listed by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' in the 2nd century.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/constellations/| title = The Constellations| author = International Astronomical Union}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm| title = Constellation names, abbreviations and sizes| author = Ian Ridpath}}</ref>
Ptolemy's catalogue is informed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century BC who introduced earlier [[Babylonian astronomy]] to the Hellenistic culture. Of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy, thirty can be shown to have a much longer history, reaching back into at least the [[Late Bronze Age]]{{cn|date=August 2013}}. This concerns the [[zodiacal constellations]] in particular.

===Ancient Near East===
{{See also|Babylonian star catalogues|MUL.APIN}}
The oldest catalogues of stars and constellations are from [[Babylonian astronomy#Old Babylonian astronomy|Old Babylonian astronomy]], beginning in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]. The numerous [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] names in these catalogues suggest that they build on older, but otherwise unattested, [[Sumer]]ian traditions of the [[Early Bronze Age]].
The classical [[Zodiac]] is a product of a revision of the Old Babylonian system in later [[Neo-Babylonian]] astronomy 6th century BC.
Knowledge of the Neo-Babylonian zodiac is also reflected in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. [[E. W. Bullinger]] interpreted the creatures appearing in the books of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] (and thence in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]) as the middle signs of the four quarters of the Zodiac,<ref>E.W. Bullinger, ''The Witness of the Stars''</ref><ref>D. James Kennedy, ''The Real Meaning of the Zodiac''.</ref> with the Lion as [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], the Bull is [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], the Man representing Aquarius and the Eagle standing in for Scorpio.<ref>Richard Hinckley Allen, ''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning'', Vol. 1 (New York: Dover Publications, 1899, p. 213-215.) argued for ''Scorpio'' having previously been called ''Eagle''.</ref>
The biblical [[Book of Job]] also makes reference to a number of constellations, including  {{lang|he|עיש ''`Ayish''}} "bier",  {{lang|he| כסיל ''Kĕciyl''}} "fool"  and {{lang|he| כימה ''Kiymah''}} "heap" (Job 9:9, 38:31-32), rendered as "Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades" by the [[KJV]], but ''`Ayish'' "the bier" actually corresponding to [[Ursa Major]].<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H5906&t=KJV Gesenius, ''Hebrew Lexicon'']</ref> The term ''[[Mazzaroth]]'' {{lang|he|מַזָּרוֹת}}, a ''[[hapax legomenon]]'' in Job 38:32, may be the Hebrew word for the zodiacal constellations.

The Greeks adopted the Babylonian system in the 4th century BC. A total of twenty Ptolemaic constellations are directly continued from the Ancient Near East. Another ten have the same stars but different names.<ref>''The Origin of the Greek Constellations'', by [[Bradley E. Schaefer]]. [[Scientific American]], November 2006.</ref>

===Greco-Roman===
There is only limited information on indigenous Greek constellations. Some evidence is found in [[Hesiod]].{{clarify|date=September 2011}}
Greek astronomy essentially adopted the older Babylonian system in the [[Hellenistic era]], first introduced to Greece by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the 4th century BC.
The original work of Eudoxus is lost, but it survives as a versification by [[Aratus]], dating to the 3rd century BC.
The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [[pseudo-Eratosthenes]] and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[[Hyginus]].

The basis of western astronomy as taught during [[Late Antiquity]] and until the [[Early Modern period]] is the ''[[Almagest]]'' by [[Ptolemy]], written in the 2nd century.

===Classical Chinese constellations===
{{Main|Chinese constellation}}
{{further|Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era}}
In classical [[Chinese astronomy]], the northern sky is divided geometrically, into five "enclosures" and [[twenty-eight mansions]] along the ecliptic, grouped into [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four Symbols]] of seven asterisms each.
The 28 lunar mansions are one of the most important and also the most ancient structures in the Chinese sky, attested from the 5th century BC.
Parallels to the earliest Babylonian (Sumerian) star catalogues suggest that the ancient Chinese system did not arise independently from that of the [[Ancient Near west and East]].<ref>Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han'', vol. 38 of Sinica Leidensia, BRILL, 1997, ISBN 978-90-04-10737-3, p. 18, note 9.</ref>
Classical Chinese astronomy is recorded in the [[Han period]] and appears in the form of three schools, which are attributed to astronomers of the [[Zhanguo period]]. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by [[Chen Zhuo]], an astronomer of the 3rd century ([[Three Kingdoms period]]).
Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in [[Tang period]] records, notably by [[Qutan Xida]].
The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to the Tang period and was preserved as part of the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]]. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the [[Song Dynasty]], and during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] became increasingly influenced by [[medieval Islamic astronomy]].<ref>Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han'', vol. 38 of Sinica Leidensia, BRILL, 1997, ISBN 978-90-04-10737-3, chapter 2, 15-36.</ref>

===Early Modern era===
The constellations around the South Pole were not observable from north of the equator, by Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese or Arabs.

The modern constellations in this region were defined during the [[age of exploration]], notably by  Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] at the end of sixteenth century.
They were  depicted by Johann Bayer in his [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title = Bayer's southern star chart| author = Ian Ridpath}}</ref> Several more were created by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] in his star catalogue, published in 1756.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title = Lacaille's southern planisphere| author = Ian Ridpath}}</ref>

Some modern proposals for new constellations were not successful; an example is  [[Quadrans Muralis|Quadrans]], eponymous of the [[Quadrantid]] meteors, now divided between [[Boötes]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].
The classical constellation of [[Argo Navis]]  was broken up into several different constellations, for the convenience of stellar cartographers.

By the end of the [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Xu Guangqi]] introduced  23 asterisms of the southern sky based on the knowledge of western star charts.<ref>{{cite book | last=Sun | first=Xiaochun | editor=Helaine Selin | editor-link=Helaine Selin | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | year=1997 | pages=910 | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn=0-7923-4066-3 (HB)}}</ref> These asterisms have since been incorporated into the traditional Chinese star maps.

==IAU constellations==
{{constellations_ecliptic_equirectangular_plot.svg}}
In 1922, [[Henry Norris Russell]] aided the IAU (International Astronomical Union) in dividing the celestial sphere into 88 official constellations.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm| title = The original names and abbreviations for constellations from 1922. | accessdate = 2010-01-31}}</ref> Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] or [[Scorpius]].
The aim of this system is area-mapping, i.e. the division of the celestial sphere into contiguous fields.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.iau.org/public/constellations//| title = The IAU on constellations| accessdate = 2010-01-31}}</ref>
Out of the 88 modern constellations, 36 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 52 predominantly in the southern.

In 1930, the boundaries between the 88 constellations were devised by [[Eugène Delporte]] along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm| title = Constellation boundaries. | accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> However, the data he used originated back to [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which was when [[Benjamin A. Gould]] first made the proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date is that due to the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the [[equinox]]es, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [[J2000]], are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.<ref>A.C. Davenhall & S.K. Leggett, [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/VI/49/constell.pdf "A Catalogue of Constellation Boundary Data"], (Centre de Donneés astronomiques de Strasbourg, February 1990).</ref> This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

==Asterisms==
[[File:Starry night at Mount Everest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Much of the dark space between stars, as seen in the sky of the image above, is due to the human eye's low light sensitivity. Other images (like the [[Hubble Deep Field]] – not pictured) detect far more stars.]]
{{main|Asterism (astronomy)}}
The stars of the main asterism within a constellation are usually given Greek letters in their order of brightness, the so-called [[Bayer designation]] introduced by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603.
A total of 1,564 stars are so identified, out of approximately 10,000 stars visible to the [[naked eye]].<ref>The [[Bright Star Catalogue]] lists 9,110 objects of the night sky which are visible to the naked eye ([[apparent magnitude]] of 6.5 or brighter). 9,096 of these are stars, all of them well within [[Milky Way|our galaxy]].</ref>

The brightest stars, usually the stars that make up the constellation's eponymous asterism,  also retain proper names, often from Arabic.
For example, the "Little Dipper" asterism of the constellation [[Ursa Minor]] has ten stars with Bayer designation, [[α UMi]] to [[π UMi]]. Of these ten stars, seven have a proper name, viz.
[[Polaris]] (α UMi), [[Kochab]] (β UMi), [[Pherkad]] (γ UMi), [[Yildun]] (δ UMi), [[Urodelus]] (ε UMi), [[Ahfa al Farkadain]]     (ζ UMi) and [[Anwar al Farkadain]]  (η UMi).

The stars within an asterism rarely have any substantial astrophysical relationship to each other, and their apparent proximity when viewed from Earth disguises the fact that they are far apart, some being much farther from Earth than others. However, there are some exceptions: many of the stars in the constellation of [[Ursa Major]] (including most of the [[Big Dipper]]) are genuinely close to one another, travel through the [[galaxy]] with similar [[proper motion|velocities]], and are likely to have formed together as part of a [[star cluster|cluster]] that is slowly dispersing. These stars form the [[Ursa Major moving group]].

==Dark cloud constellations==
[[File:Emu public.jpg|frame|The "[[Emu]] in the sky," a constellation defined by dark clouds rather than the stars. An IAU interpretation would recognise [[Crux]] (the Southern Cross) above the emu's head and [[Scorpius]] on the left. The head of the emu is the [[Coalsack]].]]
{{further|Great Rift (astronomy)}}

The Great Rift, a series of dark patches in the [[Milky Way]], is more visible and striking in the [[southern hemisphere]] than in the northern. It vividly stands out when conditions are otherwise so dark that the Milky Way's central region casts shadows on the ground. Some cultures have discerned shapes in these patches and have given names to these "dark cloud constellations." Members of the [[Inca]] civilization identified various dark areas or [[dark nebula]]e in the [[Milky Way]] as animals, and associated their appearance with the seasonal rains.<ref>[http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/andes/inca.nightsky.html The Incan View of the Night Sky]</ref> [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]] also describes dark cloud constellations, the most famous being the "emu in the sky" whose head is formed by the [[Coalsack]].
