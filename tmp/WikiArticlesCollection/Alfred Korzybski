'''Alfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski''' ({{IPAc-pl|k|o|'|rz|y|p|s|k|i}}; July 3, 1879 &ndash; March 1, 1950) was a [[Polish-American]] [[philosopher]] and [[scientist]]. He is remembered for developing the theory of [[general semantics]]. Korzybski's work argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and by the structure of language.

Korzybski thought that people do not have access to direct knowledge of reality; rather they have access to perceptions and to a set of beliefs which human society has confused with direct knowledge of reality. Korzybski is remembered as the author of the dictum: "[[The map is not the territory]]".

==Early life and career==
[[File:Herb Abdank.svg|thumb|right|100px|Alfred Korzybski's family coat-of-arms (see [[Abdank coat of arms]]).]]
Korzybski was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] which at that time was part of the  [[Russian Empire]].  He was part of an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] Polish family whose members had worked as [[Mathematics|mathematicians]], [[Science|scientists]], and [[Engineering|engineers]] for generations.  He learned the [[Polish language]] at home and the [[Russian language]] in schools; and having a [[France|French]] [[governess]] and a [[Germany|German]] governess, he became fluent in these four languages as a child.

Korzybski was educated at the [[Warsaw University of Technology]] in engineering. During the [[World War I|First World War]] Korzybski served as an [[Military intelligence|intelligence officer]] in the [[Russia]]n Army. After being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries, he moved to North America in 1916 (first to [[Canada]], then the [[United States]]) to coordinate the shipment of [[artillery]] to Russia. He also lectured to Polish-American audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of [[war bonds]]. After the War, he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] in 1940. He met Mira Edgerly,<ref>http://american-miniatures20c.blogspot.com/2007/06/edgerly-mira-portrait-of-three-sisters.html</ref> a painter of portraits on ivory, shortly after the Armistice, and married her in January, 1919. Their marriage lasted until his death.

His first book, ''Manhood of Humanity'', was published in 1921. In the book, he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a "[[General semantics#The major premises|time-binding]]" class of life (humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which are accreted in cultures).

==General semantics==
Korzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named [[general semantics]] (GS). As Korzybski said, GS should not be confused with [[semantics]], a different subject. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication <cite>''Science and Sanity''</cite>, published in 1933. After the publication of ''Science and Sanity'' he traveled about teaching briefly in many schools and universities. In 1938 Korzybski founded the [[Institute of General Semantics]] in Chicago.<ref>http://www.generalsemantics.org/about-us/history/</ref> The post-World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the Institute's building lease, so in 1946, he moved the Institute to [[Lakeville (Salisbury, Connecticut)|Lakeville, Connecticut]], [[United States|USA]], where he directed it until his death in 1950.

Korzybski's work maintained that human beings are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the [[structure]] of their languages. Human beings cannot experience the world directly, but only through their "abstractions" (nonverbal impressions or "gleanings" derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). Sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the "facts" with which we must deal. Our understanding of what is happening sometimes lacks ''similarity of structure'' with what is actually happening.

He stressed training in awareness of abstracting, using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, "consciousness of abstracting".

His system included modifying the way we consider the world, e.g., with an attitude of "I don't know; let's see," to better discover or reflect its realities as revealed by modern science. One of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience that he termed, "silence on the objective levels".

=="To be"==
Many devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form "is" of the more general verb "to be."<ref>Alfred Korzybski, ''Selections from Science and Sanity'', 2010.</ref> His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different "orders of abstraction," and formulations such as "consciousness of abstracting." It is often said{{Request quotation|date=September 2012}} that Korzybski ''opposed'' the use of the verb "to be," which is a profound exaggeration (see "Criticisms" below).

He thought that ''certain uses'' of the verb "to be", called the "is of identity" and the "is of [[E-prime#The different functions of .27to be.27|predication]]", were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, "Elizabeth is a fool" (said of a person named "Elizabeth" who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to ''deny'' identity; in this example, to be aware continually that "Elizabeth" is ''not'' what we ''call'' her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, "[[Map-territory relation|the map is not the territory]]". Note that this premise uses the phrase "is not", a form of "to be"; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon "to be" as such. In fact, he  said explicitly{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} that there were no structural problems with the verb "to be" when used as an [[E-prime#The different functions of .27to be.27|auxiliary verb]] or when used to state existence or location.

It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb "to be," as long as one was aware of their structural limitations. This was developed into the language "[[E-Prime]]" by D. David Bourland, Jr. 15 years after his death (E-Prime a form of the English language in which the verb "to be" does not appear in any of its forms; for example, the sentence "the movie was good" could translate into E-Prime as "I liked the movie", thereby distinguishing opinion from fact).

==Anecdotes==
One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. "Nice biscuit, don't you think," said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words "Dog Cookies." The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. "You see," Korzybski remarked, "I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter."<ref>R. Diekstra, ''Haarlemmer Dagblad'', 1993, cited by L. Derks & J. Hollander, ''Essenties van NLP'' (Utrecht: Servire, 1996), p. 58.</ref>

[[William Burroughs]] went to a Korzybski workshop in the Autumn of 1939. He was 25 years old, and paid $40. His fellow students—there were 38 in all—included young [[Samuel I. Hayakawa]] (later to become a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[U.S. Senate]]), Ralph Moriarty deBit (later to become the spiritual teacher [[Vitvan]]) and Wendell Johnson (founder of the [[Monster Study]]).<ref>http://nakedlunch.org/naked-lunch/space-time-travel/naked-lunch-and-chicago/seminal-semantics-antics/</ref>

== Reception ==
{{see also|General Semantics#Criticism}}
Korzybski was well received in numerous disciplinary realms, as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading persons in the sciences and humanities in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Individuals Influenced by General Semantics|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/the-general-semantics-learning-center/overview-of-general-semantics/notable-individuals/|publisher=The Institute of General Semantics}}</ref>

Some of the persons listed are, like Korzybski, [[polymath]]s and several categories apply to them. For example, Heinlein was the  "dean of science fiction writers" because he was "the scientist" of science fiction.

As reported in the Third Edition of ''Science and Sanity'', The U.S. Army in World War II used Korzybski's system to treat battle fatigue in Europe with the supervision of Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the Nazi prisoners at Nuremberg.

Some of the General Semantics tradition was continued by [[Samuel I. Hayakawa]], who had a dispute with Korzybski. When asked because of what, Hayakawa is said to have replied: "Words." {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Writers and artists===
The general semantics concept [[Non-Aristotelian logic#Use in science fiction|"non-Aristotelian logic", influenced the science fiction]] of the most prolific, best selling, influential authors of the genre during its flowering and height.   General semantics has helped guide the thinking of artists contemplating what to say to society, or how to study society, influencing a notable lyricist, a filmmaker, and other writers.

* [[Kenneth Burke]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.umn.edu/burke/gm.html|title=A Grammar of Motives |first=Kenneth |last=Burke |year=1945|publisher=University of California Press|quote=[Burke] would encourage the "delayed response" (p.238). Korzybski’s technique recommends that an individual interpose a "moment of delay" between the "Stimulus and the Response" in order to control meaning (p.239). According to Burke, Korzybski’s doctrine of the delayed action, as based on the ‘consciousness of abstracting,’ involves the fact that any term for an object puts the object in a class of similar objects" (p.240). Burke points out that Korzybski’s technique falls short with regard to the "analysis of poetic forms": "For ‘semantics’ is essentially scientist, an approach to language in terms of knowledge, whereas poetic forms are kinds of action" (p.240).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|year=1945|publisher=University of California Press|pages=238–242}}</ref> literary theorist, linguist
*: But Burke also points out that the concepts of "incipient" and "delayed action" exist in the works of [[I. A. Richard]] and [[George Herbert Mead]] as well, and that although Korzybski analyzes knowing, he doesn't fully analyze doing.  Burke wrote the book on ''[[Language As Symbolic Action]]''.
