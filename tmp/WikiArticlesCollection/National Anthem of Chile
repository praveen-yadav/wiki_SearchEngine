The '''[[National Anthem]] of [[Chile]]''' ({{lang-es|'''Himno Nacional de Chile'''|links=no}}) is also known as '''''Canción Nacional''''' (National Song). It has a history of two lyrics and two melodies that made up three different versions. The current version was composed by [[Ramón Carnicer]], with words by Eusebio Lillo, and has six parts plus the chorus.

== First National Anthem ==
The first Chilean National Anthem dates back to 1819, when the government called for, on the 19th of July, the creation of music and lyrics for this purpose.

The composer Manuel Robles and the poet Bernardo de Vera y Pintado fulfilled this mandate and their "National Song" debuted on 20 August 1820 in the Domingo Arteaga theater, although other historians claim that it was played and sung during the festivities of September 1819.

In the beginning, everyone would stand for the song. O'Higgins and Freire listened to it with respect and full of emotion, for they had marched to victory to its tune more than once.

The custom of always singing it at the theater slowly disappeared, until it was ordered that it only be sung at the anniversary of the country.

The doctor Bernardo Vera, known in the history of the independence, was the author of the verses that were sung to Robles' music.

This first hymn was sung until 1828,<ref>[http://www.nationalanthems.info/cl-47.htm first hymn original lyric 1819-1847]</ref><ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_5fkM1Ov-8&feature=related first original hymn Full lyric 1819-1847]</ref> when it was replaced with what is sung today.

== Second National Anthem ==

The second Chilean National Anthem was composed by the Spanish composer Ramón Carnicer, when he was exiled in England because of his liberal ideas. Mariano Egaña, Chilean Minister in London, acting on the criticism that Robles' song was receiving, asked Carnicer to compose a new hymn with Bernardo de Vera's original text.

The Spanish musician probably wrote the work by 1827, the date he returned to Barcelona, and his hymn debuted in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], in the Arteaga theater, 23 December 1828.

Years later, in 1847, the Chilean government entrusted the young poet Eusebio Lillo with a new text that would replace the anti-Spain poem of Vera y Pintado, and after being analyzed by [[Andrés Bello]], retained the original chorus ("''Dulce patria, recibe los votos...''"). The lyrics were slightly revised in 1903.

During the military government (1973–1990) of [[Augusto Pinochet]], the Verse III was officially incorporated because of his praise of the armed forces and the national police (Carabiners). After that, in 1990, it was eliminated from the anthem and only sung in military events as part of the full song. Supporters from the former military regime also sing the anthem with the Verse III in private ceremonies and rallies.

In the celebrations marking the return of democracy in March 1990 at Santiago's [[Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos]], the anthem was played in its present melody, raised to F Major (the Royal Musical Official Version of the anthem) which is the original melody of the second anthem by Carnicer, but using the 1847 lyrics as text, save for the original chorus of the 1819 anthem. This was the version that from 1991 to 2013 was played during [[sign-on]] and [[sign-off]] broadcasts of Chilean television stations. Now the anthem is played in C Major during sign-on and sign-off.

[[Joe Walsh]], famed musician who was part of the United States rock band the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], sang the National Anthem of Chile at a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball game in 2003.

== Official version lyrics ==
Below are the lyrics of the version most often played; it corresponds to Verse V of the full version and the chorus:

Puro, Chile, es tu cielo azulado.<br />
Puras brisas te cruzan también.<br />
Y tu campo de flores bordado<br />
Es la copia feliz del Edén.<br />
Majestuosa es la blanca montaña<br />
Que te dio por baluarte el Señor<br />
Que te dio por baluarte el Señor,<br />
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña<br />
Te promete un futuro esplendor<br />
Y ese mar que tranquilo te baña<br />
Te promete un futuro esplendor.

'''Coro'''<br />
Dulce Patria, recibe los votos<br />
Con que Chile en tus aras juró:<br />
Que o la tumba serás de los libres<br />
O el asilo contra la opresión<br />
Que o la tumba serás de los libres<br />
O el asilo contra la opresión<br />
Que o la tumba serás de los libres<br />
O el asilo contra la opresión<br />
O el asilo contra la opresión<br />
O el asilo contra la opresión.

Pure, Chile, is your blue sky<br />
Pure breezes cross you as well<br />
And your flower-embroidered fields<br />
Are the happy copy of Eden<br />
Majestic is the white colored mountain<br />
That was given to you as a bastion by the Lord<br />
That was given to you as a bastion by the Lord<br />
And that sea that quietly washes your shore<br />
Promises you a future splendor<br />
And that sea that quietly washes your shore<br />
Promises you a future splendor

'''Chorus'''<br />
Sweet Fatherland accept the vows<br />
With which Chile swore at your altars<br />
Either the tomb of the free you will be<br />
Or the refuge against oppression<br />
Either the tomb of the free you will be<br />
Or the refuge against oppression<br />
Either the tomb of the free you will be<br />
Or the refuge against oppression<br />
Or the refuge against oppression<br />
Or the refuge against oppression<br />

<poem>
Ha cesado la lucha sangrienta;
ya es hermano el que ayer invasor;
de tres siglos lavamos la afrenta
combatiendo en el campo de honor.
El que ayer doblegábase esclavo
hoy ya libre y triunfante se ve;
libertad es la herencia del bravo,
la Victoria se humilla a su pie.
</poem>

<poem>
The bloody fight has ceased; 
and yesterdays invader is now our brother;
three centuries we washed the affront
fighting in the field of honor.
That who yesterday was a slave
is free and triumphant today;
freedom is the heritage of the brave,
Victory lies shameful to his feet.

Alza, Chile, sin mancha la frente;
conquistaste tu nombre en la lid;
siempre noble, constante y valiente
te encontraron los hijos del Cid.
Que tus libres tranquilos coronen
a las artes, la industria y la paz,
y de triunfos cantares entonen
que amedrenten al déspota audaz.

Rise, Chile, with a spotless forehead;
you conquered your name on the fight;

to intimidate the daring despot.

Vuestros nombres, valientes soldados,

Sean ellos el grito de muerte

y sonando en la boca del fuerte
hagan siempre al tirano temblar.

Your names, brave soldiers
who have been Chile's mainstay,

they always make the tyrant tremble.

Si pretende el cañón extranjero

Con su sangre el altivo araucano

y no tiembla la espada en la mano
defendiendo, de Chile, el honor.

If the foreign cannon intends
to invade, daring, our people;

With its blood the proud araucanian
inherited its courage to us;
and the sword doesn't tremble in the hand
of that who defends the honour of Chile.

Esas galas, ¡oh, Patria!, esas flores
