{{Nihongo|'''''Bubble Bobble'''''|バブルボブル|Baburu Boburu}} is an [[arcade game]] by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]], first released in 1986 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7222 |title=Bubble Bobble Video Game by Taito (1986)| publisher=klov.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}</ref> and later [[porting|ported]] to numerous [[home computer]]s and [[Video game console|game console]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/bubble-bobble-games |title=Bubble Bobble Games| publisher=mobygames.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}</ref> The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons {{nihongo|'''Bub''' ''(Bubblun)''|バブルン|Baburun}} and {{nihongo|'''Bob''' ''(Bobblun)''|ボブルン|Boburun}}, is an action-platform game in which players travel through one hundred different stages, blowing and bursting [[Liquid bubble|bubbles]], dodging enemies and collecting a variety of items.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The game became very popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from Robots, among other enemies. It is also notable for being an early example of a game with [[multiple endings]], which depended on the player's skill and discovering secrets.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Game mechanics==
In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.

The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamdawes.com/retrogaming/rg_08_bubblebobble.html|title=Bubble Trouble |issue=8 |work=Retro Gamer magazine |first=Adam|last=Dawkes|publisher=adamdawes.com|year=2004|accessdate=2013-01-11 }}</ref>

Enemies turn "angry" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).

After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.

Contact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.

The game's music was written by Japanese team [[Zuntata]]. Peter Clarke, [[Tim Follin]] and [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]] converted the music for the home computer ports (some versions feature the ending sequence track for the title screen music, such as on the Commodore Amiga version by David Whittaker).

==Ports==
The popularity of ''Bubble Bobble'' led Taito (or its licensees) to [[porting|port]] to many [[home computer]]s and [[video game console]]s. Ports of the game were released for the [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[MSX]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Sharp X68000]], [[Personal computer|PC]] ([[DOS]], 1989 and 1996), [[Apple II series|Apple II]], [[FM Towns Marty]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[mobile phone]] ([[Sprint Nextel|Sprint PCS]]), [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-83|TI-8x series]] of calculators<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwedit.org/bubblebobble/ |title=Bubble Bobble 8x |accessdate=2009-07-18 }}</ref> and [[UltraCade Technologies|UltraCade]]'s Taito Arcade Classics. A version also exists for the [[BBC Micro]] on [[public domain]] though never officially released. The original [[Sega Master System]] version had two hundred levels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bubble Bobble Cheats, Codes, and Secrets|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588042-bubble-bobble/cheats|publisher=GameFaqs|accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> Of the original 8 and 16 bit ports, the NES and Game Boy ones were made by Taito themselves. Sega converted Bubble Bobble for the Master System (although this version was not released in North America). The Commodore 64 and Spectrum versions were made by UK-based Firebird Software, and most of the other computer ports by US-based Novalogic.

In 1996 [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] announced that they lost the original source code.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=bubble-bobble&page=detail&id=343 |title=Bubble Bobble video game, Taito Corp. (1986)| publisher=arcade-history.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}</ref> As [[Acclaim Cheltenham|Probe Entertainment]] was in charge of the home conversions, [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] sent them a ''Bubble Bobble'' [[arcade game|arcade]] [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] so they could play the original game and reproduce its mechanics. This led to the release of ''Bubble Bobble also featuring [[Rainbow Islands]]'' for [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] ([[DOS]]) in 1996.

The original [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] versions have a Moon Water storyline, and are known as ''Bubble Bobble'', and ''Classic Bubble Bobble'' respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble |title=Bubble Bobble StrategyWiki| publisher=strategywiki.com|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}</ref>

In 2002, a [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] version for the [[TI-83 series|TI-83]] [[graphing calculator]] was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwedit.org/bubblebobble/ |title=Bubble Bobble 8x |publisher=Dwedit.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref> {{Computing_platform requirements| OS_name=TI-83&4 series| CPU_name=Zilog Z80| this_software_genre=games}}

In October 2005, a version was released for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Personal computer|PC]] as part of the ''[[Taito Legends]]'' compilation of [[retrogaming|classic arcade games]].

At the end of 2006 a new port for mobile phones in Europe and Japan was released.

On December 31, 2007, the NES version of Bubble Bobble was released on Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] service for the [[Wii]]. It costs 500 [[Nintendo Points|Wii Points]], the equivalent of [[United States dollar|US$]]5.

During Christmas of 2011, a new version for the [[Amstrad CPC]], entitled ''Bubble Bobble 4 CPC'' or ''BB4CPC'' was released for free by programmer CNGSoft, as an update to the original/official CPC version, which had been criticised for its lacklustre implementation and underuse of the system's hardware potential.<ref>http://cngsoft.no-ip.org/cng_bb4cpc.htm</ref>
