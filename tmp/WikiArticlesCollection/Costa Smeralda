The '''Costa Smeralda''' ({{IPA-it|ˌkɔsta zmeˈralda}}, {{lang-sdn|Monti di Mola}}) is a coastal area and tourist destination in northern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], with a length of some 20&nbsp;km, although the term originally designed only a small stretch in the commune of [[Arzachena]]. With  white sand beaches, a golf club, private jet and helicopter service, and hotels costing up to [[US$]]2000–3000 per night in the peak season, the area has drawn celebrities, business leaders and other affluent visitors.
In a study released by the European luxury real estate brokerage Engel & Völkers, Costa Smeralda is the most expensive location in Europe.  House prices reach up to 300,000 euros per square meter.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/hottest-european-luxury-residential-soaring-article-1.1328619   Top residential markets in Europe soar to new heights </ref>

The main towns and villages in the area, built according to a detailed [[urban planning|urban plan]], are [[Porto Cervo]], [[Liscia di Vacca]], [[Capriccioli]] and [[Romazzino]]. [[archaeology|Archaeological]] sites include the Li Muri [[Giants' grave]]s.

Each September the ''Sardinia Cup'' [[sailing]] [[regatta]] is held off the coast. Polo matches are held between April and October at Gershan near Arzachena. Other attractions include a film festival in Tavolara and a vintage car rally. 

Development of the area started in 1961, and was financed by a consortium of companies led by Prince [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]]. Spiaggia del Principe, one of the beaches along the Costa Smeralda, was named after this Ishmaelite Prince.<ref name="CharmingSardinia">{{cite web | url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Olbia-Costa%20Smeralda-Badesi.pdf | format=web | title=Guide to Olbia, Costa Smeralda, Badesi | work=CharmingSardinia.com |date=January 2009}}</ref> Architects involved in the project included [[Busiri Vici]], [[Jacques Couëlle]], Savin Couëlle and Vietti.
