'''The Bronx''' is the northernmost of the five [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] of [[New York City]].  Coextensive with '''Bronx County''', it was the last of the 62 [[County (New York)|counties]] of [[New York|New York State]] to be incorporated. Located north of [[Manhattan]] and [[Queens]], and south of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], the Bronx is the only borough that is located primarily on the [[mainland]] (a very small portion of Manhattan, the [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] neighborhood, is physically located on the mainland, because of the rerouting of the [[Harlem River]] in 1897). The Bronx's population is 1,385,108 according to the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name="2010 Census pop est" /> The borough has a land area of {{convert|42|sqmi|km2|0}}, making it the fourth-largest in land area of the five boroughs, the fourth most populated, and the third-highest in [[population density]].<ref name="density">[[U.S. Census Bureau]], [http://www.census.gov/statab/ccdb/ccdbstcounty.html ''County and City Data Book:2007''] Table B-1, Area and Population, retrieved on July 12, 2008. New York County (Manhattan) was the nation's most densely populated county, followed by Kings County (Brooklyn), Bronx County, Queens County and San Francisco, California.</ref>

The Bronx is divided by the [[Bronx River]] into a hillier section in the west, closer to Manhattan, and the flatter eastern section, closer to [[Long Island]]. Technically, the [[West Bronx]] is divided from the [[East Bronx]] by [[Jerome Avenue]]—the continuation of Manhattan's [[Fifth Avenue]]—making the West Bronx roughly one-eighth the size of the East Bronx. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City (then largely confined to Manhattan) in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River were annexed in 1895.<ref name="ultan"/> The Bronx first assumed a distinct legal identity when it became a borough of [[City of Greater New York|Greater New York]] in 1898.

==History==

The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods: a boom period during 1900–29, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The [[Great Depression]] and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline. The mid to late century were hard times, as the Bronx declined 1950-85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty. The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.<ref name="Olmsted 1989; Olmsted 1998"/>

For generations a mostly rural area of small farms supplying the city markets, the Bronx grew into a railroad suburb in the late 19th century. Faster transportation allowed for rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to Manhattan in 1904.<ref name="Olmsted 1989; Olmsted 1998">Olmsted (1989); Olmsted (1998)</ref>

The South Bronx was for many years a manufacturing center and in the early part of the 20th century was noted as a center of piano manufacturing. In 1919, the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F20712FE3B5910738DDDA00A94D0405B898DF1D3|title=Piano Workers May Strike|date=August 29, 1919|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref>

At the end of [[World War I]], the Bronx hosted the rather small [[Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries|1918 World's Fair]] at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue.<ref name="ultan">Lloyd Ultan, Bronx Borough Historian, [http://www.bronxriver.org/?pg=content&p=abouttheriver&m1=9&m2=58 "History of the Bronx River,"] Paper presented to the [[Bronx River Alliance]], November 5, 2002 (notes taken by Maarten de Kadt, November 16, 2002), retrieved on August 29, 2008.

The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the [[New York City Subway]] contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction. Among these groups, many [[Irish Americans]], [[Italian Americans]] and especially [[Jewish Americans]] settled here. In addition, [[French American|French]], [[German American|German]], [[Polish American|Polish]] and other immigrants moved into the borough. The [[Judaism|Jewish]] population also increased notably during this time. In 1937, according to Jewish organizations, 592,185 Jews lived in The
Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population),<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]], 1943'', page 494, citing the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the Jewish Statistical Bureau of the [[Synagogue Council of America]]</ref> while only 45,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2002. Many [[synagogue]]s still stand in the Bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.<ref

June 2004, and his own survey of synagogue sites.</ref>

===Decline===

In [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] days (1920–33), [[rum-running|bootleggers]] and gangs were active in the Bronx. Irish, Italian and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey. The oldest sections of the borough began to become poverty stricken areas.

Between 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) rapidly began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]] population in the West Bronx. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today are located in the East and northwestern sections of the county.

From the mid-1960s to the late-1970s, [[quality of life]] for Bronx residents declined sharply. Historians and social scientists have put forward many factors. They include the theory (elaborated in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]'')<ref>[[Alfred A. Knopf]], New York, 1974; ISBN 0-394-72024-5</ref> that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods. Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]].

Yet another may have been a reduction in the real-estate listings and property-related financial services (such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies) offered in some areas of the Bronx — a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a "[[planned shrinkage]]" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.<ref>Roderick Wallace: "A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx." ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1–33, and "Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx", ''Social Science & Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801–813 — abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov PubMed]. One sentence in the abstract of the 1990 article reads, "Empirical and theoretical analyses strongly imply present sharply rising levels of violent death, intensification of deviant behaviors implicated in the spread of AIDS, and the pattern of the AIDS outbreak itself, have been gravely affected, and even strongly determined, by the outcomes of a program of 'planned shrinkage' directed against African-American and Hispanic communities, and implemented through systematic and continuing denial of municipal services—particularly fire extinguishment resources—essential for maintaining urban levels of population density and ensuring community stability."</ref><ref>Issues such as redlining, hospital quality and what looked like the planned shrinkage of garbage collection became the contentious issues that sparked the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] activists known as the [[Young Lords]]. The Young Lords coalesced with similar groups fighting for neighborhood empowerment, such as the [[Black Panthers]], to protest urban renewal and arson for profit with sit-ins and marches. See pages 6–9 of the guide to [http://www.pbs.org/pov/utils/youthviews/pov_palante_toolkit.pdf ''¡Palante Siempre Palante!'' The Young Lords] a "P.O.V." (Point of View) documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]].</ref> There was also much debate as to whether [[rent control]] laws had made it less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.<ref>For an example of this argument, as well as of several other theses mentioned here, see [http://www.city-data.com/forum/new-york-city/257896-when-bronx-burning-6.html "When the Bronx was burning"] ''City-data'' forum (blog), 2007, where rubygreta writes:"Rent control destroyed the Bronx, especially starting in the 1960s and 1970s, when oil prices rose through the roof, and heavily subsidized Coop City opened in the East Bronx.
Essentially, tenants never moved out of their apartments because they had below-market rents thanks to rent control. The apartments deteriorated and common areas deteriorated because the landlords had no cash-flow. And no cash flow meant that they could not get mortgages for major repairs such as boilers, roofs and window replacement."</ref>

In the 1970s, The Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, like the South Bronx. The most common explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945795-2,00.html |title= Arson for Hate and Profit |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 1977-10-31 |accessdate= 2008-03-14 }}</ref> The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.<ref name="Gonzalez 2004">Gonzalez (2004)</ref>

Out of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate. However, starting in the 1990s, many burned-out and run-down tenements were replaced by multi-unit housing.<ref name="Gonzalez 2004"/> By the early 1980s, the South Bronx was considered one of the most blighted urban areas in the country, with a loss of 60% of the population and 40% of housing units.

Among the remarks of Richard H. Neiman, New York State's Superintendent of Banks, were these: "The Bronx was an economically stable community until the mid-1960s when the entire South Bronx struggled with major construction, real estate issues, red-lining, and block busting. This included a thoroughfare that divided communities, the deterioration of property as a result of rent control, and decrease in the value of real estate.

Thanks to strong community leadership, advances in policing, social services, and changing economic migration patterns to New York City, the Bronx is undergoing a resurgence, with new housing developments and thriving business. From 2000 to 2006, there was a 2.2% increase in population, and home ownership rates increased by 19.6%. "When I look at maps of the Bronx, it's not difficult to see the areas that don't have bank branches.

The Bronx is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland.{{GR|6}} The [[Hudson River]] separates the Bronx on the west from [[Alpine, New Jersey|Alpine]], [[Tenafly, New Jersey|Tenafly]] and [[Englewood Cliffs]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]]; the [[Harlem River]] separates it from the island of [[Manhattan]] to the southwest; the [[East River]] separates it from [[Queens]] to the southeast; and to the east, [[Long Island Sound]] separates it from [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] in western Long Island. Directly north of the Bronx are (from west to east) the adjoining [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] communities of [[Yonkers]], [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]], [[Pelham Manor]] and [[New Rochelle]].
(There is also a short southern land boundary with [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] in the Borough of Manhattan, over the filled-in former course of the [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]]. Marble Hill's postal [[ZIP code]], telephonic [[Area Code]] and fire service, however, are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan.)

The [[Bronx River]] flows south from Westchester County through the borough, emptying into the East River; it is the only entirely [[freshwater]] river in New York City.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|first=Joseph|last=Berger|title= Reclaimed Jewel Whose Attraction Can Be Perilous |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/nyregion/20river.html?ref=nyregion|work=[[New York Times]] |publisher=|date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-07-21}}</ref> A smaller river, the [[Hutchinson River]] (named after the religious leader [[Anne Hutchinson]], killed along its banks in 1641), passes through the East Bronx and empties into [[Eastchester Bay]].

The Bronx also includes several small islands in the [[East River]] and [[Long Island Sound]], such as [[City Island, New York|City Island]] and [[Hart Island (New York)|Hart Island]]. [[Rikers Island]] in the East River, home to the large jail complex for the entire city, is also part of the Bronx.

===Parks and open space===
{{See also|Category:Parks in the Bronx}}

Although it was the third most densely populated county in the United States as of 2006 (after [[Manhattan]] and [[Brooklyn]]),<ref name="density"/> about one-fifth of the Bronx's area, and one-quarter of its land area, is given over to park land: about {{convert|7000|acre|km2}}.<ref name="blooming">[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20080630/ap_tr_ge/travel_trip_wild_green_bronx Ladies and gentlemen, the Bronx is blooming!] by Beth J.

[[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], one of the largest cemeteries in New York City, sits on the western bank of the [[Bronx River]] near [[Yonkers]]. It opened in 1863, at a time when the Bronx was still considered a rural area.

The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City - [[Pelham Bay Park]], which includes [[Orchard Beach, New York|Orchard Beach]] - and the fourth largest, [[Van Cortlandt Park]], which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders [[Yonkers]].

Nearer the borough's center, and along the [[Bronx River]], is [[Bronx Park]]. Its northern end houses the [[New York Botanical Gardens]], which preserve the last patch of the original [[Tsuga|hemlock]] forest that once covered the entire county, and its southern end the [[Bronx Zoo]], the largest urban zoological gardens in the U.S.<ref name="fordzoo"/>

Further south is [[Crotona Park]], home to a {{convert|3.3|acre|ha|adj=on}} lake, 28 species of trees and a large swimming pool.<ref>[http://nycgovparks.org/parks/crotonapark Crotona Park] [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]], retrieved on July 20, 2008</ref> The land for these parks, and many others, was bought by New York City in 1888, while land was still open and inexpensive, in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development.<ref>Article on the Bronx by Gary D. Hermalyn and Lloyd Ultan in ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (1995 – see [[#Further reading|Further reading]] for bibliographic details)</ref>

Some of the acquired land was set aside for the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] and [[Pelham Parkway]], the first of a series of [[boulevard]]s and [[parkway]]s ([[thoroughfare]]s lined with trees, vegetation and greenery). Later projects included the [[Bronx River Parkway]], which developed a road while restoring the riverbank and reducing pollution, [[Mosholu Parkway]] and the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]].

Just south of [[Van Cortlandt Park]] is the [[Jerome Park Reservoir]], surrounded by {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]] neighborhood.  The [[reservoir]] was built in the 1890s on the site of the former [[Jerome Park Racetrack]].<ref>[http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/historical_signs/hs_historical_sign.php?id=11042 Jerome Park] ([[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]], retrieved on July 12, 2008).</ref>

In 2006, a five-year, $220-million program of capital improvements and natural restoration in 70 Bronx parks was begun (financed by water and sewer revenues) as part of an agreement that allowed a [[water filtration]] plant under Van Cortlandt Park's [[golf course]]. One major focus is on opening more of the [[Bronx River]]'s banks and restoring them to a natural state.<ref>[http://nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/croton/html/main_page.html Bronx Parks for the 21st Century], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]], retrieved on July 20, 2008.

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of Bronx neighborhoods|Bronx Community Board|Timeline of town creation in Downstate New York}}

The number, locations and boundaries of the Bronx's neighborhoods (many of them sitting on the sites of 19th-century villages) have become unclear with time and successive waves of newcomers. In 2006, Manny Fernandez of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote,<blockquote>"According to a [[New York City Department of City Planning|Department of City Planning]] map of the city's neighborhoods, the Bronx has 49. The map publisher Hagstrom identifies 69. The borough president, [[Adolfo Carrión Jr.]], says 61. The Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, in a listing of the [[Bronx Community Board|borough's community boards]], names 68. Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, lists 44."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/nyregion/16bronx.html As Maps and Memories Fade, So Do Some Bronx Boundary Lines] by Manny Fernandez, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 16, 2006, retrieved on August 3, 2008</ref></blockquote>

Notable Bronx neighborhoods include the [[South Bronx]], Little Italy on [[Arthur Avenue, Bronx|Arthur Avenue]] in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] section, and [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]].

====East Bronx====

[[File:Co-op City Hutch River.jpg|thumb|The neighborhood of [[Co-op City]] is the largest cooperative housing development in the world.]]
East of the [[Bronx River]], the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas, or 'necks,' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh: Hunts Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck (Castle Hill Point) and [[Throgs Neck]]. The East Bronx has older tenement buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multifamily homes, as well as single family homes. It includes New York City's largest park: [[Pelham Bay Park]] along the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]-Bronx border.

Neighborhoods include: [[Clason's Point, Bronx|Clason's Point]], [[Harding Park, Bronx|Harding Park]], [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]], [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]], [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester]] ''(under [[Bronx Community Board 9|Board 9]])'', [[Throggs Neck]], [[Country Club, Bronx|Country Club]], [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]], [[Pelham Bay]], [[Co-op City]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 10|Board 10]])'', [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]], [[Van Nest]], [[Pelham Parkway, Bronx|Pelham Parkway]], [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 11|Board 11]])'', [[Williamsbridge, Bronx|Williamsbridge]], [[Eastchester, Bronx|Eastchester]], [[Baychester, Bronx|Baychester]], [[Edenwald, Bronx|Edenwald]] and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 12|Board 12]])''.

=====City Island and Hart Island=====
{{Main|City Island, Bronx|Hart Island, New York}}

[[File:CityIsland.jpg|thumb|The sea is a part of everyday life in [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].]]
([[Bronx Community Board 10]])

City Island is located east of [[Pelham Bay Park]] in [[Long Island Sound]] and is known for its seafood restaurants and private waterfront  homes. City Island's single shopping street, City Island Avenue, is reminiscent of a small New England town. It is connected to [[Rodman's Neck]] on the mainland by the [[City Island Bridge]].

East of City Island is Hart Island which is uninhabited and not open to the public. It once served as a prison and now houses New York City's [[Potter's Field]] or pauper's graveyard for unclaimed bodies.

====West Bronx====
{{Main|West Bronx}}

[[File:Grand Conc 165 jeh.JPG|thumb|The [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] at East 165th Street.]]
([[Bronx Community Board]]s 1 to 8, progressing roughly from south to northwest)

The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges, running south to north. The West Bronx has older apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and [[Fieldston, Bronx|Fieldston]].<ref>[http://fpoa.info/images/FPOA_APPROVED_BY-LAWS.doc FIELDSTON PROPERTY OWNERS’ ASSOCIATION, INC. BY-LAWS], by the FPOA, September 17, 2006</ref> It includes New York City's fourth largest park: [[Van Cortlandt Park]] along the Westchester-Bronx border. The [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], a wide boulevard, runs through it, north to south.

=====Northwestern Bronx=====
([[Bronx Community Board]]s 7 ''[between the [[Bronx River|Bronx]] and [[Harlem River]]s]'' and 8 ''[facing the [[Hudson River]]]'' — plus part of Board 12)

Neighborhoods include: [[Fordham-Bedford, Bronx|Fordham-Bedford]], [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]], [[Norwood, Bronx|Norwood]], [[Kingsbridge Heights]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 7|Board 7]])'', [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 8|Board 8]])'', and [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 12|Board 12]])''.
([[Marble Hill, Manhattan]] is now connected by land to the Bronx rather than Manhattan and is served by [[Bronx Community Board 8]].)

=====South Bronx=====
{{Main|South Bronx}}

[[File:New Yankee Stadium.JPG||thumb|The new [[Yankee Stadium]] is located on 161st and River Avenue.]]
([[Bronx Community Board]]s 1 to 6 plus part of Board 7 —— ''progressing northwards, Boards 2, 3 and 6 border the [[Bronx River]] from its mouth to [[Bronx Park]], while 1, 4, 5 and 7 face Manhattan across the [[Harlem River]]'')

Like other [[neighborhoods in New York City]], the South Bronx has no official boundaries. The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s [[Fordham Road]] was often used as a northern limit.   The [[Bronx River]] more consistently forms an eastern boundary.  The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multi-unit homes. The South Bronx is home to the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], Borough Hall, and other government buildings, as well as [[Yankee Stadium]]. The [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] bisects it, east to west. The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas.

Neighborhoods include: [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] (a retail district at [[Third Avenue (Manhattan-Bronx)|Third Avenue]] and East 149th Street), [[Port Morris, Bronx|Port Morris]], [[Mott Haven]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 1|Board 1]])'', [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 1|Board 1]] & [[Bronx Community Board 3|Board 3]])'', [[Morrisania]], [[East Morrisania, Bronx|East Morrisania]] [also known as Crotona Park East] ''([[Bronx Community Board 3|Board 3]])'', [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], [[Longwood, Bronx|Longwood]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 2|Board 2]])'', [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], [[Concourse, Bronx|Concourse]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 4|Board 4]])'', [[West Farms, Bronx|West Farms]], [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], [[East Tremont, Bronx|East Tremont]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 6|Board 6]])'', [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]], [[Morris Heights, Bronx|Morris Heights]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 5|Board 5]])'', [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]], and [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 5|Board 5]] & [[Bronx Community Board 7|Board 7]])''.

===Shopping districts===
[[File:Bronxhub1.jpeg|thumb|[[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] on Third Avenue.]]

Prominent shopping areas in the Bronx include [[Fordham Road]], [[Bay Plaza Shopping Center|Bay Plaza]] (in [[Co-op City]]), [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]]/[[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] Shopping center and [[Bruckner Boulevard]]. Shops are also concentrated on streets aligned underneath elevated railroad lines, including Westchester Avenue, White Plains Road, [[Jerome Avenue]], Southern Boulevard and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. The [[Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market]] contains several [[big-box stores]], which opened in 2009 south of Yankee Stadium.

==== The Bronx Hub ====

The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District (B.I.D.) is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], located where four roads converge: East 149th Street, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues.<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/hub/hub.html The Hub]</ref> It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven.<ref>[http://www.lehman.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/publicart/neighborhood.htm Bronx Neighborhood Histories]</ref> [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] has been called "the Broadway of the Bronx."<ref>[http://www.therealdeal.net/issues/JULY_2006/1151609191.php Bronx Hub revival gathers steam]</ref> It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density. In configuration, it resembles a miniature [[Times Square]], a spatial "bow-tie" created by the geometry of the street.<ref>[http://www.sorkinstudio.com/Bronx%20Hub.htm Bronx Hub]</ref> The area is part of [[Bronx Community Board 1]].
{{-}}

==== The Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market ====

The [[Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market]] is a shopping center in The Bronx that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space, built on a 17-acre (69,000 m2) site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market, a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention, south of [[Yankee Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Center_at_Bronx_Terminal_Market |title=Bronx Terminal Market - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>

The $500 million shopping center, which was completed in 2009, saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings, one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market. The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars. The center has earned itself a LEED "Silver" designation in its design.<ref>"Chains of Silver: Gateway Center At Bronx Terminal Market Earns LEED Silver Bona Fides"</ref>

===Roads and streets===
The Bronx [[street grid]] is irregular. Like the northernmost part of [[upper Manhattan]], the [[West Bronx]]'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid.  Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx.  This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.

The [[East Bronx]] is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a disalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.

Three major north-south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue (Manhattan-Bronx)|Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. Other major north-south roads include the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Sedgwick Avenue]], [[Webster Avenue]], and [[White Plains Road]]. Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.

Most east-west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).

The historic [[Boston Post Road]], part of the long pre-revolutionary road connecting [[Boston]] with other northeastern cities, runs east-west in some places, and sometimes northeast-southwest.

[[Mosholu Parkway|Mosholu]] and [[Pelham Parkway]]s, with [[Bronx Park]] between them, [[Van Cortlandt Park]] to the west and [[Pelham Bay Park]] to the east, are also linked by [[bridle path]]s.

Approximately 61.6% of all Bronx households do not have access to a car. Citywide, the percentage of autoless households is 55%.<ref>[http://www.tstc.org/reports/cpsheets/Bronx_factsheet.pdf Bronx factsheet]</ref>

===Highways===

Several major [[limited access]] highways traverse the Bronx. These include:

*the [[Bronx River Parkway]]
*the [[Bruckner Expressway]] ([[Interstate 278|I-278]]/[[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]])
*the [[Cross-Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]/[[Interstate 295 (New York)|I-295]])
*the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]])
*the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] ([[New York State Route 9A|NY-9A]])
*the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]]
*the [[Interstate 87#Major Deegan Expressway|Major Deegan Expressway (New York Thruway)]] (I-87)

===Bridges and tunnels===
[[File:Aerial View of the Throgs Neck Bridge.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]].]]
Many bridges and tunnels connect the Bronx to Manhattan and [[Queens]] (3). These include, from west to east:

''To Manhattan:'' the [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]], the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]], the [[University Heights Bridge]], the [[Washington Bridge]], the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]], the [[High Bridge (New York City)|High Bridge]], the [[Concourse Tunnel]], the [[Macombs Dam Bridge]], the [[145th Street Bridge]], the [[149th Street Tunnel]], the [[Madison Avenue Bridge]], the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]], the [[Lexington Avenue Tunnel]], the [[Third Avenue Bridge (Manhattan)|Third Avenue Bridge]] (southbound traffic only), and the [[Willis Avenue Bridge]] (northbound traffic only).

''To Manhattan or Queens:'' the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge]], formerly known as the Triborough Bridge.

''To Queens:'' the [[Bronx Whitestone Bridge]] and the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]].

===Mass transit===

[[File:NYC Transit New Flyer 5400.jpg|thumb|NYC Transit bus operating on the Bx40 line in [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]].]]

The Bronx is served by six lines of the [[New York City Subway]] with [[List of New York City Subway stations in the Bronx|70 stations in the Bronx]]:
*[[IND Concourse Line]] ({{NYCS Concourse}} trains)
*[[IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh north}} train)
*[[IRT Dyre Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS Dyre}} train)
*[[IRT Jerome Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS Jerome}} train)
*[[IRT Pelham Line]] ({{NYCS Pelham}} trains)
*[[IRT White Plains Road Line]] ({{NYCS White Plains}} trains)
Two [[Metro-North Railroad]] commuter rail lines (the [[Harlem Line]] and the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]) serve 11 stations in the Bronx. ([[Marble Hill (Metro-North station)|Marble Hill]], between the [[Spuyten Duyvil (Metro-North station)|Spuyten Duyvil]] and [[University Heights (Metro-North station)|University Heights]] stations, is actually in the only part of Manhattan connected to the mainland.) In addition, trains serving the [[New Haven Line]] stop at [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham Road]].

According to the 2010 Census, 53.5% of Bronx's population was of  Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race); 30.1% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 10.9% of the population was non-Hispanic White, 3.4%  non-Hispanic Asian, 0.6% from some other race (non-Hispanic) and 1.2% of two or more races (non-Hispanic). The U.S. Census considers the Bronx to be the most diverse area in the country. There is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different race or ethnicity.<ref name="Newsweek-2009">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/photo/2009/01/17/photos-bronx-residents-on-obama.html|title=Photos: Bronx Residents on Obama|date=Jan. 17, 2009|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}</ref> The borough's formerly most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 98.3% in 1940 to 45.8% by 2012.<ref>[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36005.html Population of Bronx County (Bronx Borough), New York, 2012 est.]</ref>

The Bronx is the only New York City borough with a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] majority, many of whom are [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Dominican American|Dominican]]s. In 2000, The Bronx had some of the nation's highest percentages of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans with 24.0% and 10.0%, respectively.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov Quick Table QT-P9.

According to the 2009 American Community Survey, [[White Americans]] of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-fifth (22.9%) of The Bronx's population. However, non-Hispanic whites formed under one-eighth (12.1%) of the population, down from 34.4% in 1980.<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=New York - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}</ref>  Out of all five boroughs, The Bronx has the lowest number and percentage of white residents. 320,640 whites called the Bronx home, of which 168,570 were non-Hispanic whites. The majority of the non-Hispanic European American population is of Italian and Irish descent. People of Italian descent numbered over 55,000 individuals and made up 3.9% of the population. People of Irish descent numbered over 43,500 individuals and made up 3.1% of the population. German Americans and Polish Americans made up 1.4% and 0.8% of the population respectively.

At the 2009 American Community Survey, [[Black Americans]] made the second largest group in the Bronx after Hispanics and Latinos. Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin represented over one-third (35.4%) of the Bronx's population. Blacks of non-Hispanic origin made up 30.8% of the population. Over 495,200 blacks resided in the borough, of which 430,600 were non-Hispanic blacks. Over 61,000 people identified themselves as "Sub-Saharan African" in the survey, making up 4.4% of the population.

Native Americans are a very small minority in the borough. Only some 5,560 individuals (out of the borough's 1.4 million people) are Native American, which is equal to just 0.4% of the population. In addition, roughly 2,500 people are Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin.

{{Main|Government and politics of the Bronx}}

===Local government===
{{Main|Government of New York City}}

Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, the Bronx has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council system]]. The centralized New York City government is responsible for all municipal functions.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 with powers mostly derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]].  The 1989 [[Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris]] case declared the Board unconstitutional, and since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the [[New York City Council|City Council]], the New York state government, and corporations.

On February 18, 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed the former Bronx [[Borough President]], [[Adolfo Carrión, Jr.]], to the position of Director of the [[White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy]].<ref>Kappstatter, Bob, (2/18/09), ''Bronx Beep Bound for D.C.'', New York Daily News</ref>

On April 21, 2009, a special election was held to choose Carrión's successor. Democratic [[New York State Assembly]] member [[Ruben Diaz Jr.|Rubén Díaz, Jr.]], running on the "Bronx Unity" ticket, won this election with 29,420 votes (86%) against 4,646 votes (14%) for the Republican Anthony Ribustello ("People First") and 11 votes for [[write-in candidate]]s.<ref>Trymaine Lee, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/nyregion/22bronx.html ''Borough Voters Elect Díaz as New Borough President]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York edition, April 22, 2009, page A24, retrieved on May 13, 2009</ref><ref>Kappstatter, Bob, (4/22/09), ''Ruben Diaz Cruises to Victory in Bronx Borough President Special Election'', New York Daily News</ref><ref>Board of Elections in the City of New York, [http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/pdf/results/2009/BronxBoroPresident_4_21_09/BronxBoroPresident-Recap.pdf Bronx Borough President special election results, April 21, 2009] ([[PDF]] with details by Assembly District, April 29, 2009), retrieved on May 13, 2009</ref> On May 1, 2009, Assemblyman Diaz was sworn in as the 13th Borough President of the Bronx (For his predecessors, see the [[Borough President#Bronx Borough Presidents|List of Bronx Borough Presidents]].)

Every currently elected public official in the Bronx has first won the [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democratic]] nomination (whether or not also nominated by other parties). Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in the Bronx include environmental issues, the cost of housing, and the alienation of parkland for new [[Yankee Stadium]].

Since its separation from [[New York County]] on January 1, 1914, the Bronx, has had, like each of the other 61 counties of New York State, its own directly elected [[District attorney|District Attorney]], the county's chief public prosecutor.<ref name="courtstart"/> Robert T.

[[Membership of the New York City Council|Eight members]] of the [[New York City Council]] represent districts wholly within the Bronx, while a ninth represents a [[Manhattan]] district (8) that also includes a small area of the Bronx. (All of them were Democrats in 2008.) One of those members, [[Joel Rivera]] (District 15), has been the Council's [[Majority Leader]] since 2002.

The Bronx also has 12 [[Government of New York City#Community Boards|Community Boards]], appointed bodies that field complaints and advise on land use and municipal facilities and services for local residents, businesses and institutions. (They are listed at [[Bronx Community Board]]s).

===Legislative and congressional representatives===

In 2008, three Democrats represented almost all of the Bronx in the [[United States House of Representatives]].

*[[José M. Serrano]] (first elected in March 1990) represents [[New York's 16th congressional district]], which covers much of the South Bronx. It was, in 2000, the poorest of the nation's 435 districts (42.8% below the poverty line); it was also the most Hispanic of New York state's 29 congressional districts (62.8%) and the youngest (34.5% under 18 years old; 6.7% over 65).
*[[Eliot L. Engel|Eliot Engel]] (first elected in 1988) represents the [[New York's 17th congressional district|17th District]] which includes parts of the northwest Bronx as well as parts of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] counties.
*[[Joseph Crowley]] (first elected in 1998) represents the [[New York's 7th congressional district|7th District]] which spans the East Bronx and includes [[Co-op City]], [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]], [[Pelham Bay]], [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]], [[Pelham Parkway]], [[Parkchester]], [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]] and [[Throgs Neck]], as well as parts of northwest [[Queens]].
*''([[Riker's Island]], the city's main jail complex, is included in the [[New York's 15th congressional district|15th District]], which covers [[Upper Manhattan]] and utilities facilities in [[Astoria, Queens]]. It is represented by [[Charles B. Rangel]], first elected in 1970. In 2006, the Congressional election returns in this district included no votes from the Bronx or Queens.)''

All of these Representatives won over 75% of their districts' respective votes in both 2004 and 2006. ''[[National Journal]]'s'' neutral rating system placed all of their voting records in 2005 and 2006 somewhere between very liberal and extremely liberal.<ref name="Barone">''[[The Almanac of American Politics]] 2008'', edited by [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] with [[Richard E.

11 out of 150 members of the [[New York State Assembly]] (the lower house of the state legislature) represent districts wholly within the Bronx. Six [[New York State Senate|State Senators]] out of 62 represent Bronx districts, half of them wholly within the County, and half straddling other counties. All these legislators are Democrats who won between 65% and 100% of their districts' vote in 2006.<ref>[http://www.elections.ny.gov/2006ElectionResults.html New York State Board of Elections: 2006 Results Page], retrieved on July 23, 2008.</ref>

===Votes for other offices===

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Senator [[John F. Kerry]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]/[[Working Families Party|Working Families]]) received 81.8% of the vote in the Bronx while President [[George W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]/[[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative]]) received 16.3%.

A year later, the Democratic former Bronx [[Borough President]] [[Fernando Ferrer]] won 59.8% of the borough's vote against 38.8% for Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] (Republican/[[Independence Party of New York|Independence]]) who carried every other borough in his [[New York City mayoral elections#2005|winning campaign for re-election]]. In 2009, the Bronx voted slightly more strongly against the [[New York City mayoral elections#2009|successful re-election]] of Mayor Bloomberg, who received 37% of the Bronx vote (as an independent supported by the Republican and Independence Parties) against 61.2% for [[New York City Comptroller]] [[Bill Thompson (New York)|Bill Thompson]] (Democratic and Working Families).

In 2006, [[United States Senate election in New York, 2006|successfully reelected]] Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] (Democratic, Working Families & Independence) won 89.5% of the Bronx's vote against 9.6% for [[Yonkers]] ex-Mayor [[John Spencer (politician)|John Spencer]] (Republican and [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative]]), while [[Eliot Spitzer]] (Democratic, Working Families & Independence) received 88.8% of the Borough's vote in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|winning the Governorship]] against [[John Faso]] (Republican & Conservative), who received 9.7% of the Bronx's vote.

In the Presidential primary elections of February 5, 2008, Sen. Clinton won 61.2% of the Bronx's 148,636 Democratic votes against 37.8% for [[Barack Obama]] and 1.0% for the other four candidates combined. At the same time, [[John McCain]] won 54.4% of the borough's 5,643 Republican votes, [[Mitt Romney]] 20.8%, [[Mike Huckabee]] 8.2%, [[Ron Paul]] 7.4%, [[Rudy Giuliani]] 5.6%, and the other three candidates 3.6% between them.<!-- [Names, including nicknames, on ballot as reported by Board of Elections.] --><ref>[http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/results.html Board of Elections in the City of New York] Summary of Election Results (1999–2008), retrieved on July 21, 2008.</ref>

In the Presidential general election of November 4, 2008, Sen. Obama won 87.8% of the Bronx's vote (338,261) on the Democratic and Working Families Party lines of the ballot, Sen. McCain won 10.8% (41,683) on the Republican, Independence and Conservative Party lines, and other candidates won 1.3% (1,342) between them. The Democratic candidate's percentage of the Presidential vote increased by 6% from 2004, while the Republican presidential candidate's percentage declined by 5.5%.

After becoming a separate county in 1914, the Bronx has supported only two Republican Presidential candidates. It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920, but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924 (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W. Davis]], Dem., 72,834; [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], 62,202 equally divided between the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] lines).

Since then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2–1 for the unsuccessful [[Al Smith]] in 1928, followed by four 2-1 votes for the successful [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but the Bronx voted against two former Republican Governors who ran for President: [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in 1916 and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] in 1944 and 1948.)<ref>''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 & 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)];''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]] below), article on "government and politics"</ref>

The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in [[New York City mayoral elections|elections for Mayor]]. The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30–32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22–23% as a Republican).<ref>(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)</ref> The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P. Mitchel]], who outpolled Hillquit city-wide by 23.2% to 21.7%.<ref>To see a comparison of borough votes for Mayor, see [[New York City mayoral elections#How the boroughs voted]]</ref>

Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions, many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx. The [[New York City Department of Education]] manages public noncharter schools in the borough. In 2000, public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx's residents over 3 years old (out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools).<ref name="quicktable">[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-context=qt&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP19&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-CONTEXT=qt&-tree_id=403&-all_geo_types=N&-geo_id=05000US36005&-search_results=01000US&-format=&-_lang=en QT-P19.

Private schools range from élite [[independent school]]s to religiously affiliated [[parochial schools#United States|schools]] run by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]] and Jewish organizations.

'''''Educational attainment:''''' In 2000, according to the [[U.S. Census]], out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old, 62.3% had graduated from high school and 14.6% held a bachelor's or higher college degree. These percentages were lower than those for New York's other boroughs, which ranged from 68.8% (Brooklyn) to 82.6% (Staten Island) for high school graduates over 24, and from 21.8% (Brooklyn) to 49.4% (Manhattan) for college graduates. (The respective state and national percentages were ''[NY]'' 79.1% & 27.4% and ''[US]'' 80.4% & 24.4%.)<ref>[[U.S. Census Bureau]], [http://www.census.gov/statab/ccdb/ccdbstcounty.html ''County and City Data Book:2007''], Table B-4.

===High schools===

[[File:BronxScience.jpg|thumb|[[The Bronx High School of Science]]]]

In the 2000 Census, 79,240 of the nearly 95,000 Bronx residents enrolled in high school attended public schools.<ref name="quicktable"/>

Many public [[High School#United States|high schools]] are located in the borough including the elite [[Bronx High School of Science]], [[Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music]], [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[High School for Violin and Dance]], [[Bronx Leadership Academy 2]], [[Bronx International High School]], the [[School for Excellence]], the [[Morris Academy for Collaborative Study]], Wings Academy for young adults, The Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice, Validus Preparatory Academy, Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School, Bronx Academy of Letters, [[Herbert H. Lehman High School]] and [[High School of American Studies at Lehman College|High School of American Studies]]. The Bronx is also home to three of New York City's most prestigious private, secular schools: [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston]], [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann]], and [[Riverdale Country School]].

High schools linked to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] include: [[Saint Raymond's Academy for Girls]], [[All Hallows High School]], [[Fordham Preparatory School]], [[Monsignor Scanlan High School]], [[St. Raymond High School for Boys]], [[Cardinal Hayes High School]], [[Cardinal Spellman High School (New York City)|Cardinal Spellman High School]], [[Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School|The Academy of Mount Saint Ursula]], [[Aquinas High School (New York City)|Aquinas High School]], [[Preston High School (New York City)|Preston High School]], [[St. Catharine Academy]], [[Mount Saint Michael Academy]], and [[St. Barnabas High School]].

The [[SAR Academy]] and [[SAR High School]] are [[Modern Orthodox]] Jewish [[Yeshiva]] coeducational day schools in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], with roots in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]].

In the 1990s, New York City began closing the large, public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools. Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety. Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include [[John F. Kennedy High School (Bronx, New York)|John F. Kennedy]], [[James Monroe High School (New York)|James Monroe]], [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Taft]], [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Adlai E.

More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.

===Institutions of higher education===

{{See also|List of colleges and universities in New York City}}

In 2000, 49,442 (57.5%) of the 86,014 Bronx residents seeking college, graduate or professional degrees attended public institutions.<ref name="quicktable"/>

Several colleges and universities are located in the Bronx.

[[Fordham University]], was founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the [[Archdiocese of New York|Diocese of New York]] as the first Catholic institution of higher education in the [[Northeast United States|northeast]]. It is now officially an independent institution, but strongly embraces its [[Jesuit]] heritage. The {{convert|85|acre|m2|adj=on}} Bronx campus, known as Rose Hill, is the main campus of the university, and is among the largest within the city (other Fordham campuses are located in Manhattan and Westchester County).<ref name="fordzoo">In September 2008, [[Fordham University]] and its neighbor, the Wildlife Conservation Society, a global research organization which operates the [[Bronx Zoo]], will begin a joint program leading to a [[Master of Science]] degree in adolescent science education (biology grades 7–12).</ref>

Three campuses of the [[City University of New York]] are in the Bronx: [[Hostos Community College]], [[Bronx Community College]] (occupying the former [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] Campus of [[New York University]])<ref>{{cite web|last=Chronopoulos|first=Themis|title="Urban Decline and the Withdrawal of New York University from University Heights, The Bronx."

[[Lehman College]] (formerly the uptown campus of [[Hunter College]]), which offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

The [[College of Mount Saint Vincent]] is a Catholic liberal arts college in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] under the direction of the [[Sisters of Charity of New York]]. Founded in 1847 as a school for girls, the academy became a degree-granting college in 1911 and began admitting men in 1974. The school serves 1,600 students. Its campus is also home to the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], a transdenominational rabbinical and cantorial school.

[[Manhattan College]] is a Catholic college in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] which offers undergraduate programs in the arts, business, education, engineering, and science. It also offers graduate programs in education and engineering.

[[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], part of [[Yeshiva University]], is in [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]].

Two colleges based in [[Westchester County]] have Bronx campuses. The Catholic and nearly-all-female [[The College of New Rochelle|College of New Rochelle]] maintains satellite campuses at [[Co-op City]] and in [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]]. The coeducational and non-sectarian [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], founded by the Catholic [[Sisters of Mercy]] in 1950, has a campus near [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]].

By contrast, the private, proprietary [[Monroe College]], focused on preparation for business and the professions, started in the Bronx in 1933 but now has a campus in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] (Westchester County) as well the Bronx's [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] neighborhood.<ref>[http://www.monroecollege.edu/aboutmonroe/monroeshistory Monroe College history] (from the College's web site) retrieved on July 27, 2008.</ref>

The [[State University of New York Maritime College]] in [[Fort Schuyler]] ([[Throggs Neck]])—at the far southeastern tip of the Bronx—is the national leader in maritime education and houses the [[Maritime Industry Museum]]. (Directly across [[Long Island Sound]] is [[Kings Point, New York|Kings Point]], Long Island, home of the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] and the American Merchant Marine Museum.)

The Bronx's evolution from a hot bed of [[Latin jazz]] to an incubator of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] was the subject of an award-winning documentary, produced by [[City Lore]] and broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 2006, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1169817/ "From Mambo to Hip Hop: A South Bronx Tale"]. Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has identified 1520 [[Sedgwick Avenue]] "an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] and hard along the [[Major Deegan Expressway]]" as a starting point, where [[DJ Kool Herc]] presided over parties in the community room.<ref>David Gonzalez, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/nyregion/21citywide.html "Will Gentrification Spoil the Birthplace of Hip-Hop?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref><ref>Jennifer Lee, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/tenants-might-buy-the-birthplace-of-hip-hop "Tenants Might Buy the Birthplace of Hip-Hop"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 15, 2008, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>

On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was a [[D.J.]] and [[M.C.]] at a party in the [[recreation room]] of 1520 Sedgewick Avenue in the Bronx adjacent to the Cross-Bronx Expressway.<ref name=PBS>Tukufu Zuberi ("detective"), ''BIRTHPLACE OF HIP HOP'', [[History Detectives]], Season 6, Episode 11, New York City, found at [http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/611_hiphop.html PBS official website].

Beginning with the advent of beat match DJ'ing, in which Bronx DJs ([[Disc jockey|Disc Jockey]]s) including [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]] extended the breaks of [[funk]] records, a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk, [[disco]] and [[soul music|soul]] songs.  As hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking ("[[rapping]]") in sync with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The [[Herculoids]], made up of Herc, [[Coke La Rock]], and [[DJ Clark Kent]], were the earliest to gain major fame. The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as "The Boogie Down Bronx", or just "The Boogie Down".  This was hip-hop pioneer [[KRS-One]]'s inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP, or [[Boogie Down Productions]], which included DJ [[Scott La Rock]]. Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include [[Big Pun]], [[Peter Gunz|Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz]], [[Camp Lo]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Drag-On]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]] and [[Corey Gunz]].<ref>Johan Kugelberg, [http://www.rizzoliusa.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780789315403 ''Born in the Bronx'']; New York: [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]] (Universe), 2007; ISBN 978-0-7893-1540-3.</ref>

The Bronx is the home of the [[New York Yankees]], one of the leading baseball franchises. The original [[Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankeees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.

The Stadium was the scene [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new Yankee Stadium in which the team started play in 2009; it's north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park.

The Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [http://www.pregones.org/ Pregones Theater], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.

The [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]], founded in 1971, exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and {{convert|11000|sqft|m2|-2}} of galleries. Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].

The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute, in the form of the [[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial, better known as the [[Lorelei]] Fountain from [http://www.business.uiuc.edu/vock/poetry/lorelei.html one of Heine's best-known works (1838)]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[Düsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797–1856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art.<ref name="GrayNYT2007">Christopher Gray,

In 1899, the memorial, by the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] sculptor [[Ernst Gustav Herter]] (1846–1917), finally came to rest, although subject to repeated vandalism, in the Bronx, at 164th Street and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], or [[Joyce Kilmer]] Park near today's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. (In 1999, it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse.)

===The press and broadcasting===
'''Newspapers'''
The Bronx has several local newspapers, including ''The [[Bronx News]]'',<ref>[http://www.bxnews.net bxnews.net]</ref> ''[[Parkchester]] News'', ''City News'', ''The [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] Press'', ''[[Riverdale Review]]'', ''The Bronx Times Reporter'', ''[[Inner City Press]]'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innercitypress.org/aboutus.html |title=(some) About Us |publisher=Inner City Press |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> (which now has more of a focus on national issues) and ''[[Co-Op City]] Times''. Four non-profit news outlets, ''[[Norwood, Bronx|Norwood]] News'', ''Mount Hope Monitor'', ''[[Mott Haven Herald]]'' and ''The [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] Express'' serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of ''The Riverdale Press'', Bernard Stein, won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for editorial writing for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1959.)

The Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, ''The Bronx Home News'', which started publishing on January 20, 1907 and merged into the ''[[New York Post]]'' in 1948. It became a special section of the Post, sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.

'''Radio and television'''
One of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is [[WFUV]], an [[National Public Radio]]–affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from [[Fordham University]]'s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building owned by [[Montefiore Medical Center]].

The City of New York has an official television station run by the [[NYC Media Group]] and broadcasting from [[Bronx Community College]], and [[Cablevision]] operates [[News 12 Networks|News 12 The Bronx]], both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. [[Co-op City]] was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond [[Manhattan]], to have its own [[cable television]] provider. The local [[Public-access television]] station [[BronxNet]] provides [[Government-access television]] (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.<ref>Its website showcases very short selections (less than 20 seconds and over 2 MB each in uncompressed [[AIFF]] format) from ''[http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm Bronx Music Vol.1]'', an out-of-press [[compact disc]] of the old and new sounds and artists of the Bronx.</ref>

==Screen, literature and song==

===On screen (film and television)===
Middle 20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled, working-class, urban culture. Hollywood films such as ''From This Day Forward'' (1946), set in [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], occasionally delved into Bronx life. [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life<ref>{{cite web|last=Chronopoulos|first=Themis|title="Paddy Chayefsky’s ‘Marty’ and Its Significance to the Social History of Arthur Avenue, The Bronx, in the 1950s." The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLIV (Spring/Fall 2007): 50-59.|url=http://themis.slass.org/marty.html}}</ref> was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film ''[[The Catered Affair]]'', and in the 1993 [[Robert De Niro]]/[[Chazz Palminteri]] film, ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', [[Spike Lee]]'s 1999 movie ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', centered in an [[Italian-American]] Bronx community, 1994's ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]'' that takes place in the predominately [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] neighborhood of the South Bronx, and ''Doughboys'', the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.

The Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the "[[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]", a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by [[New York Yankees]] fans. The sound can be heard, for example, when [[Spike Jones]] sings "Der Fuehrer's Face" (from the 1942 [[Disney]] [[animated film]] of the same name), repeatedly lambasting [[Adolf Hitler]] with: "We'll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil! (Bronx cheer) Right in Der Fuehrer's Face!"<ref>David Hinkley, "Scorn and disdain: Spike Jones giffs Hitler der old birdaphone, 1942." ''[[New York Daily News]]'',"March 3, 2004.http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/03/03/2004-03-03_scorn_and_disdain_spike_jone.html</ref>

Other movies have also used the term ''Bronx'' for comic effect, such as "Bronx", the character on the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.

Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that  "The Bronx is burning": in 1974 it was the title of both a [[New York Times]] [[editorial]] and a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]]. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] stated, "There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mahler |first= Jonathan |title= Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn= 0-312-42430-2}}</ref>  A new feature-length documentary film by [[Edwin Pagan]] called ''Bronx Burning''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/</ref> is in production<ref>

 |month=January | year=2006}}</ref> in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.

[[Bronx gangs (1950s-1960s)|Bronx gang life]] was depicted in the 1974 novel ''The Wanderers'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and "Gunhill" (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road]]).

This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.

The 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed "Fort Apache". Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005.

The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series [[Mystery Science Theatre 3000]].  The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes.  The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, "Leave the Bronx!" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'' was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film, another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences. '''[[Last Bronx]]''', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.

Bronx born and reared [[Nancy Savoca]]'s 1989 comedy ''[[True Love (1989 film)|True Love]]'', explores two [[Italian-American]] Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding. The film, which debuted [[Annabella Sciorra]] and [[Ron Eldard]] as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's [[Sundance Film Festival]].

The [[CBS]] [[television sitcom]] ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred [[Ted Danson]] as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.

[[Penny Marshall]]'s 1990 film ''[[Awakenings]]'', which was nominated for several [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], is based on neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]' [[Awakenings (book)|1973 account]] of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of [[encephalitis]] but briefly responded to the drug [[L-dopa]]. [[Robin Williams]] played the physician; [[Robert De Niro]] was one of the patients who emerged from a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot not far from Sacks' actual [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] residence. A 1973 [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3D8103DF932A15752C0A9679C8B63 Yorkshire Television documentary] and "A Kind of Alaska", a 1985 play by [[Harold Pinter]],<ref>(ISBN 0-573-12129-X)</ref> were also based on Sacks' book.

[[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2000 ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' was quickly billed "[[Good Will Hunting]] in the Hood." [[Sean Connery]] is in the title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel that garnered the [[Pulitzer Prize]].  He meets 16-year-old Jamal – actor Rob Brown – a gifted, Bronx reared basketball player and aspiring writer, and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

The 2012 documentary "South Bronx United" features the Mott Haven neighborhood and its conflict over the online grocery delivery service Fresh Direct's move of their trucking facility from Long Island City to the South Bronx.

===In literature===
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there.  [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue, Bronx|Tremont Avenue]].<ref>Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.</ref> In Jacob M. Appel's short story, "The Grand Concourse" (2007),<ref>''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]</ref> a woman who grew up in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),<ref>[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon and Schuster]], 1980; ISBN 0-671-41475-5</ref> an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.

By contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)<ref>Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) ISBN 978-0-374-11535-7, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) ISBN 978-0-312-42757-3</ref> portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Court House. However, times change, and in 2007, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that "the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments." In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is "Reverend Bacon") asserts that "twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe."<ref>Anne Barnard, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008</ref>

[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards.  [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s "[[Savage in Limbo]]" is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters feel they are unable to move.

In poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:
: The Bronx
: No Thonx
:: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931

Nash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:
:I can't seem to escape
:the sins of my smart-alec youth;
:Here are my amends.
:I wrote those lines, "The Bronx?
:No thonx";
:I shudder to confess them.
:Now I'm an older, wiser man
:I cry, "The Bronx?
:God bless them!"<ref name="thonx"/>

===In song===
'''''Passing through:''''' The theme song to the 1960s U.S. television comedy series ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' begins "There's a holdup in The Bronx."<ref>[[Car 54, Where Are You?#Theme song]]</ref> And the song "[[New York, New York (On The Town)|New York, New York]]" (by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]] from the 1940s [[On the Town (musical)|musical comedy]] and [[On the Town (film)|film]], "On the Town") explains that "The Bronx is up and [[Battery Park|the Battery]]'s down." Another song, "[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]" (by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]] for the 1925 musical "Garrick Gaieties"), declares "We'll have Manhattan,/The Bronx and Staten/Island too./It's lovely going through/the zoo."

'''''Bronx Local:''''' While hundreds of songs about New York City, Manhattan and Brooklyn can be found in Wikipedia's [[List of songs about New York City]] and also in Marc Ferris's 5-page, 15-column list of "Songs and Compositions Inspired by New York City" in ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (1995),<ref>''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] ([[Yale University Press]] and The [[New-York Historical Society]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], 1995 ISBN 0-300-05536-6), pages 1091–1095</ref> only a handful refer to The Bronx.
