The '''Chief Minister of the Northern Territory''' is the [[head of government]] of the [[Northern Territory]].  He is the equivalent of a [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] in a state.  

He is formally appointed by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory of Australia|Administrator]], who in normal circumstances will appoint the head of whatever party holds the majority of seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory]]. In times of constitutional crisis, the Administrator can appoint someone else as Chief Minister.  However, this has never occurred.

The incumbent Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is [[Adam Giles]], representing the [[Country Liberal Party]].

| {{Australian politics/party colours/CLP}}|&nbsp; || Dr [[Goff Letts]] <ref>While the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] was created in 1974, self-government was not granted until 1978. As a result, members of the executive in the first parliament (1974–1977) and the first eighteen months of the second were known by alternative titles. While Dr [[Goff Letts]] and his successor [[Paul Everingham]] were officially known as Majority Leaders, their function was effectively the same as that of a Chief Minister from 1978.</ref> || [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] || 1974–1977
