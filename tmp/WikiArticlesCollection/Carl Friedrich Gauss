== Early years (1777–1798) ==
[[File:Statue-of-Gauss-in-Braunschweig.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Gauss at his birthplace,  [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]]]
Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick (Braunschweig)]], in the [[Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] (now part of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]]), as the son of poor working-class parents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/gauss.html|title=Carl Friedrich Gauss|last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Wichita State University }}</ref> Indeed, his mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the [[Ascension of Jesus|Feast of the Ascension]], which itself occurs 40 days after [[Easter]]. Gauss would later solve this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of [[Computus|finding the date of Easter]], deriving methods to compute the date in both past and future years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://american_almanac.tripod.com/gauss.htm|title=Gauss Birthday Problem|last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> He was christened and [[Confirmation|confirmed]] in a church near the school he attended as a child.<ref>{{cite web|author=Susan Chambless |url=http://www.gausschildren.org/genwiki/index.php?title=Letter:WORTHINGTON,_Helen_to_Carl_F._Gauss_-_1911-07-26 |title=Letter:WORTHINGTON, Helen to Carl F. Gauss – 1911-07-26 |publisher=Susan D. Chambless |date=2000-03-11 |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref>

Gauss was a [[child prodigy]]. There are many anecdotes about his precocity while a toddler, and he made his first ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'', his [[magnum opus]], in 1798 at the age of 21, though it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.

Gauss's intellectual abilities attracted the attention of the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]],<ref name="scientificmonthly"/> who sent him to the Collegium Carolinum (now [[Braunschweig University of Technology]]), which he attended from 1792 to 1795, and to the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] from 1795 to 1798.
While at university, Gauss independently rediscovered several important theorems;<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Gauss}}</ref> his breakthrough occurred in 1796 when he showed that any regular [[polygon]] with a number of sides which is a [[Fermat number|Fermat prime]] (and, consequently, those polygons with any number of sides which is the product of distinct Fermat primes and a [[exponentiation|power]] of 2) can be constructed by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career.
Gauss was so pleased by this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his tombstone. The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.<ref>Pappas, Theoni: Mathematical Snippets, Page 42. Pgw 2008</ref>

The year 1796 was most productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March.<ref>Carl Friedrich Gauss §§365–366 in [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. Leipzig, Germany, 1801. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]], 1965.</ref> He further advanced [[modular arithmetic]], greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} On 8 April he became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31&nbsp;May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers.
Gauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the famous note: "[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ]]! num&nbsp;=&nbsp;Δ&nbsp;+&nbsp;Δ&nbsp;+&nbsp;Δ". On October&nbsp;1 he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in [[finite field]]s, which 150 years later led to the [[Weil conjectures]].

== Middle years (1799–1830) ==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
In his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.

Gauss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among things, introduced the symbol ≡ for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], contained the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]].
[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]

In that same year, [[Italy|Italian]] astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.

Gauss, who was 23 at the time, heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801—just about a year after its first sighting—and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December at [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]].

Gauss's method involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by Kepler's Second Law). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=Development of mathematics in the 19th century|last1=Klein|first1=Felix|last2=Hermann|first2=Robert |isbn=978-0-915692-28-6|year=1979|publisher=Math Sci Press}}</ref>

One such method was the [[fast Fourier transform]]. While this method is traditionally attributed to a 1965 paper by [[J. W. Cooley]] and  [[J. W. Tukey]], Gauss developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method. His paper, ''[http://lseet.univ-tln.fr/~iaroslav/Gauss_Theoria_interpolationis_methodo_nova_tractata.php Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata]'', was only published posthumously in Volume 3 of his collected works. This paper predates the first presentation by [[Joseph Fourier]] on the subject in 1807.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heideman|first=M.|coauthors=Johnson, D., Burrus, C.|title=Gauss and the history of the fast fourier transform|journal=IEEE ASSP Magazine|year=1984|volume=1|issue=4|pages=14–21|doi=10.1109/MASSP.1984.1162257}}</ref>

Zach noted that "without the intelligent work and calculations of Doctor Gauss we might not have found Ceres again". Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[Göttingen Observatory|observatory in Göttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life.

The discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It introduced the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]], and contained an influential treatment of the [[Least squares|method of least squares]], a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of [[Observational error|measurement error]]. Gauss proved the method under the assumption of [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] errors (see [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]; see also [[List of topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gaussian]]). The method had been described earlier by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1795.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
[[File:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gauß, 1828.jpg|thumb|Gauss's portrait published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' 1828]]

In 1818 Gauss, putting his calculation skills to practical use, carried out a [[surveying|geodesic survey]] of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], linking up with previous [[Denmark|Danish]] surveys. To aid the survey, Gauss invented the [[heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.

Gauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory. Research on these geometries led to, among other things, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend [[Farkas Bolyai|Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai]] with whom Gauss had sworn "brotherhood and the banner of truth" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry. Bolyai's son, [[János Bolyai]], discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: ''"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work&nbsp;... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years."'' [[File:Normal distribution pdf.png|thumb|left|Four [[normal distribution|Gaussian distributions]] in [[statistics]]]]This unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with János Bolyai (who thought that Gauss was "stealing" his idea), but it is now generally taken at face value.<ref name="Krantz2010">{{cite book|author=Steven G. Krantz|title=An Episodic History of Mathematics: Mathematical Culture through Problem Solving|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ulmAH-6IzNoC&pg=PA171|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=1 April 2010|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-766-3|pages=171–}}</ref> Letters from Gauss years before 1829 reveal him obscurely discussing the problem of parallel lines. [[G. Waldo Dunnington|Waldo Dunnington]], a biographer of Gauss, argues in ''Gauss, Titan of Science'' that Gauss was in fact in full possession of non-Euclidean geometry long before it was published by [[János Bolyai]], but that he refused to publish any of it because of his fear of controversy.

The geodetic survey of Hanover, which required Gauss to spend summers traveling on horseback for a decade,<ref>[http://www.keplersdiscovery.com/Gauss.html The Prince of Mathematics]. The Door to Science by keplersdiscovery.com.</ref> fueled Gauss's interest in [[Differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], a field of mathematics dealing with [[curve]]s and [[surface]]s. Among other things he came up with the notion of [[Gaussian curvature]]. This led in 1828 to an important theorem, the [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem''), establishing an important property of the notion of [[curvature]]. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring [[angle]]s and [[distance]]s on the surface. That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be [[embedding|embedded]] in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.

In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

[[File:Göttingen-Grave.of.Gauß.06.jpg|thumb|Grave of Gauss at [[Albanifriedhof]] in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]].]]
In 1831 Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], leading to new knowledge in [[magnetism]] (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, length and time) and the discovery of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] in electricity. It was during this time that he formulated his namesake [[Gauss's law|law]]. They constructed the first [[Electrical telegraph|electromechanical telegraph]] in 1833, which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic [[observatory]] to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the "Magnetischer Verein" (''magnetic club'' in [[German language|German]]), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer ([[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]]) sources of Earth's magnetic field.

In 1840, Gauss published his influential ''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'',<ref name="Bühler1">{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-10662-6|ref=harv|pages=144–145}}</ref> in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a [[paraxial approximation]] ([[Gaussian optics]]).<ref name=Hecht>{{Cite book|title=Optics|first=Eugene|last=Hecht|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1987|isbn=0-201-11609-X|ref=harv|page=134}}</ref>  Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its [[Cardinal point (optics)|cardinal points]]<ref name=Bass>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Optics| first1=Michael|last1=Bass|first2=Casimer|last2=DeCusatis| first3=Jay|last3=Enoch|first4=Vasudevan|last4=Lakshminarayanan|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2009|isbn=0-07-149889-3|ref=harv|page=17.7}}</ref> and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.<ref name=Ostdiek>{{Cite book|title=Inquiry Into Physics |first1=Vern J. |last1=Ostdiek|first2=Donald J.|last2=Bord|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=0-495-11943-1|ref=harv|page=381}}</ref>

In 1854, Gauss notably selected the topic for [[Bernhard Riemann]]'s now famous Habilitationvortrag, ''Über die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen''.<ref name=Monastyrsky>{{Cite book|title=Riemann, Topology, and Physics|first=Michael|last=Monastyrsky|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=1987|isbn=0-8176-3262-X|ref=harv|pages=21–22}}</ref>  On the way home from Riemann's lecture, Weber reported that Gauss was full of praise and excitement.<ref name="Bühler2">{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=Bühler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-10662-6|ref=harv|page=154}}</ref>

Gauss died in Göttingen, in the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (now part of [[Lower Saxony]], Germany) in 1855 and is interred in the [[Albanifriedhof]] cemetery there. Two individuals gave eulogies at his funeral: Gauss's son-in-law [[Heinrich Ewald]] and [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]], who was Gauss's close friend and biographer. His brain was preserved and was studied by [[Rudolf Wagner]] who found its mass to be 1,492&nbsp;grams (slightly above average) and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters<ref>This reference from 1891 ({{cite journal

== Religion ==
Bühler writes that, according to correspondence with Rudolf Wagner, Gauss did not appear to believe in a personal God.<ref name=Buhler3/> He was said to be a [[Deism|deist]].<ref name="Gerhard Falk 1995 121">{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0016-3|author=Gerhard Falk|page=121|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet.

According to Dunnington,  Gauss's religion was based upon the search for truth. He believed in "the immortality of the spiritual individuality, in a personal permanence after death, in a last order of things, in an eternal, righteous, omniscient and omnipotent God". Gauss also upheld [[religious tolerance]], believing it wrong to disturb others who were at peace with their own beliefs.<ref name="scientificmonthly"/>

== Family ==
[[File:Therese Gauss.jpg|thumb|Gauss's daughter Therese (1816—1864)]]
Gauss's personal life was overshadowed by the early death of his first wife, Johanna Osthoff, in 1809, soon followed by the death of one child, Louis. Gauss plunged into a [[Clinical depression|depression]] from which he never fully recovered. He married again, to Johanna's best friend named Friederica Wilhelmine Waldeck but commonly known as Minna. When his second wife died in 1831 after a long illness,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Gauss.html |title=Gauss biography|publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> one of his daughters, Therese, took over the household and cared for Gauss until the end of his life. His mother lived in his house from 1817 until her death in 1839.<ref name="scientificmonthly"/>

Gauss had six children. With Johanna (1780–1809), his children were Joseph (1806–1873), Wilhelmina (1808–1846) and Louis (1809–1810). Of all of Gauss's children, Wilhelmina was said to have come closest to his talent, but she died young.  With Minna Waldeck he also had three children: Eugene (1811–1896), Wilhelm (1813–1879) and Therese (1816–1864).  Eugene shared a good measure of Gauss's talent in languages and computation.<ref name="gausschildren">{{cite web|url=http://www.gausschildren.org/genwiki/index.php?title=Letter:GAUSS,_Charles_Henry_to_Florian_Cajori_-_1898-12-21 |title=Letter:GAUSS, Charles Henry to Florian Cajori – 1898-12-21 |publisher=Susan D. Chambless |accessdate=2011-09-14 |date=2000-03-11}}</ref>  Therese kept house for Gauss until his death, after which she married.

Gauss eventually had conflicts with his sons. He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for "fear of lowering the family name".<ref name="gausschildren" /> Gauss wanted Eugene to become a [[lawyer]], but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States, where he was quite successful. Wilhelm also settled in [[Missouri]], starting as a [[farmer]] and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. It took many years for Eugene's success to counteract his reputation among Gauss's friends and colleagues. See also [[s:Robert Gauss to Felix Klein - September 3, 1912|the letter from Robert Gauss to Felix Klein]] on 3 September 1912.

== Personality ==
Carl Gauss was an ardent [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] and a hard worker. He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto ''pauca sed matura'' ("few, but ripe"). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them.  Mathematical historian [[Eric Temple Bell]] estimated that, had Gauss published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.<ref>{{cite book

Though he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in [[Berlin]] in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Friedrich Bessel]]. Before she died, [[Sophie Germain]] was recommended by Gauss to receive her honorary degree.

Gauss usually declined to present the intuition behind his often very elegant proofs—he preferred them to appear "out of thin air" and erased all traces of how he discovered them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} This is justified, if unsatisfactorily, by Gauss in his "[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]", where he states that all analysis (i.e., the paths one travelled to reach the solution of a problem) must be suppressed for sake of brevity.

Gauss supported the [[monarchy]] and opposed [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], whom he saw as an outgrowth of [[revolution]].

== Anecdotes ==
There are several stories of his early genius.  According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.

Another famous story has it that in [[primary school]] after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. Büttner, gave him a task : add a list of [[integer]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant [[Johann Christian Martin Bartels|Martin Bartels]].

Gauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;99&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;98&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, and so on, for a total sum of 50&nbsp;×&nbsp;101&nbsp;=&nbsp;5050.
However, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see<ref>{{cite web|author=Brian Hayes |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/gausss-day-of-reckoning/2 |title=Gauss's Day of Reckoning Â |doi=10.1511/2006.3.200 |publisher=American Scientist |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> for discussion of the original [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book ''A first course in Abstract Algebra'', question whether it ever happened.

According to [[Isaac Asimov]], Gauss was once interrupted in the middle of a problem and told that his wife was dying. He is purported to have said, "Tell her to wait a moment till I'm done."<ref>{{cite book

 }}</ref> This anecdote is briefly discussed in [[G. Waldo Dunnington]]'s ''Gauss, Titan of Science'' where it is suggested that it is an [[apocryphal]] story.

He referred to mathematics as "the queen of sciences"<ref>Quoted in Waltershausen, Wolfgang Sartorius von (1856, repr. 1965). Gauss zum Gedächtniss. Sändig Reprint Verlag H. R. Wohlwend. ISBN 3-253-01702-8.

== Commemorations ==
[[File:10 DM Serie4 Vorderseite.jpg|thumb|German 10-[[Deutsche Mark]] [[Banknote]] (1993; discontinued) featuring Gauss]]
[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1977, MiNr 2215.jpg|thumb|Gauss (aged about 26) on East German [[Postage stamp|stamp]] produced in 1977. Next to him: [[heptadecagon]], [[compass and straightedge]].]]

From 1989 through 2001, Gauss's portrait, a [[normal distribution curve]] and some prominent [[Göttingen]] buildings were featured on the German ten-mark banknote. The reverse featured the approach for [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. Germany has also issued three postage stamps honoring Gauss. One (no. 725) appeared in 1955 on the hundredth anniversary of his death; two others, nos. 1246 and 1811, in 1977, the 200th anniversary of his birth.

[[Daniel Kehlmann]]'s 2005 novel ''Die Vermessung der Welt'', translated into English as ''[[Measuring the World]]'' (2006), explores Gauss's life and work through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting them with those of the German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. A film version directed by [[Detlev Buck]] was released in 2012.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1571401/ ''Measuring the World'' IMDb]</ref>

In 2007 a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Gauss was placed in the [[Walhalla temple]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmwfk.bayern.de/downloads/aviso/2004_1_aviso_48-49.pdf |title=Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst: Startseite |publisher=Stmwfk.bayern.de |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref>

In 1929 the [[Poland|Polish]] mathematician [[Marian Rejewski]], who would solve the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]] in December 1932, began studying [[actuarial statistics]] at [[Göttingen]]. At the request of his [[Poznań University]] professor, [[Zdzisław Krygowski]], on arriving at Göttingen Rejewski laid flowers on Gauss's grave.<ref>[[Władysław Kozaczuk]], ''Enigma:  How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War Two'', Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, p. 7, note 6.</ref>
