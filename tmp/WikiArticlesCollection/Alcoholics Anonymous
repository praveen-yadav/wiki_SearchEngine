'''Alcoholics Anonymous''' ('''AA''') is an international [[Social work with groups#Mutual aid|mutual aid]] fellowship founded in 1935 by [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]] and [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Dr. Bob Smith]] in [[Akron, Ohio]]. AA states that its primary purpose is "to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve [[sobriety]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Michael Gross,Ph.D|journal=American Journal of public health|year=2010|issue=December 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/smf-92_en.pdf AA.org]</ref><ref>Mäkelä 1996, p. 3</ref> With other early members Wilson and Smith developed AA's [[the Twelve Steps|Twelve Step]] program of spiritual and character development. AA's [[Twelve Traditions]] were introduced in 1946 to help AA stabilize and grow. The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, and do not affiliate AA with any other organization. The Traditions also recommend that AA members acting on behalf of the fellowship steer clear of dogma, governing hierarchies and involvement in public issues. Subsequent fellowships such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]] have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949">{{cite journal |journal=The AA Grapevine |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous |month=November |year=1949 |volume=6 |issue=6 |title=The Twelve Traditions |issn=0362-2584 |oclc=50379271}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Twelve-Step and Mutual-Help Programs for Addictive Disorders|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=22 |issue=2 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70085-X |pmid=10385942 |last1=Chappel |first1=JN |last2=Dupont |first2=RL |pages=425–46}}</ref>

AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called "The Big Book", originally titled ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism]]''.

==Oxford Group origins==
{{Main| History of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

AA sprang from [[The Oxford Group]], a non-denominational movement modeled after first-century Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cheever, Susan |title=My name is Bill: Bill Wilson: his life and the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=2004 |page= 129|isbn=0-7432-0154-X }}</ref> Some members ("Groupers") found the Group a help in maintaining sobriety, one of whom was [[Ebby Thacher]], Wilson's former drinking buddy. Following the evangelical bent of the Group, Thacher told Wilson that he had "got religion" and was sober, and that Wilson could do the same if he set aside objections to religion and instead formed a personal idea of God, "another power" or "higher power".<ref name="Pass It On, p 117">''Pass It On'', p 117.</ref><ref>Walter HA, ''Soul Surgery'' p. 44 Oxford: The Oxford Group</ref><ref name="NOTGOOD">{{cite book |author=Kurtz, Ernest |title=Not-God: a history of Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Hazelden Educational Services |location=Center City, Minn |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=0-89486-065-8 |doi= }}</ref>

Wilson felt with Thacher a "kinship of common suffering" and - while drunk - attended his first Group gathering.  Within days Wilson admitted himself to the [[Charles B. Towns|Charles B. Towns Hospital]], but not before drinking four beers on the way – the last time Wilson drank alcohol. Under the care of [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William Duncan Silkworth]] (an early benefactor of AA), Wilson's detox included the [[deliriant]] [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]].<ref>Pittman , Bill "AA the Way it Began"  1988, Glenn Abbey Books</ref>  At the hospital in a state of despair Wilson experienced a bright flash of light which he felt to be God revealing himself.<ref name="NOTGOD33">Kurtz 1991. pp. 18–20</ref>

Following his hospital discharge Wilson joined the Oxford Group and recruited other alcoholics to the Group.  Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Dr. Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on "the science" of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Dr. Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on June 10, 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.<ref name="NOTGOD33" /><ref name="NOTGOD16-17">Kurtz 1991. pp. 16–17</ref>

While Wilson and Smith credited their sobriety to working with alcoholics under the auspices of the Oxford Group, a Group associate pastor sermonized against Wilson and his alcoholic Groupers for forming a "secret, ashamed sub-group" engaged in "divergent works".<ref name="NOTGOD16-17"/>  By 1937 Wilson separated from the Oxford Group. AA Historian Ernest Kurtz described  the split:<ref name="NOTGOD45-46">Kurtz 1991. pp. 45–46</ref>
<blockquote>''...more and more, Bill discovered that new adherents could get sober by believing in each other and in the strength of this group.  Men [no women were members yet] who had proven over and over again, by extremely painful experience, that they could not get sober on their own had somehow become more powerful when two or three of them worked on their common problem. This, then—whatever it was that occurred among them—was what they could accept as a power greater than themselves. They did not need the Oxford Group.''
</blockquote>

In 1955, Wilson acknowledged AA's debt, saying "The Oxford Groupers had clearly shown us what to do. And just as importantly, we learned from them ''what not to do.''"  Among the Oxford Group practices AA retained were informal gatherings, a "changed-life" developed through "stages", and working with others for no material gain. AA's analogs for these are meetings, "the steps", and sponsorship. AA's tradition of anonymity was a reaction to the publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group., as well as AA's wish to not promote, Wilson said, "erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us."<ref name="NOTGOD46-48">Kurtz 1991. pp. 46–8</ref>

==The Big Book, the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions==
To promote the fellowship, Wilson and other members wrote the initially-titled book, ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism'',<ref>[http://gsowatch.aamo.info/1939/uslaw.htm GSOwatch.aamo.info]</ref> from which AA drew its name. Informally known as "The Big Book" (with its first 164 pages virtually unchanged since the 1939 edition), it suggests a twelve-step program in which members admit that they are powerless over alcohol and need help from a "higher power"; seek guidance and strength through prayer and meditation from God or [[Higher Power]] of their own understanding; take a moral inventory with care to include resentments; list and become ready to remove character defects; list and make amends to those harmed, continue to take a moral inventory, pray, meditate, and then try to help other alcoholics recover. The second half of the book, "Personal Stories" (subject to additions, removal and retitling in subsequent editions), is made of AA members' redemptive autobiographical sketches.

In 1941, interviews on American radio and favorable articles in US magazines, including a piece by Jack Alexander in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', led to increased book sales and membership.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-12_theJackAlexArticle1.pdf |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |date=1 March 1941 |author=Jack Alexander |journal=Saturday Eventing Post |edition=Reprinted in booklet form |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyRPXTQK |isbn=0-89638-199-4}}</ref> By 1946, as the growing fellowship quarreled over structure, purpose, and authority, as well as finances and publicity, Wilson began to form and promote what became known as AA's [[Twelve Traditions]], guidelines for an altruistic, unaffiliated, non-coercive, and non-hierarchical structure that limited AA's purpose to only helping alcoholics on a non-professional level while shunning publicity. Eventually he gained formal adoption and inclusion of the Twelve Traditions in all future editions of the Big Book.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949"/> At the 1955 St. Louis convention in Missouri, Wilson relinquished stewardship of AA to the General Service Conference,<ref>Pass It On 1984, p. 359</ref> as AA grew to millions of members internationally.<ref name="AAFACTFILE"/>

==Organization and finances==
{{Main|Twelve Traditions }}
[[File:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|A regional service center for Alcoholics Anonymous]]

AA says it is "not organized in the formal or political sense",<ref name="AAFACTFILE">{{cite journal |title=AA Fact File|url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-24_aafactfile.pdf |publisher=General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous |year=2007 }}</ref> and Bill Wilson called it a "benign anarchy".<ref>AA Comes Of Age, p. 225</ref> In Ireland, Shane Butler said that AA “looks like it couldn’t survive as there’s no leadership or top-level telling local [[cumann]]s what to do, but it has worked and proved itself extremely robust.” Butler explained that "AA’s 'inverted pyramid' style of governance has helped it to avoid many of the pitfalls that political and religious institutions have encountered since it was established here in 1946."<ref>{{cite news | first=Steven | last=Carroll | coauthors= | title=Group avoids politics of alcohol – author | date= 2010-03-03| publisher=http://www.irishtimes.com/ | url =http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0326/1224267100034.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-30 }}</ref>

In 2006, AA counted 1,867,212 members and 106,202 AA groups worldwide.<ref name="AAFACTFILE" /> The Twelve Traditions informally guide how individual AA groups function, and the Twelve Concepts for World Service guide how the organization is structured globally.<ref>{{cite web|title=The A.A.

A member who accepts a service position or an organizing role is a "trusted servant" with terms rotating and limited, typically lasting three months to two years and determined by group vote and the nature of the position. Each group is a self-governing entity with AA World Services acting only in an advisory capacity. AA is served entirely by alcoholics, except for seven "nonalcoholic friends of the fellowship" of the 21-member AA Board of Trustees.<ref name="AAFACTFILE"/>

AA groups are self-supporting, relying on voluntary donations from members to cover expenses.<ref name="AAFACTFILE"/> The AA General Service Office (GSO) limits contributions to US$3,000 a year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A.A. GSO Guidelines: Finances |url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/en_pdfs/mg-15_finance.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQ0kRis |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Service Office}}</ref> Above the group level, AA may hire outside professionals for services that require specialized expertise or full-time responsibilities.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949"/>

AA receives proceeds from books and literature that constitute more than 50% of the income for its General Service Office.<ref name=GSO2005OPS>{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.org/pics_gen/en_gso07_operresults.jpg |title=GSO 2007 Operating Results |quote=Gross Profit from Literature ~8,6M (57%), Contributions ~$6.5M (43%) |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Services Office |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQeumnF}}</ref> Unlike individual groups, the GSO is not self-supporting and maintains a small salaried staff. It also maintains service centers which coordinate activities such as printing literature, responding to public inquiries, and organizing conferences. They are funded by local members and responsible to the AA groups they represent. Other International General Service Offices (Australia, Costa Rica, Russia, etc.) are independent of AA World Services in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/aa_international.cfm?origpage=31 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous : International General Service Offices |work=Alcoholics Anonymous website |accessdate=2009-10-08 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQO0oho}}</ref>

AA's program is an inheritor of [[Counter-Enlightenment]] philosophy. AA shares the view that acceptance of one's inherent limitations is critical to finding one's proper place among other humans and God. Such ideas are described as "Counter-Enlightenment" because they are contrary to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideal that humans have the capacity to make their lives and societies a heaven on earth using their own power and reason.<ref name="HUMPHREYS1995">{{cite journal |last=Humphreys |first=Keith |title=World Views of Alcoholics Anonymous, Women for Sobriety, and Adult Children of Alcoholics/Al-Anon Mutual Help Groups |journal=Addiction Research & Theory |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=231–243 |doi=10.3109/16066359509005240 |year=1995 |last2=Kaskutas |first2=Lee Ann}}</ref>  
After evaluating AA's literature and observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David Rudy and Arthur Grei found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing world view while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious world view that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a ''quasi-religious organization''.<ref name="RUDY1989">{{cite journal |last1=Rudy |first1=David R. |last2=Greil |first2=Arthur L. |title=Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Religious Organization?: Meditations on Marginality |volume=50 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.2307/3710917 |jstor=3710917 |journal=Sociological Analysis}}</ref> 

===Meetings===
AA meetings are "quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dimensions of Alcoholics Anonymous: 1935–1965|journal=Substance Use & Misuse |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=509 |year=1969 |doi=10.3109/10826086909062033 |last1=Leach |first1=Barry |last2=Norris |first2=John L. |last3=Dancey |first3=Travis |last4=Bissell |first4=Leclair}}</ref> They are usually informal and often feature discussions. Local AA directories list a variety of weekly meetings. Those listed as "closed" are only for those with "a desire to stop drinking",<ref name="TRADITIONS1949"/> while "open" meetings are available to anyone. At speaker meetings one or two members tell their stories, while discussion meetings allocate the most time for general discussion. Some meetings are devoted to studying and discussing the AA literature. Except for men's and women's meetings, most meetings targeting specific demographics (including newcomers, gay people, and young people) do not exclude other alcoholics. While AA has pamphlets that suggest meeting formats,<ref name="AAGROUP">{{cite journal |title=The A.A.

== Spirituality ==
A study found a robust association between an increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use over time.  The research also found that AA was effective for agnostics and atheists. The authors concluded that though spirituality is an important mechanism of behavioral change for alcoholics, it is not the only means used.<ref>Kelly, John F.  et al   Spirituality in Recovery: A Lagged Mediational Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous’ Principal Theoretical Mechanism of Behavior Change  Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research Vol. 35, No. 3  March 2011  pp.&nbsp;1–10</ref>

==Disease concept of alcoholism==
{{Main|Disease theory of alcoholism}}

More informally than not, AA's membership has helped popularize the disease concept of alcoholism, though AA officially has had no part in the development of such postulates which had appeared as early as the late eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Rush|title=Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind|publisher=Bartam|location=Philadelphia|year=1805}}</ref>  Though AA initially avoided the term "disease", in 1973 conference-approved literature categorically stated that "we had the disease of alcoholism."<ref>[http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-3_isaaforyou.pdf AA.org]</ref>  Regardless of official positions, from AA's inception most members have believed alcoholism to be a disease.<ref name="bhrm.org"/>

Though cautious regarding the medical nature of alcoholism, AA has let others voice opinions. The Big Book states "we are told that alcoholism "is an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer." Ernest Kurtz says this is "The closest the book Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism."<ref name="bhrm.org"/>  In his introduction to The Big Book, non-member [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William Silkworth]] said those unable to moderate their drinking have an allergy. Addressing the allergy concept, AA said "The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little."<ref name="Alcoholics Anonymous page xxx"/> AA later acknowledged that "alcoholism is not a true allergy, the experts now inform us."<ref>''Living Sober'' p 68</ref> Wilson explained in 1960 why AA had refrained from using the term "disease":
<blockquote>We AAs have never called alcoholism a disease because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady – a far safer term for us to use.<ref>[http://www.nccatoday.org/conversation.htm NCCAtoday.org]</ref></blockquote>

== Canadian and United States demographics ==
AA's New York General Service Office regularly surveys AA members in North America. Its 2011 survey of over 8,000 members in Canada and the United States concluded that, in North America, AA members who responded to the survey were 65% male and 35% female. Average member sobriety is slightly under 10 years with 36% sober more than ten years, 12% sober from five to ten years, 24% sober from one to five years, and 27% sober less than one year. Before coming to AA, 63% of members received some type of treatment or counseling, such as medical, psychological, or spiritual. After coming to AA, 62% received outside treatment or counseling. Of those members, 82% said that outside help played an important part in their recovery. The same survey showed that AA received 12% of its membership from court ordered attendance.<ref name="ogfaaa">{{cite journal |title=Alcoholics Anonymous 2011 Membership Survey |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-48_membershipsurvey.pdf |accessdate=2012-03-20 |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services' General Service Office |year=2011}}</ref>

===Research limitations===
AA tends to polarize observers into believers and non-believers,<ref>Vaillant, 1995, p 255.</ref> and discussion of AA often creates controversy rather than objective reflection.<ref>Vaillant, 1995, p 265.</ref>  Moreover, a randomized study of AA is difficult: AA members are not randomly selected from the population of chronic alcoholics, with the possible exception of those who are mandated by courts to attend AA meetings; they are instead self-selected.<ref>Griffith 2002, p. 103–117</ref> There are two opposing types of self-selection bias: (1) drinkers may be motivated to stop drinking before they participate in AA (2) AA may attract the more severe and difficult cases.<ref name="HUMPHREYS2002">{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = Keith | journal = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | title = Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-Step Alcoholism Treatment Programs | volume = 16 | publisher = Springer US | doi = 10.1007/b100495 | year = 2002 | pages = 149–164 | pmid = 12638636 | isbn = 978-0-306-47258-9 | series = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | editor1-last = Galanter | editor1-first = Marc | editor2-last = Begleiter | editor2-first = Henri | editor3-last = Deitrich | editor3-first = Richard | editor4-last = Gallant | editor4-first = Donald|displayeditors=4|}}</ref> [[Scientific control|Controlled experiments]] with AA versus non-AA subjects are also difficult because AA is so easily accessible. Twelve-step groups, like AA, are not conducive to [[Sampling (statistics)#Probability and nonprobability sampling|probability sampling]] of members.

===Studies===
Studies of AA's efficacy have produced inconsistent results.

===Retention===
Every third year since 1968, AA has issued a pamphlet summarizing its latest [[wiktionary:triennial|triennial]] survey of meeting attendants. Additional published comments and analysis for academics and professionals have supplemented the survey results from 1970 through 1990.<ref name="MCINTIRE2000"/> The 1990 commentary evaluated data of triennial surveys from 1977 through 1989 and found that the distribution of those with one year or less indicated that one quarter (26%) of those who first attend an AA meeting are still attending after one year. Furthermore, nearly one third (31.5%) leave the program after one month, and by the end of the third month, almost half (47.4%) leave. Of those who stay for three months, half (50.0%) will attain one year.<ref name="AAInternalSurvey"/> After the first year, the rate of attrition slows. Only those in the first year were recorded by month.<ref name="AAInternalSurvey"/> 

Two landmark surveys that sampled the general population produced independent results on AA continuance rates. The 1990 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES) found that Alcoholics Anonymous has a 31% continuance rate.<ref>National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey Data, Manual 1 July 11, 1994, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</ref> The 2001-2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC) indicates a slightly higher rate, at 35.2%.<ref>L.

Recent Developments in Alcoholism, Vol 18: Research on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery. 261-282</ref>

===Sobriety of members===
Internal AA surveys suggest that about 40% of the members sober for less than a year will remain another year. About 80% of those sober more than one year, but less than five years will remain sober and active in the fellowship another year. About 90% of the members sober five years or more will remain sober and active in the fellowship another year. Those who remained sober outside the fellowship could not be calculated using the survey results.<ref name="AAInternalSurvey">{{cite journal |title=Comments On A.A. Triennial Surveys |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/3264243/Comments-on-AAs-Triennial-Surveys |month=December |year=1990 |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services}}</ref>

===Health-care costs===
As a volunteer-supported program, AA is free of charge. This contrasts with treatments for alcoholism such as inpatient treatment, drug therapy, psychotherapy and cognitive-based therapy. One study found that the institutional use of TSF to encourage participation in AA reduced health-care expenditures by 45% when compared to another group that was not encouraged to participate in AA.<ref name="HUMPHREYS2001" />

==Relationship with institutions==

===Hospitals===
Many AA meetings take place in treatment facilities. Carrying the message of AA into hospitals was how the co-founders of AA first remained sober. They discovered great value of working with alcoholics who are still suffering, and that even if the alcoholic they were working with did not stay sober, they did.<ref name=cheever>{{cite journal|last=Cheever|first=Susan|title=Bill W.: The Healer|journal=Time Magazine|date=June 14, 1999|page=201|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991266,00.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|quote=by helping another alcoholic, he could save himself}}</ref><ref name="dickb">{{cite book|last=B. |first=Dick |title=Turning Point: A History of Early A.A.'s Spiritual Roots and Successes|year=1997|publisher=Good Book Publishing Company|isbn=9781885803078|page=110|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nTAuj7PsApMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Turning+Point:+A+History+of+Early+A.A.%27s+Spiritual+Roots+and+Successes+Volume+10+of+History+of+Early+A.+A.%27s+Spiritual+Roots+and+Successes+Series&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FrC4UeTGEof7iwLjvoGwAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Turning%20Point%3A%20A%20History%20of%20Early%20A.A.%27s%20Spiritual%20Roots%20and%20Successes%20Volume%2010%20of%20History%20of%20Early%20A.%20A.%27s%20Spiritual%20Roots%20and%20Successes%20Series&f=false|edition=Volume 10|accessdate=12 June 2013|chapter=Turning point|quote=Bill went back to Towns constantly to work on alcoholics there, simply trying to help others had kept him from even thinking of drinking}}</ref><ref name=lois>{{cite book|first=Lois|title=Lois remembers: memoirs of the co-founder of Al-Anon and wife of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous|year=1979|publisher=Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters|isbn=9780910034234|page=95|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LdMPAQAAMAAJ&q=lois+remembers&dq=lois+remembers&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3K64Ue6nM4rniAKB6YGYDA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc|accessdate=12 June 2013|quote=simply trying to help other had kept him from even thinking of drinking}}</ref>   Bill Wilson wrote, "Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics".<ref>{{cite book |first=Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. |year=1976 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |edition=3rd |page=89 |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref> Bill Wilson visited Towns Hospital in New York City in an attempt to help the alcoholics who were patients there in 1934. At St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio, Smith worked with still more alcoholics. In 1939 a New York mental institution, Rockland State Hospital, was one of the first institutions to allow AA hospital groups. Service to corrections and treatment facilities used to be combined until the General Service Conference, in 1977, voted to dissolve its Institutions Committee and form two separate committees, one for treatment facilities, and one for correctional facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://area62.org/committees/treatment.htm |title=Treatment Committee |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|work=http://area62.org/ |publisher=Area 62 |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>

===Prisons===
In the United States and Canada, AA meetings are held in hundreds of correctional facilities. The AA General Service Office has published a workbook with detailed recommendations for methods of approaching correctional-facility officials with the intent of developing an in-prison AA program.<ref name="CORRECTIONS1">{{cite journal |title=Corrections Workbook |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous Word Services, Inc |year=1995 |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-45i_corrections.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyFWmoKq}}</ref> In addition, AA publishes a variety of pamphlets specifically for the incarcerated alcoholic.<ref name="CORRECTIONS2">{{cite web |title=Corrections Catalog |url=http://www.aa.org/subpage.cfm?page=249 |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyFe00Dd |quote=The titles include: ''Carrying the Message into Correctional Facilities, Where Do I Go From Here?, A.A. in Prison: Inmate to Inmate, A.A. in Correctional Facilities, It Sure Beats Sitting in a Cell, Memo to an Inmate Who May be an Alcoholic, A Message to Corrections Administrators''}}</ref> Additionally, the AA General Service Office provides a pamphlet with guidelines for members working with incarcerated alcoholics.<ref name="GUIDELINES">{{cite journal |title=AA Guidelines from GSO: Cooperating with Court, DWI and Similar Programs |url=http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/mg-05_coopwithcourt.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyFnXpLK |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12}}</ref>

===United States Court rulings===
United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained ''enough'' religious components (variously described in ''Griffin v. Coughlin'' below as, inter alia, "religion", "religious activity", "religious exercise") to make coerced attendance at AA meetings a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the constitution.<ref name="NYCTAP">{{cite web |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I96_0137.htm |title=IN THE MATTER OF DAVID GRIFFIN, APPELLANT, v.

===American treatment industry===
In 1949, the [[Hazelden]] treatment center was founded and staffed by AA members, and since then many alcoholic rehabilitation clinics have incorporated AA's precepts into their treatment programs.<ref>Roberson 1988, p. 220</ref>  31% of AA's membership results from treatment centers referrals.<ref name = "ogfaaa"/>

=== United Kingdom treatment industry ===
A cross-sectional survey of substance-misuse treatment providers in the West Midlands found fewer than 10% integrated twelve-step methods in their practice and only a third felt their consumers were suited for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous membership. Less than half were likely to recommend self-help groups to their clients. Providers with nursing qualification were more likely to make such referrals than those without. A statistically significant correlation was found between providers' self-reported level of spirituality and their likelihood of recommending AA or NA.<ref name="DAY2005">{{cite journal |year=2005 |title=United Kingdom substance misuse treatment workers' attitudes toward 12-step self-help groups |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |volume=29 |issue=4 |month=December |pages=321–327 |doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2005.08.009 |pmid=16311185 |last1=Day |first1=E |last2=Gaston |first2=RL |last3=Furlong |first3=E |last4=Murali |first4=V |last5=Copello |first5=A}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{See also|Twelve-step program#Criticism|l1=Twelve-step program: Criticism}}

===Moderation or abstinence===
{{see also|Alcoholism#Management|l1=Alcoholism: Management}}

[[Stanton Peele]] argued that some AA groups apply the [[Disease model of addiction|disease model]] to all problem drinkers, whether or not they are "full-blown" alcoholics.<ref>Peele 1989</ref> Along with Nancy Shute, Peele has advocated that besides AA, other options should be available to problem drinkers who can manage their drinking with the right treatment.<ref name="SHUTE1997">{{cite journal | last = Shute | first = Nancy | title = The drinking dilemma: by calling abstinence the only cure, we ensure that the nation's $100 billion alcohol problem won't be solved | journal = [[U.S. News & World Report]] | volume = 123 | issue = 9 | month = September | year = 1997 | pages = 54–64 |url=http://silkworth.net/magazine_newspaper/us_news_world_report_sep_8_1997.html}}</ref> The Big Book, however, acknowledges "moderate drinkers" and "a certain type of hard drinker" are able to stop or moderate their drinking. The Big Book suggests no program for these drinkers, but instead seeks to help drinkers without "power of choice in drink."<ref>''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page 20-1,24</ref>

===Cultural identity===
One review of AA warned of detrimental [[wiktionary:iatrogenic|iatrogenic]] effects of twelve-step philosophy and concluded that AA uses many methods that are also used by cults.<ref name="ALEXANDER1984">{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Francesa |first2 = Michele |last2 = Rollins | year = 1985 | title = Alcoholics Anonymous: the unseen cult | journal = California Sociologist | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–48 | issn = 0162-8712 | oclc = 4025459 | location = Los Angeles | publisher =[[California State University]] |url=http://www.silkworth.net/sociology/Soc63OCR.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyBcw4EM |archivedate=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>  A subsequent study concluded, however, that AA's program bore little resemblance to religious cults because the techniques used appeared beneficial.<ref name="WRIGHT1997">{{cite journal |title=Shared Ideology in Alcoholics Anonymous: A Grounded Theory Approach |doi=10.1080/108107397127806 |year=1997 |last1=Right |first1=Kevin B.

===Other criticisms===
<!-- "Thirteenth Stepping" redirects to this section -->
*"Thirteenth-stepping" is a pejorative term for AA members approaching new members for dates or sex. The ''Journal of Addiction Nursing'' reported that 50% of the women that participated in a survey (55 in all) experienced 13-stepping behavior from others.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGuiness|first=Kristen|title=The 13th Step: People Who Prey On Newcomers|date=15|year=2011|month=4|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/13th-step}}</ref><ref name="BOGART2003">{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Addictions Nursing: A Journal for the Prevention and Management of Addictions |title='13th-Stepping:' Why Alcoholics Anonymous Is Not Always a Safe Place for Women |last=Bogart |first=Cathy J. |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=43–47 |doi=10.1080/10884600305373 |issn=1548-7148 |oclc=34618968 |last2=Bogart |first2=Cathy J.}}</ref> AA's pamphlet on sponsorship  suggests that men be sponsored by men and women be sponsored by women.<ref>Questions and Answers on Sponsorship, page 10. 2005.</ref>

*In 1964, Arthur H. Cain – by his own count – had attended over 500 AA meetings since 1947.  Cain insisted that "I do not suggest for a moment that a single A.A. quit the fellowship. On the contrary, I strongly urge sticking with it. To anyone who is having trouble with alcohol I say: try A.A. first; it's the answer for most people". Even so Cain thought that AA had become the domain of irreligious misfits "Dogmatic and opinionated in their nonbeliefs", who scorned other societies such as [[Kiwanis|the Kiwanis Club]]. Cain said AA had come to rely heavily on dogmatic slogans and the group. Without referencing or fashioning a definition of the term, Cain called  AA a "cult" and "a hindrance to research, psychiatry, and to many alcoholics who need a different kind of help".<ref name="CAIN1963">[http://harpers.org/archive/1963/02/0014211 Harpers.org]</ref>
