'''Chrysler Group LLC''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|aɪ|s|l|ər}} is an American [[automobile manufacturer]] headquartered in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]], [[Michigan]]. It is a consolidated subsidiary of Italian [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[automobile manufacturer|automaker]] [[Fiat]].<ref>[http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1801/0001193125-13-097736.pdf Chrysler 8-K/A SEC filing December 3, 2012] "... served as the auditor for Fiat S.p.A. and its consolidated subsidiaries, which include Chrysler Group".

Retrieved March 29, 2013.</ref> Chrysler is one of the "[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]" American automobile manufacturers. It sells vehicles worldwide under its flagship [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] brand, as well as the [[Dodge]], [[Jeep]], and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] brands; it also manufactures vehicles sold under the [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] brand in North America. Other major divisions of Chrysler include [[Mopar]], its automotive parts and accessories division, and [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]], its performance automobile division. In 2011, Chrysler Group (not including Fiat) was the [[Automotive industry#By manufacturer|twelfth biggest]] automaker in the world by production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking.pdf|title=World motor vehicle production OICA correspondants survey without double counts world ranking of manufacturers year 2011}}</ref>

The Chrysler Corporation was founded by [[Walter Chrysler]] in 1925,<ref name="jbchrysler">{{cite web| url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/|title=Chrysler Reviews and History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref> out of what remained of the [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell Motor Company]]. Chrysler greatly expanded in 1928 when it acquired the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] truck company and the Dodge Brothers Company and began selling vehicles under those brands; that same year it also established the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] automobile brands. In the 1970s a number of factors including the [[1973 oil crisis]] impacted Chrysler's sales, and by the late 1970s, Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy. [[Lee Iacocca]] was brought in as CEO and is credited with returning the company to profitability in the 1980s. In 1987, Chrysler acquired [[American Motors|American Motors Corporation]], which brought the profitable Jeep brand under the Chrysler umbrella.

In 1998 Chrysler merged with German automaker [[Daimler-Benz|Daimler-Benz AG]] to form DaimlerChrysler; the merger proved contentious with investors and Chrysler was sold to [[Cerberus Capital Management]] and renamed Chrysler LLC in 2007. Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was hit hard by the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010]] and along with [[General Motors]] received billions of dollars in loans from the [[United States government]] in late 2008 and early 2009 to prevent both companies from shutting down. Chrysler filed for [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization]] on April 30, 2009. On June 10, 2009 Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the [[United Auto Workers]] pension fund, Fiat, and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. Over the next few years Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares to take majority ownership of the company.

{{Main|History of Chrysler}}

The company was founded by [[Walter Chrysler]] (1875–1940) on June 6, 1925,<ref>{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Mike |last2=Tell |first2=David |title=The Technology Century: 100 years of The Engineering Society 1895–1995 | publisher=Engineering Society of Detroit |year=1995 |page=53 |isbn=978-1-56378-022-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Lockwood |first=Cliff |url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html | title=Early Chrysler Corporate History: 1903–1928 |date=October 18, 1968 |publisher=Chrysler Club pages |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref> when the [[Maxwell automobile|Maxwell Motor Company]] (est. 1904) was re-organized into the Chrysler Corporation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chryslerclub.org/walterp.html |title=A Brief Look at Walter P. Chrysler |publisher=WPC News |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Malis |first=Carol |title=Michigan: celebrating a century of success |publisher=Cherbo Publishing Group |year=1999 |page=76 |isbn=978-1-882933-23-5}}</ref>

Walter Chrysler arrived at the ailing Maxwell-[[Chalmers Automobile|Chalmers]] company in the early 1920s. He was hired to overhaul the company's troubled operations (after a similar rescue job at the [[Willys]]-Overland car company).<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Kimes |editor-first=Beverly R. |editor2-last=Clark, Jr. | editor2-first=Henry A. |title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1805–1942 |year=1996 |publisher=Krause Publications |isbn=978-0-87341-428-9 |page=292}}</ref> In late 1923 production of the Chalmers automobile was ended.<ref>Kimes, p. 257.</ref>

In January 1924, Walter Chrysler launched the well-received Chrysler automobile. The Chrysler was a 6-cylinder automobile, designed to provide customers with an advanced, well-engineered car, but at a more affordable price than they might expect. (Elements of this car are traceable to a [[prototype]] which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler's tenure).<ref>Kimes, pp. 292, 1498.</ref> The original 1924 Chrysler included a carburetor air filter, high compression engine, full pressure lubrication, and an oil filter, features absent from most autos at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zatz |first=David |title=Chrysler Technological Innovations |url=http://www.allpar.com/corporate/technology.html |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Yost|first=Mark|title=A Nation of Drivers|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204573704577187152424740014.html |date=January 31, 2012 |page=D5 |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref> Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass-produced four-wheel hydraulic brakes, a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and rubber engine mounts to reduce vibration.
Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim, designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel. This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide.

Following the introduction of the Chrysler, the Maxwell brand was dropped after the 1925 model year. The new, lower-priced four-cylinder Chryslers introduced for the 1926 year were [[badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] Maxwells.<ref>Kimes, pp. 292–293, 901</ref> The advanced engineering and testing that went into Chrysler Corporation cars helped to push the company to the second-place position in U.S. sales by 1936, a position it would last hold in 1949.

In 1928, the Chrysler Corporation began dividing its vehicle offerings by price class and function. The [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] brand was introduced at the low-priced end of the market (created essentially by once again reworking and rebadging Chrysler's four-cylinder model).<ref>Kimes, pp. 296, 1156.</ref> At the same time, the [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] brand was introduced in the medium-price field. Also in 1928, Chrysler bought the Dodge Brothers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timelessrides.com/wiki/dodge |title=Dodge Car History, Car Data, Information, Pictures |publisher=Timeless Rides |accessdate=April 30, 2012}}</ref> automobile and truck company and continued the successful [[Dodge]] line of automobiles and Fargo range of trucks. By the mid-1930s, the DeSoto and Dodge divisions would trade places in the corporate hierarchy.

[[File:Chrysler Imperial car-1955.JPG|left|thumb|1955 Imperial car model shown on display at January 1955 Chicago Auto Show]]
The [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]] name had been used since 1926, but was never a separate make, just the top-of-the-line Chrysler. In 1955, the company decided to spin it off as its own make and division to better compete with its rivals, Lincoln and Cadillac.

[[File:Chryslyer imperial all transistor car radio audio sound news clip.ogg|thumb|1955 Chrysler - Philco all transistor car radio - "Breaking News" radio broadcast announcement.]]
On April 28, 1955, Chrysler and [[Philco]] had announced the development and production of the World’s First All-Transistor car radio.<ref>"Chrysler Promises Car Radio With Transistors Instead of Tubes in '56", ''The Wall Street Journal'', April 28, 1955, p. 1</ref> The all-transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR, was developed and produced by Chrysler and Philco, and was an $150.00 "option" on the 1956 Imperial car models. Philco was the company, who had manufactured the all-transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR, starting in the fall of 1955 at its Sandusky Ohio plant, for the Chrysler corporation.<ref>http://www.allpar.com/stereo/Philco/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/philco_mopar_914_hr_ch_c_5690hr.html</ref><ref>http://wpchryslermuseum.org/page.aspx?pid=436</ref> [[File:Transistor car radio Mopar model 914HR.JPG|thumb|All-Transistor car radio - Chrysler Mopar model 914HR]]

On September 28, 1957, Chrysler had announced the first production electronic fuel injection (EFI), as an option on some of its new 1958 car models (Chrysler 300D, Dodge D500, DeSoto Adventurer, Plymouth Golden Commando V-8). The first attempt to use this system was by [[American Motors]] on the 1957 [[Rambler Rebel]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Harry |title=How Good is Fuel Injection? |journal=Popular Science |month=March |year=1957 |volume=170|issue=3 |pages=88–93 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=byEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88&dq=1957+Rambler+fuel+injection |accessdate=June 24, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com">{{cite web| url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel2.htm |title=Rambler Measures Up |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |date=September 22, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Bendix Corporation]]'s Electrojector used a transistor computer brain modulator box, but teething problems on [[pre-production car]]s meant very few cars were made.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aird |first=Forbes |title=Bosch fuel injection systems |publisher=HP Trade|year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-1-55788-365-0 }}</ref> The EFI system in the Rambler ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures and AMC decided not to use this EFI system, on its 1957 Rambler Rebel production cars that were sold to the public.<ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com"/> Chrysler also used the Bendix "Electrojector" fuel injection system and only around 35 vehicles were built with this option, on its 1958 production built car models.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=September 29, 1957 |page=A9 |title=New Chrysler Fuel System Is Introduced }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/desoto/electrojector.html |publisher=Allpar.com |title=1958 DeSoto Electrojector - World’s First Electronic Fuel Injection? |accessdate=24 June 2013 }}</ref>

Imperial would see new body styles introduced every two to three years, all with V8 engines and automatic transmissions, as well as technologies that would filter down to Chrysler corporation's other models. Imperial was folded back into the Chrysler brand in 1973.

The [[Valiant (automobile)|Valiant]] was also introduced for 1960 as a distinct brand. In the U.S. market, Valiant was made a model in the Plymouth line for 1961 and the DeSoto make was discontinued during 1961. With those exceptions per applicable year and market, Chrysler's range from lowest to highest price from the 1940s through the 1970s was Valiant, Plymouth, Dodge, DeSoto, Chrysler, and Imperial.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chrysler Brands, Subsidiaries, and Related Companies |publisher=Allpar |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/auto |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

Chrysler acquired the [[Jeep]] brand as part of the purchase of [[American Motors]] (AMC) on August 5, 1987, for somewhere between US$1.7 billion and $2 billion, depending on how costs were counted.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dR3wmKlfnrMC&pg=PA117&dq=Chrysler+purchase+of+AMC+billion |page=117 |title=Jeep Color History |first=Steve |last=Statham |publisher=MBI Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7603-0636-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> Chrysler then established the [[Jeep-Eagle|Jeep/Eagle]] division, along with the [[Eagle (automobile)|Eagle]] brand that was discontinued a decade later as part of the DaimlerChrysler merger at that time. In 2001, the Plymouth brand was also discontinued. Currently, Dodge is the full line automobile brand, with the Chrysler brand marketing upscale cars. The Jeep brand focuses on SUVs, while the Ram brand offers small commercial vans and a variety of pick-up trucks. Earlier in October, 2012, inaccurate reports had suggested that Chrysler's [[Jeep]] brand is considering moving "all production to [[China]]." However, the company rejected the reports and the group's Chief Executive [[Sergio Marchionne]] reaffirmed that the company is not moving Jeep vehicle production out of the [[United States]] to [[China]] after it became an issue in the U.S. presidential campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/us-chrysler-jeep-idUSBRE89T15X20121030|title=Chrysler repeats not moving Jeep work to China from U.S.|work= Reuters|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

In 1998, Chrysler and its subsidiaries entered into a partnership dubbed a "merger of equals" with German-based [[Daimler-Benz]] AG, creating the combined entity [[DaimlerChrysler AG]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/chrysler/history/|title=Chrysler History|publisher=JB car pages|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref> To the surprise of many stockholders, Daimler subsequently acquired Chrysler in a stock swap,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/business/company-news-daimler-benz-and-chrysler-revise-ratio-for-stock-swap.html|title=Company News; Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Revise Ratio for Stock Swap|date=June 9, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref> after the retirement of Chrysler CEO Bob Eaton. Under DaimlerChrysler, the company was named DaimlerChrysler Motors Company LLC, with its U.S. operations generally called the "Chrysler Group". On May 14, 2007, DaimlerChrysler announced the sale of 80.1% of Chrysler Group to American [[private equity]] firm [[Cerberus Capital Management]], L.P., thereafter known as Chrysler LLC, although Daimler (renamed as [[Daimler AG]]) continued to hold a 19.9% stake.<ref name="dcx_20070514">"{{cite web|url=http://www.daimlerchrysler.com/dccom/0-5-7145-1-858191-1-0-0-0-0-0-11979-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html|title=Cerberus Takes Majority Interest in Chrysler Group and Related Financial Services Business for EUR 5.5 Billion ($7.4 billion)|publisher=DaimlerChrysler}}{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> The deal was finalized on August 3, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/arts/ci_6534916|title=Cerberus gains control of Chrysler|publisher=San Jose Mercury News}}{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> On April 27, 2009, Daimler AG signed a binding agreement to give up its remaining 19.9% stake in Chrysler LLC to Cerberus Capital Management and pay as much as $600 million into the automaker's pension fund.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090427-717397.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501131800/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090427-717397.html|archivedate=2009-05-01 |title=Daimler Reaches Agreement On Separation From Chrysler |date=April 27, 2009 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> Three days later, Chrysler declared bankruptcy.

The sale of substantially all of Chrysler's assets to "New Chrysler", organized as Chrysler Group LLC was completed on June 10, 2009. The federal government provided support for the deal with US$6.6 billion in financing, which was paid to "Old Chrysler", and a newly formed company called Old Carco LLC took over the remaining assets and liabilities, which remained in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aBhumEPf5wbM |last=Ramsey |first=Mike |last2=Kary |first2=Tiffany |title=Chrysler Assets Said to Have Little Net Proceeds for Creditors |publisher=Bloomberg |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> This transfer excluded eight manufacturing sites, the majority of real estate holdings, and equipment leases.

It is reported that Chrysler was heavy on fleet sales in 2010, hitting as high as 56 percent of total sales in February of that year. For the whole year, 38 percent of sales of Chrysler were to fleet customers. The industry average was 19 percent. However, the company hopes to reduce its fleet sales to the industry average in 2011 with a renewed product lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url= |title=Chrysler to Bring Fleet Sales in-line with Industry Average|date=February 15, 2011 |first=Drew |last=Johnson |publisher=Left Lane News}}</ref>

==== "Let's Refuel America" ====

In 2008, as a response to customer feedback citing the prospect of rising gas prices as a top concern, Chrysler launched the "Let's Refuel America" incentive campaign, which guaranteed new-car buyers a gasoline price of $2.99 for three years.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=B9842A079EFC9B4FA925B1D294CCDDD6?&id=7858&mid=10 |title=Chrysler LLC Delivers Economic Stimulus; Protects Consumers from Rising Gas Prices for Three Years |publisher=Chrysler.com |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref> With the U.S. purchase of eligible Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge vehicles, customers could enroll in the program and receive a gas card that immediately lowers their gas price to $2.99 a gallon, and keeps it there for the three years.

==== Lancia co-branding ====

Chrysler plans for [[Lancia]] to codevelop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia's CEO, was appointed to the [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] division in October 2009.

==== "Imported From Detroit" ====

In 2011, Chrysler unveiled their new "Imported From Detroit" campaign with ads featuring Detroit rapper [[Eminem]], one of which aired during the Super Bowl. The campaign highlights the rejuvenation of the entire product lineup, which includes the new, redesigned and repackaged 2011 200 sedan and 200 convertible, the Chrysler 300 sedan and the Chrysler Town & Country minivan.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gutierrez |first=Dianna |url=http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=FF89CD493D55543EC338709865812824?&id=10512&mid=23 |title=Chrysler Brand Launches New Marketing and Advertising Campaign |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp; Chris Shunk RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/03/08/detroit-city-council-honors-chryslers-super-bowl-commercial-w/ |title=Detroit City Council honors Chrysler's Super Bowl commercial |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref> As part of the campaign, Chrysler sold a line of clothing items featuring the [[Monument to Joe Louis]], with proceeds being funneled to Detroit-area charities, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeast Michigan, Habitat for Humanity Detroit and the Marshall Mathers Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp; Aaron Richardson RSS feed |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/03/14/report-chrysler-updates-imported-from-detroit-logo/ |title=Report: Chrysler updates 'Imported From Detroit' logo |publisher=Autoblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref> Following the Eminem ad, there was also an ad for Detroit Lions defensive tackle [[Ndamukong Suh]] driving a Chrysler 300 to Portland, Or., to visit his mother, an ad featuring Detroit-born fashion designer [[John Varvatos]] cruising through a shadowy Gotham while Kevin Yon's familiar baritone traces the designer's genesis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schultz |first=Jonathan |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/chrysler-exports-imported-from-detroit-to-new-york/ |title=Chrysler Exports ‘Imported From Detroit’ to New York |location=Detroit (Mich);Manhattan (NYC) |publisher=Wheels.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2011-05-12 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref>

In March 2011, Chrysler Group LLC filed a lawsuit against Moda Group LLC (owner of Pure Detroit clothing retailer) for copying and selling merchandise with the "Imported from Detroit" slogan.<ref>Halcom, Chad (March 16, 2011).

''Crain's Detroit Business''. Retrieved July 18, 2012.</ref> Chrysler claimed it had notified defendant of its pending trademark application February 14, but the defendant argued Chrysler had not secured a trademark for the "Imported From Detroit" phrase. On June 18, 2011, U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow ruled that Chrysler's request didn't show that it would suffer irreparable harm or that it had a strong likelihood of winning its case. Therefore Pure Detroit's owner, Detroit retailer Moda Group LLC, can continue selling its "Imported from Detroit" products. Tarnow also noted that Chrysler doesn't have a trademark on "Imported from Detroit" and rejected the automaker's argument that trademark law isn't applicable to the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20110629/CARNEWS/110629852/0/videonewsarchive |title=Chrysler loses 'Imported from Detroit' lawsuit |publisher=Autoweek.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Zach|last=Bowman|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2011/06/29/chrysler-legal-bid-to-halt-imported-from-detroit-merchandise-s/ |title=Chrysler legal bid to halt 'Imported From Detroit' merchandise sales falls short |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref> In March 2012, Chrysler Group LLC and Pure Detroit agreed to a March 27 mediation to try to settle the lawsuit over the clothing company's use of "Imported from Detroit" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120319/AUTO0101/203190378/1148/auto01/Chrysler-Pure-Detroit-agree-mediation-settle-Imported-from-Detroit-suit |title=Chrysler, Pure Detroit agree to mediation to settle 'Imported from Detroit' suit |work=The Detroit News|date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> Pure Detroit stated that Chrysler has made false claims about the origins of three vehicles - Chrysler 200, Chrysler 300 and Chrysler Town & Country - none of which are built in Detroit.

==== "Half Time in America" ====

Again in 2012, Chrysler advertised during the [[Super Bowl]]. Its two-minute February 5, 2012 [[Super Bowl XLVI]] advertisement was titled "Half Time in America". The ad drew criticism from several leading U.S. [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who suggested that its messaging implied that President Obama deserved a second term and, as such, was political payback for Obama's support for the federal bailout of the company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-06/politics/politics_eastwood-ad-politics_1_chrysler-ad-halftime-show-america-auto-industry?_s=PM:POLITICS |first=Bryan |last=Monroe |publisher=CNN|title=Were politics buried inside Eastwood's 'Halftime' commercial? |date=February 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Asked about the criticism in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview with [[Steve Kroft]], Sergio Marchionne responded "just to rectify the record I paid back the loans at 19.7% Interest.

== Environmental initiatives ==

=== Electric vehicles ===

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=May 2012}}
The first [[Battery electric vehicle|electric]] vehicle produced by Chrysler was the 1992 [[Dodge EPIC]] concept minivan. In 1993, Chrysler began to sell a limited-production electric minivan called the [[Chrysler TEVan|TEVan]]; however, this minivan did not gain much popularity throughout its lifetime. In 1997, a second generation, called the EPIC, was released. It was discontinued after 1999.

Chrysler intended to pursue new drive concepts through [[Envi (Automobile)|ENVI]], an in-house organization formed to focus on [[electric vehicle|electric-drive vehicles]] and related technologies which was established in September 2007. In August 2009, Chrysler took [[US$]]70 million in grants from the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] to develop a test fleet of 220 [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] pickup trucks and minivans. ENVI was disbanded by November 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/07/us-chrysler-ev-idUSTRE5A605N20091107?sp=true |title=Chrysler dismantles electric car plans under Fiat |date=November 6, 2009 |author=Kevin Krolicki |publisher=Reuters}}</ref>

=== Hybrid vehicles ===

The first hybrids of Chrysler, [[Chrysler Aspen]] hybrid and [[Dodge Durango]] hybrid, were discontinued a few months after production in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insideline.com/chrysler/aspen/2009/chrysler-kills-durango-and-aspen-hybrids.html |title=Edmunds Insideline: Chrysler Kills Durango and Aspen Hybrids |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>

Chrysler continues to develop the [[Dodge Ram|Ram]] hybrid.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Chrysler has also been experimenting with a [[Diesel-electric transmission|Hybrid Diesel truck]] for military applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, Chrysler/Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne has said that Chrysler and Fiat both plan to focus primarily on alternative fuels, such as [[CNG]] and [[diesel fuel|diesel]], instead of hybrid and electric drivetrains for their consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wardsauto.com/vehicles-amp-technology/chrysler-eyes-different-path-meeting-new-cafe-standards |title=Wards Auto: Chrysler Eyes Different Path to Meeting New CAFE Standards |publisher=wardsauto.com |date=2012-08-29 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}</ref>

== Special programs ==

During World War II, essentially all of Chrysler's facilities were devoted to building military vehicles (the [[Jeep]] brand came later, after Chrysler acquired [[American Motors Corporation]]).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_djEK2wqmAIC&pg=PA192&dq=Multi-auto+Tank+Engine+Designed+and+Developed+by+Central+Engineering |page=192 |title=The Birth of Chrysler Corporation and Its Engineering Legacy |first=Carl |last=Breer |first2=Anthony J. |last2=Yanik |year=1992 |publisher= SAE International |isbn=978-1-56091-524-9 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> They were also designing V12 and V16 hemi-engines producing {{convert|2500|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} for airplanes, but they did not make it into production as [[jet engine|jets]] were developed and were seen as the future for air travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/mopar/hemi/chrysler-hemi.html |title=The Original Chrysler Hemi Engine |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

=== Radar antennas ===

When the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] was established in 1941 to develop [[microwave]] [[radars]], one of the first projects resulted in the [[SCR-584]], the most widely recognized radar system of the war era. This system included a [[parabolic antenna]] six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern (round and round as well as up and down).

One of Chrysler’s most significant contributions to the war effort was not in the field of vehicles but in the radar field. For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism, the Army’s [[Signal Corps Laboratories]] turned to Chrysler's Central Engineering Office. There, the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel, allowing production forming using standard automotive presses. To keep weight down, 6,000 equally spaced holes were drilled in the face (this had no effect on the radiation pattern). The drive mechanism was completely redesigned, using technology derived from Chrysler’s research in automotive gears and differentials. The changes resulted in improved performance, reduced weight, and easier maintenance. A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building 1,500 of the SCR-584 antennas as well as the vans used in the systems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stout |last=Wesley W. |title=The Great Detective |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Colton |first=Roger B. |title=Radar in the United States Army |publisher=Proceedings of the I.R.E. |volume=33 |pages=740–753 |year=1947 |url=http://cecom.army.mil/historian/docdisp.php?fname=RadarintheUSArmy_byRogerColton.pdf&dirname=Radar |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

=== Missiles ===

In April 1950, the U.S. Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC) at [[Redstone Arsenal]], adjacent to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. To form OGMC, over 1,000 civilian and military personnel were transferred from [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]. Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]]; this group had been brought to America under [[Project Paperclip]]. OGMC designed the Army's first [[short-range ballistic missile]], the [[PGM-11 Redstone]], based on the WWII German [[V-2]] missile. Chrysler established the Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor, setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U.S. Navy of a large plant in [[Warren, Michigan]]. The Redstone was in active service from 1958 to 1964; it was also the first missile to test-launch a live [[nuclear weapon]], first detonated in a 1958 test in the South Pacific.<ref>Bullard, John W.; “History Of The Redstone Missile System,” Historical Monograph Project Number: AMC 23 M. Historical Division, Army Missile Command</ref>

Working together, the Missile Division and von Braun's team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone, resulting in the [[PGM-19 Jupiter]], a [[medium-range ballistic missile]]. In May 1959, a Jupiter missile launched two small monkeys into space in a [[nose cone]]; this was America's first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads. Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force; armed with [[nuclear warheads]], they were first deployed in [[Italy]] and [[Turkey]] during the early 1960s.<ref>Fact Sheet: Chrysler SM-78/PGM-19 Jupiter, National Museum of the U.S. Air Force; http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=534</ref>

=== Space boosters ===

In July 1959, [[NASA]] chose the Redstone missile as the basis for the [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]] to be used for suborbital test flights of the [[Project Mercury]] spacecraft. Three unmanned MLRV launch attempts were made between November 1960 and March 1961, two of which were successful. The MLRV successfully launched the chimpanzee [[Ham the Chimp|Ham]], and astronauts [[Alan Shepard]] and [[Gus Grissom]] on three suborbital flights in January, May and July 1961.

America's more ambitious manned space travel plans included the design of the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn series]] of heavy-lift launch vehicles by a team headed by [[Wernher von Braun]]. Chrysler's Huntsville operation, then designated the Space Division, became [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]’s prime contractor for the first stage of the [[Saturn I]] and [[Saturn IB]] versions. The design was based on a cluster of Redstone and Jupiter fuel tanks, and Chrysler built it for the [[Apollo program]] in the [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in East New Orleans, one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world. Between October 1961 and July 1975, NASA used ten Saturn Is and nine Saturn IBs for suborbital and orbital flights, all of which were successful;<ref>Bilstein, Roger E.; [http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm ''Stages to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch Vehicles'']. NASA SP-4206, 1980, ISBN 0-16-048909-1.{{Page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> Chrysler missiles and boosters never suffered a launch failure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The division was also a subcontractor which modified one of the [[Mobile Launcher Platform]]s for use with the Saturn IB rockets using Saturn V infrastructure.
