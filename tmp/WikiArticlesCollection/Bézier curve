A '''Bézier curve''' is a [[parametric curve]] frequently used in [[computer graphics]] and related fields.  Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher [[dimension]]s are called [[Bézier surface]]s, of which the [[Bézier triangle]] is a special case.

In [[vector graphics]], Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. "Paths," as they are commonly referred to in image manipulation programs,<ref group="note">Image manipulation programs such as [[Inkscape]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[GIMP]].</ref> are combinations of linked Bézier curves. Paths are not bound by the limits of [[rasterized image]]s and are intuitive to modify. Bézier curves are also used in [[animation]] as a tool to control motion.<ref group="note">In animation applications such as [[Adobe Flash]], [[Adobe After Effects]], [[Microsoft Expression Blend]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Autodesk Maya]] and [[Autodesk 3ds max]].</ref>

Bézier curves are also used in the time domain, particularly in animation and interface design, e.g., a Bézier curve can be used to specify the velocity over time of an object such as an icon moving from A to B, rather than simply moving at a fixed number of pixels per step. When animators or [[Graphical user interface|interface]] designers talk about the "physics" or "feel" of an operation, they may be referring to the particular Bézier curve used to control the velocity over time of the move in question.

The mathematical basis for Bézier curves — the [[Bernstein polynomial]] — has been known since 1912, but its applicability to graphics was understood half a century later.
Bézier curves were widely publicized in 1962 by the [[France|French]] engineer [[Pierre Bézier]], who used them to design [[automobile]] bodies at [[Renault]].  The study of these curves was however first developed in 1959 by mathematician [[Paul de Casteljau]] using [[de Casteljau's algorithm]], a [[numerical stability|numerically stable]] method to evaluate Bézier curves, at [[Citroën]], another French automaker.

==Applications==

===Computer graphics===
[[Image:Bézier curve in Adobe Illustrator CS2.png|left|thumb|Bézier path in [[Adobe Illustrator]]]]
Bézier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. As the curve is completely contained in the [[convex hull]] of its [[Control point (mathematics)|control points]], the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. [[Affine transformation]]s such as [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.

Quadratic and cubic Bézier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more [[computationally expensive]] to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order Bézier curves are patched together, producing a [[Bézier spline]]. A Bézier spline is commonly referred to as a "path" in [[vector graphics]] standards (like [[SVG]]) and vector graphics programs (like [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDraw]] and [[Inkscape]]). To guarantee smoothness, the control point at which two curves meet must be on the line between the two control points on either side.

The simplest method for scan converting ([[Rasterisation|rasterizing]]) a Bézier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a line segment to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 0.5 and 0.5 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation.
Analytical methods where a [[Spline (mathematics)|spline]] is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic splines) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.

===Animation===
In animation applications, such as [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Synfig]], Bézier curves are used to outline, for example, movement. Users outline the wanted path in Bézier curves, and the application creates the needed frames for the object to move along the path.
For 3D animation Bézier curves are often used to define 3D paths as well as 2D curves for keyframe interpolation.

===Fonts===
[[TrueType]] fonts use [[Bézier spline]]s composed of '''quadratic''' Bézier curves. Modern imaging systems like [[PostScript]], [[Asymptote (vector graphics language)|Asymptote]], [[Metafont]], and [[SVG]] use [[Bézier spline]]s composed of '''cubic''' Bézier curves for drawing curved shapes. [[OpenType]] fonts can use either kind, depending on the flavor of the font.

The internal rendering of all Bézier curves in font or vector graphics renderers will split them recursively up to the point where the curve is flat enough to be drawn as a series of linear or circular segments. The exact splitting algorithm is implementation dependent, only the flatness criteria must be respected to reach the necessary precision and to avoid non-monotonic local changes of curvature. The "smooth curve" feature of charts in [[Microsoft Excel]] also uses this algorithm.<ref>http://www.xlrotor.com/resources/files.shtml</ref>

Because arcs of circles and ellipses cannot be exactly represented by Bézier curves, they are first approximated by Bézier curves, which are in turn approximated by arcs of circles. This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all Bézier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all Bézier and conic curves (or surfaces) into [[Non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.

Font engines, like [[FreeType]], draw the font's curves (and lines) on a pixellated surface, in a process called [[Font rasterization]].<ref name=freetype>[http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-6.html FreeType Glyph Conventions], David Turner + Freetype Development Team, Freetype.org, retr May 2011</ref>

==Examination of cases==
A Bézier curve is defined by a set of ''control points'' '''P'''<sub>0</sub> through '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>, where ''n'' is called its order (''n'' = 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, etc.). The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve.

===Linear Bézier curves===
Given points '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, a linear Bézier curve is simply a [[straight line]] between those two points. The curve is given by

:<math>\mathbf{B}(t)=\mathbf{P}_0 + t(\mathbf{P}_1-\mathbf{P}_0)=(1-t)\mathbf{P}_0 + t\mathbf{P}_1 \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1]</math>
and is equivalent to [[linear interpolation]].

===Quadratic Bézier curves===
A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function '''B'''(''t''), given points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, and '''P'''<sub>2</sub>,

: <math>\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)[(1 - t) \mathbf P_0 + t \mathbf P_1] + t [(1 - t) \mathbf P_1 + t \mathbf P_2] \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1]</math>,

which can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points on the linear Bézier curves from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and from '''P'''<sub>1</sub> to '''P'''<sub>2</sub> respectively. Rearranging the preceding equation yields:

: <math>\mathbf{B}(t) = (1 - t)^{2}\mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)t\mathbf{P}_1 + t^{2}\mathbf{P}_2 \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1].</math>

The derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to ''t'' is

: <math>\mathbf{B}'(t) = 2 (1 - t) (\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_0) + 2 t (\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \,.</math>

from which it can be concluded that the tangents to the curve at '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>2</sub> intersect at '''P'''<sub>1</sub>. As ''t'' increases from 0 to 1, the curve departs from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> in the direction of '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, then bends to arrive at '''P'''<sub>2</sub> from the direction of '''P'''<sub>1</sub>.

The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to ''t'' is

: <math>\mathbf{B}''(t) = 2(\mathbf{P}_2 - 2 \mathbf{P}_1 + \mathbf{P}_0) \,.</math>

A quadratic Bézier curve is also a [[parabola|parabolic]] segment. As a parabola is a [[conic section]], some sources refer to quadratic Béziers as "conic arcs".<ref name=freetype/>

===Cubic Bézier curves===
Four points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>, '''P'''<sub>2</sub> and '''P'''<sub>3</sub> in the plane or in higher-dimensional space define a cubic Bézier curve.
The curve starts at '''P'''<sub>0</sub> going toward '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and arrives at '''P'''<sub>3</sub> coming from the direction of '''P'''<sub>2</sub>. Usually, it will not pass through '''P'''<sub>1</sub> or '''P'''<sub>2</sub>; these points are only there to provide directional information. The distance between '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and '''P'''<sub>1</sub> determines "how long" the curve moves into direction '''P'''<sub>2</sub> before turning towards '''P'''<sub>3</sub>.

Writing '''B'''<sub>'''P'''<sub>i</sub>,'''P'''<sub>j</sub>,'''P'''<sub>k</sub></sub>(''t'') for the quadratic Bézier curve defined by points '''P'''<sub>i</sub>, '''P'''<sub>j</sub>, and '''P'''<sub>k</sub>, the cubic Bézier curve can be defined as a linear combination of two quadratic Bézier curves:

:<math>\mathbf{B}(t)=(1-t)\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf P_0,\mathbf P_1,\mathbf P_2}(t) + t \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf P_1,\mathbf P_2,\mathbf P_3}(t) \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1].</math>

The explicit form of the curve is:

:<math>\mathbf{B}(t)=(1-t)^3\mathbf{P}_0+3(1-t)^2t\mathbf{P}_1+3(1-t)t^2\mathbf{P}_2+t^3\mathbf{P}_3 \mbox{ , } t \in [0,1].</math>

For some choices of '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and '''P'''<sub>2</sub> the curve may intersect itself, or contain a cusp.

Any series of any 4 distinct points can be converted to a cubic Bézier curve that goes through all 4 points in order.
Given the starting and ending point of some cubic Bézier curve, and any two other distinct points in sequence along that curve, the control points for the original Bézier curve can be recovered.<ref>

[http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/html/bezier_interpolation.html "Forcing Bezier Interpolation"].
</ref>

The derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to ''t'' is
: <math>\mathbf{B}'(t) = 3(1-t)^2(\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_0) + 6(1-t)t(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) + 3t^2(\mathbf{P}_3 - \mathbf{P}_2) \,.</math>


The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to ''t'' is
: <math>\mathbf{B}''(t) = 6(1-t)(\mathbf{P}_2 - 2 \mathbf{P}_1 + \mathbf{P}_0) +  6t(\mathbf{P}_3 - 2 \mathbf{P}_2 + \mathbf{P}_1) \,.</math>

==Generalization==
Bézier curves can be defined for any degree ''n.''

===Recursive definition===
A recursive definition for the Bézier curve of degree ''n'' expresses it as a point-to-point [[linear combination]] ([[linear interpolation]]) of a pair of corresponding points in two Bézier curves of degree ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.

Let <math>\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\ldots\mathbf{P}_n}</math> denote the Bézier curve determined by any selection of points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, '''P'''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;'''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>.  Then to start,

:<math>\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0}(t) = \mathbf{P}_0 \text{, and}</math>

:<math>\mathbf{B}(t) = \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\ldots\mathbf{P}_n}(t) = (1-t)\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\ldots\mathbf{P}_{n-1}}(t) + t\mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_1\mathbf{P}_2\ldots\mathbf{P}_n}(t)</math>

This recursion is elucidated in the animations below.

===Explicit definition===
The formula can be expressed explicitly as follows:

:<math>\begin{align}
  \mathbf{B}(t) = {} &\sum_{i=0}^n {n\choose i}(1 - t)^{n - i}t^i\mathbf{P}_i \\
                = {} &(1 - t)^n\mathbf{P}_0 + {n\choose 1}(1 - t)^{n - 1}t\mathbf{P}_1 + \cdots \\
                  {} &\cdots + {n\choose n - 1}(1 - t)t^{n - 1}\mathbf{P}_{n - 1} + t^n\mathbf{P}_n,\quad t \in [0,1]
\end{align}</math>

where <math>\scriptstyle {n \choose i}</math> are the [[binomial coefficient]]s.

For example, for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5:

:<math>\begin{align}
  \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{P}_0\mathbf{P}_1\mathbf{P}_2\mathbf{P}_3\mathbf{P}_4\mathbf{P}_5}(t) = \mathbf{B}(t)
    = {} & (1 - t)^5\mathbf{P}_0 + 5t(1 - t)^4\mathbf{P}_1 + 10t^2(1 - t)^3 \mathbf{P}_2 \\
    {} & + 10t^3 (1-t)^2 \mathbf{P}_3 + 5t^4(1-t) \mathbf{P}_4 + t^5 \mathbf{P}_5,\quad t \in [0,1]
\end{align}</math>

===Terminology===
Some terminology is associated with these parametric curves. We have

:<math>\mathbf{B}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^n \mathbf{b}_{i, n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i,\quad t \in [0, 1]</math>

where the polynomials

:<math>\mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t) = {n\choose i} t^i (1 - t)^{n - i},\quad i = 0, \ldots, n</math>

are known as [[Bernstein polynomial|Bernstein basis polynomials]] of degree ''n''.

Note that ''t''<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, (1&nbsp;−&nbsp;''t'')<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and that the [[binomial coefficient]], <math>\scriptstyle {n \choose i}</math>, also expressed as <math>^n{\mathbf{C}}_i </math> or <math>{\mathbf{C}_i}^n </math> is:

:<math>{n \choose i} = \frac{n!}{i!(n - i)!}</math>

The points '''P'''<sub>''i''</sub> are called ''control points'' for the Bézier curve. The [[polygon]] formed by connecting the Bézier points with [[line (mathematics)|lines]], starting with '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and finishing with '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>, is called the ''Bézier polygon'' (or ''control polygon''). The [[convex hull]] of the Bézier polygon contains the Bézier curve.

===Properties===
* The curve begins at '''P'''<sub>0</sub> and ends at '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub>; this is the so-called ''endpoint interpolation'' property.
* The curve is a straight line if and only if all the control points are [[Incidence (geometry)#Collinearity|collinear]].
* The start (end) of the curve is [[tangent]] to the first (last) section of the Bézier polygon.
* A curve can be split at any point into two subcurves, or into arbitrarily many subcurves, each of which is also a Bézier curve.
* Some curves that seem simple, such as the [[circle]], cannot be described exactly by a Bézier or [[piecewise]] Bézier curve; though a four-piece cubic Bézier curve can approximate a circle (see [[Bézier spline]]), with a maximum radial error of less than one part in a thousand, when each inner control point (or offline point) is the distance <math>\textstyle\frac{4\left(\sqrt {2}-1\right)}{3}</math> horizontally or vertically from an outer control point on a unit circle.  More generally, an ''n''-piece cubic Bézier curve can approximate a circle, when each inner control point is the distance <math>\textstyle\frac{4}{3}\tan(t/4)</math> from an outer control point on a unit circle, where ''t'' is 360/''n'' degrees, and ''n'' > 2.
* The curve at a fixed offset from a given Bézier curve, often called an ''offset curve'' (lying "parallel" to the original curve, like the offset between rails in a [[railroad track]]), cannot be exactly formed by a Bézier curve (except in some trivial cases). However, there are [[heuristic]] methods that usually give an adequate approximation for practical purposes. (For example: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.1724])
* Every quadratic Bézier curve is also a cubic Bézier curve, and more generally, every degree ''n'' Bézier curve is also a degree ''m'' curve for any ''m'' > ''n''. In detail, a degree ''n'' curve with control points '''P'''<sub>0</sub>, …, '''P'''<sub>''n''</sub> is equivalent (including the parametrization) to the degree ''n'' + 1 curve with control points '''P''''<sub>0</sub>, …, '''P''''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>, where <math>\mathbf P'_k=\tfrac{k}{n+1}\mathbf P_{k-1}+\left(1-\tfrac{k}{n+1}\right)\mathbf P_k</math>.

===Derivative===

The generalised derivative for a curve of order ''n'' is

:<math>\mathbf{B}'(t) = n \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\mathbf{P}_{i+1} - \mathbf{P}_i) \cdot \mathbf{b}_{i,n-1}(t)</math>

==Constructing Bézier curves==

===Linear curves===

|-
|Animation of a linear Bézier curve, ''t'' in [0,1]
|}

The ''t'' in the function for a linear Bézier curve can be thought of as describing how far '''B'''(''t'') is from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub>. For example when ''t=0.25'', '''B'''(''t'') is one quarter of the way from point '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub>. As ''t'' varies from 0 to 1, '''B'''(''t'') describes a straight line from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub>.

===Quadratic curves===
For quadratic Bézier curves one can construct intermediate points '''Q'''<sub>0</sub> and '''Q'''<sub>1</sub> such that as ''t'' varies from 0 to 1:
* Point '''Q'''<sub>0</sub> varies from '''P'''<sub>0</sub> to '''P'''<sub>1</sub> and describes a linear Bézier curve.
* Point '''Q'''<sub>1</sub> varies from '''P'''<sub>1</sub> to '''P'''<sub>2</sub> and describes a linear Bézier curve.
* Point '''B'''(''t'') varies from '''Q'''<sub>0</sub> to '''Q'''<sub>1</sub> and describes a quadratic Bézier curve.

===Higher-order curves===
For higher-order curves one needs correspondingly more intermediate points. For cubic curves one can construct intermediate points '''Q'''<sub>0</sub>,  '''Q'''<sub>1</sub>, and '''Q'''<sub>2</sub> that describe linear Bézier curves, and points '''R'''<sub>0</sub> & '''R'''<sub>1</sub> that describe quadratic Bézier curves:

For fourth-order curves one can construct intermediate points '''Q'''<sub>0</sub>,  '''Q'''<sub>1</sub>, '''Q'''<sub>2</sub> & '''Q'''<sub>3</sub> that describe linear Bézier curves, points '''R'''<sub>0</sub>, '''R'''<sub>1</sub> & '''R'''<sub>2</sub> that describe quadratic Bézier curves, and points '''S'''<sub>0</sub> & '''S'''<sub>1</sub> that describe cubic Bézier curves:

These representations rest on the process used in [[De Casteljau's algorithm]] to calculate Bézier curves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shene|first=C.K.|title=Finding a Point on a Bézier Curve: De Casteljau's Algorithm|url=http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/spline/Bezier/de-casteljau.html|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref>

==Degree elevation==
A Bézier curve of degree ''n'' can be converted into a Bézier curve of degree ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 ''with the same shape''. This is useful if software supports Bézier curves only of specific degree. For example, you can draw a quadratic Bézier curve with [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]], which supports only cubic Bézier curves.

To do degree elevation, we use the equality <math>\mathbf{B}(t) = (1-t)\mathbf{B}(t) + t\mathbf{B}(t)</math>. Each component <math>\mathbf{b}_{i,n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i</math> is multiplied by (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''t'') or&nbsp;''t'', thus increasing a degree by one. Here is the example of increasing degree from 2 to&nbsp;3.

: <math>
\begin{align}
       &(1 - t)^2 \mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)t\mathbf{P}_1 + t^2 \mathbf{P}_2 \\
  = {} &(1 - t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0 + (1 - t)^{2}t\mathbf{P}_0 + 2(1 - t)^2 t\mathbf{P}_1 \\
       &+ 2(1 - t)t^2 \mathbf{P}_1 + (1 - t)t^2 \mathbf{P}_2 + t^3 \mathbf{P}_2 \\
  = {} &(1 - t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0
        + (1 - t)^2 t   \left( \mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{P}_1\right)
        + (1 - t)   t^2 \left(2\mathbf{P}_1 +  \mathbf{P}_2\right)
        + t^{3}\mathbf{P}_2 \\
  = {} &(1 - t)^3 \mathbf{P}_0
        + 3(1 - t)^2 t   \left( \frac{\mathbf{P}_0 + 2\mathbf{P}_1}{3} \right)
        + 3(1 - t)   t^2 \left( \frac{2\mathbf{P}_1 + \mathbf{P}_2}{3} \right)
        + t^{3}\mathbf{P}_2
\end{align}
</math>

For arbitrary ''n'' we use equalities

:<math>\begin{align}
  {n + 1 \choose i}(1 - t)\mathbf{b}_{i, n} &= {n \choose i} \mathbf{b}_{i, n + 1} \Rightarrow (1 - t)\mathbf{b}_{i, n} = \frac{n + 1 - i}{n + 1} \mathbf{b}_{i, n + 1} \\
   {n + 1 \choose i + 1} t\mathbf{b}_{i, n} &= {n \choose i} \mathbf{b}_{i + 1, n + 1} \Rightarrow t\mathbf{b}_{i, n} = \frac{i + 1}{n + 1} \mathbf{b}_{i + 1, n + 1} \\

  \mathbf{B}(t) &= (1 - t)\sum_{i=0}^n \mathbf{b}_{i, n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i
                   + t\sum_{i=0}^n \mathbf{b}_{i, n}(t)\mathbf{P}_i \\
                &= \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{n + 1 - i}{n + 1}\mathbf{b}_{i, n + 1}(t)\mathbf{P}_i
                   + \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{i + 1}{n + 1}\mathbf{b}_{i + 1, n + 1}(t)\mathbf{P}_i \\
                &= \sum_{i=0}^{n + 1} \left(\frac{i}{n + 1}\mathbf{P}_{i - 1}
                   + \frac{n + 1 - i}{n + 1}\mathbf{P}_i\right) \mathbf{b}_{i, n + 1}(t) \\
                &= \sum_{i=0}^{n+1} \mathbf{b}_{i, n + 1}(t)\mathbf{P'}_i
\end{align}</math>

==Polynomial form==
Sometimes it is desirable to express the Bézier curve as a [[polynomial]] instead of a sum of less straightforward [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Application of the [[binomial theorem]] to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:

:<math>
\mathbf{B}(t) = \sum_{j = 0}^n {t^j \mathbf{C}_j}
</math>

where

:<math>
\mathbf{C}_j = \frac{n!}{(n - j)!} \sum_{i = 0}^j \frac{(-1)^{i + j} \mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!} =
\prod_{m = 0}^{j - 1} (n - m) \sum_{i = 0}^j \frac{(-1)^{i + j} \mathbf{P}_i}{i! (j - i)!}
.</math>

This could be practical if <math>\mathbf{C}_j</math> can be computed prior to many evaluations of <math>\mathbf{B}(t)</math>; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack [[numeric stability]] ([[de Casteljau's algorithm]] should be used if this occurs). Note that the [[empty product]] is 1.

==Rational Bézier curves==
[[Image:Rational Bezier curve-conic sections.svg|thumb|Sections of conic sections represented exactly by rational Bézier curves]]
The rational Bézier curve adds adjustable weights to provide closer approximations to arbitrary shapes. The numerator is a weighted Bernstein-form Bézier curve and the denominator is a weighted sum of [[Bernstein polynomial]]s. Rational Bézier curves can, among other uses, be used to represent segments of [[conic section]]s exactly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2000/AGraphHCI/SMEG/node5.html|title=Some Mathematical Elements of Graphics: Rational B-splines|author=Neil Dodgson|date=2000-09-25|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref>

Given ''n'' + 1 control points '''P'''<sub>''i''</sub>, the rational Bézier curve can be described by:
:<math>
\mathbf{B}(t) =
\frac{
\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i,n}(t) \mathbf{P}_{i}w_i
}
{
\sum_{i=0}^n b_{i,n}(t) w_i
}
</math>
or simply
:<math>
\mathbf{B}(t) =
\frac{
\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} t^i (1-t)^{n-i}\mathbf{P}_{i}w_i
}
{
\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} t^i (1-t)^{n-i}w_i
}.
</math>
