'''Boötes''' {{IPAc-en|b|oʊ|ˈ|oʊ|t|iː|z}} is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, located between 0° and +60° [[declination]], and 13 and 16 hours of [[right ascension]] on the [[celestial sphere]]. The name comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Βοώτης, ''Boōtēs'', meaning [[herder|herdsman]] or [[plowman]] (literally, ox-driver; from ''boos'', related to the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''bovis'', “cow”). The "ö" in the name is a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], not an [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]], meaning that each 'o' is to be pronounced separately.

Boötes was one of the 48 [[constellation]]s described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]] and is now one of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s. It contains the [[List of brightest stars|fourth brightest star]] in the night sky, [[Arcturus]]. Boötes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye.

== History and mythology ==

In ancient Babylon the stars of Boötes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god [[Enlil]], who was the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and special patron of farmers.{{sfn|White|2008|p=207}}

The name ''Boötes'' was first used by [[Homer]] in his [[Odyssey]] as a celestial reference point for [[History of navigation#Antiquity|navigation]],<ref>Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 book 5, 272]</ref> described as "late-setting" or "slow to set", translated as the "Plowman".{{sfn|Mandelbaum|1990|p=103}} Exactly whom Boötes is supposed to represent in [[Greek mythology]] is not clear. According to one version, he was the son of [[Demeter]],<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref> and a ploughman who drove the oxen in the constellation [[Ursa Major]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} This is corroborated by the constellation's name, which itself means "ox-driver" or "herdsman."<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref> The ancient Greeks saw the [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] now called the "[[Big Dipper]]" or "Plough" as a cart with oxen.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} This influenced the name's etymology, derived from the Greek for "noisy" or "ox-driver".{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} Another myth associated with Boötes tells that he invented the [[plow]] and was memorialized for his ingenuity as a constellation.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|p=133}} 

Another myth associated with Boötes by [[Hyginus]] is that of [[Icarius]], who was schooled as a grape farmer and winemaker by [[Dionysus]]. Icarius made wine so strong that those who drank it appeared poisoned, which caused shepherds to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], Icarius's dog, brought his daughter [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]] to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], and Maera as [[Canis Major]] or [[Canis Minor]].{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Following another reading, the constellation is identified with [[Arcas]] and also referred to as Arcas and Arcturus, son of [[Zeus]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]. Arcas was brought up by his maternal grandfather [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], to whom one day Zeus went and had a meal. To verify that the guest was really the king of the gods, Lycaon killed his grandson and prepared a meal made from his flesh. Zeus noticed and became very angry, transforming Lycaon into a wolf and gave back life to his son. In the meantime Callisto had been transformed into a she-bear, by Zeus' wife, [[Hera]], who was angry at Zeus' infidelity.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} This is corroborated by the Greek name for Boötes, ''Arctophylax'', which means "Bear Watcher".{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} Callisto in form of a bear was almost killed by her son who was out hunting. Zeus rescued her, taking her into the sky where she became Ursa Major, "the Great Bear". The name [[Arcturus]] (the constellation's brightest star) comes from the Greek word meaning "guardian of the bear".  Sometimes [[Arcturus]] is depicted as leading the hunting dogs of nearby [[Canes Venatici]] and driving the bears of [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor]].<ref>Levy 1996 pp=141</ref>

[[File:Sidney Hall, Boötes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis, 1825.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Boötes as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. In his left hand he holds his hunting dogs, Canes Venatici. Below them is the constellation Coma Berenices. Above the head of Boötes is [[Quadrans Muralis]], now obsolete.]]

Several [[former constellations]] were formed from stars now included in Boötes. [[Quadrans Muralis]], the Quadrant, was a constellation created near Beta Boötis from faint stars.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It was invented in 1795 by [[Jérôme Lalande]], an astronomer who used a [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to perform detailed [[astrometry|astronometric measurements]]. Lalande worked with [[Nicole-Reine Lepaute]] and others to predict the 1758 return of [[Halley's Comet]]. Quadrans Muralis was formed from the stars of eastern Boötes, western [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]], and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=51}} It was originally called ''Le Mural'' by [[Jean Fortin]] in his 1795 [[Atlas Céleste]]; it was not given the name ''Quadrans Muralis'' until [[Johann Bode]]'s 1801 ''Uranographia''. The constellation was quite faint, with its brightest stars reaching the 5th magnitude.{{sfn|Star Tales Quadrans Muralis}} [[Mons Maenalus]], representing the [[Maenalus]] mountains, was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687 at the foot of the constellation's figure. The mountain was named for the son of [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]], [[Maenalus]]. The mountain, one of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]'s hunting grounds, was also holy to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]].{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}}

=== Non-Western astronomy ===
The stars of Boötes were incorporated into many different [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese constellations]]. Arcturus was part of the most prominent of these, variously designated as the celestial king's throne (''Tian Wang'') or the Blue Dragon's horn (''Daijiao''); the name ''Daijiao'', meaning "great horn", is more common. Arcturus was given such importance in Chinese celestial mythology because of its status marking the beginning of the lunar calendar, as well as its status as the brightest star in the northern night sky. Two constellations flanked ''Daijiao'', ''Yousheti'' to the right and ''Zuosheti'' to the left; they represented companions that orchestrated the seasons. ''Zuosheti'' was formed from modern [[Zeta Bootis|Zeta]], [[Omicron Bootis|Omicron]], and [[Pi Boötis]], while ''Yousheti'' was formed from modern [[Eta Bootis|Eta]], [[Tau Bootis|Tau]], and [[Upsilon Boötis]]. ''Dixi'', the Emperor's ceremonial banquet mat, was north of Arcturus, consisting of the stars [[12 Bootis|12]], [[11 Bootis|11]], and [[9 Boötis]].  Another northern constellation was ''Qigong'', the Seven Dukes, which was mostly across the Boötes-Hercules border. It included either [[Delta Boötis]] or [[Beta Boötis]] as its terminus.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

The other Chinese constellations made up of the stars of Boötes existed in the modern constellation's north; they are all representations of weapons. ''Tianqiang'', the spear, was formed from [[Iota Bootis|Iota]], [[Kappa Bootis|Kappa]], and [[Theta Boötis]]; ''Genghe'', variously representing a lance or shield, was formed from [[Epsilon Bootis|Epsilon]], [[Rho Bootis|Rho]], and [[Sigma Boötis]]. There were also two weapons made up of a singular star. ''Xuange'', the [[halberd]], was represented by [[Lambda Boötis]], and ''Zhaoyao'', either the sword or the spear, was represented by [[Gamma Boötis]].{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Two Chinese constellations have an uncertain placement in Boötes. ''Kangchi'', the lake, was placed south of Arcturus, though its specific location is disputed. It may have been placed entirely in Boötes, on either side of the Boötes-Virgo border, or on either side of the Virgo-Libra border. The constellation ''Zhouding'', a bronze tripod-mounted container used for food, was sometimes cited as the stars [[1 Bootis|1]], [[2 Bootis|2]], and [[6 Boötis]]. However, it has also been associated with three stars in Coma Berenices.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

Antares had several names that described its significance to indigenous [[Polynesia]]ns. In the [[Society Islands]], Arcturus, called ''Ana-tahua-taata-metua-te-tupu-mavae'' ("a pillar to stand by"), was one of the ten "pillars of the sky", bright stars that represented the ten heavens of the [[Tahiti]]an afterlife.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=199}} In [[Hawaii]], the pattern of Boötes was called ''Hoku-iwa'', meaning "stars of the frigate bird". This constellation marked the path for [[Hawaiiloa]] on his return to Hawaii from the South Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=209}} The Hawaiians called Arcturus ''Hoku-lea''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=280}} It was equated to the [[Tuamotu]]an constellation ''Te Kiva'', meaning "[[frigate-bird]]", which could either represent the figure of Boötes or just Arcturus.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=221}} However, Arcturus may instead be the Tuamotuan star called ''Turu''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=264}} The Hawaiian name for Arcturus as a single star was likely ''Hoku-lea'', which means "star of gladness".{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=210}} In the [[Marquesas Islands]], Arcturus was probably called ''Tau-tou'' and was the star that ruled the month approximating January. The [[Māori people|Maori]] and [[Moriori]] called it ''Tautoru'', a variant of the Marquesan name and a name shared with [[Orion's Belt]].{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=260}}

== Characteristics ==

Boötes is a constellation bordered by [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] to the south, [[Coma Berenices]] and [[Canes Venatici]] to the west, [[Ursa Major]] to the northwest, [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] to the northeast, and [[Hercules]], [[Corona Borealis]] and [[Serpens Caput]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'Boo'.{{sfn|Russell|1922|p=469}} The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|13|36.1}} and {{RA|15|49.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates stretch from +7.36° to +55.1°.{{sfn|IAU, ''The Constellations'', Boötes}} Covering 907 square degrees, Boötes [[culmination|culminates]] at midnight around the 2nd of May and ranks 13th in area.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=150}}

Colloquially, its pattern of stars has been likened to a kite or ice cream cone.{{sfn|Bakich|1995|p=150}}{{sfn|Polakis|2009}} However, depictions of Boötes have varied historically. [[Aratus]] described him circling the north pole, herding the two bears. Later ancient Greek depictions, described by Ptolemy, have him holding the reins of his hunting dogs (Canes Venatici) in his left hand, with a spear, club, or staff in his right hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}} After Hevelius introduced Mons Maenalus in 1681, Boötes was often depicted standing on the [[Peloponnese]] mountain.{{sfn|Star Tales Mons Maenalus}} By 1801, when [[Johann Bode]] published his ''Uranographia'', Boötes had acquired a sickle, which was also held in his left hand.{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

The placement of Arcturus has also been mutable through the centuries. Traditionally, Arcturus lay between his thighs, as Ptolemy depicted him. However, [[Germanicus Caesar]] deviated from this tradition by placing Arcturus "where his garment is fastened by a knot".{{sfn|Star Tales Boötes}}

{{see also|List of stars in Boötes}}
In his ''[[Uranometria]]'', [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters Alpha through to Omega and then A to k to label what he saw as the most prominent 35 stars in the constellation, with subsequent astronomers splitting Kappa, Mu, Nu and Pi as two stars each. Nu is also the same star as Psi Herculis.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=55–57}} [[John Flamsteed]] numbered 54 stars for the constellation.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=355–56}}

[[Arcturus]], or Alpha Boötis, is the brightest star in Boötes and the fourth brightest star in the sky at an [[apparent magnitude]] of −0.04; it has an [[absolute magnitude]] of −0.2.

[[Epsilon Boötis]], also known as [[Izar]] or [[Pulcherrima]], is a close triple star popular with amateur astronomers and the most prominent binary star in Boötes. The primary is a yellow-{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} or orange-hued magnitude 2.5 giant star, the secondary is a magnitude 4.6 blue-hued [[main-sequence star]],{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} and the tertiary is a magnitude 12.0 star.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} The system is 210 light-years away. The name "Izar" comes from the Arabic word for "girdle" or "loincloth", referring to its location in the constellation. The name "Pulcherrima" comes from the Latin phrase for "most beautiful", referring to its contrasting colors in a telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary and secondary stars are separated by 2.9 [[arcsecond]]s at an angle of 341 degrees; the primary's spectral class is K0 and it has a luminosity of 200 L<sub>☉</sub>.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=105}} To the naked eye, Izar has a magnitude of 2.37.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} 

[[Mu Boötis]], known as [[Alkalurops]], is a triple star popular with amateur astronomers. It has an overall magnitude of 4.3 and is 121 light-years away. Its name is from the Arabic phrase for "club" or "staff". The primary appears to be of magnitude 4.3 and is blue-white. The secondary appears to be of magnitude 6.5, but is actually a close double star itself with a primary of magnitude 7.0 and a secondary of magnitude 7.6. The secondary and tertiary stars have an orbital period of 260 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} The primary has an absolute magnitude of 2.6 and is of spectral class F0.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} The secondary and tertiary stars are separated by 2 arcseconds; the primary and secondary are separated by 109.1 arcseconds at an angle of 171 degrees.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=106}}

==== Variable stars ====

Boötes possesses several variable stars. [[T Boötis]] was a [[nova]] observed in April 1860 at a magnitude of 9.7. It has never been observed since, but that does not preclude the possibility of it being a highly irregular [[variable star]] or a [[recurrent nova]].{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}}

Two of the brighter Mira-type variables stars in the constellations are R Bo[[R Boötis|ö]]<nowiki/>tis and S Bo[[R Boötis|ö]]<nowiki/>tis. [[R Boötis]] is an M-type star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.1 to a maximum of 6.2 over a period of 223.4 days.{{sfn|Pasachoff|2000|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[S Boötis]] is another M-type Mira variable that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.8 to a maximum of 7.8 over a period of 270.7 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[44 Boötis]] (i Boötis) is a double variable star 42 light-years away. It has an overall magnitude of 4.8 and appears yellow to the naked eye. The primary is of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.1; their orbital period is 220 years. The secondary is itself an eclipsing variable star with a range of 0.6 magnitudes; its orbital period is 6.4 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}} It is a [[W Ursae Majoris variable]] that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 7.1 to a maximum of 6.5 every 0.27 days. Both stars are G-type stars. Another W UMa-type star is [[ZZ Boötis]], which has two G2-type components and ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 6.4 to a maximum of 5.8. It has a period of 5.0 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

Boötes has two [[semi-regular variable star]]s. [[V Boötis]] is an M-type star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 12.0 to a maximum of 7.0, over a period of 258 days. [[W Boötis]] is a brighter M-type star; it has a minimum magnitude of 5.4 and a maximum magnitude of 4.7, with a period of 450 days.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

[[BL Boötis]] is the prototype of its class of pulsating variable stars,{{sfn|North|2004|p=123}} the [[anomalous Cepheids]]. These stars are somewhat similar to [[Cepheid variable]]s, but they do not have the same relationship between their period and luminosity.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=61}} Their periods are similar to [[RRAB variable]]s; however, they are far brighter than these stars.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=69}} BL Boötis is a member of the cluster [[NGC 5466]]. Anomalous Cepheids are [[metallicity|metal poor]] and have masses not much larger than the Sun's, on average, 1.5 [[solar mass]]es. BL Boötis type stars are a subtype of [[RR Lyrae]] variables.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=70}}

An apparent magnitude 4.18 [[Ap and Bp stars|type A0p star]],{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} [[Lambda Boötis]] is the prototype of its class of pulsating variable stars, somewhat like [[Delta Scuti]] type stars. Lambda Boötis type stars usually have small amplitudes. They are [[dwarf star]]s that can be either spectral class A or F.{{sfn|North|2004|p=145}} They, like BL Boötis-type stars, are metal-poor.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=62}} Scientists have had difficult determining the characteristics of Lambda Boötis-type stars because of the difficulty in correctly distinguishing them from [[Delta Scuti]]-type stars, among others.{{sfn|Good|2003|p=78}} Lambda has an absolute magnitude of 1.8.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}}

==== Stars with planetary systems ====

[[File:Tau Bootis Ab.jpg|thumb|left|A digital rendering of Tau Boötis b]]

[[Extrasolar planet]]s have been discovered encircling ten stars in Boötes as of 2012. [[Tau Boötis]] is orbited by a large planet, discovered in 1999. The host star itself is a magnitude 4.5 star of type F7V, 15.6 [[parsec]]s from Earth. It has a mass of 1.3 [[solar mass]]es and a radius of 1.331 [[solar radius|solar radii]]; a companion, [[GJ527B]], orbits at a distance of 240 AU. [[Tau Boötis b]], the sole planet discovered in the system, orbits at a distance of 0.046 AU every 3.31 days. Discovered through [[radial velocity]] measurements, it has a mass of 5.95 [[Jupiter mass]]es.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia Tau Boo b}} This makes it a [[hot Jupiter]].{{sfn|Rodler|Lopez-Morales|Ribas|2012}} The host star and planet are [[tidal lock|tidally locked]], meaning that the planet's orbit and the star's particularly high rotation are synchronized.{{sfn|Cameron et al. 2000}}{{sfn|Walker et al.|2008}} Furthermore, a slight variability in the host star's light may be caused by magnetic interactions with the planet.{{sfn|Walker et al.|2008}} [[Carbon monoxide]] is present in the planet's atmosphere. Tau Boötis b does not [[astronomical transit|transit]] its star, rather, its orbit is inclined 46 degrees.{{sfn|Rodler|Lopez-Morales|Ribas|2012}} Like Tau Boötis b, [[HAT-P-4 b]] is also a hot Jupiter. It is noted for orbiting a particularly [[metallicity|metal-rich]] host star and being of low density.{{sfn|Kovács et al.|2007}} Discovered in 2007, HAT-P-4 b has a mass of 0.68 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.27 Jupiter radii. It orbits every 3.05 days at a distance of 0.04 AU. [[HAT-P-4]], the host star, is an F-type star of magnitude 11.2, 310 parsecs from Earth. It is larger than the Sun, with a mass of 1.26 solar masses and a radius of 1.59 solar radii.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HAT-P-4 b}}

[[File:Hd128311.png|thumb|right|Evolution of the HD 128311 system over time]]

Boötes is also home to multiple-planet systems. [[HD 128311]] is the host star for a two-planet system, consisting of [[HD 128311 b]] and [[HD 128311 c]], discovered in 2002 and 2005, respectively.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}}{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 c}} HD 128311 b is the smaller planet, with a mass of 2.18 Jupiter masses; it was discovered through [[radial velocity]] observations. It orbits at almost the same distance as Earth, at 1.099 AU; however, its orbital period is significantly longer at 448.6 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}} The larger of the two, HD 128311 c, has a mass of 3.21 Jupiter masses and was discovered in the same manner. It orbits every 919 days inclined at 50°, and is 1.76 AU from the host star.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 c}} The host star, HD 128311, is a K0V-type star located 16.6 parsecs from Earth. It is smaller than the Sun, with a mass of 0.84 solar masses and a radius of 0.73 solar radii; it also appears below the threshold of naked-eye visibility at an apparent magnitude of 7.51.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 128311 b}}

There are several single-planet systems in Boötes. [[HD 132406]] is a sun-like star of spectral type G0V with an apparent magnitude of 8.45, 231.5 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Da Silva Udry et al.|2007}} It has a mass of 1.09 solar masses and a radius of 1 solar radius.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132406}} The star is orbited by a gas giant, [[HD 132406 b]], discovered in 2007.{{sfn|Da Silva Udry et al.|2007}} HD 132406 orbits 1.98 AU from its host star with a period of 974 days and has a mass of 5.61 Jupiter masses. The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132406}} [[WASP-23]] is a star with one orbiting planet, [[WASP-23 b]]. The planet, discovered by the [[transit method]] in 2010, orbits every 2.944 very close to its sun, at 0.0376 AU. It is smaller than Jupiter, at 0.884 Jupiter masses and 0.962 Jupiter radii. Its star is a K1V type star of apparent magnitude 12.7, far below naked-eye visibility, and smaller than the Sun at 0.78 solar masses and 0.765 solar radii.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-23 b}} [[HD 131496]] is also encircled by one planet, [[HD 131496 b]]. The star is of type K0 and is located 110 parsecs from Earth; it appears at a visual magnitude of 7.96. It is significantly larger than the Sun, with a mass of 1.61 solar masses and a radius of 4.6 solar radii. Its one planet, discovered in 2011 by the [[radial velocity method]], has a mass of 2.2 Jupiter masses; its radius is as yet undetermined. HD 131496 b orbits at a distance of 2.09 AU with a period of 883 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 131496 b}}

Another single planetary system in Boötes is the [[HD 132563]] system, a [[triple star]] system. The parent star, technically [[HD 132563B]], is a star of magnitude 9.47, 96 parsecs from Earth. It is almost exactly the size of the sun, with the same radius and a mass only 1% greater. Its planet, [[HD 132563B b]], was discovered in 2011 by the radial velocity method. 1.49 times the mass of Jupiter, it orbits 2.62 AU from its star with a period of 1544 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 132563B b}} Its orbit is somewhat elliptical, with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.22. HD 132563B b is one of very few planets found in triple star systems; it orbits the isolated member of the system, which is separated from the other components, a [[spectroscopic binary]], by 400 AU.{{sfn|Desidera et al.|2011}} Also discovered through the radial velocity method, albeit a year earlier, is [[HD 136418 b]], a 2-Jupiter mass planet that orbits the star [[HD 136418]] at a distance of 1.32 AU with a period of 464.3 days. Its host star is a magnitude 7.88 G5-type star, 98.2 parsecs from Earth. It has a radius of 3.4 solar radii and a mass of 1.33 solar masses.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia HD 136418 b}}

[[WASP-14 b]] is one of the most massive and dense exoplanets known,{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}} with a mass of 7.341 Jupiter masses and a radius of 1.281 Jupiter radii. Discovered via the transit method, it orbits 0.036 AU from its host star with a period of 2.24 days.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-14 b}} WASP-14 b has a density of 4.6 grams per cubic centimeter, making it one of the densest exoplanets known.{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}} Its host star, [[WASP-14]], is an F5V-type star of magnitude 9.75, 160 parsecs from Earth. It has a radius of 1.306 solar radii and a mass of 1.211 solar masses.{{sfn|Exoplanet Encyclopedia WASP-14 b}} It also has a very high proportion of [[lithium]].{{sfn|Joshi et al.|2009}}

=== Deep-sky objects ===

Boötes is in a part of the [[celestial sphere]] facing away from the plane of our home [[Milky Way]] galaxy, and so does not have open clusters or nebulae. Instead, it has one bright [[globular cluster]] and many faint [[galaxy|galaxies]].{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=102}} The globular cluster [[NGC 5466]] has an overall magnitude of 9.1 and a diameter of 11 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} It is a very loose globular cluster with fairly few stars and may appear as a rich, concentrated [[open cluster]] in a telescope. NGC 5466 is classified as a [[Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class]] 12 cluster, reflecting its sparsity.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=103}} Its fairly large diameter means that it has a low [[surface brightness]], so it appears far dimmer than the catalogued magnitude of 9.1 and requires a large amateur telescope to view. Only approximately 12 stars are resolved by an amateur instrument.{{sfn|Thompson|Thompson|2007|p=104}}

Boötes has two bright galaxies. [[NGC 5248]] ([[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell]] 45) is a [[Hubble sequence|type Sc galaxy]] (a variety of [[spiral galaxy]]) of magnitude 10.2. It measures 6.5 by 4.9 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} 50 million light-years from Earth, NGC 5248 is a member of the [[Virgo Cluster]] of galaxies; it has dim outer arms and obvious [[H II region]]s, [[dust lane]]s, and young [[star cluster]]s.{{sfn|Niksch|Block|2004}} [[NGC 5676]] is another type Sc galaxy of magnitude 10.9. It measures 3.9 by 2.0 arcminutes.{{sfn|Moore|2000|pp=341–342}} Other galaxies include [[NGC 5008]], a type Sc [[emission-line galaxy]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5008}} [[NGC 5548]], a type S [[Seyfert galaxy]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5548}} [[NGC 5653]], a type S HII galaxy,{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5653}} [[NGC 5778]] (also classified as NGC 5825),{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5825}} a type E galaxy that is the brightest of its cluster,{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5778}} [[NGC 5886]],{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5886}} and [[NGC 5888]], a type SBb galaxy.{{sfn|SIMBAD NGC 5888}} [[NGC 5698]] is a barred spiral galaxy, notable for being the host of the 2005 supernova [[SN 2005bc]], which peaked at magnitude 15.3.

Much further away lies the 250 million light-year diameter [[Boötes void]], a huge space largely empty of galaxies. Its centre is roughly 700 million light years from Earth. Beyond it and within the bounds of the constellation, lie two [[supercluster]]s at around 830 million and 1 billion light years distant.

=== Meteor showers ===
[[File:Quad2011.324.JPG|thumb|left|A Quadrantid captured by an all-sky camera during a 4-second exposure.]]
Boötes is home to the [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower, the most prolific annual meteor shower. It was discovered in January 1835 and named in 1864 by Alexander Hershell.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357–368}} The [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] is located in northern Boötes near Kappa Boötis,{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=612}} in its namesake former constellation of [[Quadrans Muralis]]. Quadrantid meteors are dim, but have a peak visible hourly rate of approximately 100 per hour on January 3–4.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=88–89}}{{sfn|Moore|Tirion|1997|pp=132–133}} The [[zenithal hourly rate]] of the Quadrantids is approximately 130 meteors per hour at their peak; it is also a very narrow shower. The Quadrantids are notoriously difficult to observe because of a low radiant and often inclement weather. The parent body of the meteor shower has been disputed for decades;{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|pp=357–368}} however, [[Peter Jenniskens]] has proposed [[2003 EH1|2003 EH<sub>1</sub>]], a minor planet, as the parent.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=368}} 2003 EH<sub>1</sub> may be linked to [[C/1490 Y1|C/1490 Y<sub>1</sub>]], a comet previously thought to be a potential parent body for the Quadrantids.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=373}}{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=376}} 2003 EH<sub>1</sub> is a [[short-period comet]] of the [[Jupiter family comet|Jupiter family]]; 500 years ago, it experienced a catastrophic breakup event. It is now dormant.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}} The Quadrantids had notable displays in 1982, 1985, and 2004.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=49}} Meteors from this shower often appear to have a blue hue and travel at a moderate speed of 41.5–43 kilometers per second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=104}}

On April 28, 1984, a remarkable outburst of the normally placid [[Alpha Bootids]] was observed by visual observer Frank Witte from 00:00 to 2:30 UTC. In a 6&nbsp;cm telescope, he observed 433 meteors in a field of view near [[Arcturus]] with a diameter of less than 1°. [[Peter Jenniskens]] comments that this outburst resembled a "typical dust trail crossing".{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=199}} The Alpha Bootids normally begin on April 14, peaking on April 27th and 28th, and finishing on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 20.9 kilometers per second.{{sfn|IAU Alpha Bootids}} They may be related to Comet [[73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3]], but this connection is only theorized.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}}

[[File:QUADRANTID meteor on January 3 2009.jpg|thumb|left|A bright Quadrantid observed at twilight.]]

The [[June Bootids]], also known as the Iota Draconids, is a meteor shower associated with the comet [[7P/Pons-Winnecke]], first recognized on May 27, 1916 by William F. Denning.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=334}} The shower, with its slow meteors, was not observed prior to 1916 because Earth did not cross the comet's dust trail until Jupiter perturbed Pons-Winnecke's orbit, causing it to come within 0.03 [[astronomical unit|AU]] of Earth's orbit the first year the June Bootids were observed. In 1982, E. A. Reznikov discovered that the 1916 outburst was caused by material released from the comet in 1819.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=335}} Another outburst of the June Bootids was not observed until 1998, because Comet Pons-Winnecke's orbit was not in a favorable position. However, on June 27, 1998, an outburst of meteors radiating from Boötes, later confirmed to be associated with Pons-Winnecke, was observed. They were incredibly long-lived, with trails of the brightest meteors lasting several seconds at times. Many [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]]s, green-hued trails, and even some meteors that cast shadows were observed throughout the outburst, which had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 200–300 meteors per hour.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=336–337}} In 2002, two Russian astronomers determined that material ejected from the comet in 1825 was responsible for the 1998 outburst.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=338}} [[Ejecta]] from the comet dating to 1819, 1825, and 1830 was predicted to enter Earth's atmosphere on June 23, 2004. The predictions of a shower less spectacular than the 1998 showing were borne out in a display that had a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 16–20 meteors per hour that night. The June Bootids are not expected to have another outburst in the next 50 years.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2006|p=339–344}} Typically, only 1–2 dim, very slow meteors are visible per hour; the average June Bootid has a magnitude of 5.0. It is related to the [[Alpha Draconids]] and the [[Bootids-Draconids]]. The shower lasts from June 27 to July 5, with a peak on the night of June 28.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=113}} The June Bootids are classified as a class III shower (variable),{{sfn|AMS 2012 List}} and has an average entry velocity of 18 kilometers per second. Its radiant is located 7 degrees north of Beta Boötis.{{sfn|AMS June 23}}

The [[Beta Bootids]] is a weak shower that begins on January 5, peaks on January 16, and ends on January 18. Its meteors travel at 43 kilometers/second.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=105}} The [[January Bootids]] is a short, young meteor shower that begins on January 9, peaks from January 16 to January 18, and ends on January 18th.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=106}} The [[Phi Bootids]] is another weak shower radiating from Boötes. It begins on April 16, peaks on April 30 and May 1, and ends on May 12.{{sfn|Levy|2008|p=110}} Its meteors are slow-moving, with a velocity of 15.1&nbsp;km/s. They were discovered in 2006.{{sfn|IAU Phi Bootids}}  The shower's peak hourly rate can be as high as 6 meteors per hour. Though named for a star in Boötes, the Phi Bootid radiant has moved into [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]].{{sfn|Koed|Sherrod|2003|p=52}} The meteor stream is associated with three different asteroids: [[1620 Geographos]], [[2062 Aten]], and [[1978 CA]].{{sfn|Štohl|Porubčan|1993|p=43}} The [[Lambda Bootids]], part of the [[Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex]], are a weak annual shower with moderately fast meteors; 41.75&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Lambda Bootids}} The complex includes the Lambda Bootids, as well as the [[Theta Coronae Borealids]] and [[Xi Coronae Borealids]].{{sfn|IAU Bootid-Coronae Borealid Complex}}{{sfn|Green|2007}} All of the Bootid-Coronae Borealid showers are [[Jupiter family comet]] showers; the streams in the complex have highly inclined orbits.{{sfn|Jenniskens|2012}}

There are several minor showers in Boötes, some of whose existence is yet to be verified. The [[Rho Bootids]] radiate from near the namesake star, and were hypothesized in 2010.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}} The average Rho Bootid has an entry velocity of 43&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Rho Bootids}}{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} It peaks in November and lasts for 3 days. The Rho Bootid shower is part of the [[SMA complex]], a group of meteor showers related to the [[Taurids]], which is in turn linked to the comet [[2P/Encke]]. However, the link to the Taurid shower remains unconfirmed and may be a chance correlation.{{sfn|Brown|Wong|Weryk|Wiegert|2010}} Another such shower is the [[Gamma Bootids]], which were hypothesized in 2006. Gamma Bootids have an entry velocity of 50.3&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Gamma Bootids}} The [[Nu Bootids]], hypothesized in 2012, have faster meteors, with an entry velocity of 62.8&nbsp;km/s.{{sfn|IAU Nu Bootids}}
