'''Chernobyl''' or '''Chornobyl''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ər|ˈ|n|əʊ|b|ɪ|l}}; {{lang-uk|Чорнобиль}}, {{IPA-uk|tʃɔrˈnɔbɪlʲ|pron}}; {{lang-ru|Чернобыль}}, {{IPA-ru|tɕɪrˈnobɨlʲ|pron}}, {{lang-pl|Czarnobyl}})  is a city in the restricted [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] situated in northern [[Kiev Oblast]], [[Ukraine]] near the border with [[Belarus]]. The city had been the administrative centre of the Chernobyl [[Raion]] since 1932.

The city was evacuated in 1986 due to the [[Chernobyl disaster]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], located {{convert|14.5|km|mi}} north-northwest. The power plant was within Chernobyl [[Raion]] (District), but the city was not the residence of the power plant workers. When the power plant was under construction, [[Pripyat]], a city larger and closer to the power plant, had been built as home for the power plant workers.

After the accident the Chernobyl Raion administration was transferred to the neighboring [[Ivankiv Raion]]. Though the city today is mostly uninhabited, a small number of people reside in houses marked with signs stating that the "Owner of this house lives here". Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone|Zone of Alienation]] are stationed in the city on a long term basis. Prior to its evacuation, the city was inhabited by about 14,000 residents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mould|first=Richard |title=Chernobyl Record|publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]|location=Bristol, England|page=105|chapter=Evacuation zones and populations|isbn=0-7503-0670-X}}</ref> The city of [[Slavutych]] was built specifically for the evacuated population of Chernobyl.

==Name origin==
The city name is the same as a local [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] name for ''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]'' ([[mugwort]] or common [[wormwood]]), which is also чорнобиль "chornobyl".<ref>[http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Arte_vul.html#chornobyl Gernot Katzer's Spice Pages, ''Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.)''], by Gernot Katzer, 4 July 2006.</ref> An alternative etymology holds that it is a combination of the words ''chornyi'' (чорний, black) and ''byllia'' (билля, grass blades or stalks), hence it would literally mean black grass or black stalks.

==History==
Originally part of the land of [[Kievan Rus]] Chernobyl first appeared in a charter of 1193, described as a hunting-lodge of [[Knyaz]] [[Rostislavich]].<ref name="ND">[[Norman Davies]], ''[[Europe: A History]]'', Oxford University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-19-820171-0</ref><ref>[http://www.chornobyl.in.ua/en/chornobyl.htm Chernobyl ancient history and maps].</ref> It was a crown village of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 13th century. The village was granted as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Filon Kmita]], a captain of the royal [[cavalry]], in 1566. The province containing Chernobyl was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1569, and then annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1793.<ref name="ND2">Davies, Norman (1995) "Chernobyl", [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/195/index.html ''The Sarmatian Review, vol. 15'', No. 1].</ref> Prior to the 20th century, Chernobyl was inhabited by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and some [[Poles|Polish]] [[peasant]]s, and a relatively large number of [[Jew]]s.

Chernobyl had a rich religious history. The Jews were brought by [[Filon Kmita]], during the Polish campaign of colonization. The traditionally Christian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Ukrainian peasantry of the district was largely forced, by Poland, to convert to the [[Greek Catholic]] Uniate religion after 1596. Yet the vast majority returned to [[Eastern Orthodox]]y after the Partitions of Poland.

The [[Dominican order|Dominican]] church and [[monastery]] were founded in 1626 by Lukasz Sapieha, at the height of the [[Counter-reformation]]. There was a group of [[Old Catholics]], who opposed the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. The Dominican monastery was sequestrated in 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, and the church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852.<ref name="ND"/>

In the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became one of the major centers of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. The [[Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)|Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty]] had been founded by Rabbi [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]]. The Jewish population suffered greatly from [[pogrom]]s in October 1905 and in March–April 1919, when many Jews were killed and others were robbed, at the instigation of the Russian nationalist [[Black Hundreds]]. In 1920, the Twersky dynasty left Chernobyl, and it ceased to exist as a Hasidic centre.

Since the 1880s, Chernobyl has seen many changes of fortune. In 1898 Chernobyl had a population of 10,800, including 7,200 [[Jews]]. In [[World War I]] the village was occupied, and in the ensuing [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Civil War]], Chernobyl was fought over by [[Bolshevik]]s and Ukrainians. In the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919–20, it was taken first by the Polish Army and then by cavalry of the [[Red Army]]. From 1921, it was incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name="ND"/>

During the period 1929–33, Chernobyl suffered greatly from mass killings during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[collectivization]] campaign, and in the [[Holodomor]] (famine) that followed. The Polish community of Chernobyl was deported to [[Kazakhstan]] in 1936 during the [[Frontier Clearances]]. The Jewish community was murdered during the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|German occupation of 1941–44]].<ref name="ND"/> Twenty years later, the area was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power station on Ukrainian soil.

The [[Duga-3]] [[over-the-horizon radar]] array several miles out of Chernobyl was the origin of the infamous [[Russian Woodpecker]], designed as part of Russia's [[anti-ballistic missile]] [[early warning radar]] network.

With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of [[Ukraine]], now an independent nation.

==Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster==
<!------
This article describes the city of Chernobyl. Please include information on the Chernobyl accident in [[Chernobyl disaster]].
-------->
{{Main|Chernobyl disaster}}

On April 26, 1986, Reactor #4 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] near the town of [[Pripyat]], Ukraine, exploded. The explosion took place at 1:23am while the neighboring town of Pripyat slept. Two workers were killed instantly. 40 hours later, the residents of Pripyat were ordered to evacuate, and most never returned; by that time, many of the residents had suffered varying degrees of [[radiation poisoning]].

In 2003, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] launched a project called the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP)]] for the recovery of the affected areas.<ref>[http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&projects=14 CRDP: Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (United Nations Development Program)]</ref> The program launched its activities based on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations and was initiated in February 2002. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the [[Government of Ukraine]] to mitigate long-term social, economic and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe, among others. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: [[Kiev Oblast]], [[Zhytomyrska Oblast]], partially [[Kiev]], [[Chernihivska Oblast]] and [[Rivne Oblast]].
===Chernobyl city after the disaster===
Chernobyl was evacuated soon after the disaster. The base of operations for the administration and monitoring of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was moved from Pripyat to Chernobyl. Chernobyl currently contains offices for the [[State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management|Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone#Administration]] and accommodation for visitors. Apartment blocks have been re-purposed as accommodation for employees of the State Agency. Due to regulations to limit exposure workers in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are limited in the number of days per week or weeks per month they stay in Chernobyl.
