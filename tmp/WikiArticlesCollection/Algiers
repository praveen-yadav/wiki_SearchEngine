'''Algiers''' ({{lang-ar|{{linktext|الجزائر}}}}, ''al-Jazā’er''; [[Algerian Arabic]]: دزاير, [[Berber language|Berber]]: Dzayer, ⴷⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ, {{lang-fr|Alger}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of [[Algeria]]. According to the 1998 census, the population of the city proper was 1,519,570 and that of the urban agglomeration was 2,135,630.<ref name=citypop/> In 2009, the population was about 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population at about 3,574,000 as of 2010. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria<ref name=wup/>

Sometimes nicknamed ''El-Behdja'' (البهجة) or alternatively ''Alger la Blanche'' ("Algiers the White") for the glistening white of its buildings as seen rising up from the sea, Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the [[dey]]s, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the [[casbah]] or citadel, {{convert|122|m|0}} above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.

==Etymology==<!--linked name-->
The city name is derived (via [[French language|French]] ''Alger'' and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Alger''<ref name=leschi>''Origins of Algiers'' by Louis Leschi, speech delivered June 16, 1941 published in ''El Djezair Sheets'', July 1941 [http://alger-roi.fr/Alger/alger_son_histoire/textes/3_origines_alger_1941_feuillets.htm History of Algeria] {{fr icon}}.</ref>) from the Arabic name الجزائر ''al-Jazā’ir'', which translates as "The Islands", referring to the four islands which lay off the city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525. ''Al-Jazā’ir'' is itself a truncated form of the city's older name جزائر بني مزغانة ''Jaza'ir Bani Mazghana'', "The Islands of the [[Banu Mazghanna|Sons of Mazghana]]", used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Algiers history}}
A [[Phoenicia]]n commercial outpost called ''Ikosim'' which later developed into a small [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town called ''[[Icosium]]'' existed on what is now the marine quarter of the city. The ''rue de la Marine'' follows the lines of what used to be a Roman street. Roman cemeteries existed near ''[[Bab-el-Oued]]'' and ''[[Bab Azoun]]''. The city was given [[Latin]] rights by [[Vespasian]]. The [[bishop]]s of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century.

[[File:Old algiers 16th century.jpg|thumb|left|Old Algiers in the 16th century, with the Spanish-built Peñón of Algiers in the forefront.]]
The present-day city was founded in 944 by [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]], the founder of the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Zirid]]–[[Sanhaja]] dynasty.  He had earlier (935) built his own house and a [[Sanhaja]] center at Ashir, just south of Algiers.  Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the [[Hammadid]]s in 1014.<ref>Ruedy, John Douglas (2005) ''Modern Algeria: The origins and development of a nation'' Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana [http://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC&pg=PA13 page 13], ISBN 978-0-253-21782-0</ref> The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the [[Almohades]] in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the [[Ziyanid]] sultans of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]]. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under [[amir]]s of its own due to [[Oran]] being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.

As early as 1302 the islet of Peñón in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by Spaniards. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and [[Spain]]. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the [[Moors]] from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Peñon and imposed a levy intended to suppress [[Barbary corsairs|corsair]] activity.<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 13.</ref>

===Ottoman rule===
[[File:Duquesne fait liberer des captifs chretiens apres le bombardement d Alger en 1683.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Abraham Duquesne]] delivering Christian captives in Algiers after the bombing in 1683.]]
In 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Hayreddin]] Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the [[Capture of Algiers (1516)]]. Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the [[Fall of Tlemcen (1517)]], was the founder of the ''[[pashaluk]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[bey]]lik'', of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the [[Capture of Algiers (1529)]], and then formally invited the Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the [[Barbary pirates]]. In October 1541 in the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]], the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their [[Pasha]], Hassan.

Formally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 17th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjaránið – Heimaslóð |language={{is icon}} |publisher=Heimaslod.is |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.

The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Jew]]ish, [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, pp. 13–14.</ref>

In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), assisted by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.

===French rule===
The history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of [[Algeria]] and its relationship to [[France]]. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul—whom the [[dey]] had hit with a [[fly-whisk]] when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants—a French army under [[Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont|General de Bourmont]] attacked the city in the [[invasion of Algiers in 1830|1830 invasion of Algiers]]. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of [[French Algeria]].

Many Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population.<ref>Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=egbOb0mewz4C&pg=PA323&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A history of the Arab peoples]''". Harvard University Press. p.323. ISBN 0-674-01017-5</ref> During the 1930s, the architect [[Le Corbusier]] drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as "nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which "the 'civilised' live like rats in holes" whereas "the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being".<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5.</ref> However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.

During [[World War II]], Algiers was the last city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during [[Operation Torch]].
[[File:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|left|City and harbour of Algiers, c. 1921]]

In 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 500,000 to 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]) during fighting between the [[French Army]] and the Algerian [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]], Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population—and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Geography of Algeria|Mitidja]] plain.

===Algerian War===
[[File:Algiers Coat of Arms (French Algeria).svg|thumb|180px|[[Coat of arms]] of Algiers during French colonization]]
Algiers also played a pivotal role in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), particularly during the [[Algerian War#Battle of Algiers|Battle of Algiers]] when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of then French Minister of Justice [[François Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means "to eliminate the insurrectionists"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between Algerian forces who, on the one hand, resorted to attacking the French civilians and pro-French Algerians, and the French Army who, on the other, carried out a bloody repression including the quasi-systematic use of torture on protesters of the colonial order. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power.

===Independence===
Algeria achieved [[independence]] on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the “Spring of Algiers”. The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the reign of the single party and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.

===Crisis of the 1990s===
The city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1992. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army cancelled the election process, setting off a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.

On December 11, 2007, two car [[11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|bombs exploded in Algiers]]. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll is at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Les autorités accusent al-Qaïda|publisher=RFI|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/096/article_60149.asp|accessdate=2007-12-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213023440/http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/096/article_60149.asp| archivedate= 13 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Toll in Algiers bombings rises to 31|agency=Associated Press|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion|accessdate=2007-12-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214021257/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}</ref> As of 2008, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Al Qaeda blamed for Algeria bombs|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/12/11/algeria.blast/index.html|accessdate=2007-12-11 | date=2007-12-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071212153122/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/12/11/algeria.blast/index.html| archivedate= 12 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

* The ''' [[Casbah]] ''' (of '' Al Qasbah '', “the Citadel”), Ier District of Algiers: called '' Al-Djazaïr Al Mahroussa '' (“Well Kept Algiers”), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El Kébir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by [[almoravides|almoravide]] [[Youssef Ibn Tachfin]] and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Raïs, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of Jénina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque; and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.
* ''' [[Bab El Oued]] ''': Literally ''the River's Gate'', the popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond "the gate of the river". It is the capital's darling and best liked borough. Famous for its square with “the three clocks” and for its “market Triplet”, it is also a district of workshops and manufacturing plants.
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Alger.jpg|thumb|left|Bab El Wadi]] -->
* ''' Edge of sea ''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and [[Charles Frédéric Chassériau]] designed new buildings apart from the Kasbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, casino ... to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is the boulevard today [[Che Guevara]] (ex-boulevard of [[Republic]]).
* ''' [[Kouba, Algeria|Kouba]] ''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Of village, Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers knew after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.
* [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of the city.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Place-emir-abdelkader.jpg|thumb|left|Place emir abdelkader]] -->
* The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the heights of Algiers. These communes shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.
* The street ''' Didouche Mourade ''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the ''' Grande Post office ''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the ''' place Audin ''', ''' the Faculty of Algiers ''', ''' The Crowned Heart ''' and ''' the park of Galland '''. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.

===Climate===
Algiers has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with hot summers and mild winters. Its proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior deserts. The climate of Algiers, like that of other Mediterranean cities, features wet winters and dry summers. Algiers on average receives roughly {{convert|600|mm|in|0}} of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April.

Snow is very rare; in 2012, the city received {{convert|10|cm|in}}, its first snowfall in eight years.<ref>{{cite news |title=European Chill Moves West, 122 Die in Ukraine |first=Richard |last=Balmforth |date=4 February 2012 |work=Reuters |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/04/us-europe-weather-idUSTRE8130NK20120204 }}</ref>

==Local architecture==
[[File:Alger front de mer.jpg|thumb|360px|Algiers waterfront]]
[[File:Algeri04.jpg|thumb|Cosmopolitan Algiers]]

There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole [[Kasbah]] quarter, Martyrs Square (''Sahat ech-Chouhada'' ساحة الشهداء), the government offices (formerly the [[United Kingdom|British]] consulate), the "Grand", "New", and Ketchaoua [[Mosque]]s, the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral of [[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], the [[Bardo National Museum|Bardo Museum]] (a former Turkish mansion), the old ''Bibliothèque Nationale d'Alger''—a [[Turkey|Turkish]] palace built in 1799–1800—and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the [[British Library]].

The main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into [[barracks]], and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a [[minaret]] and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.

The [[Great Mosque of Algiers|Great Mosque]] (''Jamaa-el-Kebir'' الجامع الكبير) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (''[[minbar]]'' منبر) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of [[Tlemcen]], in 1324.<ref name="WDL2">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8764/ |title = Fountain in Mosque of El Kebir, Algiers, Algeria |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1899 |accessdate = 2013-09-24 }}</ref> The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by [[Moors|Moorish]] arches.

The New Mosque (''Jamaa-el-Jedid'' الجامع الجديد), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a [[Greek cross]], surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is {{convert|27|m|0}} high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.

The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the ''rue d'Isly'' near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun باب عزون. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in [[Ireland]], sacked [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]]. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Cité Maison Carré - El Harrach.jpg|thumb|left|Maison Carr]] -->

[[File:Mosquée Ketchaoua.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Ketchaoua Mosque]]
The Ketchaoua mosque (''Djamaa Ketchaoua'' جامع كتشاوة), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a [[portico]] supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of [[Moorish Empire|Moorish]] [[plaster]] work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of [[San Geronimo]]. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles.

Algiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The [[Bardo National Museum|Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunisia]] holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.

The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial—the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of {{convert|95|ha|acre|0}}. An opening in the south [[jetty]] affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by [[Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa]] (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]]. The lighthouse which occupies the site of [[Fort Penon]] was built in 1544.

Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a [[Defensive wall|rampart]], [[parapet]] and [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]], with two terminal forts, [[Bab Azoun]] باب عزون to the south and [[Bab-el-Oued]] باب الواد to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of [[Bouzareah]] بوزريعة (at an elevation of {{convert|396|m|0}} above the sea) took their place.
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Bananiers-mohammadia.jpg|thumb|Mohammedia]] -->
[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], a church built (1858–1872) in a mixture of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the [[Bouzareah]] hills, {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}}
to the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the [[archangel Michael]], belonging to the confraternity of [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fishermen.

[[Villa Abd-el-Tif]], former residence of the [[dey]], was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the [[Abd-el-Tif prize]], among whom [[Maurice Boitel]], for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.

The first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station "Aga" located in the downtown area. Ultramodern, the station, intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.

The second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the {{convert|44|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.
