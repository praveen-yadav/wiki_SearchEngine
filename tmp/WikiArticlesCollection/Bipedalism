'''Bipedalism''' is a form of [[terrestrial locomotion]] where an organism [[Motion (physics)|moves]] by means of its two rear [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]], or [[legs]]. An [[animal]] or [[machine]] that usually moves in a '''bipedal''' manner is known as a '''biped''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|p|ɛ|d}}, meaning "two feet" (from the [[Latin]] ''bi'' for "two" and ''ped'' for "foot"). Types of bipedal movement include [[walking]], [[running]], or [[jumping|hopping]], on two [[appendage]]s (typically [[Leg (anatomy)|legs]]).

Relatively few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. Within [[mammal]]s, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s, [[Kangaroo mouse|kangaroo mice]], [[Dipodidae|dipodids]], [[springhare]],<ref>NC Heglund, GA Cavagna and CR Taylor
 1982 Energetics and mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. III. Energy changes of the centre of mass as a function of speed and body size in birds and mammals Journal of Experimental Biology 97:1</ref> [[hopping mice]], [[pangolin]]s and [[hominina]]n apes, as well as various other extinct groups evolving the trait independently. In the [[Triassic]] period some groups of [[archosaur]]s (a group that includes the  ancestors of [[crocodile]]s) developed bipedalism; among their descendants the [[dinosaur]]s, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the [[bird]]s descended from one group of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs.

A larger number of modern species utilise bipedal movement for a short time. Several non-archosaurian [[lizard]] species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate species, such as [[Gibbon]]s and [[Indriidae|Indriids]], exclusively utilise bipedal locomotion during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. A few animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.

==Definition==
The word is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''bi(s)'' 'two (2)' and ''ped-'' 'foot', as contrasted with [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] 'four feet'.

===Facultative and obligate bipedalism===
Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as "facultative" (i.e. optional) or "obligate" (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut — for example, humans normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary. There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases are a result of conditions such as [[Uner Tan syndrome]] — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior.<ref name="HumphreyEtAl2005HumanHandWalkers">{{cite web | url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/CPNSS/pdf/DP_withCoverPages/DP77/DP7705.pdf | title=Human Hand-Walkers: Five Siblings Who Never Stood Up | author=Humphrey, N., Skoyles, J.R., and Keynes, R. | publisher=Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, London School of Economics | year=2005 |format=PDF}}</ref> Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that "normal" humans can crawl on hands and knees. This article therefore avoids the terms "facultative" and "obligate", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion ''normally'' used by various groups of animals.

==Movement==
There are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism.

# [[Standing]]. Staying still on both legs. In most bipeds this is an active process, requiring constant adjustment of balance.
# [[Walking]]. One foot in front of another, with at least one foot on the ground at any time.
# [[Running]]. One foot in front of another, with periods where both feet are off the ground.
# [[Jumping]]/Hopping. Moving by a series of jumps with both feet moving together.

==Bipedal animals==
The great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds. Among mammals, bipedalism is a normal method of [[Animal locomotion|ground locomotion]] in various groups of [[primate]]s (e.g. [[lemurs]], [[gibbon]]s and [[Hominina]]), in the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s (kangaroos, wallabies, etc.), and in a few groups of rodents, including [[kangaroo rat]]s, [[gerbils]] and [[spring hare]]s. All [[birds]] are bipeds when on the ground, a feature inherited from their [[dinosaur]] ancestors. Bipedalism evolved more than once in [[archosaurs]], the group that includes both dinosaurs and [[crocodilians]].<ref name="Hutchinson2006EvolutionOfLocomotionInArchosaurs">{{cite journal | title=The evolution of locomotion in archosaurs | author=Hutchinson, J.R. | journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol | volume=5 | issue=3–4 | year=2006 | pages=519–530 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X1G-4J6WP8M-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=ff4c612aef14e51e872112989be76277 | doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2005.09.002 }}</ref> Many species of [[lizards]] become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus ''[[Ctenosaura]]''). There are no known living or fossil bipedal amphibians.

Most bipedal animals move with their backs close to horizontal, using a long tail to balance the weight of their bodies. The primate version of bipedalism is unusual because the back is close to upright (completely upright in humans).

Humans, gibbons and large birds [[walking|walk]] by raising one foot at a time.  On the other hand most macropods, smaller birds, lemurs and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously. [[Tree kangaroo]]s are able to utilize either form of locomotion, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground.

===Archosaurs (include birds, crocodiles, and dinosaurs)===
[[Birds]] are bipedal when not flying. All dinosaurs are believed to be descended from a fully bipedal ancestor, perhaps similar to ''[[Eoraptor]]''.  Bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other [[dinosaur]] lineages such as the [[iguanodon]]s. Some extinct members of the [[crocodilian]] line, a sister group to the dinosaurs and birds, also evolved bipedal forms - a [[crocodile]] relative from the [[triassic]], ''[[Effigia okeeffeae]]'', is believed to be bipedal.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0125_060125_crocodile.html | title = Dino-Era Fossil Reveals Two-Footed Croc Relative | last = Handwerk | first = Brian | date=  2006-01-26 | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | publisher = [[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]}}</ref>  [[Pterosaur]]s were previously thought to have been bipedal, but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion.

===Mammals===
Bipedal movement is less common among [[mammal]]s, most of which are [[quadruped]]al. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), [[kangaroo rat]],  [[springhare]] and certain primates such as the [[sifaka]] and [[sportive lemur]] all move bipedally. Very few mammals other than primates commonly move bipedally by an alternating gait rather than hopping. Exceptions are the [[ground pangolin]] and in some circumstances the [[tree kangaroo]].

Many primates can stand upright on their hind legs without any support.

In addition, non-human primates often use bipedal locomotion when carrying food.

===Limited bipedalism in mammals===
Other mammals engage in limited, non-locomotory, bipedalism. A number of other animals, such as [[rat]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and [[beaver]]s will squat on their hindlegs to manipulate some objects but revert to four limbs when moving (the beaver may also move bipedally if transporting wood for their [[Beavers#Dams|dams]]).  [[Bear]]s will fight in a bipedal stance to use their forelegs as weapons.  [[Ground squirrel]]s and [[meerkat]]s will stand on hind legs to survey their surroundings, but will not walk bipedally.  [[Dog]]s can stand or move on two legs if trained, or if birth defect or injury precludes [[quadruped]]alism.  The [[gerenuk]] antelope stands on its hind legs while eating from trees, as did the extinct [[Megatherium|giant ground sloth]]  and [[chalicothere]]s.  The [[spotted skunk]] will also use limited bipedalism when threatened, rearing up on its forelimbs while facing the attacker so its [[anal glands]], capable of spraying an offensive oil, face its attacker.

===Limited bipedalism in non-mammals===
Bipedalism is unknown among the [[amphibian]]s. Among the non-[[archosaur]] [[reptile]]s bipedalism is rare, but it is found in the 'reared-up' running of [[lizard]]s such as [[Agamidae|agamids]] and [[monitor lizard]]s. Many reptile species will also temporarily adopt bipedalism while fighting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wildlifetimes.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=601 | format = php | last = Sharma | first = Jayanth | title = The Story behind the Picture - Monitor Lizards Combat | date=  2007-03-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | publisher = Wildlife Times}}</ref>  One genus of [[Basiliscus (genus)|basilisk lizard]] can run bipedally across the surface of water for some distance.

===Advantages===
Limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages.  Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths.  While upright, non-locomotory [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in giant pangolin), combat (in bears and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage (in certain species of octopus).  The maximum bipedal speed appears less fast than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – the [[ostrich]] reaches speeds of {{convert|65|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and the [[red kangaroo]] {{convert|70|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, while the [[cheetah]] can exceed {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name='Garland_1983_JZL'>{{cite journal|last=Garland|first=T., Jr. |authorlink=Theodore Garland, Jr.|coauthors= |year=1983 |title=The relation between maximal running speed and body mass in terrestrial mammals| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1983_JZL.pdf |journal=Journal of Zoology, London |volume=199 |issue= 2|pages=157–170 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02087.x }}</ref><ref name='Sharp_1997'>{{cite journal|last=Sharp |first=N.C.C.|coauthors= |year=1997 |title=Timed running speed of a [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus'')| url= |journal=Of Zoology, London |volume=241 |issue= 3|pages=493–494 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1997.tb04840.x }}</ref>

==Evolution==
Bipedalism has a number of adaptive advantages, and has evolved independently in a number of lineages.

===Early reptiles and lizards===
The first known biped is the [[bolosaurid]] ''[[Eudibamus]]'' whose fossils date from 290 million years ago.<ref>{{cite news | title = Upright lizard leaves dinosaur standing | date=  2000-11-03 | work = cnn.com | accessdate = 2007-10-17 | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031005956/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/11/03/germany.dinosaur/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}</ref><ref>

The species was extinct before the dinosaurs appeared.

Independent of ''Eudibamus'', some modern lizard species have developed the capacity to run on their hind legs.

===Dinosaurs and birds===
Bipedalism also evolved independently among the dinosaurs. Dinosaurs diverged from their [[archosaur]] ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late [[Triassic]] period, roughly 20 million years after the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 95% of all [life on Earth].<ref>Citation for Permian/Triassic extinction event, percentage of animal species that went extinct.

===Mammals===
A number of mammals will adopt a bipedal stance in specific situations such as for feeding or fighting. A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion - for example humans, [[giant pangolin]]s, the extinct [[Megatheriidae|giant ground sloths]], numerous species of jumping [[rodent]]s and [[Macropodidae|macropod]]s. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied are documented in the next section. Macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago.<ref name="Burk 1998">{{cite journal |last=Burk |first=Angela |coauthors=Michael Westerman and Mark Springer |year=1988 |month=September |title=The Phylogenetic Position of the Musky Rat-Kangaroo and the Evolution of Bipedal Hopping in Kangaroos (Macropodidae: Diprotodontia) |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=457–474 |pmid=12066687 |url=|doi=10.1080/106351598260824 }}</ref>

====Humans====
{{Main|Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism}}
There are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lovejoy, C.O. |title=Evolution of Human walking |journal=Scientific American. |volume=259 |issue=5 |pages=82–89 |year=1988}}</ref> Bipedal specializations are found in ''[[Australopithecus]]'' fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.<ref name="evolutionthe1st4billionyears">{{cite book|title= Evolution: The First Four Billion Years| author=McHenry, H.M | chapter=Human Evolution | editors=Michael Ruse & Joseph Travis | year=2009 | publisher= The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-03175-3 | page=263}}</ref> Recent evidence regarding modern human [[sexual dimorphism]] (physical differences between male and female) in the [[lumbar spine]] has been seen in pre-modern primates such as ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.

This article has good pictures explaining the differences between bipedal and non-bipedal pregnancy loads.</ref> The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still.

Possible reasons for the evolution of human bipedalism include freeing the hands for tool use and carrying, [[sexual dimorphism]] in food gathering, changes in climate and habitat (from [[jungle]] to [[savanna]]) that favored a more elevated eye-position, and to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the tropical sun.

=====Savanna-based theory=====
According to the '''savanna-based theory''', [[hominines]] descended from the trees and adapted to life on the savanna by walking erect on two feet. The theory suggests that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees. In fact, [[Elizabeth Vrba]]’s [[turnover-pulse hypothesis|turnover pulse hypothesis]] supports the savanna-based theory by explaining the shrinking of forested areas due to global warming and cooling, which forced animals out into the open grasslands and caused the need for hominids to acquire bipedality.<ref name="Sunset on the savanna">Shreeve, James, [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/Sunset.Savanna.doc "Sunset on the savanna"], ''Discover'', 1996</ref>

Rather, the bipedal adaptation hominines had already achieved was used in the savanna. The fossil record shows that early bipedal hominines were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. Hominine fossils found in dry grassland environments led anthropologists to believe hominines lived, slept, walked upright, and died only in those environments because no hominine fossils were found in forested areas. However, fossilization is a rare occurrence—the conditions must be just right in order for an organism that dies to become fossilized for somebody to find later, which is also a rare occurrence. The fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there. The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years.<ref>Shreeve, James, [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/Sunset.Savanna.doc "Sunset on the savanna"], ‘’Discover'', 1996</ref>

Some of the fossils found actually showed that there was still an adaptation to arboreal life. For example, [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], the famous ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'', found in Hadar in Ethiopia, which may have been forested at the time of Lucy’s death, had curved fingers that would still give her the ability to grasp tree branches, but she walked bipedally. “[[Little Foot]],” the collection of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' foot bones, has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright. “Little Foot” could grasp things using his feet like an ape, perhaps tree branches, and he was bipedal. Ancient pollen found in the soil in the locations in which these fossils were found suggest that the area used to be covered in thick vegetation and has only recently become the arid desert it is now.<ref name="Sunset on the savanna"/>

=====Traveling efficiency hypothesis=====
An alternative explanation is the mixture of savanna and scattered forests increased terrestrial travel by proto-humans between clusters of trees, and bipedalism offered greater efficiency for long-distance travel between these clusters than quadrupedalism.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Isbell, L.A. and T.P. Young.   |title=The evolution of bipedalism in hominids and reduced group size in chimpanzees: alternative responses to decreasing resource availability |journal=Journal of Human Evolution  |volume=30 |pages=289–297 |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Lewin, Roger; Swisher, Carl Celso; Curtis, Garniss H. |title=Java man: how two geologists' dramatic discoveries changed our understanding of the evolutionary path to modern humans |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-684-80000-4 |doi=}}</ref>

=====Postural feeding hypothesis=====
The postural feeding hypothesis has been recently supported by Dr. Kevin Hunt, a professor at Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they ate. While on the ground, they would reach up for fruit hanging from small trees and while in trees, bipedalism was utilized by grabbing for an overhead branch. These bipedal movements may have evolved into regular habits because they were so convenient in obtaining food. Also, Hunt hypothesises that these movements coevolved with [[chimpanzee]] arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the ''[[Australopithecus]]'' hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to [[humans]]. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture.

=====Provisioning model=====
One theory on the origin of bipedalism is the behavioral model presented by [[Owen Lovejoy (anthropologist)|C. Owen Lovejoy]], known as "male provisioning".<ref name="Price">{{cite book

}}</ref> Lovejoy theorizes that the [[evolution]] of bipedalism was linked to monogamy. In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early [[hominids]] engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring. Lovejoy proposes that male provisioning of food would improve the offspring survivorship and increase the pair's reproductive rate. Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs. This model is supported by the reduction ("feminization") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brunet|first=Michel|coauthors=Guy F, Pilbeam D, Mackaye HT, Likius A et al.|title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa|journal=Nature|date=11|year=2002|month=July|volume=418|pages=145–151|doi=10.1038/nature00879|pmid=12110880|url=http://www.nature.com/nature|issue=6894}}</ref> and ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suwa|first=Gen|coauthors=Kono RT, Simpson SW, Asfaw B, Lovejoy CO, White TD|title=Paleobiological implications of the ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' dentition|journal=Science|date=2|year=2009|month=October|volume=326|pages=94–99|doi=10.1126/science.1175824|pmid=19810195|url=|issue=5949|bibcode = 2009Sci...326...94S }}</ref> which along with low body size dimorphism in ''Ardipithecus''<ref>White TD et al.

Science. 2009 326(5949):74e1-8.</ref> In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of [[sexual swelling]]) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

However, this model has generated some controversy, as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous. Among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size. That is [[sexual dimorphism]] is minimal, and other studies have suggested that [[Australopithecus afarensis]] males were nearly twice the weight of females. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk.<ref>Lovejoy CO. Science. 1981 211(4480):341-50.</ref> Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom<ref>Keith Oatley, Dacher Keltner, Jennifer M. Jenkins. Understanding Emotion (2006) Second Edition. Page 235.</ref> and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as [[gibbon]]s tend to be also territorial, but fossil evidence indicates that ''Australopithecus afarensis'' lived in large groups. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a group living primate.

=====Early bipedalism in homininae model=====
Recent studies of 4.4 million years old  ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' suggest bipedalism, it is thus possible that bipedalism evolved very early in [[homininae]] and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized. According to Richard Dawkins in his book "[[The Ancestor's Tale]]",  chimps and bonobos are descended from ''[[Australopithecus]]'' gracile type species while gorillas are descended from [[Paranthropus]]. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines who eventually became us (see [[Homininae]]). Early [[homininae]]s such as ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'' may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in [[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 19667206 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901280106 | pmc=2732797 | volume=106 | issue=34 | title=Independent evolution of knuckle-walking in African apes shows that humans did not evolve from a knuckle-walking ancestor | year=2009 | month=August | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | pages=14241–6 | author=Kivell TL, Schmitt D|bibcode = 2009PNAS..10614241K }}</ref> and towards efficient walking and running in [[modern humans]] (see figure). It is also proposed that one cause of [[Neanderthal extinction]] was a less efficient running.

=====Warning display (Aposematic) model=====
[[Joseph Jordania]] from the University of Melbourne recently (2011) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on [[aposematism]], or [[warning display]] and [[intimidation]] of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time. Several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal:  upright bipedal posture, longer legs, long tightly coiled hair on the top of the head, [[body painting]], threatening synchronous body movements, loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing/stomping/drumming on external subjects.<ref>[[Joseph Jordania]]. [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011</ref> Slow locomotion and strong body odor (both characteristic for hominids and humans) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators.

=====Other behavioural models=====
There are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism. For example, Wescott (1967) and later Jablonski & Chaplin (1993) suggest that bipedal threat displays could have been the transitional behaviour which led to some groups of apes beginning to adopt bipedal postures more often. Others (''e.g.'' Dart 1925) have offered the idea that the need for more vigilance against predators could have provided the initial motivation. Dawkins (''e.g.'' 2004) has argued that it could have begun as a kind of fashion that just caught on and then escalated through sexual selection. And it has even been suggested (''e.g.'' Tanner 1981:165) that male phallic display could have been the initial incentive.

=====Thermoregulatory model=====
The thermoregulatory model explaining the origin of bipedalism is one of the simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of [[Ardipithecus]] reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the [[forest]] and [[woodland]] environmental [[preadaptation]] of early-stage [[hominid]] bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of [[natural selection]]. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions [[ecological niche]], rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus.

=====Carrying models=====
Charles Darwin wrote that "Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will" Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought. Gordon Hewes (1961) suggested that the carrying of meat "over considerable distances" (Hewes 1961:689) was the key factor. Isaac (1978) and Sinclair et al. (1986) offered modifications of this idea as indeed did Lovejoy (1981) with his 'provisioning model' described above. Others, such as Nancy Tanner (1981) have suggested that infant carrying was key, whilst others have suggested stone tools and weapons drove the change.<ref>Tanner, Nancy Makepeace [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1425592 “ On Becoming Human” ] Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981</ref>

=====Wading Models=====
Several theories have been proposed regarding the influence of water on human bipedalism.  The [[aquatic ape hypothesis]], promoted for several decades by [[Elaine Morgan (writer)|Elaine Morgan]], proposed that swimming, diving and aquatic food sources exerted a strong influence on many aspects of human evolution, including bipedalism.<ref name = Morgan1997>{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Elaine | authorlink = Elaine Morgan (writer) | title = The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis   | year = 1997 | month =  | publisher = Souvenir Press | isbn = 0-285-63518-2  }}</ref>  It is not accepted by or considered a serious theory within the anthropological scholarly community.<ref>{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=0Zim5e65ij4C&pg=PA64 64] | title = Psychology & evolution: the origins of mind | isbn = 0-7619-2479-5 | last = Bridgeman | first = B | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2003 }}</ref><ref name = Meier>{{cite book | last = Meier | first = R | title = The complete idiot's guide to human prehistory | publisher = Alpha Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-02-864421-2 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?doi=r_Wit4KYSmMC&pg=PA57 57–59]}}</ref>

Other theories have been proposed that suggest wading and the exploitation of aquatic food sources (providing essential nutrients for human brain evolution<ref>{{cite book | last = Cunnane | first = Stephen C | title = Survival of the fattest: the key to human brain evolution | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company | year = 2005 | isbn = 981-256-191-9 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=kKNpHN3dDaUC&pg=PA259 259]}}</ref> or critical fallback foods<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wrangham R, Cheney D, Seyfarth R, Sarmiento E |title=Shallow-water habitats as sources of fallback foods for hominins |journal=Am.

Anthropol. |volume=140 |issue=4 |pages=630–42 |year=2009 |month=December |pmid=19890871 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21122 |url=}}</ref>) may have exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors promoting adaptations  which later assisted full-time bipedalism.

==Physiology==
Bipedal movement occurs in a number of ways, and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations. Some of these are described below.

===Biomechanics===

====Standing====
Energy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid [[feedback|overcorrection]].  The difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly, even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness.

====Walking====
Walking is characterized by an "inverted pendulum" movement in which the [[center of gravity]] vaults over a stiff leg with each step.<ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=1sz5501URh0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=macmahon+muscles#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Muscles, reflexes, and locomotion | isbn = 978-0-691-02376-2 | author1 = McMahon | first1 = Thomas A | year = 1984}}</ref>  [[Force plate]]s can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two.<ref name="books.google.com"/>  Interestingly, this model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yMaN9pk8QJAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = A moving topic: control and dynamics of animal locomotion | isbn = 978-0-19-850022-3 | author1 = Biewener | first1 = Andrew A | year = 2003 | pmid = 20410030 | last2 = Daniel | first2 = T | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–8 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2010.0294 | pmc = 2880073 | journal = Biology Letters}}</ref>

In humans, walking is composed of several separate processes:<ref name="books.google.com"/>
* Vaulting over a stiff stance leg
* Passive ballistic movement of the swing leg
* A short 'push' from the ankle prior to toe-off, propelling the swing leg
* Rotation of the hips about the axis of the spine, to increase stride length
* Rotation of the hips about the horizontal axis to improve balance during stance

====Running====
Running is characterized by a spring-mass movement.<ref name="books.google.com"/>  Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact.<ref name="books.google.com"/>  Again, the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Musculature===
Bipedalism requires strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs. Contrast in [[domestication|domesticated]] [[poultry]] the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings. Likewise in humans, the [[quadriceps]] and [[hamstring]] muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is much larger than the well-developed biceps of the arms.

===Respiration===
A biped also has the ability to breathe while it runs. Humans usually take a breath every other stride when their [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] system is functioning. During a sprint, at which point the anaerobic system kicks in, breathing slows until the [[lactic acid fermentation|anaerobic]] system can no longer sustain a sprint.

==Bipedal robots==
{{Main|Humanoid robot|Chicken walker}}
[[Image:Asimo.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[ASIMO]] - a bipedal robot]]
For nearly the whole of the 20th century, bipedal [[robot]]s were very difficult to construct and [[robot locomotion]] involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible. Some notable biped robots are [[ASIMO]], [[HUBO]] and [[QRIO]].  Recently, spurred by the success of creating a fully passive, un-powered bipedal walking robot,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/hplab/pdw.html |title=Passive Dynamic Walking at Cornell |publisher=Ruina.tam.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion, which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption.
