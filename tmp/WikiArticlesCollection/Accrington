'''Accrington''' is a town in the [[Hyndburn]] borough of [[Lancashire]], England. It lies about {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of [[Blackburn]], {{convert|6|mi|0}} west of [[Burnley]], {{convert|20|mi|0}} north of [[Manchester city centre]] and is situated on the mostly [[culvert]]ed [[River Hyndburn]]. Commonly abbreviated by locals to "'''Accy'''",<ref>{{cite web|url= http://menmedia.co.uk/accringtonobserver/sport/football/accrington_stanley/s/1418758_accys-easter-rising|title=Accy's Easter Rising|publisher=MEN Media - Accrington Observer|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> the town has a population of 35,203 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] and the urban area has a population of over 70,000.

Accrington is a former centre of the cotton and textile machinery industries. The town is famed for manufacturing the hardest and densest building bricks in the world, [[Accrington brick|"The Accrington NORI" (iron)]], which were used in the construction of the [[Empire State Building]] and for the foundations of [[Blackpool Tower]]; famous for [[Accrington Stanley F.C.]] and the [[Haworth Art Gallery]] which holds Europe's largest collection of [[Tiffany Glass]].

== History ==
The name '''Accrington''' appears to be Anglo-Saxon in origin. Its derivation is very simple; There used to be a ring of acorn trees around the area which became Accrington, 'Acc' from the acorn trees, 'ring' the shape the trees used to be around the 'ton' or town. Put those together makes Acc-ring-ton.

In the records it variously appears as ''Akarinton'' in 1194; ''Akerunton'', ''Akerinton'' and ''Akerynton'' in 1258; ''Acrinton'' in 1292; ''Ackryngton'' in 1311 and ''Acryngton'' in 1324.<ref name="Names">{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft#page/89/mode/1up|title=Accrington|work=Place Names of Lancashire|author=Ellert Ekwall|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>

The name may mean ''acorn farmstead'' from [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''æcern'' meaning ''acorn'' and ''tun'' meaning ''farmstead'' or ''village''.<ref name=Names /> The southern part of Accrington, the township of New Accrington, was formerly in the Forest of Blackburnshire and the presence of oak trees may be inferred from local place names like Broad Oak and Oak Hill. The products of oak trees were once an important food for swine and a farmstead may have been named for such produce.<ref name=Names /> [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]]  ''ᴁcerntun'' might become [[Middle English]] ''Akerenton'', ''Akerinton'' and the like.<ref name=Names /> Also worth considering is that in the Lancashire dialect  ''acorn'' was ''akran''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7247738M/A_glossary_of_the_Lancashire_dialect|title=A Glossary of the Lancashire Dialect|publisher=Open Library|accessdate=17 June 2011}}</ref>

There is no known Old English personal name from which the first element can be derived. But if the Frisian names ''Akkrum'', ''Akkeringa'' and Dutch name ''Akkerghem'', are derived from the personal name ''Akker'' there may be a corresponding Old English name from which ''Accrington'' may be derived.<ref name=Names />

The town we now call Accrington covers two [[Township (England)|townships]] which were established in 1507 following disafforestation; those of Old Accrington and New Accrington which were merged in 1878 with the incorporation of the borough council.<ref name=BHO>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53146|title='Townships: Old and New Accrington'; A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 6|publisher=William Farrer & J. Brownbill|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> There have been settlements there since the medieval period, likely in the Grange Lane and Black Abbey area,<ref name=BHO /><ref name="Assessment">{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/documents/historictowns/AccringtonComplete_LowRes.pdf|title=Accrington Historic Town Assessment report|publisher=Lancashire County Council and Egerton Lea Consultancy  with the support of English Heritage and Hyndburn Borough Council |accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> and the King's Highway which passes above the town was at one time used by the kings and queens of England when they used the area for hunting when the [[Royal forest|Forest of Accrington]] was one of the four forests of the [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] of [[Blackburnshire]]. 

[[Robert de Lacy]] gave the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Accrington to the monks of [[Kirkstall Abbey|Kirkstall]] in the 12th century. The monks built a [[Monastic grange|grange]] there; removing the inhabitants to make room for it. The locals got their revenge by setting fire to the new building, destroying its contents and in the process killing the three lay brothers who occupied it.<ref name=BHO /> An area of the town is named 'Black Abbey' a possible reference to the murders. Regardless of whatever happened Accrington did not remain under monastic control for long before reverting to the [[de Lacy]]s. 

It is thought the monks of Kirkstall may have built a small chapel there during their tenure for the convenience of those in charge residing there and their tenants, but the records are uncertain.<ref name=BHO /> What is known is that there was a chapel in Accrington prior to 1553 <ref name=BHO /> where the vicar of Whalley was responsible for the maintenance of divine worship. However it did not have its own minister and it was served, when at all, by the curate of one of the adjacent chapels. In 1717 Accrington was served by the curate of Church, who preached there only once a month.<ref name=BHO /> St. James's Church was built in 1763, replacing the old chapel<ref name=BHO /> however it did not achieve parochial status until as late as 1870.<ref name=Assessment />  

Until around 1830 visitors considered Accrington to be just a "considerable village".<ref name=BHO /> The [[Industrial Revolution]], however, resulted in large changes and Accrington’s location on the confluence of a number of streams made it attractive to industry and a number of mills were built in the town in the mid-eighteenth century. Further industrialisation then followed in the late eighteenth century and local landowners began building mansions in the area on the outskirts of the settlement where their mills were located while their employees lived in overcrowded unsanitary conditions in the centre.<ref name=Assessment />

Industrialisation resulted in rapid population growth during the nineteenth century, as people moved from over north-west England to Accrington,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/PDF/LPS30/LPS30_1983_28-34.pdf|title=Patterns of Migration of Textile Workers into Accrington in the Nineteenth Century|publisher=William Turner|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> with the population increasing from 3,266 in 1811 to 10,376 in 1851 to 43,211 in 1901<ref name=Assessment /> to its peak in 1911 at 45,029.<ref name=Frith>{{Cite book|author=H Barrett & C Duckworth|title=Accrington Old & New|publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd|year=2004|isbn=1-85937-806-4}}</ref> 

This fast population growth and slow response from the [[Church of England|established church]] allowed [[nonconformism|non-conformism]] to flourish in the town. By the mid-nineteenth century there were Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist, United Free Methodist, Congregationalist, Baptist, Swedenborgian, Unitarian, Roman Catholic and Catholic Apostolic churches in the town.<ref name=BHO /> The [[Swedenborgian Church|Swedenborgian church]] was so grand that it was considered to be the ‘Cathedral’ of that denomination.<ref name=Frith />

For many decades the textiles industry, the engineering industry and coal mining were the central activities of the town. [[Cotton mills]] and [[dye]] works provided work for the inhabitants; but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers over wages and working conditions. On 24 April 1826 over 1,000 men and women, many armed, gathered at Whinney Hill in Clayton-le-Moors to listen to a speaker from where they marched on Sykes’s Mill at Higher Grange Lane, near the site of the modern police station and Magistrate’s Courts, and smashed over 60 looms. These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm|title=Cotton Times|publisher=Doug Peacock|accessdate=17 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110604221023/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm| archivedate= 4 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Turner|first=William|title=Riot!

In the 1842 [[1842 General Strike|'plug riots']]  a [[general strike]] spread from town to town due to conditions in the town. In a population of 9,000 people as few as 100 were fully employed.<ref>"An alarming statement of distress", the Newcastle Courant, 1 July 1842</ref> From the 15 August 1842 the situation boiled over and bands of men entered the mills which were running and stopped the machinery by knocking out the boiler plugs.

In the early 1860s the [[Lancashire cotton famine]] badly affected Accrington, although less so than the wider area due to its more diverse economy,<ref>"The Distress in Lancashire", The Leeds Mercury, 25 October 1862</ref> with as many as half of the town's mill employees out of work at one time.<ref>"State of Employment", The Preston Guardian, 3 December 1864</ref>

Conditions were such that a Local Board of Health was constituted in 1853 and the town itself incorporated in 1878 allowing the enforcement of local laws to improve the town.<ref name=BHO /><ref name=Assessment />

=== Accrington Pals ===
{{Further2|[[Recruitment to the British Army during World War I]]}}

One well-known association the town has is with the '[[Accrington Pals]]', the nickname given to the smallest home town [[battalion]] of volunteers formed to fight in [[World War I|the first world war]]. The [[Pals battalion]]s were a peculiarity of the 1914-18 war: [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th [[East Lancashire Regiment]]': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was actually composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other east [[Lancashire]] towns such as [[Burnley]], [[Blackburn]] and [[Chorley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pals.org.uk/pals_e.htm|title=The Accrington Pals|first=Andrew C|last=Jackson|year=2009|accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref>

The Pals' first day of action, Saturday 1 July 1916, took place in [[Serre (Somme)|Serre]] in the north of France. It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]) that was intended to force the [[German Army]] into a retreat from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed and a further 350 wounded &mdash; more than half of the battalion &mdash; within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, [[First day on the Somme|in a disastrous day]] for the British Army (approximately 19,000 British soldiers were killed in a single day).

Later in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers &mdash; in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during [[World War I]]. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The [[cenotaph]] also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from [[World War II]].

After [[World War I]] and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining. The mudguards were painted black as a sign of mourning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Demography==
The 2001 census gave the population of Accrington town as 35,203. The figure for the urban area was 71,224, up 1.1% from 70,442 in 1991. This total includes Accrington, [[Church, Lancashire|Church]], [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Great Harwood]] and [[Oswaldtwistle]]. For comparison purposes that is approximately the same size as [[Aylesbury]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Guildford]] or [[Scunthorpe]] urban areas.

The borough of [[Hyndburn]] as a whole has a population of 81,496. This includes Accrington Urban Area and other outlying towns and villages such as; [[Altham, Lancashire|Altham]], [[Baxenden]], part of [[Belthorn]], [[Huncoat]], [[Rishton]] and Stanhill.

==Economy==
The centre of Accrington is located around a pedestrianised street called Broadway with shops on both sides, which connects Blackburn Road to Whalley Road. On one side of Broadway forms part of a shopping centre called the Accrington [[Arndale Centre|Arndale]], which consists of 52 retail units, and was opened in 1987.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/local-news/accrington-arndale-centre-struggling-to-attract-1294538|title=Arndale centre struggling to attract chains|first=Alex|last=Bell|date=2013-02-01|accessdate=2013-04-14|newspaper=Accrington Observer|publisher=MEN Media}}</ref> The markets, with indoor and outdoor stalls, are on Blackburn Road next to the Town Hall. 

The indoor market was opened in 1869 and the Market Hall is now a [[listed building]]; in 2010 it was refurbished and the following year it was named as best indoor market in a [[National Association of British Market Authorities]] competition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/8241617.Accrington_market_hall_s___2m_revamp_unveiled/|title=Accrington market hall's £2m revamp unveiled|first=Emma|last=Cruces|newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph|publisher=Newsquest (North West)|date=2010-06-27|accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/8823166.Accrington_market_scoops_national_award/|title=

The outdoor market, with 37 stalls, is next to it and opens on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10295920.Fears_Accrington_market_on_brink_of_collapse/|title=Fears Accrington market on brink of collapse|first=Emma|last=Cruces|newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph|publisher=Newsquest (North West)|date=2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref> Near the town centre there is the Eastgate Retail Park.

Formerly cotton and textile machinery were important industries in the town. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Accrington brick]]s, a type of iron hard engineering brick, were produced nearby in [[Huncoat]].

==Geography==
{{expand section|date=November 2009}}
Accrington is a hill town located at the western edge of the Pennines within a bowl and largely encircled by surrounding hills to heights of 300-400m. The Hyndburn or Accrington Brook flows through the centre of the town. Hill settlements origins were as the economic foci of the district engaging in the spinning and weaving of woollen cloth. Wool, lead and coal were other local industries.
Geographical coordinates: 53° 46' 0" North, 2° 21' 0" West. Height above sea level: there is a spot height outside the Market Hall which is 133.5m; the bench mark on the side of the neighbouring Town Hall is 441.10 feet.

==Transport==
The town has strong local travel links as [[Accrington railway station]] lies on the [[East Lancashire Line]] serving trains running locally and trains running from [[Blackpool]] to [[York]]. However, recent changes to the train timetables have been a disservice to Accrington, increasing the journey time to Preston (a vital link to London or Scotland) by up to 1.5 hours. However, there are still buses to Manchester every thirty minutes as well as more frequent services to other towns in east Lancashire.  The main road running through the town centre is the [[A680 road|A680]] running from [[Rochdale]] to [[Whalley, Lancashire|Whalley]]. The town is served by junction seven of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] and is linked from the A680 and the [[A56 road|A56]] [[dual carriageway]] which briefly merge; linking to the [[M66 motorway]] heading towards Manchester. The closest airports are [[Manchester Airport]] at {{convert|27|mi}}, [[Blackpool Airport]] at {{convert|28|mi}} and [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] at {{convert|30|mi}}.

There was once a rail link south to Manchester via [[Haslingden]] and [[Bury]], but this was closed in the 1960s as part of cuts following the [[Beeching Report]]. The trackbed from Accrington to [[Baxenden]] is now a linear treelined cycleway/footpath. A train service to Manchester via the Todmorden Curve on the [[Caldervale Line]] is planned to start in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10388550.New_Manchester_route_will_revitalise_Burnley_branch_station/|title=New Manchester route will revitalise Burnley branch station|first=Peter|last=Magill|newspaper=Lancashire Telegraph|publisher=Newsquest (North West)|date=2013-04-30|accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

Bus operators Pilkington Bus and M & M Coaches are based in Accrington, and Holmeswood Coaches, [[Rossendale Transport|Rossendalebus]] and [[Transdev]] subsidiaries [[Burnley & Pendle]] and [[Lancashire United]] also provide bus services in the town; routes serve places such as [[Blackburn]], [[Oswaldtwistle]], [[Rishton]], [[Burnley]] and [[Clitheroe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/viewdoc.asp?id=49729|title=Bus map & guide: Your Guide to Services throughout Accrington & Surrounding Area|publisher=Lancashire County Council|month=November|year=2010|accessdate=2013-04-14}}</ref>

==Social==

===Governance===
Accrington is represented in parliament as a part of the constituency of Hyndburn. Note that the constituency boundaries do not align exactly with those of the district of the same name.

Accrington was first represented nationally after the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] by [[Accrington (UK Parliament constituency)]]. This seat was abolished in the 1983 general election and replaced with the present constituency of [[Hyndburn (UK Parliament constituency)]].

Hyndburn consists of 16 wards of 35 councillors. Due to its size Accrington is represented by a number of wards in the Borough of [[Hyndburn]]. The town largely consists of the Milnshaw, Peel, Central, Barnfield and Spring Hill wards, although some parts of those wards are in other towns in the borough.

Accrington became incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1878. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], since 1974, the town has formed part of the larger Borough of [[Hyndburn]] including the former [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]]s of [[Oswaldtwistle]], [[Church, Lancashire|Church]], [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Great Harwood]] and [[Rishton]].

[[Image:Blackburn-Rd-Regeneration.jpg|thumb|left|Accrington Acorn PHCC under construction]]

===Health===
The local [[hospital]] is Accrington Victoria Hospital however, as it only deals with minor issues, [[Accident and Emergency|A&E]] is provided by the Royal Blackburn Hospital. Other services are provided at the Accrington Pals Primary Health Care Centre and the Accrington Acorn Primary Health Care Centre. Some wards in Accrington rank amongst the most deprived in terms of healthcare and life expectancy in the country. According to the 1991 census 28% of houses in the borough were considered 'unfit', chiefly those in Accrington and Church. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} A current urban regeneration scheme, Elevate East Lancashire, is attempting to remedy these problems.

===Media===

The chief publications in the area are the ''Accrington Observer'', part of [[Manchester Evening News|MEN media]], and the ''Lancashire Telegraph''.

== Sport ==
The town's other famous association is with [[Accrington Stanley F.C.]],<ref>[http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/ Accrington Stanley F.C.]</ref> the butt of many (largely affectionate) jokes.  The club's name is often invoked as a symbol of British sport's legion of plucky but hopeless causes.

The club entered the [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1921 with the formation of the old [[Third Division (North)]]; after haunting the lower reaches of English football for forty years, they eventually resigned from the League in 1962, due to financial problems, and folded in 1965. The club was reformed three years later and then worked its way through the non-league divisions to reach the [[Football Conference|Nationwide Conference]] in 2003. In the 2005&ndash;06 season, Stanley, after winning against [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] with 3 matches to spare, secured a place back in the [[The Football League|Football League]] and the town celebrated with a small parade and honours placed on senior executives of the team. Coincidentally, one of the teams relegated&mdash;and thus being replaced by Stanley&mdash;were [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], who were voted into the Football League to replace the previous Accrington Stanley. The football stadium is called the Crown Ground. Until the 2012-13 season, when [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]] entered the league, Accrington was the smallest town in [[England and Wales]] with a [[Football League]] club.<ref>[http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/FootballTeams/FootballTeamsTable5.asp Towns Represented in League Two 2007-8]</ref>

Accrington Stanley Football Club has officially had its own [[Public house|pub]] in the town, the Crown, since July 2007.<ref>[http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/index.php/commercial/crown http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/index.php/commercial/crown] ''Accringtonstanley.co.uk''</ref>

The club was ridiculed during the 1980s with a [[milk]] [[Television advertisement|advert]] on television, in which a young boy boasted that [[Ian Rush]] had told him that "if [he] didn't drink lots of milk, when [he] [grew] up, [he'd] [[Accrington Stanley, Who Are They?|only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley]]".<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieK7b4KLL4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieK7b4KLL4] ''Youtube.com''</ref>

An earlier club, [[Accrington F.C.]], were one of the twelve founder members of the [[Football League]] in 1888. However, their time in league football was even less successful and considerably briefer than that of Accrington Stanley: they dropped out of the league in 1893 and folded shortly afterwards due to financial problems. The town of Accrington thus has the unique "distinction" of having lost two separate clubs from league football.

Local Swimming Club Pioneer 79 is based in the area and uses Acrrington Swimming Pool.<ref>[http://www.pioneer79.org.uk/aboutus.php] ''Pioneer 79''</ref> The club coaches a broad spectrum of age groups, including local swimmer Niamh Robinson who is sponsored by local company [[TP Properties]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://menmedia.co.uk/accringtonobserver/sport/s/1490584_stroke-of-luck-for-swim-star-niamh-robinson.html | title=Stroke of luck for swim star Niamh Robinson }}</ref>

== Tiffany Glass ==
The Haworth Art Gallery<ref>[http://www.hyndburnbc.gov.uk/hag Haworth Art Gallery]</ref> in Accrington contains an outstanding collection of [[Tiffany glass]]ware presented to the town by Joseph Briggs, an Accrington man who had joined [[Tiffany & Co|Tiffany’s]] in the late 19th century and eventually became art director and assistant manager. The [[Art Nouveau]] vases are considered to be the most important such group in Europe. One of the most striking items is a glass mosaic exhibition piece, designed by Briggs himself and entitled "''Sulphur Crested Cockatoos''".
