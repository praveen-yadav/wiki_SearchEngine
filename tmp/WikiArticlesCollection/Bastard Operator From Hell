The '''Bastard Operator From Hell''' ('''BOFH'''), a [[fictional character]] created by [[Simon Travaglia]], is a rogue [[system administrator]] who takes out his anger on [[user (computing)|user]]s (often referred to as [[luser]]s), colleagues, bosses, and anyone else who pesters him with their pitiful user created "problems".

The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to [[Usenet]] by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in [[Datamation]].<ref>{{cite web

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any [[system administrator]] who displays (or wishes he could get away with) the qualities of the original.<ref>{{cite book|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond |title=The new hacker's dictionary|isbn=978-0-262-68092-9|year=1996|publisher=The MIT Press|page=80}}</ref> The term has become common [[Internet slang]]. 

In the stories, the PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) is the BOFH's assistant; this too has become a general term for a junior or trainee system administrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PFY|title=Urban Dictionary: PFY}}</ref>

Early BOFH editions took place in a university, moving on to an office workplace over time (an exact transition is not given). BOFH 2k began with the BOFH and PFY moving to a new company.

==Characters==

The following characters appear regularly :

* The BOFH (real name of Simon). Loves 'his' system, and hates the users, who he believes are intent on breaking it. Faked his death in order to take an extended holiday, twice, with great success.
* The PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) (real name of Stephen<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/05/bofh_2010_episode_15/|title=BOFH: You just can't go around killing people (The Register)}}</ref>) (BOFH's assistant, 1996–) Possesses a similar temperament to the BOFH, and is often found either teaming up with and/or plotting against him.
* The Boss (often portrayed as having no IT knowledge whatsoever yet believes otherwise, changes throughout the stories as successive bosses are sacked, leave, are committed, or have nasty "accidents")
* "[[Beancounter]]s" aka [[accountant]]s (disposable, interchangeable, faceless, used on occasion as balls in a game of "blackout fire-alarm beancounter pinball")
* The [[CEO]] — The PFY's uncle Brian from 1996 until 2000, when the BOFH and PFY moved on to a new company. Generally on good terms with the BOFH, if only because both parties like to keep their jobs safe
* The Head of [[Information technology|IT]], almost as disposable as the Boss, slightly more intelligent.
* "[[Help desk|Helldesk]] Operators" (disposable, interchangeable, faceless)
* The Boss's Secretary, Sharon. Has stayed in the company during many changes of bosses. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
* [[Security]] (who will tape ''[[Emmerdale]]'' over [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] video tapes; useless with computers)
* George, the cleaner (invaluable source of information, often referred to as the "Alfred" to the BOFH and PFY)
* Sam, the janitor (scapegoat)
* Ron, the electrician (Mad Ron the Sparky, often electrocuted, possibly deceased)
* Engineers, from various suppliers (often shown as having no idea what they are doing, often used as scapegoats)
* The 'Coloured Crayon' Department — the users of [[Macintosh|Apple Macs]] for [[graphic design]]
* Code Hacks — Programmers
