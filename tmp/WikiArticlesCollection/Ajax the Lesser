'''Ajax''' ({{lang-grc|Αἴας}}) was a [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] hero, son of [[Oileus]], the king of [[Locris]].  He was called the "lesser" or "Locrian" Ajax,<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' ii. 527</ref> to distinguish him from [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax the Great]], son of [[Telamon]]. He was the leader of the [[Locrians|Locrian]] contingent during the [[Trojan War]].  He is a significant figure in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and is also mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]''<ref name="DGRBM">{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link =   | contribution = Ajax (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 87–88  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0096.html }}</ref> and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. In [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan legend]], he was known as ''Aivas Vilates''.

==Mythology==
His mother's name was [[Eriopis]].  According to [[Strabo]], he was born in Naryx in [[Locris]],<ref>[[Strabo]], ix. p. 425</ref> where [[Ovid]] calls him ''Narycius Heroes''.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiv. 468</ref>  According to the ''[[Iliad]]'',<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' ii. 527, &c.</ref> he led his [[Locrians]] in forty ships against [[Troy]].<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 97 gives the number of ships as twenty</ref>  He is described as one of the great heroes among the Greeks. When the grammatical dual form of Ajax is used in the ''[[Iliad]]'', it was once believed that it indicated the lesser Ajax fighting side-by-side with Telamonian [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], but now it is generally thought that that usage refers to the Greater Ajax and his brother [[Teucer]]. In battle, he wore a [[linen]] [[cuirass]] ({{lang|grc|λιμνοθώρηξ}}), was brave and intrepid, especially skilled in throwing the spear and, next to [[Achilles]], the swiftest of all the Greeks.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' xiv. 520, &c., xxiii. 789, &c.</ref>

In the funeral games at the [[pyre]] of [[Patroclus]], he contended with [[Odysseus]] and [[Antilochus]] for the prize in the footrace; but [[Athena]], who was hostile towards him and favored Odysseus, made him stumble and fall, so that he won only the second prize.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' (xxiii. 754), &c.</ref> On his return from Troy, his vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks ({{lang|grc|Γυραὶ πέτραι}}), but he himself escaped upon a rock through the assistance of [[Poseidon]] and would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he said that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. In punishment for this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his [[trident]] and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea.<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 499, &c.</ref>

In later traditions, this Ajax is called a son of Oileus and the [[nymph]] Rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of Helen.<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 81, 97</ref><ref>''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 10. § 8</ref> After the taking of Troy, it is said he rushed into the temple of Athena, where [[Cassandra]] had taken refuge, and was embracing the statue of the goddess in [[supplication]]. Ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives.<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' ii. 403</ref><ref>[[Euripides]], ''Troad.'' 70, &c.</ref><ref>''Dict. Cret.'' v. 12</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 116</ref>  According to some writers, he even raped Cassandra inside the temple.<ref>[[Tryphiodorus]], 635</ref><ref>[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], xiii. 422</ref><ref>[[Lycophron]], 360, with the [[Scholion]]</ref> Odysseus, at least, accused him of this crime and Ajax was to be stoned to death, but saved himself by establishing his innocence with an oath.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' x. 26. § 1, 31. § 1</ref>  The whole charge was sometimes said to have been an invention of [[Agamemnon]], who wanted to have Cassandra for himself.

Whether or not the accusation that Ajax raped Cassandra was true, Athena still had cause to be indignant, as Ajax had dragged a supplicant from her temple.  According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until [[Calchas]], the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide in the altar of an unnamed deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices Athena became so angry that she persuaded [[Zeus]] to send a storm that sank many of their ships. When Ajax finally left Troy, Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt, but Ajax still survived, managing to cling onto a rock. He boasted that even the gods could not kill him and [[Poseidon]], upon hearing this, split the rock with his trident, causing Ajax to eventually drown. [[Thetis]] buried him when the corpse washed up on Myconos.<ref>Apollodore, R. Scott Smith, Stephen Trzaskoma, and Hygin. Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2007. 84-85. "5.24-6.6." Print.</ref> Other versions depict a different death for Ajax, showing him dying when on his voyage home. In these versions, when Ajax came to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of [[Euboea]], his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax.<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref>comp. [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 40, &c., xi. 260</ref>

After his death his spirit dwelt in the island of [[Leuce (island)|Leuce]].<ref name="paus319">[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' iii. 19. § 11</ref> The [[Opuntian Locris|Opuntian]] Locrians worshiped Ajax as their national hero, and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle, they always left one place open for him, believing that, although invisible to them, he was fighting for and among them.<ref name="paus319" /><ref>[[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] ''Narrations'' 18</ref>  The story of Ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists, and the hero who appears on some Locrian coins with the helmet, shield, and sword is probably this Ajax.<ref>Théodore Edme Mionnet, No. 570, &c.</ref>

Other accounts of his death are offered by [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] and the [[scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]].<ref>[[Philostratus]], ''Her.'' viii. 3</ref><ref>[[Scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]] ''l. c.''</ref>

==Art==
The abduction of Cassandra by Ajax was frequently represented in [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek]] works of art, for instance on the chest of [[Cypselus]] described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and in extant works.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 17</ref>
