'''Bison''' are large, [[even-toed ungulate]]s in the genus ''Bison'' within the subfamily [[Bovinae]].

There are two [[extant taxon|extant]] and four [[extinction|extinct]] species recognized. Of the four extinct species, three were North American: ''[[Bison antiquus]]'', ''[[Bison latifrons|B. latifrons]]'', and ''[[Bison occidentalis|B. occidentalis]]''. The fourth, ''[[Steppe Wisent|Bison priscus]]'', ranged across [[steppe]] environments from Western Europe, through Central Asia, and onto North America.

There are two surviving species: the [[American bison]], ''Bison bison'', found only in North America, is the most numerous. (It is only distantly related to the [[African buffalo|buffalo]].) The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the [[plains bison]], ''Bison bison bison'', and the [[wood bison]], ''Bison bison athabascae'', which is the namesake of [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in [[Canada]]. The [[European bison]] ''Bison bonasus'', or wisent is found in Europe and the [[Caucasus]], re-introduced after being extinct in the wild.

While all bison species are usually grouped into their own [[genus]], they are sometimes included in the closely related genus ''[[Bos]]'',<ref>''Systematic relationships in the Bovini (Artiodactyla, Bovidae)''.

==Description==
[[File:Bison on plaque Bedeilhac grottoe Ariege.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Magdalenian]] bison on plaque, 17,000–9,000 BCE, [[Bédeilhac]] grottoe, [[Ariège]].]]

The [[American bison]] and the [[European bison|European wisent]] are the largest terrestrial animals in North America and Europe. Bison are good swimmers and can cross rivers over half a mile (1&nbsp;km) wide. Bison are nomadic [[Grazing|grazers]] and travel in [[herd]]s. The bulls leave the herds of females at two or three years of age, and join a male herd which is generally smaller than the female herds. Mature bulls rarely travel alone.  Towards the end of the summer, for the reproductive season, the sexes necessarily commingle.<ref name="headsmashedin">{{cite book |url=http://www.aupress.ca/books/120137/ebook/99Z_Brink_2008-Imagining_Head_Smashed_In.pdf |title=Imagining Head-Smashed-In: Aboriginal Buffalo Hunting on the Northern Plains |last=Brink |first=Jack W. |publisher=Athabasca University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-897425-09-1}}</ref> American bison are known for living in the [[Great Plains]]. Both species were hunted close to [[extinction]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since rebounded. The American plains bison is no longer listed as [[endangered]], but the wood bison is on the endangered species list in Canada.<ref>{{cite web

Although superficially similar, there are a number of physical and behavioural differences between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five.<ref>''The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'' by Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain), published by C. Knight, 1835</ref> (The difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra in wisent has ribs attached to it in American bison and is thus counted as the 15th thoracic vertebra, compared to 14 thoracic vertebrae in wisent.) Adult American bison are less slim in build and have shorter legs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trophy Bowhunting: Plan the Hunt of a Lifetime and Bag One for the Record Books |last=Sapp |first=Rick |edition=illustrated |publisher=Stackpole |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8117-3315-1}}</ref> American bison tend to graze more, and [[Browsing (herbivory)|browse]] less than their European cousins. Their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference; the American bison's head hangs lower than the European's. The body of the American bison is typically hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison, which favours butting.<ref>{{cite book |title=American Bison: A Natural History |last=Lott |first=Dale F. |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-24062-9}}</ref> American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Notice of the Various Species of Bovine Animals |editor=Newman, Edward |journal=The Zoologist |year=1859 |volume=17 |page=6362 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KbwtAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA6362&lpg=PA6362&dq=Zoologist:+A+Monthly+Journal+of+Natural+History+bison&source=bl&ots=0AxGurhp2N&sig=mqDPuwezuRDEFzh_7bA1hL2AyYw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eYY_UsWBKYS8iwKNs4CADg&ved=0CE0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Zoologist%3A%20A%20Monthly%20Journal%20of%20Natural%20History%20bison&f=false}}</ref>

==Evolution and genetic history==

The bovine family (Taurids and Bisonids) diverged from the common ancestral line with water buffalo and African buffalo about 5 to 10 million years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/7/1165.full |title=Maternal and Paternal Lineages in Cross-Breeding Bovine Species. Has Wisent a Hybrid Origin? |publisher=Mbe.oxfordjournals.org |date=2004-01-22 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>  Thereafter, the family lineage of bison and taurine cattle does not appear to be a straightforward "tree" structure as is often depicted in much evolution, because there is evidence of interbreeding and crossbreeding between different species and members within this family, even many millions of years after their ancestors separated into different species.  This crossbreeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as yak being related to American bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent.

A 2003 study of mitochondrial DNA indicated four distinct maternal lineages in tribe ''[[Bovini]]'':
#Taurine [[cattle]] and [[zebu]],
#Wisent,
#American bison and [[yak]],<ref name=Guo2006>{{cite journal | author1 = Guo, S. |author2=Liu, J. |author3=Qi, D. |author4=Yang, J. |author5=Zhao, X. |year = 2006 | title = Taxonomic placement and origin of yaks: implications from analyses of mtDNA D-loop fragment sequences | journal = Acta Theriologica Sinica | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | url=http://english.mammal.cn/Magazine/show.aspx?id=2079 | pages = 325–330}}</ref> and

The [[Steppe bison]] (''Bison priscus'') diverged from the lineage that led to cattle (''Bos taurus'') approximately 2 to 5 million years ago. The Bison genus is clearly in the fossil record by 2 million years ago.<ref name="McDonald, J. 1981">McDonald, J., 1981. ''North American Bison, Their classification and Evolution''. University of California Press, Berkeley, Los Angeles, London.</ref> The Steppe bison spread across Eurasia and was the bison that was pictured in the ancient cave drawings of Spain and Southern France.

The European bison or wisent arose from the Steppe bison, without fossil evidence of other ancestral species between the Steppe bison and the European bison, though the European bison might have arisen from the lineage that led to American bison if that lineage backcrossed with the Steppe bison.  Again, the web of relationships is confusing, but there is some evidence that the European bison is descended from bison that had migrated from Asia to North America, and then back to Europe, where they crossbred with existing Steppe bison.<ref name="McDonald, J. 1981"/>

At one point, some Steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak.  After that crossbreeding, a population of Steppe bison (''Bison priscus'') crossed the [[Bering Land Bridge]] to North America.  There is evidence of multiple crossings of bison to and from Asia starting before 500,000 years ago and continuing until at least 220,000 years ago.  The Steppe bison spread through the northern parts of North America and lived in Eurasia until approximately 11,000 years ago<ref>Guthrie, R. D., 1990. ''Frozen Fauna of the Mammoth Steppe: the Story of Blue Babe''. University of Chicago Press: Chicago.</ref> and North America until 4,000 to 8,000 years ago.<ref name="McDonald, J. 1981"/>

''[[Bison latifrons]]'' (the "giant" or "longhorn" bison) is thought to have evolved in midcontinent North America from ''B. priscus'', after the Steppe bison crossed into North America.<ref name="Belletal.2004">{{cite book | author1=Bell, C.J. |author2=Lundelius, E.L.|author3=Barnosky, A.D.|author4=Graham, R.W.|author5=Lindsay, E.H.|author6=Ruez, D.R.|author7=Semken, H.A.|author8=Webb, S.D.|author9=Zakrzewski, R.J.| year = 2004 |chapter= The Blancan, Irvingtonian, and Rancholabrean mammal ages |title=Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic Mammals of North America: Biostratigraphy and Geochronology |editor= Woodburne, M.O.| pages = 232–314 | location = New York | publisher = Columbia Univ.

[[File:Euroameribison.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Skulls of European bison (left) and American bison (right)]]

During the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of American bison during the nineteenth century, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce "cattleo"<ref name="Halbert2007" /> (today called "[[beefalo]]") Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.<ref name=Halbert2007/><ref name=Polziehn/> In the United States, many ranchers are now utilizing DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics which prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species.

Some cattle breeds are intentionally bred with bison to produce, for instance, beefalo hybrids. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia all the time. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds ([[Zubron]]) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile.

==Behavior==

[[Wallowing in animals|Wallowing]] is a common behavior of bison. A bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. Possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of [[Parasitism|ectoparasite]] load ([[tick]]s and [[Louse|lice]]), and thermoregulation.<ref name="JSTOR">{{cite journal|title=Wallowing Behavior of American Bison (Bos Bison)|author=McMillan, B. R.; Cottam, M. R. and Kaufman, D. W. |journal=American Midland Naturalist|volume=144|issue=1|pages=159–167|jstor=3083019}}</ref> In the process of wallowing, bison may become infected by the fatal disease [[anthrax]], which may occur naturally in the soil.<ref name="Anthrax kills bison in southern N.W.T.">{{cite news | title = Anthrax kills bison in southern N.W.T. |publisher = CBC.CA| date = 2006-07-08| url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/north/story/2006/07/06/anthrax-nwt-bison.html}}</ref>

[[File:Muybridge Buffalo galloping.gif|thumb|left|250px|A group of images by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], set to motion to illustrate the movement of the bison]]

The bison's temperament is often unpredictable. They usually appear peaceful, unconcerned, even lazy, yet they may attack anything, often without warning or apparent reason. They can move at speeds of up to {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}} and cover long distances at a lumbering gallop.<ref name="NPS">[http://web.archive.org/web/20100303175945/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/bison.htm American Bison]. nps.gov</ref>

Their most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females, but their massive heads can be used as battering rams, effectively using the momentum produced by {{convert|2000|lb|sigfig=1}} moving at {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect. At the time bison ran wild, they were rated second only to the [[Kodiak bear|Alaska brown bear]] as a potential killer, more dangerous than the [[grizzly bear]]. In the words of early naturalists, they were a dangerous, savage animal that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe<ref name="NPS"/> (except for wolves and brown bears<ref name="headsmashedin"/><ref name=Carbyn/>).

The rutting, or mating, season lasts from June through September, with peak activity in July and August. At this time, the older bulls rejoin the herd, and fights often take place between bulls. The herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season. The animals are belligerent, unpredictable and most dangerous.<ref name="NPS"/>

==Habitat==
[[File:The last of the Canadian buffaloes Photo No 580 (HS85-10-13487).jpg|thumb|300px|right|"Last of the Canadian Buffaloes", 1902, photograph: Steele and Company]]American bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains.  Typical habitat is open or semi-open grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semi-arid lands and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison.  Bison will also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep.  Though not particularly known as high altitude animals, bison in the [[Yellowstone Park bison herd]] are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the [[Henry Mountains bison herd]] is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet.

European bison (Wisent) tend to live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas and areas with increased shrubs and bushes, though they can also live on grasslands and plains.

===Restrictions===
Throughout most of their historical range, free-ranging bison are not tolerated by landowners or state governments. Herds on private land must be fenced in.<ref name=NYT4113>{{cite news|title=On the Montana Range, Efforts to Restore Bison Meet Resistance|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/us/efforts-to-restore-bison-on-the-montana-range-resisted.html|accessdate=April 2, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 1, 2013|author=Jim Robbins}}</ref> In the U.S. state of Montana, free-ranging bison on public land may be shot, citing concerns of spreading disease and damage to public property.<ref name=ICT41713>{{cite news|title=Shot, Left to Rot: Montana Officials Kill Bison Bull Wandering Outside Yellowstone National Park|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/04/17/shot-left-rot-montana-officials-kill-bison-bull-wandering-outside-yellowstone-national|accessdate=April 18, 2013|newspaper=Indian Country Today|date=April 17, 2013|author=Adrian Jawort}}</ref> Legislation surrounding the bison continues to be proposed and vetoed by the governor of Montana, and remains an issue of contention between Native American tribes and the American government.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/05/12/montana-governor-vetoes-three-anti-bison-bills-lets-hunt-stand-149320 | title=Montana Governor Vetoes Three Anti-Bison Bills, Lets the Hunt Stand | publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network | accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref>

==Diet==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Bison are herbivores and eat simple foods. The bison's main foodstuff is grass, though they will eat any available low-lying shrubbery [[Citation needed]] as well as [[Cyperaceae|sedges]]. In the winter, bison forage for grass under the snow. If there is little grass available, they will eat the twigs of shrubs. Bison are notably better browsers than cattle, since cattle are more obligate grazers, even though wood bison have also been described as "obligate grazers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://srd.alberta.ca/FishWildlife/SpeciesAtRisk/DetailedStatus/Mammals/documents/Status-WoodBison-inAlberta-Jan2002.pdf |title=p. iv |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>  Wisent tend to browse on shrubs and low hanging trees more often than do their cousins, the American bison. American bison prefer grass to shrubbery and trees. [[Citation needed]]

==Predators==
{{expand section|date=May 2012}}
Due to their size, bison have few predators.  Five notable exceptions are the [[grey wolf]], [[human]], [[brown bear]], [[coyote]], and [[grizzly bear]].<ref name=3of5pred>{{cite web|last=Newell|first=Toni Lynn|title=ADW: Bison bison: INFORMATION|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Bison_bison/|work=Animal Diversity Web at the University of Michigan|accessdate=21 June 2013|coauthors=Anna Bess Sorin}}</ref>  The grey wolf generally takes down a bison while in a pack, but there have been cases of a single wolf killing bison.<ref name=Carbyn/> [[Brown bear]] also prey on bison calves, often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolves' kill.<ref name="headsmashedin"/>

==Infections and illness==
For the American bison, the main cause of illness is [[malignant catarrhal fever]] (MCF),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Durham |first=Sharon |year=2010 |title=Figuring out puzzling animal diseases |journal=Agricultural Research |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/apr10/animal0410.htm}}</ref> though [[brucellosis]] is a serious concern in the Yellowstone Park bison herd.  Bison in the [[Antelope Island bison herd]] are regularly inoculated against brucellosis, parasites, clostridium, infectious bovine rhino tracheitis and bovine vibriosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utah.com/schmerker/1999/bison.htm |title=Island Named for Antelope, the Bison |publisher=Utah.com |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>

The major concerns for illness in European bison are foot-and-mouth disease and balanoposthitis, which affects the male sex organs; a number of parasitic diseases have also been cited as threats.<ref name=ebcc>{{cite web | url=http://www.bison-ebcc.eu/about-european-bison/actual-main-and-potential-threats/ | title=Actual, and Potential Threats | publisher=European Bison Conservation Center | accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> The inbreeding of the species caused by the small population plays a role in a number of genetic defects and immunity to diseases, which in turn poses greater risks to the population.<ref name=ebcc />

==Name==
The term "buffalo" is sometimes considered to be a [[misnomer]] for this animal, as it is only distantly related to either of the two "true buffalo", the Asian [[water buffalo]] and the [[African buffalo]]. However, "bison" is a Greek word meaning [[ox]]-like animal, while "buffalo" originated with the French fur trappers who called these massive beasts {{lang|fr|''bœufs''}}, meaning ox or bullock—so both names, "bison" and "buffalo", have a similar meaning. Though the name "bison" might be considered more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage the name "buffalo" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison.  In reference to this animal, the term "buffalo" dates to 1635 in North American usage when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.  It thus has a much longer history than the term "bison", which was first recorded in 1774.<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition.</ref>

==Human impact==
{{see also|Bison hunting}}
The extinction of four species of bison (''[[Bison antiquus]]'', ''[[Bison latifrons]]'', ''[[Bison occidentalis]]'', and ''[[Bison priscus]]'') is linked to [[natural selection]]. Humans were almost exclusively accountable for the near-extinction of the [[American bison]] in the 1800s. At the beginning of the 19th century, tens of millions of bison roamed North America. Humans slaughtered an estimated 50 million bison,<ref name="natgeo">{{cite web | url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/american-bison/ | title=American Bison, ''Bison bison'' | website=National Geographic | accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref> generally for their meat or [[Fur|pelts]]. This practice of over-hunting the bison reduced their population to hundreds. Attempts to revive the American bison, however, have been highly successful. Farming of bison has increased their population to nearly 150,000. The American bison is therefore no longer considered an [[endangered species]].<ref name=fermiendangered>{{cite web|title=Are Bison an Endangered Species?|url=http://ed.fnal.gov/entry_exhibits/bison/endangered.html|work=Fermilab Science Education Office|publisher=Leon M. Lederman Science Education Center, Fermilab|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref>

== Meat industry ==
In America, the commercial industry for bison has been slow to develop despite individuals like [[Ted Turner]], who have long marketed bison meat.
