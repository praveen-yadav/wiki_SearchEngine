'''Belgian hip hop music''' has a few [[rapper]]s stemming from [[Africa]] and [[Italy]]. [[Belgium]], like [[France]], controlled [[Africa]]n countries like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly Zaire), [[Rwanda]], and [[Burundi]] until the early 1960s. Like in France, [[Immigration|immigrants]] from these countries started to study and live in [[Belgium]].

The Belgian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based [[techno music|techno]]/hip hop group called [[Technotronic]]. In the group was an emcee named [[Ya Kid K]] from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] who later led the group into international fame with hits like "Pump up the Jam" and "Shake That Body". In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' movie [[soundtrack]]. 

However, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was [[Benny B]], who had a very mainstream and commercial sound.  According to the European Music Office's report on ''Music in Europe'', this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.

Also in the late 1990s in the [[Wallonia|Walloon south]] of the country, French speaking/rapping [[Starflam]] was the biggest name in hip hop. In the [[Flanders|Flemish]] north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like [['t Hof van Commerce]], Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional [[dialect]]s.
