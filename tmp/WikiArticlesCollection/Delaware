'''Delaware''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Delaware.ogg|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə|w|ɛər}} {{respell|DEL|ə-wair}})<ref>''Random House Dictionary''.</ref> is a [[U.S. state]] located on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the United States.{{Efn | name ="WhichRegion" | While the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] designates Delaware as one of the [[South Atlantic States]], it is sometimes grouped with the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] or the Northeastern United States.}}  It is bordered to the south and west by [[Maryland]], to the northeast by [[New Jersey]], and to the north by [[Pennsylvania]].{{Efn | name = "WhichRegion"}}  The state takes its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], an English nobleman and [[Virginia]]'s first colonial governor, after whom what is now called [[Cape Henlopen]] was originally named.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Delaware |title= Delaware| accessdate = February 24, 2007 | publisher = Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

Delaware is located in the northeastern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|second smallest]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|sixth least populous]], but the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|sixth most densely populated]] of the 50 United States. Delaware is divided into [[List of counties in Delaware|three counties]]. From north to south, these three counties are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle County has been more industrialized.

Before its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of American Indians, including the [[Lenape]] in the north and [[Nanticoke Indian Tribe|Nanticoke]] in the south. It was initially colonized by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] traders at [[Zwaanendael Colony|Zwaanendael]], located near the present town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], in 1631.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://portal.delaware.gov/facts/history/delhist.shtml | publisher =State of Delaware | title = A brief history}}</ref> Delaware was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 colonies]] participating in the [[American Revolution]] and on December 7, 1787, became the first state to ratify the [[Constitution of the United States]], thereby becoming known as ''The First State''.

==Etymology==
The state was named after the [[Delaware_River#Origin_of_the_name|Delaware River]] which in turn derived its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] (1577–1618), the governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]] at the time the river was first explored by Europeans. The [[Delaware Indians]], a name used by Europeans for [[Lenape]] people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.

==Geography==
{{main|Twelve-Mile Circle|Wedge (border)|Mason–Dixon Line|Transpeninsular Line}}
{{See also|#Counties|l1="Counties" section below}}
[[File:National-atlas-delaware.png|thumb|300px|right|Map of Delaware]]
[[File:Twelve-mile-circle.gif|thumb|300px|right|The Twelve-Mile Circle]]
[[File:Delaware-wedge.svg|thumb|Diagram of the Twelve-Mile Circle, the Mason–Dixon line and "[[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]]". All blue and white areas are inside Delaware, except for the small sliver of Maryland on the western extremity of the circle.]]
Delaware is {{convert|96|mi|km}} long and ranges from {{convert|9|mi}} to {{convert|35|mi|km}} across, totaling {{convert |1954|sqmi|km2}}, making it the second-smallest state in the United States after [[Rhode Island]]. Delaware is bounded to the north by [[Pennsylvania]]; to the east by the [[Delaware River]], [[Delaware Bay]], [[New Jersey]] and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by [[Maryland]]. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore counties of Maryland]] and [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|two counties of Virginia]], form the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.

The definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending {{convert|12|mi|km|sigfig=3}} from the [[cupola]] of the courthouse in the city of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]]. This boundary is often referred to as the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]].{{Efn | Because of surveying errors, the actual line is actually several compound arcs with centers located at different points in town New Castle.}}  This is the only nominally circular state boundary in the United States.

This border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the 12-mile (19&nbsp;km) arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel ([[thalweg]]) of the Delaware River. To the west, a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland. The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc. [[The Wedge (border)|The Wedge]] of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.

===Topography===
Delaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation.<ref name=USGS>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/04statab/geo.pdf|format=PDF|page=216|title=Extreme and Mean Elevations by State and Other Area|work=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004–2005|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> Its highest elevation, located at [[Ebright Azimuth]], near [[Concord High School (Wilmington, Delaware)|Concord High School]], does not rise fully {{convert|450|ft}} above sea level.<ref name=USGS/> The northernmost part of the state is part of the Appalachian Piedmont with hills and rolling surfaces. The [[fall line]] approximately follows the [[Delaware Route 2|Robert Kirkwood Highway]] between [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]; south of this road is the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dgs.udel.edu/delaware-geology/summary-geologic-history-delaware|title=A Summary of the Geologic History of Delaware|publisher= The Delaware Geological Survey}}</ref> A ridge about {{convert|75|to|80|ft}} in elevation extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the [[drainage basin|watershed]]s that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to the west.

===Climate===
Since almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state is in a transitional zone between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and a [[continental climate]]. Despite its small size (roughly {{convert|100|mi|km}} from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County. Moderated  by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state. Delaware's all time record high of {{convert|110|F|C}} was recorded at [[Millsboro, Delaware|Millsboro]] on July 21, 1930; the all time record low of {{convert|-17|F|C}} was also recorded at Millsboro on January 17, 1893.

===Environment===
The transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found [[Northeastern coastal forests]] and mixed [[Quercus|oak]] forests typical of the northeastern United States.<ref name="ecoregions">{{cite journal|author=Olson|title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth|journal=[[BioScience]]|year=2001|volume=51|issue=11|pages=933–938|url=http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2|author-separator=,|author2=D.

==History==
{{Main|History of Delaware}}

===Native Americans===
Before Delaware was settled by European colonists, the area was home to the Eastern [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes known as the Unami [[Lenape]] or Delaware throughout the Delaware valley, and the [[Nanticoke River|Nanticoke]] along the rivers leading into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to [[Munsee]] Lenape tribes along the [[Hudson River]]. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the State of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.

===Colonial Delaware===
[[Image:NouvSuede.jpg|thumb|200px|New Sweden – encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware.]]
The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the Middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware|Zwaanendael]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in 1631. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|area Indian tribes]].  In 1638 [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted for 17 years. In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].<ref name=hod>{{cite book|title=History of Delaware| first =John A | last = Munroe|edition = 5th, illustrated|publisher= University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=0-87413-947-3|page=45| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=vs7NcOKnlNUC&lpg=PA45&dq=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&f=false | chapter = 3.

Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], [[Province of Maryland|Proprietor of Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania province]] and leased what then came to be known as the "Lower Counties on the Delaware"<ref name = hod /> from the Duke.

Penn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties.  The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique.  From 1703 to 1738, New York and New Jersey shared a governor.<ref>{{Citation | last = Lurie | first = Mappen M | title = Encyclopedia of New Jersey | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 2004 | ISBN = 0-8135-3325-2 | page = 327}}.</ref> Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.<ref>{{Citation | last = Mayo | first = LS | title = John Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire: 1767–1775 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1921 | page = 5}}.</ref>

Dependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.

===American Revolution===
Like the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.

So it was that New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] became the "Penman of the Revolution."  Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.

Initially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the "Delaware Blues" and nicknamed the "[[Blue Hen Chicken|Blue Hen's Chicks]]." In August 1777, [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County.

Following the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner.  The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.<ref>{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Schama | author-link = Simon Schama | title = [[Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution]] | place = New York | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2006}}</ref>

Following the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.

===Slavery and race===
Many colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, which had been experiencing a population boom. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on tobacco culture and were increasingly dependent on slave labor for its intensive cultivation. Most of the English colonists arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid. Most of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | first = Paul | last = Heinegg | title = Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware | accessdate = February 15, 2008}}.</ref> As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor.

At the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming created less need for slaves' labor. Local [[Methodist]]s and [[Quaker]]s encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free.  When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves.  By 1860 the largest slaveholder owned only 16 slaves.{{Sfn | Kolchin | 1994 | pp = 78, 81–82}}

Although attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms, the state had mostly ended the practice. By the [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 91.7 percent of the black population were free;{{Sfn | Kolchin | 1994 | pp = 81–82}} 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 "free colored persons".<ref>{{Citation | url = http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 | title = Historical Census Browser | contribution = 1860 Federal Census | publisher = University of Virginia Library | accessdate = November 30, 2012}}.</ref>

The independent black denomination was chartered by freed slave [[Peter Spencer (religious leader)|Peter Spencer]] in 1813 as the "[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]]". This followed the 1793 establishment of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|first=Peter T.|last=Dalleo|title=The Growth of Delaware's Antebellum Free African Community|publisher= University of Delaware|date=June 27, 1997}}</ref>
This was renamed the [[African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection]], more commonly known as the [[A.U.M.P. Church]]. Begun by Spencer in 1814, the annual gathering of the [[Big August Quarterly]] still draws people together in a religious and cultural festival, the oldest such cultural festival in the nation.

At the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Delaware was only nominally a slave state, and it remained in the Union. Delaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861. As the governor said, Delaware had been the first state to embrace the Union by ratifying the Constitution and would be the last to leave it. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in [[Maryland Civil War Confederate units|Maryland]] and [[List of Virginia Civil War units|Virginia]] Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. It freed the remaining Delaware slaves with the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the US Constitution]] in December 1865.

The religious body with the largest number of congregations is the [[United Methodist Church]] (with 158 congregations) followed by non-denominational [[Evangelical Protestant]] (with 106 congregations), then the [[Catholic Church]] (with 45 congregations).

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington]] and the [[Episcopal Diocese of Delaware]] oversee the parishes within their denominations. The A.U.M.P. Church, the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington. It still has a substantial presence in the state. Reflecting new immigrant populations, an [[mosque|Islamic mosque]] has been built in the [[Ogletown, Delaware|Ogletown]] area, and a [[Hindu temple]] in [[Hockessin, Delaware|Hockessin]].

In 2009, DelDOT maintained 13,507 lane miles of roads, totaling 89 percent of the state's public roadway system; the remaining public road miles are under the supervision of individual municipalities. This far exceeds the United States national average of 20 percent for state department of transportation maintenance responsibility.<ref name=deldotfactbook>{{cite book|title=Delaware Transportation Facts|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|year=2009|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/pubs_forms/fact_book/pdf/2009/2009_fact_book.pdf|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}</ref>

The "DART First State" public transportation system was named "Most Outstanding Public Transportation System" in 2003 by the [[American Public Transportation Association]]. Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and [[paratransit]] modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a state-wide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as "the most generous paratransit system in the United States."<ref name=montgomery2012nj/> {{As of|2012}}, fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.<ref name=montgomery2012nj/>

===Roads===

[[File:DE 1 near canal.JPG|right|thumb|[[Delaware Route 1]], a partial [[toll road]] linking [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].]]
One major branch of the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]], crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County. In addition to I-95, there are six [[U.S. Highway System|U.S. highways]] that serve Delaware: [[U.S. Route 9]], [[U.S. Route 13]], [[U.S. Route 40]], [[U.S. Route 113]], [[U.S. Route 202]], and [[U.S. Route 301]]. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include [[Delaware Route 1]], [[Delaware Route 9]], and [[Delaware Route 404]]. U.S. 13 and DE Rt 1 are primary north-south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland, with DE 1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the [[Delaware beaches]]. DE Rt. 9 is a north-south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the [[Delaware Bay]]. U.S. 40, is a primary east-west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey. DE Rt. 404 is another primary east-west highway connecting the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] in Maryland with the Delaware beaches. The state also operates two toll highways, the [[Delaware Turnpike]], which is Interstate 95, between Maryland and New Castle and the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE Rt. 1, between Wilmington and Dover.

A bicycle route, [[Delaware Bicycle Route 1]], spans the north-south length of the state from the Maryland border in [[Fenwick Island, Delaware|Fenwick Island]] to the Pennsylvania border north of [[Montchanin, Delaware|Montchanin]]. It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deldot.gov/information/projects/bike_and_ped/bike_facilities/pages/regional_routes.shtml|publisher=Delaware Department of Transportation|title= Projects: Delaware Bicycle Facility Master Plan|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}</ref>

Delaware has around 1,450 bridges, 95 percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built prior to 1950 and about 60 percent of the number are included in the [[National Bridge Inventory]]. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]], which are under the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], which is under the bi-state [[Delaware River and Bay Authority]].

It has been noted that the [[tar and chip]] composition of secondary roads in Sussex County make them more prone to [[Road surface#Surface deterioration|deterioration]] than [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] roadways found in the rest of the state.<ref name=nj20110417>{{cite news|location=Wilmington, Delaware|title=Anything Once: On the road, taking plenty of pot shots|author=Justin Williams|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110417/NEWS02/304170008/-1/NLETTER01/On-the-road--taking-plenty-of-pot-shots|newspaper=News Journal|publisher=Gannett|date=April 17, 2011|at=DelawareOnline|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 238 is among the most problematic.<ref name=nj20110417/>

===Ferries===
[[File:MVDelaware.jpg|thumb|right|Cape May-Lewes Ferry]]
There are three ferries that operate in the state of Delaware:
* [[Cape May-Lewes Ferry]] crosses the mouth of the Delaware Bay between Lewes, Delaware and [[Cape May, New Jersey]].
* [[Woodland Ferry]] is a cable ferry that crosses the [[Nanticoke River]] southwest of [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]].
* [[Delaware City–Salem Ferry]] connects [[Delaware City]] with [[Fort Delaware]] and [[Salem, New Jersey]]

===Rail and bus===
[[File:Wilmington Furness Station.JPG|thumb|left|Wilmington Station]]
[[Amtrak]] has two stations in Delaware along the [[Northeast Corridor]]; the relatively quiet [[Newark Rail Station (Delaware)|Newark Rail Station]] in Newark, and the busier [[Wilmington Rail Station]] in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by [[SEPTA]]'s [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] of [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]], which serves [[Claymont, Delaware|Claymont]], Wilmington, [[Churchmans Crossing, Delaware|Churchmans Crossing]], and Newark. The major freight railroad in Delaware is the [[Class I railroad]] [[Norfolk Southern]], which provides service to most of Delaware. It connects with two shortline railroads, the [[Delaware Coast Line Railroad]] and the [[Maryland and Delaware Railroad]], which serve local customers in Sussex County.  Another Class I railroad, [[CSX]], passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. CSX connects with the freight/[[heritage railroad|heritage]] operation, the [[Wilmington and Western Railroad]], based in Wilmington and the [[East Penn Railroad]], which operates a line from Wilmington to [[Coatesville, Pennsylvania]].

The last north-south passenger train through the main part of Delaware was the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s ''The Cavalier,'' which ended service from Philadelphia through the state's interior in 1956.<ref>{{Citation | first = Christopher T | last = Baer | title = Named Trains of The PRR Including Through Services | year = 2009 | url = http://www.prrths.com/Hagley/PRR%20NAMED%20TRAINS.pdf | publisher= PRRTHS | format = [[PDF]]}}.</ref>

===Air===
{{see also|Aviation in Delaware}}
[[New Castle Airport]] near Wilmington is currently served by commercial airline [[Frontier Airlines]], providing service to various locations in the country.  In the past, [[Skybus Airlines]] also serviced in Wilmington, which provided service to [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] from March 7, 2008<ref>{{cite news|first=Marla |last=Matzer Rose|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/business/stories/2008/01/09/skybus_routeannounce.ART_ART_01-09-08_C10_DP90M2P.html?sid=101|title=Skybus adds two cities to schedule|date=January 9, 2008|accessdate=January 9, 2008}}</ref> until its bankruptcy on April 5, 2008.

Delaware is centrally situated in the [[Northeast Corridor]] region of cities along [[Interstate 95|I-95]]. Therefore, Delaware [[commercial airline]] passengers most frequently use [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL), [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI) and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use [[Wicomico Regional Airport]], as it is located less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Delaware border. [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR) and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) are also within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of New Castle County.

The Dover Air Force Base of the Air Mobility Command is located in the central part of the state, and it is the home of the [[436th Airlift Wing]] and the [[512th Airlift Wing]].

Other general aviation airports in Delaware include [[Summit Airport (Delaware)|Summit Airport]] near [[Middletown, Delaware|Middletown]], [[Delaware Airpark]] near [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]], and [[Sussex County Airport]] near [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].

==Law and government==
Delaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.

===Legislative branch===
[[File:Delaware State Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Delaware General Assembly]] meets in the [[Delaware State Capitol|Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]]
The [[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.

Delaware's U.S. Senators are [[Thomas R. Carper]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Coons]] (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is [[John C. Carney, Jr.|John Carney]] (Democrat).

===Judicial branch===
The Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:
* The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court.
* The [[Delaware Superior Court]] is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.
* The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.
* The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.
* The [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]] has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.

Minor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.

Significantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Court of equity|Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]]. The [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning [[corporate law]] which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are [[incorporated in Delaware]], including 60% of the companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name= "divcorpabout">{{cite web|url= http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title= About Agency|accessdate= July 23, 2008 | publisher =Delaware Division of Corporations|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070228002805/http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |archivedate = February 28, 2007}}</ref> Delaware was the last US state to use [[judicial corporal punishment]], in 1952.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pleck|first=Elizabeth Hefkin|title = Domestic tyranny: the making of American social policy against family|publisher=University of Illinois Press | year =2004|page=120|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zN2A2shTz6YC&pg=PA120|isbn= 978-0-252-07175-1}}</ref>

===Executive branch===
{{See also|List of Governors of Delaware}}
The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]]. The present governor is [[Jack A. Markell]] (Democrat), who took office January 20, 2009. The lieutenant governor is [[Matthew P. Denn]]. The governor presents a "[[State of the State]]" speech to a [[joint session]] of the Delaware legislature annually.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.delawarestatehouse.com/| year= 2010| title = Delaware House of Representatives Minority Caucus | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5n1UxlPVx|archivedate=January 24, 2001|accessdate= January 24, 2001}}</ref>

===Counties===
Delaware is subdivided into [[List of counties in Delaware|three counties]]; from north to south they are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues.  Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states – such as court and law enforcement – have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real-estate title descriptions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml|title= The Hundreds of Delaware| work= Department of State: Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs|publisher=Delaware State Archives|accessdate= September 28, 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

The Democratic Party holds a [[pluralism (political theory)|plurality]] of registrations in Delaware. Until the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000, when Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Al Gore]]; in 2004, [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight percentage points. In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Delaware 62.63% to 37.37%. Obama's [[running mate]] was [[Joe Biden]], who had represented Delaware in the [[United States Senate]] since 1973.

Delaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population—more than the populations of Kent and Sussex counties combined (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not gone Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000 and 2004, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double-digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.

The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last six gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold eight of the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans hold only one statewide office, [[State Auditor]].

===Freedom of information===
{{see also|Freedom of information in the United States#State legislation}}
Each of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government.{{citation needed|date = April 2011}} In 2011, Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Rep. | first2 = Sen. | last2 = Peterson | first3 = Sen. | last3 = Katz|date=January 6, 2011|publication-date=April 15, 2011|contribution= An Act to Amend Title 29 of the Delaware Code Relating to the Freedom of Information Act|accessdate=April 22, 2011 | contribution-url = http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5| edition = online | title = Delaware Code | volume = 78| at = 10| id = House Bill # 5| url = http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+5/}}</ref>

===Government revenue===
Delaware has six different [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess [[sales tax]] on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.

Delaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property.  Real estate is subject to county [[property tax]]es, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.

[[Gambling in the United States#Authorized types|Gambling]] provides significant revenue to the state. For instance, the [[Delaware Park Racetrack#Casino|casino at Delaware Park Racetrack]] provided more than $100 million USD to the state in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delaware crime: Wave of brazen attacks sounds alarm at casino | first = Chris | last = Barrish|url= http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110423/NEWS01/104230342/-1/NLETTER01/Wave-of-brazen-attacks-sounds-alarm-at-casino | publisher = Gannett | location = Wilmington, DE | date=April 23, 2011| work =Delaware Online|accessdate= April 23, 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5ygCHfM0y | archivedate = May 14, 2011 | at = 1st page of online article archived via link provided}}</ref>

==Municipalities==

==Education==
[[File:UDel Memorial and Magnolia Circle.JPG|thumb|right|University of Delaware]]
Delaware was the origin of ''[[Belton v. Gebhart]]'', one of the four cases which was combined into ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision that led to the end of [[racial segregation|segregated]] public schools. Significantly, ''Belton'' was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation was unconstitutional.

Unlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions.

{{As of|2011}}, the Delaware Department of Education had authorized the founding of 25 [[charter school]]s in the state, among them one [[Single-sex education|all-girls facility]].<ref name=Dobo20110612>{{cite news|last=Dobo|first=Nichole|title=Delaware schools: Checkered past goes unchecked|accessdate=June 13, 2011|newspaper=[[The News Journal]]|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20110612/NEWS03/106120369/-1/NLETTER01/Checkered-past-goes-unchecked|date=June 12, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zOplxsjf|archivedate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

==Media==

===Television===
There are no network broadcast-television stations operating solely in Delaware. A local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station from Philadelphia (but licensed to Wilmington), [[WHYY-TV]], maintains a studio and broadcasting facility in Wilmington and Dover, while [[ION Television]] affiliate [[WPPX]] is licensed to Wilmington but maintains their offices in Philadelphia and their digital transmitter outside of that city and an analog tower in New Jersey. Philadelphia's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WPVI-TV]], maintains a news bureau in downtown Wilmington. The northern part of the state is served by network stations in Philadelphia and the southern part by network stations in [[Baltimore]] and [[Salisbury, Maryland]]. Salisbury's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WMDT]] covers Sussex and lower Kent County; while [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WBOC-TV]], maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton.

==Tourism==

Rehoboth Beach often bills itself as "The Nation's Summer Capital" because it is a frequent summer vacation destination for Washington, D.C. residents as well as visitors from Maryland, Virginia, and in lesser numbers, Pennsylvania. Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town's charm, artistic appeal, nightlife, and tax free shopping.

Delaware is home to several festivals, fairs, and events. Some of the more notable festivals are the Riverfest held in [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]], the World Championship [[Punkin_Chunkin#World_Championship_Punkin_Chunkin|Punkin Chunkin]] held at various locations throughout the county since 1986, the Rehoboth Beach Chocolate Festival, the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral to mark the end of summer, the Apple Scrapple Festival held in [[Bridgeville, Delaware|Bridgeville]], the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival, the Sea Witch Halloween Festival and Parade in Rehoboth Beach, the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, the Nanticoke Indian Pow Wow in [[Oak Orchard, Delaware|Oak Orchard]], [[Firefly Music Festival]], and the Return Day Parade held after every election in [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].

[[File:2013 FedEx 400 from turn 3.jpeg|thumb|right|NASCAR racing at Dover International Speedway]]
As Delaware has no franchises in the major America professional sports leagues, many Delawareans follow either Philadelphia or Baltimore teams, depending on their location within the state. The [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football|University of Delaware's football team]] has a large following throughout the state with the [[Delaware State Hornets football|Delaware State University]] and [[Wesley College (Delaware)|Wesley College]] teams also enjoying a smaller degree of support.

Delaware is home to [[Dover International Speedway]] and [[Dover Downs]]. DIS, also known as the ''Monster Mile'', hosts two [[NASCAR]] races each year. Dover Downs is a popular [[harness racing]] facility. It is the only co-located horse and car-racing facility in the nation, with the Dover Downs track located inside the DIS track.

Delaware has been home to [[professional wrestling]] outfit [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW). CZW has been affiliated with the annual Tournament of Death and [[East Coast Wrestling Association|ECWA]] with its annual [[ECWA Super 8 Tournament|Super 8 Tournament]].

==Delaware Native Americans==
Delaware is also the name of a Native American group (called in their own language [[Lenni Lenape]]) that was influential in the colonial period of the United States and is today headquartered in Cheswold, Kent County, Delaware. A band of the Nanticoke tribe of American Indians today resides in Sussex County and is headquartered in Millsboro, Sussex County, Delaware.
