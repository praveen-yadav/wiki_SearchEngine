"'''{{lang|de|''Arbeit macht frei''}}'''" ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯baɪt ˈmaxt ˈfʁaɪ}}) is a German phrase meaning "work makes (you) free".<ref>''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'', [[Yad Vashem]],  1990, vol. 4, p. 1751.</ref> The slogan is known for having been placed over the entrances to a number of [[Nazi concentration camps]] during [[World War II]], including most infamously [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]], where it was made by prisoners with metalwork skills and erected by order of the Nazis in June 1940.

==Etymology==

The expression comes from the title of a novel by German philologist [[Lorenz Diefenbach]], ''Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach'' (1873), in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news |last=Connolly |first=Kate |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/18/auschwitz-arbeit-macht-frei-sign |title=Poland declares state of emergency after 'Arbeit Macht Frei' stolen from Auschwitz |publisher=The Guardian |date=18 December 2009}}
*Diefenbach, Lorenz. ''Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach''. J. Kühtmann's Buchhandlung, 1873.</ref> The phrase was also used in French ("le travail rend libre!")  by [[Auguste Forel]], a Swiss ant scientist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his "Fourmis de la Suisse" ["Ants of Switzerland"] (1920).<ref name="Fourmis de la Suisse">{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/lesfourmisdelasu00fore#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Les fourmis de la Suisse (2nd Ed.) |first=Auguste |last=Forel |authorlink=Auguste Forel|location=La Chaux-de-Fonds |publisher=Imprimarie cooperative |year=1920 |language=French |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> In 1922, the Deutsche Schulverein of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist "protective" organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase ''Arbeit macht frei''. It was adopted in 1928 by the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar government]] as a slogan extolling the effects of their desired policy of large-scale [[public works]] programmes to end unemployment. This use of the phrase was continued by the [[Nazi Party]] when it came to power in 1933.

==Use by the Nazis==

The slogan "''Arbeit macht frei''" was placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. The slogan's use in this instance was ordered by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] General [[Theodor Eicke]], inspector of concentration camps and second commandant of [[Dachau Concentration Camp]].

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]] where, according to BBC historian [[Laurence Rees]] in his "Auschwitz: a New History", the sign was erected by order of commandant [[Rudolf Höss]]. This particular sign was made by prisoner-labourers including [[Jan Liwacz]], and the upper bowl in the ''[[B]]'' of the word ''ARBEIT'' is wider than the lower bowl—thus making the letter seem upside-down. The "flipped" ''B'' has fuelled ongoing rumours that the apparent error was done on purpose as a signal to new arrivals about what was actually happening behind the facility's gates, but this style was also seen elsewhere in the era.<ref name="Liwacz">{{cite news | last = Łosińska | first = Ewa | first2 = Piotr |last2=Zychowicz | title = Kto ukradł napis z Auschwitz | newspaper = [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] | url = http://www.rp.pl/artykul/21,408428.html | date = 19 December 2009 |language=Polish}}</ref>

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a "wild camp" in the city of [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]], which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}). It can also be seen at the [[Dachau concentration camp]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]], and the [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] Ghetto-Camp, as well as at [[Fort Breendonk]] in [[Belgium]]. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over entrance gates to Auschwitz III / Buna/Monowitz<ref>Denis Avey with Rob Broomby ''The Man who Broke into Auschwitz'', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 2011 p.236</ref><ref>Freddie Knoller with Robert Landaw ''Desperate Journey'', Metro, London, 2002, p.158</ref> as well as [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Primo Levi]] describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) in [[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III/Buna Monowitz]].<ref>Primo Levi, trans. Stuart Woolf, ''If This is a Man'' Abacus, London, 2004, p.28.</ref>

At [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], "[[Jedem das Seine]]" (literally, "to each his own", but idiomatically "everyone gets what he deserves") was used.

In 1938 the [[Austria]]n political [[cabaret]] writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the [[composer]] [[Herbert Zipper]], while prisoners at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], wrote the ''[[Dachaulied]]'' (The Dachau Song). They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily [[forced labour]], and considered the motto "''Arbeit macht frei''" over the gate an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a "lesson" taught by Dachau.  (The first verse is translated in the article on [[Jura Soyfer]].)

In ''The Kingdom of Auschwitz'', Otto Friedrich wrote regarding Höss:
:He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labour does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last= Friedrich |first= Otto |title= The Kingdom of Auschwitz |publisher= [[Harper Perennial]] |year= 1994 |month= August |isbn= 978-0-06-097640-8 |pages= 2–3}}</ref>

==Legacy==

The sign over Auschwitz was stolen in December 2009 by thieves, and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish former neo-Nazi leader, and two Poles were jailed for the act. As a result, the original is now in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], and a replica has been placed over the gate.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12094855 | work=BBC News | title=Auschwitz sign theft: Swedish man jailed | date=30 December 2010}}</ref>
