The term '''carotene''' (also '''carotin''', from the Latin ''carota'', or carrot<ref>Mosby’s Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary, Fourth Edition, Mosby-Year Book 1994, p. 273</ref><ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=carotene|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=carotene&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref>) is used for several related [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]] substances having the formula C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>x</sub>, which are synthesized by plants but cannot be made by animals. Carotene is an [[orange (colour)|orange]] [[photosynthetic pigment]] important for [[photosynthesis]]. Carotenes are all coloured to the human eye. They are responsible for the orange colour of the [[carrot]], for which this class of chemicals is named, and for the colours of many other fruits and vegetables (for example, [[sweet potato]]es, [[chanterelle]] and orange [[cantaloupe]] melon). Carotenes are also responsible for the orange (but not all of the yellow) colours in dry foliage. They also (in lower concentrations) impart the yellow coloration to milk-fat and butter. Omnivorous animal species which are relatively poor converters of coloured dietary carotenoids to colourless retinoids have yellowed-coloured body fat, as a result of the carotenoid retention from the vegetable portion of their diet. The typical yellow-coloured fat of humans and chickens is a result of fat storage of carotenes from their diets.

Carotenes contribute to photosynthesis by transmitting the light energy they absorb from [[chlorophyll]]. They also protect plant tissues by helping to absorb the energy from [[singlet oxygen]], an excited form of the oxygen molecule O<sub>2</sub> which is formed during photosynthesis.

[[Beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]] is composed of two [[retinol|retinyl]] groups, and is broken down in the [[mucosa]] of the human [[small intestine]] by [[β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] to [[retinal]], a form of [[vitamin A]]. β-Carotene can be stored in the [[liver]] and body fat and converted to retinal as needed, thus making it a form of [[vitamin A]] for humans and some other mammals. The carotenes [[alpha-Carotene|α-carotene]] and [[gamma-Carotene|γ-carotene]], due to their single retinyl group (β-[[ionone]] ring), also have some vitamin A activity (though less than β-carotene), as does the [[xanthophyll]] carotenoid β-[[cryptoxanthin]]. All other carotenoids, including [[lycopene]], have no beta-ring and thus '''no''' vitamin A activity (although they may have antioxidant activity and thus biological activity in other ways).

Animal species differ greatly in their ability to convert retinyl (beta-[[ionone]]) containing carotenoids to retinals. Carnivores in general are poor converters of dietary ionone-containing carotenoids. Pure carnivores such as [[ferret]]s lack [[β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase]] and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinals at all (resulting in carotenes '''not''' being a form of vitamin A for this species); while cats can convert a trace of β-carotene to retinol, although the amount is totally insufficient for meeting their daily retinol needs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Green AS, Tang G, Lango J, Klasing KC, Fascetti AJ |title=Domestic cats convert ((2) H(8))-β-carotene to ((2) H(4))-retinol following a single oral dose |journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition |year=2011 |pmid=21797934 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0396.2011.01196.x |pages=681–92 |volume=96 |issue=4}}</ref>

==Molecular structure==
Chemically, carotenes are polyunsaturated [[hydrocarbon]]s containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable numbers of hydrogen atoms, and no other elements. Some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or both ends of the molecule. All are coloured to the human eye, due to extensive systems of [[conjugated double bond]]s. Structurally carotenes are [[tetraterpene]]s, meaning that they are synthesized biochemically from four 10-carbon [[terpene]] units, which in turn are formed from eight 5-carbon [[isoprene]] units.

Carotenes are found in plants in two primary forms designated by characters from the [[Greek alphabet]]: [[alpha-Carotene|alpha-carotene]] (α-carotene) and [[beta-Carotene|beta-carotene]] (β-carotene). [[gamma-Carotene|Gamma-]], [[delta-Carotene|delta-]], [[epsilon-Carotene|epsilon-]], and [[zeta-Carotene|zeta-carotene]] (γ, δ, ε, and ζ-carotene) also exist. Since they are hydrocarbons, and therefore contain no oxygen, carotenes are fat-soluble and insoluble in water (in contrast with other [[carotenoid]]s, the [[xanthophyll]]s, which contain oxygen and thus are less chemically hydrophobic).

Absorption from these foods is enhanced if eaten with fats, as carotenes are fat soluble, and if the food is cooked for a few minutes until the plant [[cell wall]] splits and the colour is released into any liquid. 6 μg of dietary β-carotene supplies the equivalent of 1 μg of retinol, or 1 RE (Retinol Equivalent).  This is equivalent to 3⅓ [[International unit|IU]] of vitamin A.

==The multiple forms==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Alpha-carotene.svg|thumb|200px|α-carotene]]
[[File:Beta-Carotin.svg|thumb|200px|β-carotene]]

[[File:Delta-carotene.svg|thumb|200px|δ-carotene]]
The two primary [[isomer]]s of carotene, α-carotene and β-carotene, differ in the position of a [[double bond]] (and thus a hydrogen) in the cyclic group at one end (left in the diagram here).

[[beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]] is the more common form and can be found in [[yellow]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], and [[green]] leafy [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s. As a [[rule of thumb]], the greater the intensity of the orange colour of the fruit or vegetable, the more β-carotene it contains.

Carotene protects plant cells against the destructive effects of ultraviolet light. β-Carotene is an [[antioxidant]].

==β-Carotene and cancer==
It has been shown in trials that the ingestion of β-carotene supplements at about 30&nbsp;mg/day (10 times the [[Reference Daily Intake]]) increases the rate of lung and prostate cancer development in [[smoking|smokers]] and people with a history of [[asbestos]] exposure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

An article on the [[American Cancer Society]] says that [[The Cancer Research Campaign]] has called for warning labels on β-carotene supplements to caution smokers that such supplements may increase the risk of lung cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Warning_Labels_on_Beta_Carotene_Called_For.asp |title=British Cancer Organization Calls for Warning Labels on Beta-Carotene |date=2000-07-31 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061204074724/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Warning_Labels_on_Beta_Carotene_Called_For.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] published an article<ref>{{cite journal |author=The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group |title=The effect of vitamin E and beta carotene on the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers in male smokers |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=330 |issue=15 |pages=1029–35 |year=1994 |pmid=8127329 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199404143301501 }}</ref> in 1994 about a trial which examined the relationship between daily supplementation of β-carotene and [[vitamin E]] (α-tocopherol) and the incidence of lung cancer. The study was done using supplements and researchers were aware of the epidemiological correlation between carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables and lower lung cancer rates. The research concluded that no reduction in lung cancer was found in the participants using these supplements, and furthermore, these supplements may, in fact, have harmful effects.

A review of all randomized controlled trials in the scientific literature by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] published in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'' in 2007 found that synthetic β-carotene ''increased'' mortality by something between 1 and 8% (Relative Risk 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.01–1.08).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Gluud LL, Simonetti RG, Gluud C |title=Mortality in randomized trials of antioxidant supplements for primary and secondary prevention: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17327526 |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842}}

==Carotenemia==
{{Main|Carotenodermia}}
Carotenemia or hypercarotenemia is excess carotene, but unlike excess vitamin A, carotene is non-toxic. Although hypercarotenemia is not particularly dangerous, it can lead to an oranging of the skin (carotenodermia), but not the [[conjunctiva]] of eyes (thus easily distinguishing it visually from [[jaundice]]). It is most commonly associated with consumption of an abundance of [[carrot]]s, but it also can be a [[medical sign]] of more dangerous conditions.

==Production==
Most of the world's synthetic supply of carotene comes from a manufacturing complex located in [[Freeport, Texas]] and owned by [[DSM (company)|DSM]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The other major supplier [[BASF]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} also uses a chemical process to produce β-carotene. Together these suppliers account for about 85% of the β-carotene on the market.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In Spain [[Vitatene]] produces natural β-carotene from fungus [[Blakeslea trispora]], as does DSM but at much lower amount when compared to its synthetic β-carotene operation. In Australia, organic β-carotene is produced by [[Aquacarotene Limited]] from dried marine algae ''[[Dunaliella salina]]'' grown in harvesting ponds situated in [[Karratha, Western Australia]]. Cognis Australia Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of the Germany-based company [[Cognis]], is also producing β-carotene from microalgae grown in two sites in Australia that are the world’s largest algae farms. In [[Portugal]], the [[industrial biotechnology]] company [[Biotrend]] is producing natural all-''trans''-β-carotene from a non genetically modified bacteria of the ''[[Sphingomonas]]'' genus isolated from soil.

Carotenes are also found in palm oil, corn, and in the milk of dairy cows,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} causing cow's milk to be light yellow, depending on the feed of the cattle, and the amount of fat in the milk (high-fat milks, such as those produced by [[Guernsey]] cows, tend to be more yellow because their fat content causes them to contain more carotene).

Carotenes are also found in some species of termites, where they apparently have been picked up from the diet of the insects.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Total synthesis===
There are currently two commonly used methods of [[total synthesis]] of β-carotene. The first was developed by the Badische Anilin- & Soda-Fabrik ([[BASF]]) and is based on the [[Wittig reaction]] with Wittig himself as patent holder:<ref name="β-Carotin-1">Wittig G.; Pommer H.: ''DBP 954247, '''1956'''</ref><ref name="β-Carotin-2">{{cite journal | author = Wittig G., Pommer H. | year = 1959 | title = | url = | journal = Chem. Abstr | volume = 53 | issue = | page = 2279 }}</ref>

:[[Image:Wittig-9.svg|Carotene synthesis by Wittig|500px]]

The second is a [[Grignard reaction]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} elaborated by [[Hoffman-La Roche]] from the original synthesis of Inhoffen et al.  They are both symmetrical; the BASF synthesis is C20 + C20, and the Hoffman-La Roche synthesis is C19 + C2 + C19.

==Nomenclature==
Carotenes are [[carotenoid]]s containing no oxygen. Carotenoids containing some oxygen are known as [[xanthophyll]]s.

The two ends of the β-carotene molecule are structurally identical, and are called '''β-rings'''. Specifically, the group of nine carbon atoms at each end form a β-ring.

The α-carotene molecule has a β-ring at one end; the other end is called an '''ε-ring'''. There is no such thing as an "α-ring".

These and similar names for the ends of the carotenoid molecules form the basis of a systematic naming scheme, according to which:
* α-carotene is '''β,ε-carotene''';
* β-carotene is '''β,β-carotene''';
* γ-carotene (with one β ring and one uncyclized end that is labelled ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'') is '''β,ψ-carotene''';
* δ-carotene (with one ε ring and one uncyclized end) is '''ε,ψ-carotene''';
* ε-carotene is '''ε,ε-carotene'''
* [[lycopene]] is '''ψ,ψ-carotene'''

ζ-Carotene is the [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[neurosporene]], which is the precursor of lycopene, which, in turn, is the precursor of the carotenes α through ε.

==Food additive==
Carotene is also used as a substance to colour products such as juice, cakes, desserts, butter and margarine. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU (listed as additive E160a)<ref>UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref> Australia and New Zealand (listed as 160a)<ref>Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 – Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref> and the USA.<ref>US FDA: {{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/FoodAdditiveListings/ucm091048.htm |title=Listing of Food Additives Status Part I |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>
