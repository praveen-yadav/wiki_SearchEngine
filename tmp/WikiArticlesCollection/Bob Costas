'''Robert Quinlan "Bob" Costas''' (born March 22, 1952) is an American sportscaster, on the air for [[NBC Sports]] television since the early 1980s.  He has been prime-time host of 9 Olympic games. He also does play-by-play for [[MLB Network]] as well as hosting an interview show called ''Studio 42 with Bob Costas''.

==Early life==
Bob Costas was born in the borough of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]], the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent. His father's family roots are from the island of Chios in the Aegean Sea.<ref>{{verify credibility|date=August 2012|reason=must bet better source out there.  filmreference.com appears to be user-generated; filmreference.com doesn't even have wikipedia article.}} Database (undated).

He grew up in [[Commack, New York|Commack]], New York, graduating from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]].

Following high school, Costas was majoring in communications and rhetorical studies at [[Syracuse University]],<ref>{{cite web| author = Meliker, Shayna | url=http://www.dailyorange.com/2008/09/bob-costas-to-address-university/ |title=Bob Costas To Address University | work = [[The Daily Orange]] |date= September 23, 2008; updated March 7, 2010 |accessdate= July 31, 2012}}</ref> before he dropped out of school.

==Broadcasting career==

===Early career===
His sportscasting career started while attending Syracuse University, as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].

Costas began his professional career at [[KMOX]] radio in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], where he served as a play-by-play announcer for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] in 1974. He also called [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers basketball]] for KMOX, and co-hosted the station's ''Open Line'' call-in program.

He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls]]: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association''. He is extensively quoted on many topics, and the book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.

Costas later did play-by-play for [[Chicago Bulls]] broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]] during the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–1980 NBA season]].<ref>Database (undated).

Retrieved August 5, 2012.</ref> He was also employed by [[CBS Sports]] as a regional [[NFL on CBS|CBS NFL]] and [[NBA on CBS|CBS NBA]] announcer from 1976 to 1979, when he moved to NBC.

===NBC Sports===
When Costas was first hired by NBC, [[Don Ohlmeyer]], who at the time ran the network's sports division, told the then 28-year-old Costas that he looked like a 14-year-old (a story that Costas would recite during an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' when [[Conan O'Brien|O'Brien]] commented about Costas' apparent inability to "[[Ageing|age]]" normally). Ohlmeyer presumably based his reaction on Costas' modest stature (Costas is 5' 7" in height) and boyish, babyfaced appearance.

Costas has been an in-studio host for NBC's [[NFL on NBC|National Football League]] coverage and a [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] man for [[NBA on NBC|National Basketball Association]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|Major League Baseball]] coverage. Costas has teamed with [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] for NBA telecasts (from [[1997–98 NBA season|1997]]–[[1999–2000 NBA season|2000]]) and [[Sal Bando]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120322&content_id=27505084&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb |title=At 60, Costas Remains at Top of His Game{{spaced ndash}} MLB Network Commentator's Talent, Love for Baseball Unmatched |author=Kalb, Elliott |date= March 22, 2012 | publisher= [[MLB.com]] |accessdate= August 5, 2012}}</ref> ([[1982 in baseball|1982]]), [[Tony Kubek]] (from [[1983 in baseball|1983]]–[[1989 in baseball|1989]]), [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Bob Uecker]] (from [[1994 in baseball|1994]]–[[2000 in baseball|2000]]) for baseball telecasts. Before becoming the studio host for ''[[NFL on NBC|The NFL on NBC]]'' in [[1984 NFL season|1984]], Costas did play-by-play of NFL games with analyst [[Bob Trumpy]].

Since 2001, Costas has been the co-host of the [[Kentucky Derby]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoppert |first=Melissa |url=http://therail.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/nbc-blankets-churchill-downs/ |title=NBC Blankets Churchill Downs | publisher = ''The Rail'' (blog of ''[[The New York Times]]'') |date= May 2, 2012 |accessdate= August 5, 2012}}</ref> Since 1995, Costas has also hosted [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] golf tournament.<ref>{{cite web| author = Yoder, Matt | date = June 17, 2012; update June 18, 2012 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/17/us-open-fan-webb-simpson-trophy-costas-video_n_1604552.html |title=U.S. Open Fan Interrupts Webb Simpson Trophy Presentation, Bob Costas Interview (Video) | work = [[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate= August 5, 2012}}</ref>

With the introduction of the [[NBCSN|NBC Sports Network]], Costas also became the host of the new monthly interview program ''[[Costas Tonight]]''.<ref name=tvg-nbcsn>{{cite web|last=Sands|first=Rich|title=Channel Changing: Versus Becomes NBC Sports Network|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Versus-NBC-Sports-1041158.aspx|publisher=TV Guide|accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref>

====Olympics====
Costas has frontlined many Olympics broadcasts for [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]. They include the Olympics in [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona in 1992]], [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta in 1996]], [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney in 2000]], [[2002 Winter Olympics|Salt Lake City in 2002]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens in 2004]], [[2006 Winter Olympics|Turin in 2006]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing in 2008]], [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver in 2010]], and [[2012 Summer Olympics|London in 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|author= Guinto, Joseph |url=http://www.americanwaymag.com/costas-now-olympics-beijing-bob-costas |title= Golden Boy | work = [[American Way (magazine)|American Way]] |date= August 1, 2008 |accessdate= July 31, 2012}}</ref> He discusses his work on the Olympic telecasts extensively in a book by Andrew Billings entitled ''Olympic Media: Inside the Biggest Show on Television''. A personal influence on Costas has been legendary [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] broadcaster [[Jim McKay]], who hosted many Olympics for [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.<ref>(June 7, 2008).

During the 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Opening Ceremonies, Costas' remarks on [[China]]'s teams' possible drug use caused an uproar among the American Chinese and international communities. Thousands of dollars were raised to purchase ads in the ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and Sunday ''[[The New York Times]]'', featuring an image of the head of a statue of [[Apollo]] and reading: "Costas Poisoned Olympic Spirit, Public Protests NBC."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://museums.cnd.org/CND-Global/CND-Global.96.3rd/CND-Global.96-08-31.html | title=Text of Protest Ad| work = [[China News Digest]] |first=K.

Further evidence of Chinese athletes' drug use came in 1997 when Australian authorities confiscated 13 vials of [[Growth hormone|Somatropin]], a human growth hormone, from the bag of Chinese swimmer Yuan Yuan upon her arrival for the [[1998 World Aquatics Championships|1997 World Swimming Championships]]. At the World Championships, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance [[Triamterene]], a diuretic used to dilute urine samples in order to mask the presence of anabolic steroids. Including these failed drug tests, 27 Chinese swimmers were caught using performance enhancing drugs from 1990 through 1997; more than the rest of the world combined.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/18/sports/sp-9735 | title=Latest Drug Scandal Has China Critics Seeing Red | author = [[Mike Penner|Penner, Mike]] | date= January 18, 1998 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = July 31, 2012}}</ref>

Along with that of co-host [[Meredith Vieira]] and [[Matt Lauer]], Costa's commentary of the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremonies]] came under fierce criticism, with Costas being described as making "a series of [[jingoistic]] remarks, including a joke about [[Idi Amin]] when [[Uganda]]'s team appeared"<ref>[[Guy Adams (journalist)|Adams, Guy]] (July 30, 2012).

Costas later appeared on [[Conan O'Brien]]'s [[Conan (TV series)|talk show]] and criticized his employer for its decision to air a preview of the upcoming series ''[[Animal Practice]]'' over a performance by [[The Who]] during the London closing ceremonies. "So here is the balance NBC has to consider: The Who, 'Animal Practice.' Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend -- monkey in a lab coat.

====Major League Baseball====
One of his most memorable broadcasts occurred on June 23, 1984 (in what would go down in baseball lore as "[[Ryne Sandberg#"The Sandberg Game"|The Sandberg Game]]").<ref name="chicagocubsonline1">{{cite web|author=By Neil on June 23, 2009 |url=http://chicagocubsonline.com/archives/2009/06/1984cubs_2.php |title=Looking Back at '84: The Sandberg Game |publisher=ChicagoCubsOnline.com |date= June 23, 2009 |accessdate= July 16, 2012}}</ref> Costas, along with Tony Kubek, was calling the Saturday baseball ''[[Major League Baseball on NBC|Game of the Week]]'' from Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]]. The game between the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] and [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in particular was cited for putting [[Ryne Sandberg]] (as well as the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984 Cubs]] in general, who would go on to make their first postseason appearance since [[1945 in baseball|1945]]) "on the map." In the ninth inning, the Cubs trailed 9–8, and faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, [[Bruce Sutter]]. Sandberg, then not known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer.<ref name="chicagocubsonline1"/> Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base. Sandberg then shocked the national audience by hitting a second home run, even farther into the left field bleachers, to tie the game again.<ref name="chicagocubsonline1"/> The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning.<ref>[http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2008/2/9/5390/94355 The Top 20 Cub HR Of All Time - #4 Ryne Sandberg 6/23/1984 - Bleed Cubbie Blue<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> Costas said when Sandberg hit that second home run, ''"Do you believe it?!"'' The Cardinals' [[Willie McGee]] hit for the cycle in the same game.

While broadcasting Game 4 of the [[1988 World Series]] between the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] on [[NBC]], Costas angered many members of the Dodgers (especially the team's manager, [[Tommy Lasorda]]) by commenting before the start of the game that the Dodgers quite possibly were about to put up the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history.<ref>{{cite web|author= Ostler, Scott |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-20/sports/sp-5478_1_dodger-lineup |title=This Is One Incredible Stunt They're Pulling Off | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= October 20, 1988|accessdate= July 31, 2012}}</ref> That comment ironically fired  up the competitive spirit of the Dodgers, and later (while being interviewed by NBC's [[Marv Albert]]), after the Dodgers had won Game 4 (en route to a 4–1 series victory), Lasorda sarcastically suggested that the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas.

Besides calling the [[1989 American League Championship Series]] for NBC, Costas also filled-in for a suddenly ill [[Vin Scully]], who had come down with [[laryngitis]], for Game 2 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]]. Game 2 of the NLCS occurred on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterwards, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.

Bob Costas anchored NBC's pre and post-game for NFL broadcasts and the pre and post-game shows for numerous World Series and [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s during the 1980s (the first being for the [[1982 World Series]]). Costas didn't get a shot at doing play-by-play (as the games on NBC were previously called by [[Vin Scully]]) for an All-Star Game until [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1994]] and a World Series until [[1995 World Series|1995]] (when NBC split the coverage with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] under "[[The Baseball Network]]" umbrella). It wasn't until [[1997 World Series|1997]] when Costas finally got the chance to do play-by-play for a World Series from start to finish. Costas ended up winning a [[Sports Emmy Award]] for [[Outstanding Sports Personality, Play-by-Play]].

In [[1999 in baseball|1999]], Costas teamed with his then-[[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] colleague, [[Joe Morgan]] to call two weekday night telecasts for [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]]. The first was on [[Wednesday Night Baseball|Wednesday]], August 25 with [[1999 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] playing against the [[1999 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]]. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] playing against the [[1999 New York Mets season|New York Mets]].

====National Basketball Association====
When NBC gained the NBA network contract from [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] in [[1990–91 NBA season|1990]], Costas hosted the telecasts and was teamed in the studio with ex-[[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] coach [[Pat Riley]]. He also hosted the studio program ''[[NBA Showtime|Showtime]]'' and did play-by-play for the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]]. In [[1997–98 NBA season|1997]], Costas began a three-year stint as the lead play-by-play man for ''[[NBA on NBC|The NBA on NBC]]''. NBC enlisted Costas' services after they were forced to (temporarily) remove [[Marv Albert]] from their broadcasts due to lingering personal and legal problems at the time. Costas stepped aside following the [[2000 NBA Finals]], in favor of a returning Marv Albert. Costas returned to call some games of the [[2002 NBA Playoffs]] after Albert was injured in a car accident two days before the playoffs began.

While this, in essence, ended his active role on the ''NBA on NBC'' program (by this point, [[Hannah Storm]] and briefly [[Ahmad Rashād]] had replaced Costas on studio anchoring duties), Costas would return to do play-by-play for selected playoff games. Costas also anchored NBC's NBA Finals coverage in [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]], which was their last to date as [[Hannah Storm]] also anchored it with Costas.

====National Football League====
In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], Costas returned to studio hosting duties on ''[[The NFL on NBC pregame show|The NFL on NBC]]'' (under the ''[[Football Night in America]]'' banner), which was returning after a near ten-year hiatus. Costas last hosted NFL telecasts for NBC in [[1992 NFL season|1992]].

Costas is nicknamed "Rapping Roberto" by New York City's ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' sports media columnist Bob Raissman.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/story/451507p-380022c.html | title=NBC out-Foxed in opener | work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | author= Raissman, Bob | date= September 12, 2006}}</ref> [[Al Michaels]] also called him "Rapping Roberto" during the telecast between the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and the [[2006 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on September 10, 2006, in response to Costas calling him "Alfalfa."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-09-10-weekend_x.htm | title=Scores, injury updates early fodder for NBC's Sunday-night NFL show | work = [[USA Today]] | author= Hiestand, Michael | date= September 11, 2006}}</ref>

He hosted the event in 2012 as well as a post-game edition of NHL Live on NBC Sports Network.

===Talk show hosting===
Costas also hosted the syndicated [[radio]] program ''Costas Coast to Coast'' from 1986–1996, which was later revived as ''[[Costas on the Radio]]''. ''Costas on the Radio'', which ended its three-year run on May 31, 2009, aired on 200 stations nationwide each weekend and syndicated by the [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] owned [[Premiere Networks|Premiere Radio Networks]]. Like ''Later'', Costas' radio shows have focused on a wide variety of topics, and have not been limited to sports discussion.

Costas hosted ''[[Later (talk show)|Later with Bob Costas]]'' on NBC from 1988 until 1994. This late night show created by [[Dick Ebersol]], coming on at 1:30 a.m. as the third program in NBC's nightly lineup after ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', was something of a break from the typical TV talk show format of the era, featuring Costas and a single guest having a conversation for the entire half hour, without a band, opening monologue or studio audience. On several occasions, Costas held the guest over for multiple nights, and these in-depth discussions won Costas much praise for his interviewing skills. The show was taped in [[GE Building]]'s studios 3B or 8H at the [[Rockefeller Center|Rockefeller Plaza]] with Costas interviewing the guest for 45 minutes to an hour before turning the material over to editors who condensed it down to 22 minutes plus commercial breaks.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmyB934SsDI Later 1994].</ref> More popular guests were given two or three part interviews that ran consecutive nights. In August 1991, [[Mel Brooks]] became the only guest for four consecutive nights in the series' history.

In June 2005, Costas was named by [[CNN]] president [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]] as a regular substitute anchor for [[Larry King]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' for one year. Costas, as well as Klein, have said that Costas was not trying out for King's position on a permanent basis. [[Nancy Grace]] was also named a regular substitute host for the show.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/09/entertainment/main700753.shtml | title=CNN Hires Bob Costas | publisher= [[Associated Press]] (via [[CBS News]]) | date= June 9, 2005}}</ref>

On August 18, 2005, Costas refused to host a ''Larry King Live'' broadcast where the subject was missing teenager [[Natalee Holloway]]. Costas said he had no hard feelings about the subject, but that he was uncomfortable with it.<ref>{{dead link|date=August 2012|reason=redirects to dynamic page}} {{cite web | url=http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/usworld/news-article.aspx?storyid=42748 | title=Bob Costas Refuses To Anchor Holloway Coverage | publisher= [[Associated Press]]  | date= August 19, 2005}}</ref>

Since October 2011, Costas is a correspondent for ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams]]''. He gained acclaim for his November 2011 live interview of former [[Pennsylvania State University]] assistant coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] concerning [[Penn State child sex abuse scandal|charges of sexual abuse of minors]], in which Sandusky called in by telephone to deny the charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/lawyers-convicted-serial-child-molester-jerry-sandusky-appeal-conviction-grounds-tv-glitch-interview-bob-costas-article-1.1101631?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Lawyers for convicted serial child molester Jerry Sandusky to appeal conviction on grounds of TV glitch during his interview with Bob Costas | work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date= June 24, 2012 |accessdate= July 16, 2012}}</ref>

Costas currently hosts a monthly talk show ''Costas Tonight'' on [[NBC Sports Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/21/costas-tonight-looks-at-bounty-scandal/ |title=Costas Tonight Looks at Bounty Scandal |publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= June 21, 2012 |accessdate= July 16, 2012}}</ref>

===HBO Sports===
In 2001, Costas was hired by [[HBO]] to host a 12-week series called ''[[On the Record with Bob Costas]]''.<ref>Database (undated).  [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283207/ 'On the Record with Bob Costas' (2001)"].  [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> ''On the Record with Bob Costas'' was similar to the format of the old ''Later'' program as they both concentrated on in-depth interviews.

In 2002, Costas began a stint as co-host of HBO's long-running series ''[[Inside the NFL]]''. Costas remained host of ''Inside the NFL'' through the end of the [[2007 NFL season]]. He hosted the show with [[Cris Collinsworth]] and former NFL legends [[Dan Marino]] and [[Cris Carter]]. The program aired each week during the NFL season.

In 2005, ''On the Record with Bob Costas'' was revamped to become ''[[Costas Now]]'', a monthly show that would focus more on sports and air year-round in a 9 p.m. ET/PT time slot. ''Costas Now'' was more akin to HBO's ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]''.

Costas left HBO to sign with [[MLB Network]] in February 2009.

===MLB Network===
Costas agreed to become a contributor to [[MLB Network]]. At the channel's launch on January 1, 2009, he hosted the premiere episode of ''All Time Games'', a presentation of the recently discovered [[kinescope]] of Game 5 of the [[1956 World Series]]. During the episode, he held a forum with [[Don Larsen]], who pitched MLB's only postseason [[perfect game]] during that game, and [[Yogi Berra]], who caught the game.

Costas joined the network full-time on February 3, 2009. He hosts a regular interview show titled ''MLB Network Studio 42 with Bob Costas'' as well as special programming, and provides play-by-play for select live ''[[Thursday Night Baseball]]'' games.<ref>Press release (February 3, 2009).  [http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090203&content_id=3793902&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb&partnerId=rss_mlb "Bob Costas Joins MLB Network{{spaced ndash}} Costas Returns to Baseball To Host Special Programs, Contribute to On-Air Game Telecasts MLB Network To Be Exclusive Cable Home of 19-Time Emmy Winner"].  [[MLB.com]].  Retrieved August 5, 2012.</ref>

===Other appearances===
Costas provided significant contributions to the [[Ken Burns]], [[PBS]] mini series ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' as well as its follow-up ''[[Baseball (TV series)|The 10th Inning]]''. He also appears in another PBS film, ''[[A Time for Champions]]'', produced by [[St. Louis|St. Louis']] [[KETC|Nine Network of Public Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeforchampions.org/ |title=Time for Champions |publisher=Time for Champions |date= |accessdate= February 14, 2012}}</ref>

==Interests==

===Love of baseball===
Costas is a devoted baseball fan (he's been suggested as a potential [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]]) and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a [[United States dollar|$]]3.31 tip in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''"a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic."'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 in baseball|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.

Costas has been fairly outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believes that it diminishes the significance of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to on an equal level with teams by which they were outplayed over a 162 game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a bye into the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance.

Costas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.

===Political views===

====George W. Bush====

On May 26, 2007, Costas declared that the presidency of [[George W. Bush]] had "tragically failed."
<blockquote>''Some people may wonder about the [political] feelings that I've expressed, and I won't get into all the particulars. I think it is now overwhelmingly evident, if you're honest about it, even if you're a conservative Republican, if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration. And no honest conservative would say that George W. Bush was among the 500 most qualified people to be President of the United States. That's not based on political leaning. If a liberal, and I tend to be liberal, disagrees with a conservative, they can still respect that person's competence and the integrity of their point of view. This administration can be rightly criticized by a fair-minded person smack in the middle of the political spectrum on a hundred different counts, and by now they're all self-evident."<ref>Pierre, Dave (June 6, 2007).  [http://newsbusters.org/node/13253 Bob Costas: 'Inescapable Fact' That Bush Presidency 'A Tragically Failed Administration'].  [[Media Research Center#NewsBusters|NewsBusters]].  Retrieved August 1, 2012.</ref></blockquote>

The following summer, Costas would interview Bush, as Bush made an appearance during the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.<ref name="ostrow2008">{{cite web|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne| date = August 10, 2008 | title=Bob Costas, redeemed |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2008/08/10/bob-costas-redeemed/215/| publisher = ''Ostrow Off the Record'' (blog of ''[[The Denver Post]]'') |accessdate= August 1, 2012}}</ref>

====Gun control controversy====
During a segment on the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' halftime show on December 2, 2012, Costas paraphrased a report by [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] columnist [[Jason Whitlock]] in regards to [[Jovan Belcher]]'s murder-suicide the day prior, stating that the United States' [[Gun_culture#Present-day_gun_culture_in_the_United_States|gun culture]] was causing more [[domestic violence|domestic dispute]]s to result in death, and that Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun.<ref name=bi-costasbelcher>{{cite web|title=Bob Costas Got Blasted For His Gun-Control Monologue After Jovan Belcher's Murder-Suicide|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-costas-gun-control-jovan-belcher-chiefs-murder-suicide-kasandra-perkins-2012-12|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>

Critics interpreted his remarks as support for [[gun control]], resulting in mixed reactions. Many (including former republican Presidential candidates [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Herman Cain]])<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/> felt that Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics, [[Lou Dobbs]] criticized his remarks for supporting the abolishment of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] by quoting a [[sports writer]], while [[Andrew Levy]] remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had "gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men’s bodies and brains."<ref name=nydn-costasguns>{{cite web|title=ob Costas delivers anti-gun message on Sunday Night Football one day after NFL player Jovan Belcher kills girlfriend, himself|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/costas-delivers-anti-gun-message-sunday-night-football-article-1.1212138|publisher=New York Daily News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> However, [[Erik Wemple]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast, feeling that the incident's connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show, stating that "the things that [NFL players] do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread. And few cases better exemplify that dynamic as powerfully as the Belcher incident."<ref name=twp-wemple-costas>{{cite web|last=Wemple|first=Erik|title=Bob Costas, please keep spouting off|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/bob-costas-please-keep-spouting-off/2012/12/03/ab289450-3d67-11e2-8a5c-473797be602c_blog.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref>

During the following week, Costas defended his remarks in an appearance on [[MSNBC]]'s program ''[[The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell]]'', where he stated that the remarks were related to the country's gun culture, and not about gun control as critics had inferred. While he did not call for an outright ban on guns, Costas did suggest that more [[moderation]] be placed on America's gun culture:<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc>{{cite web|last=Pengelly|first=Martin|title=Bob Costas defends 'gun culture' comments in MSNBC interview|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/05/bob-costas-gun-comments-msnbc-interview|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> 
<blockquote>"Now, do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation? Yes I do. That doesn't mean repeal the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family. It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation. But even if you had that, you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about, and what I agree with. And that is a gun culture in this country."<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/></blockquote>

==Personal life==
Costas was married from 1983 to 2001 to Carole "Randy" Randall Krummenacher. They had two children, son Keith (born 1986) and daughter Taylor (born 1989). Costas once jokingly promised [[Minnesota Twins]] center fielder [[Kirby Puckett]] that if he was batting over .350 by the time his child was born he would name the baby Kirby. Kirby was hitting better than .350, but Bob's son initially was not given a first (or second) name of Kirby. After Puckett reminded Costas of the agreement, the birth certificate was changed to "Keith Michael Kirby Costas".<ref>{{cite news| author = [[Steve Wulf|Wulf, Steve]] | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1003993/index.htm | work = [[Sports Illustrated]] | title= The Host with the Most{{spaced ndash}} Bob Costas, the Anchorman for NBC's Olympic Television Coverage, Is, as Always, Voluminously Prepared| date=July 22, 1992 | accessdate = August 5, 2012}}</ref> On March 12, 2004, Costas married his second wife, Jill Sutton.
