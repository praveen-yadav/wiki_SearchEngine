'''James Avery Hopwood''' (May 28, 1882 - July 1, 1928), was an American playwright, called the most successful playwright of the Jazz Age, having four plays running simultaneously on Broadway in 1920.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the [[University of Michigan]] (1905).  

Hopwood started out as a journalist for a Cleveland newspaper as its New York correspondent, but within a year had a play, ''Clothes'' (1906), produced on Broadway. He became known as "The Playboy Playwright"<ref name=imdbbio>Jim Beaver [http://imdb.com/name/nm0394479/bio Biography for Avery Hopwood] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> and specialized in comedies and farces, some of them with material considered risqué  at the time.  One play, ''[[The Demi-Virgin]]'' in 1921, prompted a court case because of its suggestive subject matter, including a risque game of cards, "Stripping Cupid", where a bevy of showgirls teased the audience in their lingerie.  The case was dismissed.

===Dramatist===
His many plays included ''Nobody's Widow'' (1910), starring Blanche Bates; ''Fair and Warmer'' (1915), starring Madge Kennedy (filmed in 1919); ''The Gold Diggers'' (1919), starring Ina Claire (filmed in 1923 as ''[[The Gold Diggers (1923 film)|The Gold Diggers]]'', in 1928 as ''[[Gold Diggers of Broadway]]'' and also as ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]''); ''[[Ladies' Night (play)|Ladies' Night]]'', 1920, starring [[Charlie Ruggles]] (filmed in 1928); the famous mystery play ''The Bat'' (with [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]]), 1920 (filmed in [[The Bat (1926 film)|1926]], [[The Bat Whispers|1930]] and [[The Bat (1959 film)|1959]]); ''Getting Gertie's Garter'' (with Wilson Collison), 1921, starring [[Hazel Dawn]] (filmed in 1927 and 1945); ''The Demi-Virgin'', 1921, also starring Dawn; ''The Alarm Clock'', 1923; ''The Best People'' (with David Gray), 1924 (filmed in 1925 and as ''[[Fast and Loose (1930 film)|Fast and Loose]]'' in 1930), the song-farce ''Naughty Cinderella'', 1925, starring [[Irene Bordoni]] and ''The Garden of Eden'' in 1927 (filmed in as ''[[The Garden of Eden (1928 film)|1928]])''. 

A clever, adroit, masterful craftsman who wrote to the tastes of his public, Hopwood was inexhaustible in his work ethic.  Although the press reported that he was engaged to vaudeville dancer and choreographer Rose Rolanda in 1924, Hopwood's close friend [[Carl Van Vechten]] confirmed in later years that it was all a publicity stunt.  Rolanda would later marry caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias.

===Death===
Sadly, personal troubles related to his [[homosexuality]] and his inability to break from the formula writing that made him a success led to his early death at age 46.  While swimming at [[Juan-les-Pins]] on the French Riviera, July 1, 1928, he suffered a heart attack and died. He is buried in Riverside Cemetery, Cleveland, Ohio, next to his mother, Jule.<ref>Vigil, Vicki Blum (2007). ''Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols & Stories''.

===Hopwood Awards===
The terms of Hopwood's will left a substantial portion of his estate to his alma mater, the University of Michigan for the establishment of the [[Hopwood Award|Avery Hopwood and Jule Hopwood Creative Writing Awards]]. The bequest stipulated: "It is especially desired that students competing for prizes shall be allowed the widest possible latitude, and that the new, the unusual, and the radical shall be especially encouraged." Famous Hopwood award winners include [[Robert Hayden]], [[Marge Piercy]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Betty Smith]], [[Lawrence Kasdan]], [[John Ciardi]], [[Mary Gaitskill]], [[Nancy Willard]], [[Frank O’Hara]], and [[Steve Hamilton (author)|Steve Hamilton]].

Throughout his life, Hopwood worked on a novel that he hoped would "expose" the strictures the commercial theater machine imposed on playwrights, but the manuscript was never published. This manuscript, which Jack Sharrar recovered in 1982 during his research for ''Avery Hopwood, His Life and Plays'', was published July, 2011.

==="The Great Bordello"===
Edited, with an Afterword, by Sharrar, Avery Hopwood's ''The Great Bordello, a Story of the Theatre'', is a ''roman à clef'' that tells the story of Edwin Endsleigh—Hopwood’s fictional counterpart—who graduates from the University of Michigan and heads for Broadway to earn his fortune and the security to pursue his one true dream of writing the great American novel. Shaping Edwin’s ambitious journey in the world of the theater is his love of three women: the beautiful, strong-minded Julia Scarlet, whom he first meets in Ann Arbor; the emotionally fragile and haunting Jessamy Lee, and the very private and mysterious leading lady Adelina Kane, idol of the American stage.  In the company of Edwin and his loves are a dramatic array of thinly veiled representations of theatrical personages of the time, amongst them Daniel Mendoza, an exacting and powerful impresario, who controls the lives of his leading ladies; the goatish, démodé manager, Matthew Lewis, who promotes Julia Scarlet as “the American Sarah Bernhardt”; the worldly-wise veteran of the stage, Ottilie Potter, who has gotten where she is because, “Men had what I wanted, and I had what they wanted”; and the huge, manlike Helen Sampson, chief among theatrical agents. Above all, ''The Great Bordello''  provides a deeper understanding of the human desire to accomplish something of enduring value amidst commercial success and ruthless realities of life.
