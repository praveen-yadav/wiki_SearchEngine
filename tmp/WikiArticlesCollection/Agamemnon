In [[Greek mythology]], '''Agamemnon''' ({{IPAc-en|english|pron|æ|g|ə|ˈ|m|ɛ|m|n|ɒ|n}}; {{lang-grc|Ἀγαμέμνων}}; [[Modern Greek]]: {{lang|el|Αγαμέμνονας}}, "''very steadfast''") was the son of king [[Atreus]] and queen [[Aerope]] of [[Mycenae]], the brother of [[Menelaus]], the husband of [[Clytemnestra]] and the father of [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]] and [[Chrysothemis]]. Mythical legends make him the king of Mycenae or [[Argos]], thought to be different names for the same area. When [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], the wife of Menelaus, was abducted by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris of]] [[Troy]], Agamemnon commanded the united Greek armed forces in the ensuing [[Trojan War]].

Upon Agamemnon's return from Troy, he was murdered (according to the oldest surviving account, ''[[Odyssey]]'' 11.409–11) by [[Aegisthus]], the lover of his wife, Clytemnestra. In old versions of the story, "[t]he scene of the murder, when it is specified, is usually the house of Aegisthus, who has not taken up residence in Agamemnon's palace, and it involves an ambush and the deaths of Agamemnon's followers too".<ref>Aeschylus (1986) ''Choephori''; introduction by A. F. Garvie, Oxford U. P., p. x</ref> In some later versions Clytemnestra herself does the killing, or they do it together, in his own home.

==Early life==
[[Atreus]], Agamemnon's father, murdered the children of twin brother [[Thyestes]] and fed them to Thyestes after discovering Thyestes' adultery with his wife Aerope. Thyestes fathered [[Aegisthus]] with his own daughter, [[Pelopia]], and this son vowed gruesome revenge on Atreus' children. Aegisthus successfully murdered Atreus and restored his father to the throne. Aegisthus took possession of the throne of Mycenae and jointly ruled with Thyestes. During this period Agamemnon and his brother, [[Menelaus]], took refuge with [[Tyndareus]], King of [[Sparta]]. There they respectively married Tyndareus' daughters [[Clytemnestra]] and Helen.  Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had four children: one son, [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], and three daughters, [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]] and [[Chrysothemis]]. Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus in Sparta, while Agamemnon, with his brother's assistance, drove out Aegisthus and Thyestes to recover his father's kingdom. He extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in Greece.

Agamemnon's family history had been tarnished by [[rape]], [[murder]], [[incest]], and treachery, consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor, [[Tantalus]], and then of a curse placed upon [[Pelops]], son of Tantalus, by [[Myrtilus]], whom(?) he(?) had murdered. Thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the [[House of Atreus]], until atoned by [[Orestes]] in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods.

==Trojan War==
{{Main|Trojan War}}
Agamemnon gathered the reluctant Greek forces to sail for [[Troy]]. Preparing to depart from [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]], which was a port in [[Boeotia]], Agamemnon's army incurred the wrath of the goddess [[Artemis]]. There are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath: in [[Aeschylus]]' play ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', Artemis is angry for the young men who will die at Troy, whereas in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', Agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to Artemis, and subsequently boasted that he was Artemis' equal in hunting. Misfortunes, including a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and a lack of wind, prevented the army from sailing. Finally, the prophet [[Calchas]] announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter [[Iphigenia]]. Classical dramatisations differ on how willing either father or daughter were to this fate, some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to [[Achilles]], but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis, and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the [[human sacrifice]] have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources, such as ''[[Iphigenia at Aulis]]'', claim that Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but that Artemis accepted a deer in her place, and whisked her away to Taurus in the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. [[Hesiod]] said she became the goddess [[Hecate]].

Agamemnon was the commander-in-chief of the Greeks during the Trojan War. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed [[Antiphus]] and 15 other Trojan soldiers.<ref>[[Hyginus]], "[[Fabulae]]" 114.</ref> The ''[[Iliad]]'' tells the story about the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles in the final year of the war. Agamemnon took an attractive slave, [[Briseis]], one of the spoils of war, from Achilles. Achilles, the greatest warrior of the age, withdrew from battle in revenge and nearly cost the Greek armies the war.

Although not the equal of Achilles in bravery, Agamemnon was a representative of kingly authority. As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. He took the field himself, and performed many heroic deeds until he was wounded and forced to withdraw to his tent. His chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness; an over-exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult [[Chryses]] and Achilles, thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.

After the capture of Troy, [[Cassandra]], doomed prophetess and daughter of [[Priam]], fell to Agamemnon's lot in the distribution of the prizes of war.

==Return to Greece==

After a stormy voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra either landed in [[Argolis]], or were blown off course and landed in Aegisthus' country. [[Clytemnestra]], Agamemnon's wife, had taken [[Aegisthus]], son of [[Thyestes]], as a lover.  When Agamemnon came home he was slain by either Aegisthus (in the oldest versions of the story) or Clytemnestra. According to the accounts given by [[Pindar]] and the tragedians, Agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone, a blanket of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance. Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra. Her jealousy of Cassandra, and her wrath at the sacrifice of Iphigenia and at Agamemnon's having gone to war over Helen of Troy, are said to have been the motives for her crime. Aegisthus and Clytemnestra then ruled Agamemnon's kingdom for a time, Aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for Agamemnon's father Atreus having fed Thyestes his own children (Thyestes then crying out "So perish all the race of Pleisthenes!",<ref>Aeschylus, Aga., ln. 1602</ref> thus explaining Aegisthus' action as justified by his father's curse). Agamemnon's son [[Orestes]] later avenged his father's murder, with the help or encouragement of his sister [[Electra]], by murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra (his own mother), thereby inciting the wrath of the [[Erinyes]] ([[English language|English]]: the Furies), winged goddesses who tracked down egregiously impious wrongdoers with their hounds' noses and drove them to insanity.

The fortunes of Agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous [[tragedy|tragedies]], ancient and modern, the most famous being the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of [[Aeschylus]]. In the legends of the [[Peloponnesus]], Agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch, and in [[Sparta]] he was worshipped under the title of ''[[Agamemnon (Zeus)|Zeus Agamemnon]]''. His tomb was pointed out among the ruins of Mycenae and at [[Amyclae]].

Another account makes him the son of [[Pleisthenes]] (the son or father of [[Atreus]]), who is said to have been Aerope's first husband.

In works of art there is considerable resemblance between the representations of [[Zeus]], king of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men. He is generally depicted with a [[sceptre]] and [[diadem]], conventional attributes of kings.

Agamemnon's mare was named Aetha.  She was also one of two horses driven by [[Menelaus]] at the funeral games of [[Patroclus]].<ref>[[pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. ''Description of Greece''; 5.8.3</ref><ref>[[Plutarch]]. ''Amores'', 21</ref>
