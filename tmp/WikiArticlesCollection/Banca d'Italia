'''Banca d'Italia''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for ''Bank of Italy'') is the [[central bank]] of [[Italy]] and part of the [[European System of Central Banks]]. It is located in [[Palazzo Koch]], [[Rome]], [[via Nazionale (Rome)|via Nazionale]]. The bank's current governor is [[Ignazio Visco]], who took the office on 1 November 2011.

==Functions==
After the charge of monetary and exchange rate policies was shifted in 1998 to the [[European Central Bank]], within the European institutional framework, the bank implements the decisions, issues [[euro]] banknotes and withdraws and destroys worn pieces.

The main function has thus become banking and financial supervision. The objective is to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system and compliance to rules and regulations; the bank pursues it through secondary legislation, controls and cooperation with governmental authorities.

Following reform in 2005, which was prompted by takeover scandals, the bank has lost exclusive antitrust authority in the credit sector, which is now shared with [[Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato|Italy's Antitrust Authority]].

Other functions include, market supervision, oversight of the payment system and provision of settlement services, State treasury service, Central Credit Register, economic analysis and institutional consultancy.

Bank of Italy [[Official gold reserves|gold reserves]] are 2,451.8 [[tonnes]] (2006).

==History==
The institution, also called BankItalia, was established in 1893 from the combination of three major banks in Italy after the [[Banca Romana scandal]].<ref name=quaderni>Alfredo Gigliobianco and Claire Giordano, [http://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/pubsto/quastoeco/quadsto_05/Quaderno_storia_economica_5.pdf Economic Theory and Banking Regulation: The Italian Case (1861-1930s)], Quaderni di Storia Economica (Economic History Working Papers), Nr. 5, November 2010</ref><ref> [http://www.bancaditalia.it/bancaditalia/storia/origini Banca D'Italia - ''Origins'']</ref> The new central bank first issued bank-notes during 1926.<ref>[http://www.bancaditalia.it/bancaditalia/storia;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en Banca D'Italia - ''History''] Retrieved 2012-05-28</ref> Until 1928, it was directed by a general manager, after this time instead by a governor elected by an internal commission of managers, with a decree from the [[President of the Italian Republic]], for a term of seven years.

==Organization of the Bank of Italy==
===Governing Bodies===
The Bank's governing bodies are the [[Annual General Meeting|General Meeting of Shareholders]], the [[Board of Directors]], the Governor, the [[Director General]] and three Deputy Directors General; the last five constitute the Directorate. 

The general meeting takes place yearly and with the purpose of approving accounts and appointing the [[auditor]]s. The Board of Directors has administrative powers and is chaired by the governor (or by the Director General in his absence). Following reform in 2005, the governor lost exclusive responsibility regarding decisions of external relevance (i.e. banking and financial supervision), which has been transferred to the Directorate (by majority vote). The Director General is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank, and acts as governor when absent.

The [[Board of Auditors]] assesses the bank's administration and compliance with the law, regulations and the statute.

===Appointment===
The Directorate's [[term of office]] lasts six years and is renewable once. The appointment of the governor is the responsibility of the government, head of the Board of Directors, with the approval of the President of the Republic (formally a [[decree]] of the President). The Board of Directors is elected by the shareholders according to the bank [[statute]].

==== 2011 designation of new governor ====

On 25 October 2011, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] named [[Ignazio Visco]] as new governor of the bank, replacing Mario Draghi.
