'''''Apatosaurus''''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|p|æ|t|ɵ|ˈ|s|ɔr|ə|s}}, including the popular but scientifically redundant [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] '''''Brontosaurus''''', is a [[genus]] of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived from about 154 to 150 million years ago, during the [[Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] ([[Kimmeridgian]] and early [[Tithonian]] ages).<ref name=turner1999/> It was one of the [[Megafauna|largest land animals]] known to have ever existed, with an average length of {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a mass of at least {{convert|16|MT|ST}}.<ref name=henderson/> [[Fossil]]s of these animals have been found in [[Nine Mile Quarry]] and [[Bone Cabin Quarry]] in [[Wyoming]] and at sites in [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Utah]], present in stratigraphic zones 2–6.<ref name="foster-appendix">Foster, J. (2007). "Appendix." ''Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World''. Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329.</ref>

The cervical vertebrae were less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of ''[[Diplodocus]]'' and the bones of the leg were much stockier (despite being longer), implying a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Like most sauropods, ''Apatosaurus'' had only a single large claw on each forelimb, with the first three toes on the hind limb possessing claws.

==Etymology==
The composite term ''Apatosaurus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''apate'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπάτη}})/''apatelos'' ({{lang|grc|ἀπατηλός}}) meaning "deception"/"deceptive" and ''sauros'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:σαῦρος|σαῦρος]]}}) meaning "lizard"; thus, "deceptive lizard". Paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]  (1831 –1899) gave it this name, because he regarded the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevron bones]] as similar to those of some [[mosasaur]]s, members of a group of prehistoric marine lizards.

The skull was small in comparison with the size of the animal. The jaws were lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth, suited to an herbivorous diet. Like those of other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck were deeply bifurcated; that is, they carried paired spines, resulting in a wide and deep neck.<ref name=dinonathist>Fasovsky, D.E. and Weishampel, D.B.

''Apatosaurus'', like its close relative ''[[Supersaurus]]'', is notable for the incredibly tall spines on its vertebrae, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid, being comparatively slender, due to the vertebral spines rapidly decreasing in height the farther they are from the hips.

''Apatosaurus'' is a member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Diplodocidae]], a [[cladistics|clade]] of gigantic [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Supersaurus]]'', and ''[[Barosaurus]]''.

In 1877, Othniel Charles Marsh published the name of the [[type species]] ''Apatosaurus ajax''. He followed this in 1879 with a description of another, more complete specimen, which he thought represented a new [[genus]] and [[species]], which he named ''Brontosaurus excelsus''. In 1903, [[Elmer Riggs]] re-examined the fossils. While he agreed with Marsh that ''Brontosaurus excelsus'' was likely a distinct species, he also noted many similarities between ''B. excelsus'' and ''A. ajax'', and decided that both should be placed in the same genus. Riggs re-classified the species as ''Apatosaurus excelsus'' in 1903.<ref name="riggs-1903">{{cite journal

''Apatosaurus ajax'' is the [[type species]] of the genus, and was named by the [[paleontologist]] Othniel Charles Marsh in 1877 after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], the [[hero]] from [[Greek mythology]]. Two partial skeletons have been found, including part of a [[skull]]. ''Apatosaurus laticollis'', named by Marsh in 1879, is now considered a synonym of it.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1002/gj.3350270109}}</ref> ''Apatosaurus excelsus'' (originally ''Brontosaurus'') was named by Marsh in 1879. It is known from six partial skeletons, including part of a skull, which have been found in the [[United States]], in [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]]. ''Apatosaurus louisae'' was named by William Holland in 1915 in honor of Mrs. Louise Carnegie, wife of [[Andrew Carnegie]] who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. ''Apatosaurus louisae'' is known from one partial skeleton which was found in [[Utah]] in the United States. ''Apatosaurus parvus'' was originally known as ''Elosaurus parvus'', but was reclassified as a species of ''Apatosaurus'' in 1994.<ref name="CM94">Carpenter, K. and McIntosh, J. (1994).

[[Othniel Charles Marsh]], a Professor of [[Paleontology]] at [[Yale University]], described and named an incomplete (and juvenile) skeleton of ''Apatosaurus ajax'' in 1877. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at [[Como Bluff]] [[Wyoming]]—which, because of discrepancies including the size difference, Marsh incorrectly identified as belonging to an entirely new [[genus]] and [[species]]. He dubbed the new species ''Brontosaurus excelsus'', meaning "thunder lizard", from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] '''brontē/βροντη''' meaning "thunder" and '''sauros/σαυρος''' meaning "lizard", and from the [[Latin]] ''excelsus'', "highest, sublime", referring to the greater number of sacral vertebrae than in any other genus of sauropod known at the time.
[[File:Sharp lull brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Original (outdated) ''A. excelsus'' skeletal mount at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]]]]
The finds—the largest dinosaur ever discovered at the time and nearly complete, lacking only a head, feet, and portions of the tail—were then prepared for what was to be the first ever mounted display of a sauropod skeleton, at Yale's [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in 1905. The missing bones were created using known pieces from close relatives of ''Brontosaurus''. Sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry were added, as well as a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it should, as well as a composite model of what he felt the skull of this massive creature might look like. This was not a delicate ''[[Diplodocus]]''-style skull (which would later turn out to be more accurate<ref>{{Cite journal | author = McIntosh, J.S. and Berman, D.S. | year = 1975 | title = Description of the palate and lower jaw of the sauropod dinosaur ''Diplodocus'' (Reptilia: Saurischia) with remarks on the nature of the skull of ''Apatosaurus'' | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 187–199 | jstor =1303324 }}</ref>), but was composed of "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries",<ref name="Bakker">{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = Robert | year = 1994 | title = The Bite of the Bronto | url = | journal = Earth | volume = 3 | issue = 6| pages = 26–33 }}</ref> primarily those of ''[[Camarasaurus]]'', the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. This method of reconstructing incomplete skeletons based on the more complete remains of related dinosaurs continues in museum mounts and life restorations to this day. In 1979, two Carnegie researchers replaced the skull on the museum's skeleton with the correct head found in a quarry in Utah in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|last=NPR Staff|title=Forget Extinct: The Brontosaurus Never Even Existed|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166665795/forget-extinct-the-brontosaurus-never-even-existed|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> 

Despite the much-publicized debut of the mounted skeleton, which cemented the name ''Brontosaurus'' in the public consciousness, [[Elmer Riggs]] had published a paper in the 1903 edition of ''Geological Series of the Field Columbian Museum'' that argued that ''Brontosaurus'' was not different enough from ''Apatosaurus'' to warrant its own genus, and created the combination ''Apatosaurus excelsus'': "In view of these facts the two genera may be regarded as synonymous. As the term 'Apatosaurus' has priority, 'Brontosaurus' will be regarded as a synonym."<ref name="riggs-1903" />

Despite this, at least one paleontologist—[[Robert Bakker]]—argued in the 1990s that ''A. ajax'' and ''A. excelsus'' are in fact sufficiently distinct that the latter continues to merit a separate genus.<ref name="Bakker98">Bakker, R.T.

[[File:Apatosaurus33.jpg|thumb|[[Paleoart|Artistic interpretation]] of an individual arching its neck down to drink]] 
Until the 1970s, it was believed that sauropods like ''Apatosaurus'' were too massive to support their own weight on dry land, so it was theorized that they must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. Recent findings do not support this, and sauropods are thought to have been fully terrestrial animals.

In 2008, footprints of a juvenile ''Apatosaurus'' were reported from Quarry Five in Morrison, Colorado. Discovered in 2006 by Matthew Mossbrucker, these footprints show that juveniles could run on their hind legs in a manner similar to that of the modern [[Basiliscus (genus)|basilisk]] lizard.<ref name="smithsonian08">{{Cite journal|last=Rajewski|first=Genevieve|date=May 2008|title=Where Dinosaurs Roamed |journal=Smithsonian |pages=20–24 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/phenom-dino-200805.html |accessdate=2008-04-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080427162722/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/phenom-dino-200805.html| archivedate= 27 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Physiology===
Given the large body mass of ''Apatosaurus'', combined with its long neck, [[physiologist]]s have encountered problems determining how these animals managed to breathe.

Beginning with the assumption that ''Apatosaurus'', like [[crocodilia]]ns, did not have a diaphragm, the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about 184&nbsp;liters for a 30 ton specimen.

Its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]] (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) has been calculated based on the following [[respiratory system]]s:
* 904&nbsp;liters if avian
* 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian
* 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.

On this basis, its respiratory system could not have been reptilian, as its tidal volume would not have been able to replace its dead-space volume. Likewise, the mammalian system would only provide a fraction of new air on each breath. Therefore, it must have had either a system unknown in the modern world or [[Parabronchi|one like birds]], i.e., multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&nbsp;liters compared to a mammalian requirement of 2,950&nbsp;liters, which would exceed the available space. The overall thoracic volume of ''Apatosaurus'' has been estimated at 1,700&nbsp;liters allowing for a 500-liter, four-chambered [[heart]] (like [[bird]]s, not three-chambered like [[reptile]]s) and a 900-liter lung capacity. That would allow about 300&nbsp;liters for the necessary [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. Assuming ''Apatosaurus'' had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, it would need to consume only about 262&nbsp;liters (69 gallons) of water per day.<ref name="paladinoetal1997">Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P.

===Tail===
An article that appeared in the November 1997 issue of ''[[Discover Magazine]]'' reported research into the mechanics of ''Apatosaurus'' tails by [[Nathan Myhrvold]], a [[computer scientist]] from [[Microsoft]]. Myhrvold carried out a [[computer simulation]] of the tail, which in diplodocids like ''Apatosaurus'' was a very long, tapering structure resembling a [[bullwhip]]. This computer modeling suggested that sauropods were capable of producing a whip-like cracking sound of over 200 [[decibel]]s, comparable to the volume of a [[cannon]].<ref name="zimmer1997">Zimmer, C.

==In popular culture==

The length of time taken for Marsh's misclassification to be brought to public notice meant that the name ''Brontosaurus'', associated as it was with one of the largest dinosaurs, became so famous that it persisted long after the name had officially been abandoned in scientific use.<ref name="gould1991"/>

''Apatosaurus'' have often been depicted in cinema, beginning with [[Winsor McCay]]'s 1914 classic ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', one of the first animated films.<ref>{{cite book|title=Before Mickey: The Animated Film 1898-1928|author=Donald Crafton|year=1982|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-03083-7}}</ref> McCay based his unidentified dinosaur on the ''Brontosaurus'' skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[http://www.sdnhm.org/exhibits/dinosrr/index.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> The 1925 silent film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' featured a battle between a ''Brontosaurus'' and an ''[[Allosaurus]]'', using [[special effect]]s by [[Willis O'Brien]].<ref>Glut, Donald F.; Brett-Surman, Michael K.

ISBN 978-0-253-33349-0.</ref> These, and other early uses of the animal as major representative of the group, helped cement ''Brontosaurus'' as a quintessential dinosaur in the public consciousness.<ref name="gould1991"/>

[[Sinclair Oil]] has long been a fixture of American roads (and briefly in other countries) with its green dinosaur logo and mascot, an ''Apatosaurus'' (''Brontosaurus''). While Sinclair's early advertising included a number of different dinosaurs, eventually only ''Apatosaurus'' was used as the official logo, due to its popular appeal.<ref>Sinclair Oil Corporation, (2008).

As late as 1989, the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] caused controversy when it issued four "dinosaur" stamps: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', ''[[Pteranodon]]'' and ''Brontosaurus''. The use of the term ''Brontosaurus'' in place of ''Apatosaurus'', as well as the fact that ''Pteranodon''s were technically [[pterosaur]]s and not dinosaurs, led to complaints of "fostering scientific illiteracy."<ref name="NYT">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DC173CF932A25753C1A96F948260 " Topics of The Times; Leapin' Lizards!"] ''The New York Times'', 1989-10-11. Retrieved 2008-06-08.</ref> The Post Office defended itself (in Postal Bulletin 21744) by saying, "Although now recognized by the scientific community as ''Apatosaurus'', the name 'Brontosaurus' was used for the stamp because it is more familiar to the general population." [[Stephen Jay Gould]] also supported this position in his essay "[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]," though he echoed Riggs's original argument that ''Brontosaurus'' is a synonym for ''Apatosaurus''. Nevertheless, he noted that the former has developed and continues to maintain an independent existence in the popular imagination.<ref name="gould1991">Gould, S.J. (1991).
