[[Image:Consécration-de-Déodat.jpg|thumb|[[Episcopal consecration]] by one or more other bishops]]

'''Apostolic succession''' is the method whereby the ministry of the [[Christian Church]] is held to be derived from the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops.<ref name=ODCC>F.L. Cross, E.A. Livingstone (editors), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 ISBN 978-0-19-280290-3), article "apostolic succession"</ref> This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a [[Apostolic see|particular see founded by one or more of the apostles]], but it is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles.<ref name=ETT/>

Apostolic succession "may also be understood as a continuity in doctrinal teaching from the time of the apostles to the present"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=y_RpbmWNfHcC&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=%22apostolic+succession%22+anglican&source=bl&ots=TUICDSwWqB&sig=pNp6s1xOVsvx9f4019oYaO5xnL0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NvhRUM6iDsiJhQf0pYHgBg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22apostolic%20succession%22%20anglican&f=false Donald S.

''The Church''. John Knox press: 1980, p.229</ref>

Those who hold for the importance of apostolic succession via episcopal [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] appeal to the [[New Testament]], which, they say, implies a personal apostolic succession (from [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] and [[Apostle Titus|Titus]], for example). They appeal as well to other documents of the early Church, especially the Epistle of St. Clement.<ref>Adam, Karl. ''The Spirit of Catholicism'' Doubleday & C°, Inc: 1957 p. 20</ref>  In this context, Clement explicitly states that the apostles appointed bishops as successors and directed that these bishops should in turn appoint their own successors; given this, such leaders of the Church were not to be removed without cause and not in this way. Further, proponents of the necessity of the personal apostolic succession of bishops within the Church point to the universal practice of the undivided early Church (up to AD 431), before being divided into the [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Catholic Church]].

Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] deny the need for this type of continuity<ref name=ODCC/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/apostolic_succession.jsp |title="Apostolic Succession" in '&#39;The Columbia Encyclopedia'&#39;, Sixth Edition (Columbia University Press 2004) |publisher=Questia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>  and the historical claims involved have been severely questioned; Eric Jay comments that the account given of the emergence of the episcopate in chapter III of ''Lumen Gentium'' "is very sketchy, and many ambiguities in the early history of the Christian ministry are passed over"<ref>Jay, Eric G. ''The Church'' John Knox Press: 1980, p.317f</ref>

== Meanings ==
[[Michael Ramsey]] (Archbishop of Canterbury, 1961-1974), described three meanings of "apostolic succession":
# One bishop succeeding another in the same see meant that there was a continuity of teaching: "while the Church as a whole is the vessel into which the truth is poured, the Bishops are an important organ in carrying out this task".
# The bishops were also successors of the apostles in that "the ''functions'' they performed of preaching, governing and ordaining were the same as the Apostles had performed".
# It is also used to signify that "grace is transmitted from the Apostles by each generation of bishops through the imposition of hands".
He adds that this last has been controversial in that it has been claimed that this aspect of the doctrine is not found before the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]], while others allege that it is implicit in the Church of the second and third centuries.<ref>Ramsey, Arthur Michael. ''The Gospel and the Catholic Church'' (translated from the Spanish edition published in the Dominican Republic: 1964, pp.134ff)</ref>

In its 1982 statement on [[Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry]], the Faith and Order Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] stated that "the primary manifestation of apostolic succession is to be found in the apostolic tradition of the Church as a whole…. Under the particular historical circumstances of the growing Church in the early centuries, the succession of bishops became one of the ways, together with the transmission of the Gospel and the life of the community, in which the apostolic tradition of the Church was expressed."<ref>[http://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-commissions/faith-and-order-commission/i-unity-the-church-and-its-mission/baptism-eucharist-and-ministry-faith-and-order-paper-no-111-the-lima-text ''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'', 35, 36]</ref> It spoke of episcopal succession as something that churches that do not have bishops can see "as a sign, though not a guarantee, of the continuity and unity of the Church" and that all churches can see "as a sign of the apostolicity of the life of the whole church".<ref>''Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry'', 38</ref>

The Porvoo Common Statement (1996), agreed to by the Anglican churches of the British Isles and most of the Lutheran churches of Scandinavia and the Baltic, also stated that "the continuity signified in the consecration of a bishop to episcopal ministry cannot be divorced from the continuity of life and witness of the diocese to which he is called."<ref>[http://www.porvoochurches.org/whatis/output03.php], [http://www.porvoochurches.org/whatis/resources-0201-english.php], sec. 49</ref>

The teaching of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on apostolic succession<ref>essentially ''Lumen Gentium'', 19-21</ref> has been summed up as follows:
:Bishops have succeeded the apostles, not only because they come after them, but also because they have inherited apostolic power. ... "To fulfil this apostolic mission, Christ ... promised the Holy Spirit to the apostles...". [These were] "enriched by Christ the Lord with a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit ... This spiritual gift has been transmitted down to us by episcopal consecration".<ref>Wells, David F. ''Revolution in Rome'', Tyndale Press: 1973, p.36</ref>

==In the early Fathers==

The doctrine was formulated in the second century in the first of the [[#Meanings|three senses given by Ramsey]], originally as a response to [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] claims of having received secret teaching from Christ or the apostles; it emphasised the public<ref>{{cite book| title=Early Christian Doctrines| last=Kelly| first=J.N.D|publisher=A&C Black|location=London| year=1965| page=37}}</ref> manner in which the apostles had passed on authentic teaching to those whom they entrusted with the care of the churches they founded and that these in turn had passed it on to their successors.<ref name=ETT>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Gonz%C3%A1lez+%22succession+originally+an%22&btnG= |title=Justo L.

Writing about AD 94, Clement of Rome states that the apostles appointed successors to continue their work where they had planted churches and for these in their turn to do the same because they foresaw the risk of discord. He uses both 'bishop' and 'presbyter' to refer to these men.  The interpretation of his writing is disputed, but it is clear that he supports some sort of approved continuation of the apostolic ministry<ref>Jay, Eric G. ''The Church'', John Knox Press (1978). p.31ff citing ''Ad Cor. xliiff''</ref> which in its turn was derived from Christ.<ref name=ODCC/>

[[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]] (180?) and [[Irenaeus]] (180) introduce explicitly the idea of the bishop's succession in office as a guarantee of the truth of what he preached in that it could be traced back to the apostles.<ref name="kjw1">Woollcombe, K.J. "The Ministry and the Order of the Church in the Works of the Fathers" in ''The Historic Episcopate''. Kenneth M. Carey(ed) Dacre Press (1954) p.31f</ref> and they produced succession lists to back this up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Prusak+%22Irenaeus+brought%22&btnG= |title=Bernard B. Prusak, '&#39;The Church Unfinished'&#39;(Paulist Press 2004 ISBN 978-0-8091-4286-6), p. 125 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>  That this succession depended on the fact of ordination to a vacant see and the status of those who administered the ordination is seldom commented on. Woollcombe also states that no one questioned the apostolicity of the See of Alexandria despite the fact that its Popes were consecrated by the college of presbyters up till the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325.<ref name="kjw1" /> Irenaeus also refers to a succession of presbyters who preserve the tradition "which originates from the apostles".<ref name="jay1">Jay, Eric G. ''The Church'', John Knox Press (1978). p.47f citing ''Adv. Haer. III.ii.2'' and IV.xxvi.2 respectively</ref> and later goes on to speak of their having "an infallible gift of truth"[''charisma veritatis certum'']. Jay comments that this is sometimes seen as an early reference to the idea of the transmission of grace through the apostolic succession which in later centuries was understood as being specifically transmitted through the laying on of hands by a bishop within the apostolic succession (the "pipeline theory").  He warns that this is open to the grave objection that it makes grace a (quasi)material commodity and represents an almost mechanical method of imparting what is by definition a free gift.  He adds that the idea cannot be squeezed out of Irenaeus' words.<ref name="jay1" />

Writing a little later, Tertullian makes the same main point but adds expressly that recently founded churches (such as his own in Carthage) could be considered apostolic if they had "derived the tradition of faith and the seeds of doctrine" from an apostolic church.<ref>Jay, Eric G. ''The Church'', John Knox Press (1978). p.51 citing ''De Praescr. xx,xxi''</ref>  His disciple, [[Cyprian]] ([[Bishop of Carthage]] 248-58) appeals to the same fundamental principle of election to a vacant see in the aftermath of the [[Decius#Persecution of Christians|Decian Persecution]] when denying the legitimacy of his rigorist rival in Carthage and that of the anti-pope [[Novatian]] in Rome; however, the emphasis is now on legitimating his episcopal ministry as a whole and specifically his exclusive right to administer discipline to the lapsed rather than on the content of what is taught.<ref>Jay, Eric G. ''The Church'', John Knox Press (1978). p.67f</ref> Cyprian also laid great emphasis on the fact that any minister who broke with the Church lost ''ipso facto'' the gift of the Spirit which had validated his orders. This meant that he had no power or authority to celebrate an efficacious sacrament.<ref>Woollcombe, K.J. "The Ministry and the Order of the Church in the Works of the Fathers" in ''The Historic Episcopate'' Kenneth M. Carey(ed) Dacre Press (1954) pp.56,7</ref>

==As transmission of grace==
For the adherents of this understanding of '''apostolic succession''' grace is transmitted during [[Consecration (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecrations]] (the [[ordination]] of bishops) by the [[laying on of hands]] of bishops previously consecrated within the apostolic succession. This lineage of ordination is traceable, according to "apostolic" churches, to the original [[Twelve Apostles]], thus making the Church the continuation of the early [[Apostolic Age|Apostolic Christian community]]. It is "one of four elements which define the true Church of Jesus Christ"<ref>Oskar Sommel, ''Rudolf Stählin Christliche Religion,'' Frankfurt 1960, p.19</ref> and legitimizes the ministry of its clergy, as only a bishop within the succession can perform legitimate or "valid" ordinations.  Furthermore, only bishops and [[Priesthood|presbyters (priests)]] ordained by bishops in the apostolic succession can validly celebrate or "confect" several of the other [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]], including the [[Eucharist]], [[Confession (religion)|reconciliation of penitents]], [[confirmation]] and [[anointing of the sick]].

This position was stated by [[John Henry Newman]] in the following words:
<blockquote>We [priests of the Church of England] have been born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  The Lord Jesus Christ gave His Spirit to His Apostles; they in turn laid their hands on those who should succeed them; and these again on others; and so the sacred gift has been handed down to our present bishops, who have appointed us as their assistants, and in some sense representatives. .... we must necessarily consider none to be 'really'' ordained who have not ''thus'' been ordained.<ref>''Tracts for the Times - Number 1'', emphases in original, cited Dean Church. ''The Oxford movement'' MacMillan & C°: 1892</ref></blockquote>

==Apostolicity as doctrinal and related continuity==
Most [[Protestant]] denominations deny the need of maintaining episcopal continuity with the early Church, holding that the role of the apostles was that, having been chosen directly by Jesus as witnesses of his resurrection, they were to be the "special instruments of the Holy Spirit in founding and building up the Church".<ref name="Litton">Litton, E.A. ''Introduction to Dogmatic Theology''. James Clarke & C°: 1960, p.388</ref>  The Church is "built upon 'the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles' (Ephes. ii. 20); but a foundation does not repeat itself".<ref name="Litton" />  When the apostles died, they were replaced by their writings.<ref>Litton, E.A. ''Introduction to Dogmatic Theology''. James Clarke & C°: 1960, p.389</ref> To share with the apostles the same faith, to believe their word as found in the Scriptures, to receive the same Holy Spirit, is to them the only meaningful "continuity".  The most meaningful ''apostolic succession'' for most Protestants, then, is a "faithful succession" of apostolic teaching.

Max Thurian describes the classic Reformed/Presbyterian concept of apostolic succession in the following terms.  "The Christian ministry is not derived from the people but from the pastors; a scriptural ordinance provides for this ministry being renewed by the ordination of a presbyter by presbyters; this ordinance originates with the apostles, who were themselves presbyters, and through them it goes back to Christ as its source.".<ref>quoted by Thurian from a report to the 1911 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland</ref>  However, in itself:
:"it does not guarantee the continuity and faithfulness of the Church.  A purely historical or mechanical succession of ministers, bishops or pastors would not mean ''ipso facto'' true apostolic succession in the church, Reformed tradition, following authentic Catholic tradition, distinguishes four realities which make up the true apostolic succession, symbolized, but not absolutely guaranteed, by ministerial succession."<ref name="Thurian">Thurian, Max. ''Priesthood & Ministry''. Paula Clifford (tr) Mowbrays: 1983, pp.167f</ref>
These realities form a "composite faithfulness" and are (i) "perseverance in the apostolic doctrine"; (ii) "the will to proclaim God's word"; (iii) "communion in the fundamental continuity of the Church, the Body of Christ, the faithful celebration of Baptism and the Eucharist"; (iv) "succession in the laying on of hands, the sign of ministerial continuity".<ref name="Thurian" />

===Objections to the transmission of grace theory===
Protestants have objected that this theory is not explicitly found in Scripture<ref name="gt">Thomas, Griffith. ''The Principles of Theology''. Church Book Room Press:1963, p.357</ref> and the New Testament uses 'bishop' and 'presbyter' as alternative names for the same office.<ref name="gt" />  Furthermore, it is not clearly found in the writings of the Fathers before [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] in the fourth century and attempts to read it back as implicit in earlier writers<ref>Ramsey, Arthur Michael. ''The Gospel and the Catholic Church'' (translated from the Spanish edition published in the Dominican Republic: 1964, p.136)</ref> are flawed because it is possible to show that significant changes occurred.<br />

For example, Barrett points out that the Pastoral Epistles are concerned that ministers of the generation of Timothy and Titus should pass on the doctrine they had received to the third generation.  Teaching and preaching are "the main, almost the only, activities of ministry."  However, in Clement of Rome ministerial activity is liturgical: the undifferentiated 'presbyter-bishops' are to "make offerings to the Lord at the right time and in the right places" something which is simply not defined by the evangelists.  More significant still is the change in the use of sacrificial language: for Paul the Eucharist is a receiving of gifts from God, the Christian sacrifice is the offering of our bodies (Romans 12).<ref>Barrett, C.K. ''Church, Ministry and Sacraments in the New Testament'' Paternoster Press: 1993, p.92f</ref> Moving on to Ignatius of Antioch, Barrett states that here we find a sharp distinction between 'presbyter' and 'bishop': the latter now stands out as "an isolated figure" who is to be obeyed and without whom it is not lawful to baptise or hold a love-feast.<ref>Barrett, C.K. ''Church, Ministry and Sacraments in the New Testament'' Paternoster Press: 1993, p.94f</ref>  He also points out that when Ignatius writes to the Romans, there is no mention of a bishop of the Roman Church, "which we may suppose had not not yet adopted the monarchical episcopate."<ref>Barrett, C.K. ''Church, Ministry and Sacraments in the New Testament'' Paternoster Press: 1993, p.95</ref> Jalland comes to a similar conclusion and locates the change from the "polyepiscopacy" of the house churches in Rome to monepiscopacy as occurring before the middle of the second century.<ref>Jalland, Trevor Gervaise. ''The Church and the Papacy''. SPCK: 1944, pp.80ff</ref><br />

Similar objections are voiced by Harvey who comments that there is a "strong and ancient tradition" that the presence of an ordained man is necessary for the celebration of the Eucharist. But, there is "certainly no evidence for this view in the New Testament" and in the case of Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch the implication is not that it ''cannot'' be celebrated by anyone else, but that it ''ought'' not.  In the third century, this "concern for propriety" begins to be displaced by the concept of 'power' to do so which means that in the absence of such a man it is "literally impossible" for a Eucharist to be celebrated.<ref>Harvey, A.E. ''Priest or President?''. SPCK:1975, pp.45f</ref>

==Churches claiming apostolic succession==

Churches that claim some form of [[historical episcopate|episcopal apostolic succession]], dating back to the apostles or to leaders from the apostolic era,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01648b.htm Apostolicity] [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] article</ref> include the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, the [[Church of the East]], the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]], the [[Liberal Catholic Church]] and some [[Lutheran Church]]es (see [[#Lutheran churches|below]]). The [[Anglican Communion]] (see [[#Anglican Churches|below]]) and those Lutheran Churches which claim apostolic succession do not specifically teach this but exclusively practice episcopal ordination. While some Anglicans claim it for their communion, their views are often nuanced and there is widespread reluctance to 'unchurch' Christian bodies which lack it.<ref>Ramsey, Arthur Michael. ''From Gore to Temple'' Longmans: 1960, pp.119-24</ref>

Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, and the Old Catholic Church (Union of Utrecht only). The Eastern Orthodox generally recognize Roman Catholic orders, but have a different concept of the apostolic succession as it exists outside of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. The lack of apostolic succession through bishops is the primary basis on which Protestant communities are not considered ''churches'' by the Orthodox churches and the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name="vatican.va">"[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.htmlResponsesto Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church]", published 10 July 2007.</ref>

==Apostolic founders==

An early understanding of apostolic succession is represented by the traditional claims of various churches, as organized around important [[episcopal see]]s, to have been founded by specific apostles. On the basis of these traditions, the churches in question often claim to have inherited specific authority, doctrines and/or practices on the authority of their founding apostle(s), which is understood to be continued by the bishops of the [[apostolic throne]] of the church that each founded and whose original leader he was. Thus:

{{rquote|right|Wherefore we must obey the priests of the Church who have succession from the Apostles, as we have shown, who, together with succession in the episcopate, have received the mark of truth according to the will of the Father; all others, however, are to be suspected, who separated themselves from the principal succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103426.htm |title=Adversus Haereses (Book IV, Chapter 26) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>|[[Irenaeus]]}}

In [[Roman Catholic]] theology, the doctrine of apostolic succession states that Christ gave the full sacramental authority of the Church to the [[Twelve Apostles]] in the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]], making them the first [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]]. By conferring the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders on the apostles, they were given the authority to confer the sacrament of Holy Orders on others, thus consecrating more bishops in a direct lineage that can trace its origin back to the Twelve Apostles and Christ. This direct succession of bishops from the apostles to the present day bishops is referred to as apostolic succession.
[[Papal primacy]] is different though related to apostolic succession as described here. The Catholic Church has traditionally claimed a unique leadership role for the Apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]], believed to have been named by Jesus as head of the Apostles and as a focus of their unity, who became the first Bishop of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]], and whose successors inherited the role and accordingly became the leaders of the worldwide Church as well. Even so, Catholicism acknowledges the papacy is built on apostolic succession, not the other way around. As such, apostolic succession is a foundational doctrine of authority in the Catholic Church.<ref>"If the very order of episcopal succession is to be considered, how much more surely, truly, and safely do we number them from Peter himself, to whom, as to one representing the whole Church, the Lord said, ‘Upon this rock I will build my Church’....{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|16:18}} Peter was succeeded by Linus, Linus by Clement, Clement by Anacletus, Anacletus by Evaristus..." (St. Augustine; Letters 53:1:2 [A.D. 412]).</ref><ref>The Roman Catholic position is summarized this way: "The Lord says to Peter: ‘I say to you,’ he says, ‘that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it ....’{{bibleref2c|Mt.|16:18}} On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep,{{bibleref2c|Jn|21:17}} and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity.... If someone [today] does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he still be confident that he is in the Church?" (Cyprian of Carthage; The Unity of the Catholic Church 4; first edition [A.D. 251]). [http://www.catholic.com/library/Peter_Successors.asp Peter's Successors]. Catholic Answers.</ref>

Catholicism holds that Christ entrusted the Apostles with the leadership of the community of believers, and the obligation to transmit and preserve the "deposit of faith" (the experience of Christ and his teachings contained in the doctrinal "tradition" handed down from the time of the apostles and the written portion, which is Scripture). The apostles then passed on this office and authority by ordaining bishops to follow after them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect2chpt3art9p3.shtml#861 |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, #861-862 |publisher=Old.usccb.org |date=1975-12-14 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>

Roman Catholic theology holds that the apostolic succession effects the power and authority to administer the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] except for [[baptism]] and [[matrimony]]. (Baptism may be administered by anyone and matrimony by the couple to each other). Authority to so administer such sacraments is passed on only through the sacrament of [[Holy Orders]], a rite by which a priest is ordained (ordination can be conferred only by a bishop). The bishop, of course, must be from an unbroken line of bishops stemming from the original apostles selected by Jesus Christ. Thus, apostolic succession is necessary for the valid celebration of the sacraments today.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the early 18th century, Pope Benedict XIII, whose orders were descended from [[Scipione Rebiba]], personally consecrated at least 139 bishops for various important European sees, including German, French, English and New World bishops. These bishops in turn consecrated bishops almost exclusively for their respective countries causing other episcopal lineages to die off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/res7gdmc/aposccs/ |title=Apostolic succession in the Roman Catholic Church |publisher=Mysite.verizon.net |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the apostolic successions of the bishops, and therefore the rest of the clergy, of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian, Old Catholic, and some Independent Catholic Churches. Rome does not recognize any Anglican orders as valid. This conflict stems over the Anglican Church's revision of its rite of ordination for its bishops during the 16th century. Most of today's Anglican bishops would trace their succession back through a bishop who was ordained with the revised form and thus would be viewed as invalid. However, all Anglican bishops in Europe today<ref name="dufort"/> can claim a line of succession through bishops who had only been ordained through the old rite. This was achieved through several different means: ordinations by the schismatic Catholic bishops of the Old Catholic and Independent Catholic Churches who converted to Anglicanism.  This has not affected the official Roman opinion in any way since their objection was based fundamentally on the intention of the rite and the question has been further complicated by the ordination of women which as seen as implying that, in ordination, the Anglican Communion does not intend to do what the Roman Catholic Church does.<ref>R. William Franklin(ed). ''Anglican Orders''. Mowbray 1996 pp.72,73(note 11), 104</ref>

On 29 June 2007, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] explained why apostolic succession is integral to, and indeed, "a constitutive element" of the Church. In response to the question why the [[Second Vatican Council]] and other official statements of the Catholic Church do not call Protestant Christian Communities "Churches", it stated that "according to Catholic doctrine, these Communities do not enjoy ''apostolic succession'' in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church. These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called 'Churches' in the proper sense".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html |title=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, '&#39;Responses to some questions regarding certain aspects of the doctrine of the Church'&#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>

====Debate among some Catholic theologians====
Differing interpretations are offered by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and by some Catholic theologians.<ref>McBrien, Richard P. "[http://ncronline.org/node/1862 Debate over role of 'bishop' in apostolic succession is a church-dividing issue]." The National Catholic Reporter, 19 September 2008. Web: 21 February 2010.</ref> According to liberal Catholic theologian Richard P. McBrien, professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, and Boston College theologian Francis Sullivan, debate over the role of the "bishop" in apostolic succession is a church-dividing issue.  Of course, from a Catholic point of view, the bishops in communion with the Pope (the Church's [[Magisterium]]) have the final say in the matter, as they, not theologians, are the successors of the Apostles and have doctrinal authority.

McBrien calls for rejection of what he terms the passing-the-baton theory, which he characterizes as "an overly simplistic, mechanistic notion." McBrien says many Catholics accept the commonly understood definition of the doctrine; specifically, the claim that each validly ordained Catholic bishop can trace his episcopal consecration in an unbroken line back to one of the original apostles or to the apostles, collectively. He quotes Jesuit Professor Francis Sullivan's two reasons for opposing such a view:
* The apostles were not bishops in the present-day meaning of the word. They were missionaries and founders of local churches.
* Second, while some local churches had pastoral leaders who were called bishops, {{Bibleref2c|Ac|20:17-35||Ac 20:17-35}} it remains unclear whether these “bishops” were appointed or ordained by the apostle Paul, or by any other apostle.

McBrien has no complaint with the succession doctrine, but with the way it is so often explained. He says that Catholic theologians today would point to Vatican&nbsp;II’s declaration that apostolic succession is “by divine institution” (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church). McBrien maintains this interpretation should ''not'' be understood to mean that Christ explicitly determined the episcopal structures of either the local churches or dioceses.

===Orthodox Churches===
[[File:Cheirotonia Presbyter 2.jpeg|thumb|Ordination of an Orthodox priest by laying on of hands. Orthodox Christians view apostolic succession as an important, God-ordained mechanism by which the structure and teaching of the Church are perpetuated.]]

While Eastern Orthodox sources often refer to the bishops as "successors of the apostles" under the influence of Scholastic theology, strict Orthodox ecclesiology and theology hold that all legitimate bishops are properly successors of Peter.<ref>See Meyendorff J., Byzantine Theology</ref> This also means that presbyters (or "priests") are successors of the apostles. As a result, Orthodox theology makes a distinction between a geographical or historical succession and proper [[Ontology|ontological]] or ecclesiological succession. Hence, the bishops of [[Pope|Rome]] and [[Bishop of Antioch|Antioch]] can be considered successors of Peter in a historical sense on account of Peter's presence in the early community. This does not imply that these bishops are more successors of Peter than all others in an ontological sense.<ref>Cleenewerck, Laurent. His Broken Body. Washington, DC: EUC Press, 2007. p. 86-89</ref>

According to ancient canons still observed with the Orthodox communion, a bishop must be consecrated by at least three other bishops; so-called "single handed ordinations" do not exist. Moreover, bishops are never ordained "at large" but only for a specific Eucharist community, in due historical and sacramental succession.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Views concerning other churches====

The [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] have often permitted non-Orthodox clergy to be rapidly ordained within Orthodoxy as a matter of pastoral necessity and [[Economy (Eastern Orthodoxy)|economia]]. Priests entering Eastern Orthodoxy from Oriental Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism have usually been received by "vesting" and have been allowed to function immediately within Eastern Orthodoxy as priests. Recognition of Roman Catholic orders by the Russian Orthodox Church was stipulated in 1667 by the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|Synod of Moscow]],<ref>Cleenewerck, Laurent. His Broken Body. Washington, DC: EUC Press, 2007. p. 138</ref> but this position is not universal within the Eastern Orthodox communion.  The validity of a priest's ordination is decided by each autocephalic Orthodox church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/seia/ordinati.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723002517/http://www.usccb.org/seia/ordinati.shtml |archivedate=2011-07-23 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}</ref>

When [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke away from the jurisdiction of Rome in 1533/4, the English Church retained the [[episcopal polity]] and apostolic succession inherent in its Catholic past; however, [[Protestant]] theology gained a certain foothold<ref>Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Pelican (1960) pp.49,61</ref> and under his successor, [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] what had been an administrative schism became a Protestant reformation under the guiding hand of [[Thomas Cranmer]].<ref>Neill, Stephen.

''Anglicanism'' Pelican (1960) p.131</ref> apostolic succession was not seen as a major concern: English Reformers such as [[Richard Hooker]] rejected the Catholic position that Apostolic Succession is divinely commanded or necessary for true Christian ministry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Archer |first1=Stanley |last2= |first2= |year=1993 |title=Hooker on Apostolic Succession: The Two Voices |journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal |publisher= |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=67–74 |jstor=2541798 |doi=|quote="While he argues that the rank originated with the Apostles, enjoyed divine approval, and flourished throughout Christendom, he rejects the view inherent in the Catholic position that the office is divinely commanded or is a result of divine law." }}</ref>  The "''foreign'' Reformed [Presbyterian] Churches" were genuine ones despite the lack of apostolic succession because they had been abandoned by their bishops at the Reformation.<ref>Norris, Richard A. "Episcopacy" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Sykes, Stephen & Booty, John (eds) SPCK(1988), p.304</ref>
In very different ways both [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England]] made it plain that the Church of England could no longer count on the 'godly prince' to maintain its identity and traditions and the 'High Church' clergy of the time began to look to the idea of apostolic succession as a basis for the church's life.  For William Beveridge (Bp of St Asaph 1704-8) the importance of this lay in the fact that Christ himself is "continually present at such imposition of hands; thereby transferring the same Spirit, which He had first breathed into His Apostles, upon others successively after them".,<ref>Norris, Richard A. "Episcopacy" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Sykes, Stephen & Booty, John (eds) SPCK(1988), p.305</ref> but the doctrine did not really come to the fore until the time of the Tractarians.<ref>Webster, John B. "Ministry and Priesthood" in ''The Study of Anglicanism'' Sykes, Stephen & Booty, John (eds) SPCK(1988), p.305</ref>

[[John Henry Newman|Newman]] writing of the apostolic succession stated: "We must necessarily consider none to be ''really'' ordained who has not been ''thus'' ordained".  After quoting this,<ref>Ramsey, Arthur Michael. ''From Gore to Temple'' Longmans(1960) p.111. All quotations in this paragraph are from this work, unless otherwise indicated.</ref> [[Michael Ramsey]] continues: "With romantic enthusiasm, the Tractarians propagated this doctrine.  In doing so they involved themselves in some misunderstandings of history and in some confusion of theology".  He goes on to explain that they ascribed to early Anglican authors a far more exclusive version of the doctrine than was the case, they blurred the distinction between succession in office (Irenaeus) and succession in consecration (Augustine); they spoke of apostolic succession as the channel of grace in a way that failed to do justice to His gracious activity within all the dispensations of the New Covenant.<sup>(p.&nbsp;111)</sup> Newman, and after him, [[Charles Gore]] held that the episcopate was passed down from the apostles through men like Timothy and Titus to single bishops in particular localities (monarchial episcopacy).  However Bp. Lightfoot argued that monarchial episcopacy evolved upwards from a college of presbyters by the elevation of one of their number to be the episcopal president<sup>(p.&nbsp;116)</sup> and A.C Headlam laid great stress on Irenaeus' understanding of succession (see [[#Apostolic succession in the Early Fathers|above]]) which had been lost from sight behind the Augustinian 'pipe-line theory'.<sup>(pp.&nbsp;117,18)</sup>

====Eastern Orthodox views on Anglican orders====
In the 20th century there have been a variety of positions taken by the various [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es on the validity of Anglican orders. In 1922 the Patriarch of Constantinople recognized them as valid.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm The Ecumenical Patriarch on Anglican Orders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He wrote: "That the orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders."

Succeeding judgements, however, have been more conflicting. The Eastern Orthodox churches require a totality of common teaching to recognize orders and in this broader view find ambiguities in Anglican teaching and practice problematic. Accordingly, in practice Anglican clergy who convert to Orthodoxy are treated as if they had not been ordained and must be ordained in the Eastern Orthodox communion as would a lay person.<ref>[http://www.orthodox.clara.net/orthodoxy_and_anglicanism.htm The Orthodox Web Site for information about the faith, life and worship of the Orthodox Church]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref>

====Roman Catholic judgment on Anglican orders====
[[File:Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|upright|Pope Leo XIII rejected Anglican arguments for apostolic succession in his bull ''Apostolicae Curae''.]]
In the Catholic Church, [[Pope Leo XIII]] stated in his 1896 [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Apostolicae Curae]]'' that the [[Catholic Church]] believes specifically that the Anglican Church's consecrations are "absolutely null and utterly void" because of changes made to the rite of consecration under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], thus denying that Anglicans participate in the apostolic succession. Anglican clergy, then, are ordained as Catholic priests upon entry into the Catholic Church.<ref>Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Pelican:1960, p.105</ref>

A reply from the Archbishops of Canterbury and York (1896) was issued to counter Pope Leo's arguments: ''[[Saepius Officio]]: Answer of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to the Bull Apostolicae Curae of H. H. Leo XIII''.<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/saepius.htm] {{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> They argued that if the Anglican orders were invalid, then the Roman orders were as well since the Pope based his case on the fact that the Anglican ordinals used did not contain certain essential elements but these were not found in the early Roman rites either.<ref>For if the Pope shall by a new decree declare our Fathers of two hundred and fifty years ago wrongly ordained, there is nothing to hinder the inevitable sentence that by the same law all who have been similarly ordained have received no orders. And if our Fathers, who used in 1550 and 1552 forms which as he (the Pope) says are null, were altogether unable to reform them in 1662, (Roman) Fathers come under the self-same law. And if Hippolytus and Victor and Leo and Gelasius and Gregory have some of them said too little in their rites about the priesthood and the high priesthood, and nothing about the power of offering the sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ, the Church of Rome herself has an invalid priesthood... [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/saepius.htm Archbishops of England: ''Saepius Officio'': Answer of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to the Bull Apostolicae Curae of H. H. Leo XIII]</ref> However, Catholics argue, this argument does not consider the sacramental intention involved in validating Holy Orders. In other words, Catholics believe that the ordinands were reworded so as to invalidate the ordinations because the intention behind the alterations in the rite was a fundamental change in Anglican understanding of the priesthood.<ref>Franklin, R. William. "Introduction: The Opening of the Vatican Archives and the ARCIC Process" in Franklin, R. William (ed)''Anglican orders'' Mowbray:1996</ref>

It is Roman Catholic doctrine that the teaching of ''Apostolicae Curae'' is a truth to be "held definitively", as evidenced by commentary by then-Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI.<ref>With regard to those truths connected to revelation by historical necessity and which are to be held definitively, but are not able to be declared as divinely revealed, the following examples can be given: the legitimacy of the election of the Supreme Pontiff or of the celebration of an ecumenical council, the canonizations of saints (dogmatic facts), the declaration of Pope Leo XIII in the Apostolic Letter Apostolicae Curae on the invalidity of Anglican ordinations... {{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFADTU.HTM |title=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: '&#39;Doctrinal commentary on the concluding formula of the '&#39;professio fidei |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716005711/http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFADTU.HTM| archivedate= 16 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] explained the conditional character of his ordination of [[Graham Leonard]], former Anglican bishop of the Diocese of London, to the priesthood in the following way:  "While firmly restating the judgment of ''Apostolicae Curae'' that Anglican ordination is invalid, the Catholic Church takes account of the involvement, in some Anglican episcopal ordinations, of bishops of the Old Catholic Church of the Union of Utrecht who are validly ordained. In particular and probably rare cases the authorities in Rome may judge that there is a 'prudent doubt' concerning the invalidity of priestly ordination received by an individual Anglican minister ordained in this line of succession."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/malleus/hume_statement.html |title=Statement of Cardinal Hume on the Ordination of Anglican Bishop Graham Leonard as a Roman Catholic Priest |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> but this opinion is not widely endorsed. Since ''Apostolicae Curae'' was issued many Anglican jurisdictions have revised their ordinals, bringing them more in line with ordinals of the early Church.

Timothy Dufort, writing in [[The Tablet]] in 1982, argued that by 1969 all Anglican bishops had acquired apostolic succession fully recognized by Rome,<ref name="dufort">Timothy Dufort, ''The Tablet'', 29 May 1982, pp. 536–538.</ref> since from the 1930s [[Old Catholic]] bishops (whose orders Rome recognizes as valid) have acted as co-consecrators in the ordination of Anglican bishops. This view is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church itself, which continues to require that Anglican clergy be ordained absolutely (not conditionally) if they are to exercise a ministry in that church.

===Porvoo Communion of Churches===
Negotiated at [[Järvenpää]], Finland, and inaugurated with a celebration of the eucharist at [[Porvoo Cathedral]] in 1992, this agreement of unity includes the mutual recognition of the traditional apostolic succession among the following Churches:

* Lutheran Churches: [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Iceland]], [[Church of Norway]], [[Church of Sweden]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania]], [[Church of Denmark]], observer: [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]].<ref>See below, section: "Lutheran Churches".</ref>

* Anglican Communion: [[Church of Ireland]], [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], [[Church of England]], the [[Church in Wales]], the [[Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church]], and the [[Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church]].

Of note is the fact that at least one of the Scandinavian Lutheran Churches in the Porvoo Communion of Churches, the [[Church of Denmark]] has bishops, but strictly speaking they were not in the historic apostolic succession prior to their entry into the Porvoo Communion, since their Episcopate and Holy Orders derived from Dr. [[Johannes Bugenhagen]], who was a pastor, not a bishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/lutherania/denmark.html |title=The Church of Denmark and the Anglican Communion |publisher=Anglicanhistory.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> In 2010, the Church of Denmark joined the Porvoo Communion of Churches.

====Indifference to the issue====
Many German Lutherans appear to demur on this issue, which may be sourced in the [[Church Order (Lutheran)|church governance views]] of [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Martin Luther, ''An Appeal to the Ruling Class of German Nationality as to the Amelioration of the State of Christendom'' (1520), reprinted in Lewis W. Spitz, editor, ''The Protestant Reformation'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall 1966) at 51-59. E.g., "When a bishop consecrates, he simply acts on behalf of the entire congregation, all of whom have the same authority." ... "[T]he status of priest among Christians is merely that of an office-bearer; while he holds the office he exercises it; if he be deposed he resumes his status in the community and becomes like the rest. ... All these are human inventions and regulations." ''Ibid.'' at 54, 55.</ref> Luther's reform movement, however, usually did not as a rule abrogate the ecclesiastic office of [[Bishop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/defense_13_ecclesiasticalorder.php |title=Defense of the Augsburg confession, Article XVI, lines 24 |publisher=Bookofconcord.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110719173007/http://www.bookofconcord.org/defense_13_ecclesiasticalorder.php| archivedate= 19 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>Cf., Roland H.

An important historical context to explicate the wide differences among German Lutheran Churches is the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]] of 1817, whereby the secular government directed the Lutheran Churches in Prussia to merge with non-Lutheran [[Reformed Church]]es in Prussia. The Reformed Churches generally oppose on principle the traditional doctrine of ecclesiastic Apostolic Succession, e.g., not usually even recognizing the church office of Bishop.<ref>Cf., [[Jean Calvin]], ''Ecclesiastical ordinances'' (Genève 1541, 1561), reprinted in Lewis W. Spitz, editor, ''The Protestant Reformation'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall 1966) at 122-129, 122.</ref> Later in the 19th century, other Lutheran and Reformed congregations merged to form [[United and uniting churches|united church bodies]] in some of the other 39 states of the [[German Confederation]], e.g., in Anhalt, Baden, Bremen, Hesse and Nassau, Hesse-Kassel and Waldeck, and the Palatinate.<ref>The [[Evangelical State Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical State Church of Baden]], [[Evangelical Church of Bremen|Bremian Evangelical Church]] (union of Lutheran and Reformed in 1873), [[Evangelical Church in Hesse and Nassau]], [[Evangelical Church of Hesse-Kassel and Waldeck]], and the [[Evangelical Church of the Palatinate]].</ref><ref>In 1866 the [[States of the German Confederation|German Confederation]] dissolved; in 1871 most of its former member states joined the German Empire led by Prussia.

Knoft 1969) at 187-188, 194-199 [1866]; at 223-227 [1871].</ref> Yet the partial nature of this list also serves to show that in Germany there remained many Lutherans who never did unite with the Reformed.<ref>E.g., the current umbrella federation of German protestant churches known as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|EKD]] has as members 22 Church bodies: 9 regional Lutheran, 11 united Lutheran and Reformed, and 2 Reformed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}</ref>

Other Lutheran Churches seem indifferent as a matter of understood doctrine regarding this particular issue of ecclesiastical governance. In America, the conservative [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]] places its church authority in the congregation rather than in the bishop, though its founder, C.F.W. Walther, while establishing congregational polity for the Missouri Synod, did consider Polity (a Church's form of government) to be a matter of adiaphora (something indifferent.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reformationchurch.org/Informative%20Pages/The%20Church%20Polity%20of%20CFW%20Walther%20and%20Its%20Context.pdf|title=The Church Polity of CWF Walther and its Context}}</ref>

The Missouri Synod is, however, not in what it calls "Pulpit and Altar Fellowship" (full communion) with Churches which are not governed by [[Congregationalist polity]].  It has its own international communion structure, the [[International Lutheran Council]], the member Churches of which are all of Congregationalist polity.<ref>[http://www.pastorzip.org/uslutheranlinx.html Pastor Zip's US Lutheran Web Links] - the entry for The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilc-online.org/pages/default.asp?NavID=69 |title=International Lutheran Council |publisher=Ilc-online.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110726172731/http://www.ilc-online.org/pages/default.asp?NavID=69| archivedate= 26 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Beyond indifference, some conservative Lutherans are in principle outright against the traditional doctrine of Apostolic Succession, e.g., [[Confessional Lutheranism]] (see also subsection ''Confessional Lutheranism'' herein below). Other conservative Lutherans, however, may favor [[High Church Lutheranism]] which remains generally favorable to the traditional doctrine of Apostolic Succession (see above).

Here it is plain that the ministerial gift or power which Timothy possessed, was given him ''by'' the laying on of the hands of the body of the elders who ordained him. And in regard to the ''government'' of the church, it is equally plain that ''bishops'', in distinction from ''presbyters'', were not charged with the oversight thereof, for it is said - Acts xx. 17, 28, that Paul "called the elders (not the bishops) of the Church of Ephesus, and said unto them, 'Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers,' feed the church of God." On this passage we remark, 1st, that the original Greek term for the word "overseer" is "episcopos," they very word from which our term "bishop" is derived, and which is generally translated "bishop" in the English version of the New Testament. Now this term episcopos, overseer, or bishop, is applied to the ''identical'' persons called ''elders'' in the 17th verse, and to none other.

In addition to the aforementioned arguments, or perhaps instead of them, in 1937 the annual Conference of the [[British Methodist Church]] located the "true continuity" with the Church of past ages in "the continuity of Christian experience, the fellowship in the gift of the one Spirit; in the continuity in the allegiance to one Lord, the continued proclamation of the message; the continued acceptance of the mission;..." [through a long chain which goes back to the] "the first disciples in the company of the Lord Himself ...

For this reason they resolved to seek the episcopal succession. At that time a colony of Waldenses lived on the Bohemian border. The synod was satisfied that these people possessed the regular authenticated episcopal succession. Their chief was Stephen. To him the Brethren sent a deputation consisting of three priests or presbyters. These were Michael Bradacius, a priest of the Roman Catholic, and a priest of the Waldensian Church, whose names have not been preserved. They were instructed to inquire into the validity of the Waldensian episcopate. Stephen received the deputies with great kindness, assembled his assistant bishops, and entered into a minute account of the episcopacy which they had. Fully satisfied with what they lad learned the deputies requested to be consecrated bishops. This request Bishop Stephen and his assistants fulfilled in a solemn convocation of the Waldensian Church. The new bishops immediately returned to the barony of Lititz where another synod was convened and three of the brethren were set apart for the work of the ministry, by the laying on of hands. In spite of the terrible persecutions suffered by the Ancient Church, this episcopate was most wonderfully preserved.}}</ref><ref name="Schaff2007">{{cite book|last=Schaff|first=Philip|title=The Creeds of Christendom: History of the Creeds - Volume I, Part II|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JbxML0B75ZIC&pg=PA567|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=2007-11-30|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=9781602068902|page=567|quote=they sought regular ordination from a Waldensian bishop, Stephen of Austria, who was reported to have been ordained by a Roman bishop in 1434, and who afterwards suffered martyrdom in Vienna.}}</ref> These three consecrated bishops returned to Lititz and then ordained other Moravians, thereby preserving the historic episcopate.<ref name="Stocker1918"/>

==Protestant denominations that reject apostolic succession==
Most Protestants deny the doctrine of apostolic succession, believing that it is neither taught in Scripture nor necessary for Christian teaching, life, and practice. Accordingly, these Protestants strip the notion of apostolic succession from the definition of "apostolic" or "apostolicity." For them, to be apostolic is simply to be in submission to the teachings of the original twelve apostles as recorded in Scripture.<ref>Martin E. Marty, ''A Short History of Christianity'' (New York: Meridian Books 1959) at 75-77 (traditional doctrine).</ref> This doctrinal stance reflects the Protestant view of authority, embodied in the doctrine known as [[Sola Scriptura]].

Among the original champions of Protestantism who rejected the doctrine of apostolic succession were [[John Calvin]],<ref>Cf., John Calvin, ''Institutio Christianae Religionis'' 1536, 5th ed. 1559; translated by John Allen as ''Institutes of the Christian Religion'' (London 1813; reprinted Philadelphia: Presbyterian Board of Publications, 6th ed. 1921), 2 volumes.</ref> and [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Martin Luther ''The Bondage of the Will'' (1525)</ref> They both said that the episcopacy was inadequate to address corruption, doctrinal or otherwise, and that this inadequacy justified the intervention of the church of common people. In part this position was also necessary, as otherwise there would have been no means to elicit or initiate reform of the church.

In the 20th century, there has been more contact between Protestants and Christians from Eastern traditions which claim apostolic succession for their ministry. Like the Roman Catholic Church, these ancient Eastern churches may use the doctrine of apostolic succession in ministry in their apologetics against Protestantism. Some Protestants feel that such claims of apostolic succession are proven false by the differences in traditions and doctrines between these churches: Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider both the [[Church of the East]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches to be heretical, having been anathematized in the early ecumenical councils of [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431) and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] (451) respectively. However, churches that claim apostolic succession in ministry distinguish this from doctrinal orthodoxy, holding that "it is possible to have valid orders coming down from the apostles, and yet not to have a continuous spiritual history coming down from the apostles".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Knox+%22orders+coming+down+from+the+apostles%22&btnG= |title=Ronald Knox, '&#39;In Soft Garments'&#39; (Ignatius Press 2010 ISBN 978-1-58617-300-5), p. 216 |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>

All Christians who have a genuine relationship with God through and in Christ are part of the "true Church", according to exemplary statements of evangelical Protestant theology, notwithstanding condemnation of the Catholic Church by some Protestants.<ref>But cf., Mark A. Noll and Carolyn Nystrom, ''Is the Reformation Over? An evangelical assessment of contemporary Roman Catholicism'' (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic 2005).</ref> According to these statements, claims that one or more denominations might be the "true Church" are nothing more than propaganda which has evolved over centuries to support authoritarian claims---based on tradition or based on scripture---of merely human institutions. Such claims can be found among the worldwide community of Christians. Yet all appear to treasure the truth that liberates, and Jesus taught his followers to love one another.<ref>{{Bibleref2|John|13:35}}</ref>

===Charismatic and British New Church Movement===
Some Protestant [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] and [[British New Church Movement]] churches include "apostles" among the offices that should be evident into modern times in a true church, though they never trace an historical line of succession. The founders or senior leaders of a [[British New Church Movement]] group will frequently be referred to as the apostles. [[Church planting]] is a key role of these present-day apostles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Confessional Lutheranism===
[[Confessional Lutheranism]] rejects Apostolic succession, stating that that there is no evidence the Popes have historic succession from Peter other than their own claim that it is so. Furthermore, they claim that the Bible contains no evidence showing that the office must be conveyed by laying-on of hands and no Biblical command that it must be by a special class of bishops. Laying-on of hands is repeatedly mentioned, especially in the case of Paul and Timothy; however, it is a descriptive, non-prescriptive teaching in the Bible:  

{{quote|A person enters the public ministry through the divine call. God through his people places a person into the public ministry when they ask a qualified individual to proclaim the gospel and administer the sacraments in their name and on their behalf and he accepts the call. The divine call confers the office, not ordination. Ordination is the public declaration of the man's fitness for office and the public recognition or confirmation of the legitimacy of the call that was extended and accepted. Although it is still our custom to lay on hands during the right of ordination, the laying on of hands is not commanded by God and is not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arkiv.lbk.cc/faq/site.pl@1518cutopic_topicid68cuitem_itemid8947.htm |title=WELS Topical Q&A: Apostolic Succession / Transmutation Authority |publisher=Arkiv.lbk.cc |date= |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref>}}

Confessional Lutherans hold that the churches claiming apostolic succession have not preserved [[Pauline epistles|apostolic doctrine]], therefore their leaders have no meaningful apostolic succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=942&cuItem_itemID=22266 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080630172953/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=942&cuItem_itemID=22266 |archivedate=30 June 2008 |title=WELS Topical Q&A - Apostolic Succession |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

==Unconventional teachings on apostolic succession==

===Latter-day Saints (Mormons)===
[[File:Melchizedek Priesthood.jpg|thumb|150px|Bronze statue in [[Temple Square]], [[Salt Lake City]], representing [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]] in the act of conferring the ''Melchizedek priesthood'' to [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]].]]

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (sometimes referred to as Mormons) claim apostolic succession through the process of [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]]. According to their teaching, a period of universal [[apostasy]] followed the death of the Twelve Apostles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/study/topics/apostasy?lang=eng&query=apostasy |title=Apostasy - Gospel Topics |publisher=Lds.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Without apostles or prophets left on the earth with the legitimate [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood Authority]], many of the true teachings and practices of Christianity were lost. Eventually these were restored to the prophet [[Joseph Smith]] and various others in a series of divine conferrals and ordinations by angelic men who had held this authority during their lifetimes (see this [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)#Partial list of restoration events|partial list of restoration events]]). As it relates to apostolic succession, Joseph Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery]] said that the apostles Peter, James, and John appeared to them in 1829 and conferred upon them the [[Melchizedek Priesthood]]<ref>[[Joseph Smith—History]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng#72 1:72]</ref> and with it "the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times".<ref>[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng#20 128:20]</ref>

For Latter-day Saints, Apostolic Succession is the leadership of the Church being established through the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].  Each time the [[President of the Church]] dies, the most senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]], who is designated as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, is [[Setting apart|set apart]] as the [[List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|new Church President]].

===Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica===
Although no longer Christian, [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]], also known as E.G.C., recognizes apostolic succession as a major spiritual tenet. Because E.G.C. has since accepted the [[Thelema|Law of Thelema]], a religion which claims to supersede Christianity, it is no longer concerned with apostolic succession deriving from Jesus. Instead, apostolic succession in E.G.C. is derived from The Master Therion, known by his civil name as [[Aleister Crowley]] and considered by Thelemites to be the [[Aeon (Thelema)|Prophet of the Aeon]].<ref name="sabazius">{{cite web |url=http://hermetic.com/sabazius/clergy_egc.htm |title=The Role and Function of Thelemic Clergy in Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica |author=Tau Apiryon |year=1997 |publisher=Hermetic.com |accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://oto-usa.org/egc.html |title=Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica |publisher=U.S. Grand Lodge, Ordo Templi Orientis |accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref>

Unlike apostolic succession in Christianity, E.G.C. does not claim that Thelemic Succession grants the power to remit and retain sins. Instead, the point of a valid line of succession in E.G.C. is to grant the authority to claim communion and benediction of the [[Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic Saints]].<ref name="sabazius" />
