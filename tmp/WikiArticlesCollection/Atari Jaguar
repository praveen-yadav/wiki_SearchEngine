The '''Atari Jaguar''' is a [[video game console]] that was released by Atari Corporation in 1993. It was the last to be marketed under the Atari brand until the release of the [[Atari Flashback]] in 2004. It was designed to surpass the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], and the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|Panasonic 3DO]] in processing power. Although launched one year earlier, it was eventually in competition with the [[Sega Saturn]], the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and other consoles that made up the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] of video game consoles. The console was first released in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]] in 1993, and the rest of the US in early 1994.<ref name="Jaguar_NA_RD" /> Although it was marketed as the first 64-bit gaming system, the Jaguar proved to be a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] and prompted [[Atari]] to leave the home video game console market. Despite its commercial failure, the Jaguar has a dedicated fan base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for it.<ref name="redundant">{{cite web | last = Goss | first = Patrick | title = Redundant gadgets (Atari Jaguar entry) | url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=6171299&imageindex=5  | accessdate = 2007-10-23

==Development==
The Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare Technology|Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed "[[Atari Panther|Panther]]"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.

==Reception==
The Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99,<ref name="gamepro">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time| accessdate=2008-08-01|author=Blake Snow|publisher=[[GamePro]].com|date=2007-05-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080905175411/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|archivedate=2008-09-05}}</ref> under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[IBM]]. The system was initially marketed only in the [[New York City]] and the [[San Francisco Bay]] areas, under the slogan "Do the Math",<ref name="gamepro"/> claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems. A US-wide release followed in early 1994.

The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base. In 1993, Atari reported that they had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market.<ref>Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993. pp 14.</ref> By the end of 1994, Atari reported that they had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console.<ref>Atari Corporation Annual Report. pp 11.</ref> By the end of 1995, Sony and Sega had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly. In their 1995 annual report, they noted:

"Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively."<ref>[http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993]. pp 3.</ref>

Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as ''[[Tempest 2000]]'', ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Rayman (video game)|Rayman]]'', ''[[Atari Karts]]'', and ''[[Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure]]''.<ref>''[http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html Atari Jaguar History]''. [[AtariAge]]. Retrieved 9 December 2008.</ref> The most successful title during the Jaguar's first year was ''[[Alien vs Predator (Jaguar game)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.<ref>Atari Corporation 1994 annual report. pp 3.</ref> Both it and ''Tempest 2000'' were named among the system's defining titles by [[GamePro]] in 2007.<ref name="gamepro"/> With such a small library of games<ref name="wired">{{cite web |url= http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=28&slideView=7 | title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming |accessdate=2008-03-23 |author=Greg Orlando |date=2007-05-15 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired News]] |publisher=[[Cond√© Nast Publications]]}}</ref> to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience.

In 2006 [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris rated the Jaguar controller as the worst ever,<ref name =harris>{{cite web |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2006-02-21}}</ref> criticizing the complexity of the "phone keypad" and the VGA-style [[D-subminiature]] connector. A version that has six action buttons, the Pro Controller, also exists and is suggested for certain games.

Lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar.  Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms. In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's [[memory controller]], which prevented code execution out of system [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Less severe, but still annoying defects included a buggy [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]]. The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code. Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete. Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious [[assembly language|assembler]].

In a July 1995 interview with [[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]], then-CEO Sam Tramiel declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the [[Sega Saturn]], and slightly weaker than the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Atari's President talks back | magazine = Next Generation | date = July 1995 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

By the end of [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.<ref name="10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996">[http://sec.edgar-online.com/1996/04/12/00/0000891618-96-000213/Section8.asp ATARI CORP Annual Report (Regulation S-K, item 405) (10-K405) ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL C]{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}</ref> In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning [[infomercial]] advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system. The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems. In its 10-K405 SEC Filing, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: {{quote|From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar.

Production of the Jaguar ceased after Atari Corp. merged with [[JT Storage]] in a [[reverse takeover]].<ref name="jtmerger">{{cite web | url=http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml | title=Atari and JT Storage Reorganisation Plan | publisher=One Cle | accessdate=2006-11-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061209123854/http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml| archivedate= 9 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In a last-ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system.

No.}}</ref> because the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] ([[Motorola 68000|68000]]) and [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or "graphics accelerators"). Atari Corp.'s position was that the mere presence of 64-bit ALUs for graphics was sufficient to validate the claim. Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.

Over the short life of the console, several add-on peripherals were announced. However, only the ProController, the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] drive, and the JagLink (a simple two-console networking device) reached retail shelves. A voice modem<ref>Mowatt, Todd. ''Atari to Unleash new Jaguar CD and Jaguar III''. [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]. Issue 70. Pg 28. May 1995.</ref> and [[Virtual reality|VR]] headset<ref>''Gaming Gossip''. [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]. Issue 70. Pg 54. May 1995.</ref> (with infrared head-tracking) existed in prototype form, but were never commercialized (see [[Loki (computer)|Loki]] and [[Konix Multisystem]] for early development).

==Legacy==

After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by [[Hasbro Interactive]] in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] development.<ref name="hasbro">{{cite web | url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/archives/HasbroRights.html | title=Hasbro Releases Jaguar Publishing Rights | publisher=Hasbro Interactive | accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> A few developers, including [[Telegames]] and Songbird Productions, have not only released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past, but also several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.

In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets. The machine was initially sold for ¬£29.99 brand new and the software was ranged between ¬£9.99 for more common games such as ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Ruiner Pinball]]'', and up to ¬£39.99 for more sought-after releases such as ''[[Defender 2000]]'' and ''[[Checkered Flag (video game)|Checkered Flag]]''. The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for ¬£9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.

This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, [[Gamestation]], who were well known for stocking retro formats.

Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera.<ref>{{cite web | title = Atari Jaguar Revived As Dental Camera | date = January 1, 2010 | work = 1UP | url = http://www.1up.com/news/atari-jaguar-revived-dental-camera | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}</ref> The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.<ref>{{cite web | title = HotRod | publisher = Imagin | url = http://www.imaginsystems.com/Graphics/HotRod%20DS-final.pdf | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}</ref>

The Jaguar continues to have a small and dedicated game development circle.

==Accessories==

===Atari Jaguar CD===
The [[Atari Jaguar CD]] or Jag CD is a CD-ROM peripheral that sat on top the Atari Jaguar video game console and plugged in through the cartridge slot.

===Memory Track===
Released in 1995, the Atari Jaguar CD ''Memory Track'' is a cartridge that contains a 128&nbsp;K [[EEPROM]], allowing Atari Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and savegames. The Memory Track Program Manager is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously.<ref>Atari Jaguar CD Memory Track instruction card</ref>

The box boasts:
"Capture your best gaming moments with Memory Track!
Keep, organize and save important information from Atari Jaguar CD games. with over 125,000 bytes of storage, Memory Track stores information for up to 250 Jaguar games. Fit Memory Track into your Jaguar CD Player's cartridge slot and start storing!
You can store:
*High Scores - break your own record
*Game progress to a specific level - pick up where you left off
*Specific character configurations - save the characters you created
*Particular levels or worlds - use them later"<ref>Atari Jaguar CD Memory Track box</ref>

===Team Tap===
The Atari Jaguar "Team Tap" is a multi-player adapter for use on certain Jaguar games. It was available by itself, or as a special promotional item with the four player game [[White Men Can't Jump (video game)|White Men Can't Jump]].

According to the box:
*The Jaguar Team Tap allows up to 4 players to play compatible Jaguar games.
*With 2 Team Tap adapters, play with up to 8 players!
*Jaguar Team Tap is compatible with most controllers, including the standard Jaguar 3-Button Controller and the Jaguar 6-Button Pro Controller.<ref>Atari Jaguar Team Tap box</ref>

According to the instructions, you could "play with five players" by connecting a controller in one port and a Team Tap with four controllers in the other.<ref>Atari Jaguar Team Tap instructions</ref>

===Jaglink Interface===
The Atari Jaguar "Jaglink Interface" enables players to hook two Atari Jaguars connected to two TVs together with a phone cable for a two screen experience. The only games to support this add-on are DOOM, BattleSphere, and AirCars. The Jaglink is also used to connect the Jaguar to a PC for game development using the JUGS DD (Jaguar Unmodified Game Server Dev Disc) dev system disk for Jaguar CD that was included in Battle Sphere Gold which also came with the "JUGS Device" (a DB9 to phone cord adapter) to connect your PC to your Jaguar via Jaglink.<ref>Battle Sphere Gold manual addendum</ref> Jaglink is also compatible with ICD's CatBox. Jaglink came in sets of two.

===Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge===
The Atari Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge from B&C Computervisions allows you to boot unencrypted discs on your Atari Jaguar CD system.

===CatBox by ICD===
The "CatBox" is an unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar released in 1996 by the [[Rockford, Illinois]] company ICD. The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions. These are audio, video, and communications. It features six output formats, three for audio ([[Line level|line level stereo]], RGB monitor, [[Headphones|headphone]] jack with volume control) and three for video ([[Composite video|composite]], [[S-Video]], and [[RGB color model|RGB analog component video]]) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time. It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and [[RS-232]] as well as [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] pass through, allowing you to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems. The ICD CatBox features a polished steel casing and red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity. An [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM AT]] type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together.<ref>Official CatBox Manual - Final Version 1.01c - May 8, 1996</ref> The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.

===Atari Jaguar VR Headset Prototype===
Atari developed several Virtual Reality headset prototypes for the Jaguar. There were two models, a blue and grey high resolution unit, and a red and grey low resolution unit. After Atari merged with JTS in 1996, most of the headsets were reportedly destroyed, but not all of them. Supposedly, there are only two working units known to be left in existence. The only game released that was compatible with the Atari Jaguar VR Headset was [[Missile Command 3D]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/games/the-atari-jaguar-had-a-vr-headset-auction-20130123/ |title=Atari Jaguar had a VR headset?! One of the two left intact is up for auction &#124; Games |publisher=Geek.com |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}</ref>

===Atari Jaguar Cortina Web TV Adapter Prototype===
An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for [[MSN TV|WebTV]] access was revealed in 1998, one prototype is known to exist.

===Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator aka Jaguar Voice Modem (JVM) Prototype===
In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled all together, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made. The JVM as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is [[Ultra Vortek]], the modem is initialized in the Ultra Vortek start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vinciguerra|first=Robert|title=A Complete History of Online Console Gaming in the United States|url=http://www.revrob.com/sci-a-tech-topmenu-52/38-a-complete-history-of-online-console-gaming-in-the-united-states|work=The Rev. Rob Times|publisher=RevRob.com|accessdate=5 December 2007}}</ref>

==COJAG Arcade Games==
[[Atari Games]] licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games. The system, named '''COJAG''' (for "Coin-Op Jaguar"), replaced the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] with a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R3000-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM. It ran the lightgun games ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' and ''[[Maximum Force]]'', which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine. Other games (''3 On 3 Basketball''; ''Fishin' Frenzy''; ''Freeze''; ''Vicious Circle'') were developed but never released.

==Atari Jaguar Duo==

The '''Atari Jaguar Duo''' was a proposed console similar to the [[Sega Neptune]]. It was an attempt by [[Atari]] to combine the Atari Jaguar and [[Atari Jaguar CD]] to make a new console. It was never completed and was thus never released. After cancelling the console, Atari was bought by [[Hasbro]] and ceased all console development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edwards |first=Benj |url=http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3 |title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995) - Slideshow from |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>
