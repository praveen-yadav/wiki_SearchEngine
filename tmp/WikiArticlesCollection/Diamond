In [[mineralogy]], '''diamond''' (from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] αδάμας – ''adámas'' "unbreakable") is a [[metastable]] [[Allotropes of carbon|allotrope of carbon]], where the carbon [[atoms]] are arranged in a variation of the [[face-centered cubic]] crystal structure called a [[diamond lattice]]. Diamond is less [[Chemical stability|stable]] than [[graphite]], but the conversion rate from diamond to graphite is negligible at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]]. Diamond is renowned as a material with superlative physical qualities, most of which originate from the strong [[covalent bond]]ing between its atoms. In particular, diamond has the highest [[Scratch hardness|hardness]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of any bulk material. Those properties determine the major industrial application of diamond in cutting and polishing tools and the scientific applications in [[diamond knife|diamond knives]] and [[diamond anvil cell]]s.

Because of its extremely rigid lattice, it can be contaminated by very few types of impurities, such as [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]]. Small amounts of defects or impurities (about one per million of lattice atoms) color diamond blue (boron), yellow (nitrogen), brown ([[lattice defect]]s), green (radiation exposure), purple, pink, orange or red. Diamond also has relatively high [[optical dispersion]] (ability to disperse light of different colors).

Most natural diamonds are formed at high temperature and pressure at depths of {{convert|140|to|190|sp=us|km}} in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]]. Carbon-containing minerals provide the carbon source, and the growth occurs over periods from 1&nbsp;billion to 3.3&nbsp;billion years (25% to 75% of the [[age of the Earth]]). Diamonds are brought close to the Earth′s surface through deep [[volcanic eruptions]] by a [[magma]], which cools into [[igneous rock]]s known as [[kimberlite]]s and [[lamproite]]s. Diamonds can also be produced synthetically in a [[HPHT diamond|high-pressure high-temperature]] process which approximately simulates the conditions in the Earth's mantle. An alternative, and completely different growth technique is [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD). Several non-diamond materials, which include [[cubic zirconia]] and [[silicon carbide]] and are often called [[diamond simulants]], resemble diamond in appearance and many properties. Special [[Gemology|gemological]] techniques have been developed to distinguish natural and [[synthetic diamond]]s and diamond simulants.

The name ''diamond'' is derived from the ancient Greek ''αδάμας'' ''(adámas''), "proper", "unalterable", "unbreakable", "untamed", from [[:wiktionary:ἀ-|ἀ-]] (a-), "un-" + ''δαμάω'' (''damáō''), "I overpower", "I tame".<ref>

In 1772, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] used a lens to concentrate the rays of the sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of [[oxygen]], and showed that the only product of the combustion was [[carbon dioxide]], proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, [[Smithson Tennant]] repeated and expanded that experiment. By demonstrating that burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.<ref name=hazen/>

The most familiar use of diamonds today is as gemstones used for [[adornment]], a use which dates back into antiquity. The [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of white light into [[spectral color]]s is the primary gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology have developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the ''four Cs'', are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are ''[[Carat (unit)|carat]]'', ''[[Diamond cut|cut]]'', ''[[Diamond color|color]]'', and ''[[Diamond clarity|clarity]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DIWEi5Hg93gC&pg=PA42|page=42|last=Hesse|first= R.

===Natural history===
The formation of natural diamond requires very specific conditions—exposure of carbon-bearing materials to high pressure, ranging approximately between 45 and 60 [[Bar (unit)|kilobar]]s (4.5 and 6 [[gigapascal|GPa]]), but at a comparatively low temperature range between approximately {{convert|900|and|1300|C|F}}. These conditions are met in two places on Earth; in the [[Lithosphere|lithospheric mantle]] below relatively stable [[continental plate]]s, and at the site of a meteorite strike.<ref name=core>{{cite book|title=The Mantle and Core|last= Carlson|first= R.W.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1clZ4ABsfoAC&pg=PA248|page=248|publisher =Elsevier|year= 2005|isbn=0-08-044848-8}}</ref>

====Formation in cratons====
[[File:Diamond face trigons scale.jpg|thumb|alt=A triangular facet of a crystal having triangular etch pits with the largest having a base length of about {{Convert|0.2|mm}}|One face of an uncut octahedral diamond, showing trigons (of positive and negative relief) formed by natural chemical etching]]
The conditions for diamond formation to happen in the lithospheric mantle occur at considerable depth corresponding to the requirements of temperature and pressure. These depths are estimated between {{convert|140|and|190|km|sp=us}} though occasionally diamonds have crystallized at depths about {{convert|300|km|sp=us}}.<ref name="AMNH"/> The rate at which [[geothermal gradient|temperature changes with increasing depth]] into the Earth varies greatly in different parts of the Earth. In particular, under oceanic plates the temperature rises more quickly with depth, beyond the range required for diamond formation at the depth required. The correct combination of temperature and pressure is only found in the thick, ancient, and stable parts of continental plates where regions of lithosphere known as ''[[craton]]s'' exist. Long residence in the cratonic lithosphere allows diamond crystals to grow larger.<ref name="AMNH">

Through studies of carbon [[isotope]] ratios (similar to the methodology used in [[carbon dating]], except with the [[stable isotope]]s [[Carbon-12|C-12]] and [[Carbon-13|C-13]]), it has been shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as ''[[Peridotite|harzburgitic]]'', are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, ''[[eclogite|eclogitic]]'' diamonds contain organic carbon from organic [[detritus]] that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] through [[subduction]] (see [[plate tectonics]]) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different <sup>13</sup>C:<sup>12</sup>C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1&nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] to 3.3&nbsp;billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the [[Earth]].<ref name="AMNH"/>

Diamonds occur most often as [[euhedral]] or rounded [[octahedron|octahedra]] and [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] octahedra known as ''macles''. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic arrangement of the atoms, they have many [[facet]]s that belong to a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], octahedron, [[rhombicosidodecahedron]], [[tetrakis hexahedron]] or [[disdyakis dodecahedron]]. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Sometimes they are found grown together or form double "twinned" crystals at the surfaces of the octahedron. These different shapes and habits of some diamonds result from differing external circumstances. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal faces) are commonly found coated in ''nyf'', an opaque gum-like skin.<ref>

Primitive interstellar meteorites were found to contain carbon possibly in the form of diamond (Lewis et al. 1987).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1= Roy S.|last2=Ming|first2= Tang|last3=Wacker|first3= John F.|last4=Steel||first4= Eric|title=Interstellar Diamonds in Meteorites|journal= Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference| volume =18| page= 550|year=1987|bibcode=1987LPI....18..550L}}</ref> Not all diamonds found on Earth originated here. A type of diamond called [[carbonado]] that is found in South America and Africa may have been deposited there via an asteroid impact (not formed from the impact) about 3&nbsp;billion years ago.

Diamonds can also form under other naturally occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of micrometer and nanometer sizes, known as ''microdiamonds'' or ''[[Detonation nanodiamond|nanodiamonds]]'' respectively, have been found in meteorite [[impact crater]]s. Such impact events create shock zones of high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond formation. Impact-type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters.<ref name=core/> [[Popigai crater]] in Russia may have the world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.<ref name="Alexander2">{{Cite journal

====Transport from mantle====
[[File:VolcanicPipe.jpg|right|thumb|float|220px|alt=Schematic cross section of an underground region 3 km deep and 2 km wide. A red dike stretches across the bottom, and a pipe containing some xenoliths runs from the dike to the surface, varying from red at the bottom to orange-yellow at the top. The pipe's root, at its bottom, is about 1 km long, and its diatreme, above the root, is about 1.5 km long. The pipe's top is a crater, rimmed by a tuff ring and containing washed-back ejecta. The erosion level is almost zero for Orapa, about 1 km for Jagersfontein, and about 1.4 km for Kimberley.|Schematic diagram of a volcanic pipe]]

Diamond-bearing rock is carried from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin volcanic eruptions. The magma for such a volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed<ref name="AMNH"/>—{{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} or more (three times or more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as [[volcanic pipe]]s.<ref name="AMNH"/> The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes are open to the surface, resulting in open circulation; many [[xenolith]]s of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of [[continental crust]] (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.<ref name="AMNH"/>

The magma in volcanic pipes is usually one of two characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite.<ref name="AMNH"/> The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals ([[xenocryst]]s), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in [[magnesium]]-bearing [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], and [[amphibole]] minerals<ref name="AMNH"/> which are often altered to [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain ''indicator minerals'' typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in [[chromium]] (Cr) or [[titanium]] (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium [[garnet]]s (usually bright red chromium-[[pyrope]], and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium [[spinel]]s, dark [[chromite]], bright green chromium-[[diopside]], glassy green olivine, black [[ilmenite|picroilmenite]], and [[magnetite]]. Kimberlite deposits are known as ''blue ground'' for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as ''yellow ground'' for the near surface [[smectite]] [[clay]] and carbonate [[weathering|weathered]] and [[oxidation|oxidized]] portion.<ref name="AMNH"/>

Once diamonds have been transported to the surface by magma in a volcanic pipe, they may erode out and be distributed over a large area. A volcanic pipe containing diamonds is known as a ''primary source'' of diamonds. ''Secondary sources'' of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix, and accumulated because of water or wind action. These include [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines, where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density. Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers (notably in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Indiana]]); in contrast to alluvial deposits, glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond.<ref name="AMNH"/>

===Hardness===
Diamond is the hardest known natural material on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], where hardness is defined as resistance to scratching and is graded between 1 (softest) and 10 (hardest). Diamond has a hardness of 10 (hardest) on this scale.<ref name=read>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=t-OQO3Wk-JsC&pg=PA49|pages=49–50|title=Gemmology|last=Read|first= P. G.|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year= 2005|isbn=0-7506-6449-5}}</ref> Diamond's hardness has been known since antiquity, and is the source of its name.

Diamond hardness depends on its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the [[Miller index#Case of cubic structures|<111>]] direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice).<ref>{{cite book|pages=142–147|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jtC1mUFZfQcC&pg=PA143|title=Properties, Growth and Applications of Diamond|last1=Neves | first1= A. J. |last2= Nazaré | first2= M. H.|publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology]]|year= 2001|isbn=0-85296-785-3}}</ref> Therefore, whereas it might be possible to scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as [[boron nitride]], the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other diamonds and [[Aggregated diamond nanorod|nanocrystalline diamond aggregates]].

The hardness of diamond contributes to its suitability as a gemstone. Because it can only be scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear because of its resistance to scratching—perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in [[engagement ring|engagement]] or [[wedding ring]]s, which are often worn every day.

[[File:Vickers anvil diamons.jpg|thumb|The extreme hardness of diamond in certain orientations makes it useful in materials science, as in this pyramidal diamond embedded in the working surface of a [[Vickers hardness test]]er.]]

The hardest natural diamonds mostly originate from the [[Copeton Dam|Copeton]] and [[Bingara]] fields located in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] area in [[New South Wales]], Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness is associated with the [[crystal growth]] form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.<ref name="Smithsonian">

Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property ''toughness'', which is a material's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact. The [[toughness]] of natural diamond has been measured as 7.5–10 [[Megapascal|MPa]]·m<sup>1/2</sup>.<ref>{{cite book

As with any material, the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage. Diamond has a [[cleavage plane]] and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others. [[Diamond cutting|Diamond cutters]] use this attribute to cleave some stones, prior to faceting.<ref name=harlow/> "Impact toughness" is one of the main indexes to measure the quality of synthetic industrial diamonds.<ref name=DBS/>

===Electrical conductivity===
Other specialized applications also exist or are being developed, including use as [[semiconductor]]s: some blue diamonds are natural semiconductors, in contrast to most diamonds, which are excellent [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulators]].<ref name="boron"/> The conductivity and blue color originate from boron impurity. Boron substitutes for carbon atoms in the diamond lattice, donating a hole into the [[valence band]].<ref name="boron">

===Surface property===
Diamonds are naturally [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], which means the diamonds' surface cannot be wet by water but can be easily wet and stuck by oil. This property can be utilized to extract diamonds using oil when making synthetic diamonds.<ref name=DBS/> However, when diamond surfaces are chemically modified with certain ions, they are expected to become so [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] that they can stabilize multiple layers of [[ice|water ice]] at [[human body temperature]].<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink1 = Alex Wissner-Gross | first1 = A.

===Chemical stability===
Diamonds are not very reactive. Under room temperature diamonds do not react with any chemical reagents including strong acids and bases. A diamond's surface can only be oxidized a little by just a few oxidants{{which|date=April 2012}} at high temperature (below {{val|1000|u=degC}}). Therefore, acids and bases can be used to refine synthetic diamonds.<ref name=DBS/>

Diamond has a wide [[bandgap]] of {{val|5.5|ul=eV}} corresponding to the deep [[ultraviolet]] wavelength of 225 nanometers. This means pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong and only atoms of nitrogen, boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Transition metals Ni and Co, which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high-pressure high-temperature techniques, have been detected in diamond as individual atoms; the maximum concentration is 0.01% for Ni<ref>

Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration, while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless.

===Identification===
Diamonds can be identified by their high thermal conductivity. Their high [[refractive index]] is also indicative, but other materials have similar refractivity. Diamonds cut glass, but this does not positively identify a diamond because other materials, such as quartz, also lie above glass on the [[Mohs scale]] and can also cut it. Diamonds can scratch other diamonds, but this can result in damage to one or both stones. Hardness tests are infrequently used in practical gemology because of their potentially destructive nature.<ref name=read/> The extreme hardness and high value of diamond means that gems are typically polished slowly using painstaking traditional techniques and greater attention to detail than is the case with most other gemstones;<ref name=hazen>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fNJQok6N9_MC&pg=PA7|pages=7–10|title=The diamond makers|last=Hazen | first= R. M|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-65474-2}}</ref> these tend to result in extremely flat, highly polished facets with exceptionally sharp facet edges. Diamonds also possess an extremely high refractive index and fairly high dispersion. Taken together, these factors affect the overall appearance of a polished diamond and most diamantaires still rely upon skilled use of a [[loupe]] (magnifying glass) to identify diamonds 'by eye'.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Jm3FwBiHaI4C&pg=PA37|pages=34–37|title=Synthetic, Imitation and Treated Gemstones|last=O'Donoghue | first= M.|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year= 1997|isbn=0-7506-3173-2}}</ref>

The diamond industry can be separated into two distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and another for industrial-grade diamonds. Both markets value diamonds differently.

===Gem-grade diamonds===
{{Main|Diamond (gemstone)}}

A large trade in gem-grade diamonds exists. Unlike other commodities, such as most precious metals, there is a substantial mark-up in the retail sale of gem diamonds.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-07-07|url=http://www.photius.com/diamonds/the_diamond_industry.html|title=The Diamond Industry|work=photius.com|last=Coutsoukis | first= Photius }}</ref> There is a well-established market for resale of polished diamonds (e.g. pawnbroking, auctions, second-hand jewelry stores, diamantaires, bourses, etc.). One hallmark of the trade in gem-quality diamonds is its remarkable concentration: wholesale trade and diamond cutting is limited to just a few locations; in 2003, 92% of the world's diamonds were cut and polished in [[Surat]], [[India]].<ref>

The production and distribution of diamonds is largely consolidated in the hands of a few key players, and concentrated in traditional diamond trading centers, the most important being Antwerp, where 80% of all rough diamonds, 50% of all cut diamonds and more than 50% of all rough, cut and industrial diamonds combined are handled.<ref name=India>

Further down the supply chain, members of The [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]] (WFDB) act as a medium for wholesale diamond exchange, trading both polished and rough diamonds. The WFDB consists of independent diamond bourses in major cutting centers such as Tel Aviv, Antwerp, Johannesburg and other cities across the USA, Europe and Asia.<ref name=harlow/> In 2000, the WFDB and The International Diamond Manufacturers Association established the [[World Diamond Council]] to prevent the trading of diamonds used to fund war and inhumane acts. WFDB's additional activities include sponsoring the [[World Diamond Congress]] every two years, as well as the establishment of the ''[[International Diamond Council]]'' (IDC) to oversee diamond grading.

Once purchased by Sightholders (which is a trademark term referring to the companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives).<ref name=polish>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=fkBJ0HL34WsC&pg=PA297 | pages = 297–299 | title = Africa's silk road | last1 = Broadman | first1 = H.

Mined rough diamonds are converted into gems through a multi-step process called "cutting".
Diamonds are extremely hard, but also brittle and can be split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine the weight of the final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%.<ref name=x50>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=jPT6JADCqgwC&pg=PA280 | page = 280 | title = Handbook of carbon, graphite, diamond, and fullerenes: properties, processing, and applications | last = Pierson | first = Hugh O. | publisher = William Andrew | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-8155-1339-9 }}</ref> Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape.<ref name=antique>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Y84qRt6nz-8C&pg=PA88 | pages = 82–102 | title = Antique jewellery: its manufacture, materials and design | last = James | first = Duncan S. | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-7478-0385-4 }}</ref>

The most time-consuming part of the cutting is the preliminary analysis of the rough stone. It needs to address a large number of issues, bears much responsibility, and therefore can last years in case of unique diamonds. The following issues are considered:
*The hardness of diamond and its ability to cleave strongly depend on the crystal orientation. Therefore, the crystallographic structure of the diamond to be cut is analyzed using [[X-ray diffraction]] to choose the optimal cutting directions.
*Most diamonds contain visible non-diamond inclusions and crystal flaws. The cutter has to decide which flaws are to be removed by the cutting and which could be kept.
*The diamond can be split by a single, well calculated blow of a hammer to a pointed tool, which is quick, but risky. Alternatively, it can be cut with a [[diamond saw]], which is a more reliable but tedious procedure.<ref name=antique/><ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=X3qe9jzYUAQC&pg=PA984 | pages = 984–992 | title = Handbook of industrial diamonds and diamond films|last1 = Prelas | first1 = Mark Antonio | last2 = Popovici | first2 = Galina | last3 = Bigelow | first3 = Louis K. | publisher = CRC Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-8247-9994-1 }}</ref>

After initial cutting, the diamond is shaped in numerous stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, which is a responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming.

====Marketing====
Marketing has significantly affected the image of diamond as a valuable commodity.

[[N. W. Ayer & Son]], the advertising firm retained by [[De Beers]] in the mid-20th century, succeeded in reviving the American diamond market. And the firm created new markets in countries where no diamond tradition had existed before. N. W. Ayer's marketing included [[product placement]], advertising focused on the diamond product itself rather than the De Beers brand, and associations with celebrities and royalty. Without advertising the De Beers brand, De Beers was also advertising its competitors' diamond products as well<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=33243 |title=Keep the Diamond Dream Alive | first = Martin | last = Rapaport | work = Rapaport Magazine | publisher = Diamonds.net |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref> (De Beers' market share dipped temporarily to 2nd place in the global market below Alrosa in the aftermath of the global economic crisis of 2008, down to less than 29% in terms of carats mined, rather than sold<ref name="jckonline.com">{{cite web|author=JCK Staff |url=http://www.jckonline.com/2011/01/26/10-things-rocking-industry |title=10 Things Rocking the Industry |work= JCK |publisher=Jckonline.com |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}</ref>).

Brown-colored diamonds constituted a significant part of the diamond production, and were predominantly used for industrial purposes. They were seen as worthless for jewelry (not even being assessed on the [[diamond color]] scale). After the development of Argyle diamond mine in Australia in 1986, and marketing, brown diamonds have become acceptable gems.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_WI86J88ydAC&pg=PA34|page=34|title=The nature of diamonds|first=George E. | last = Harlow|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-521-62935-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zNicdkuulE4C&pg=PA416|page=416|title=Industrial minerals & rocks|first = Jessica Elzea | last = Kogel|publisher= Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration (U.S.)|year=2006|isbn=0-87335-233-5}}</ref> The change was mostly due to the numbers: the Argyle mine, with its {{convert|35000000|carat|kg}} of diamonds per year, makes about one-third of global production of natural diamonds;<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-04|url=http://www.costellos.com.au/diamonds/industry.html|title=The Australian Diamond Industry}}</ref> 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=068-M3xrDSQC&pg=PT158 | page = 158 | title = Diamond deposits: origin, exploration, and history of discovery | last1 = Erlich | first1 = Edward | last2 = Dan Hausel| first2 = W.| publisher = SME | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-87335-213-0 }}</ref>

===Industrial-grade diamonds===

Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and thermal conductivity, making many of the gemological characteristics of diamonds, such as the [[4 Cs]], irrelevant for most applications. 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about {{convert|135000000|carat|kg}} annually), are unsuitable for use as gemstones, and used industrially.<ref>http://www.minerals.net/mineral/diamond.aspx</ref> In addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another {{convert|570000000|carat|kg}} of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use. Approximately 90% of diamond [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding grit]] is currently of synthetic origin.<ref name=usgs>

The boundary between gem-quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones rather than being sold for industrial use). Within the category of industrial diamonds, there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as [[bort]].<ref name=spear>

Industrial use of diamonds has historically been associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond can be used to polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped [[drill bit]]s and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an [[abrasive]]. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes.<ref>

Synthetic diamonds are diamonds manufactured in a laboratory, as opposed to diamonds mined from the Earth. The gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for rough stones. This demand has been satisfied in large part by synthetic diamonds, which have been manufactured by various processes for more than half a century. However, in recent years it has become possible to produce gem-quality synthetic diamonds of significant size.<ref name="AMNH"/>  It is possible to make colorless synthetic gemstones that, on a molecular level, are identical to natural stones and so visually similar that only a gemologist with special equipment can tell the difference.<ref name="bain">{{cite web|url=http://www.bain.com/Images/PR_BAIN_REPORT_The_global_diamond_industry.pdf|title=The Global Diamond Industry: Lifting the Viel of Mystery|publisher=[[Bain and Company|Bain & Company]]|accessdate=Jan 14 2012}}</ref>

===Simulants===
{{Main|Diamond simulant}}
[[File:Moissanite ring.JPG|thumb|alt=A round sparkling, clear gemstone with many facets.|Gem-cut synthetic silicon carbide set in a ring]]
A diamond simulant is a non-diamond material that is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. [[Cubic zirconia]] is the most common. The gemstone [[Moissanite]] (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.<ref>

===Enhancements===
{{Main|Diamond enhancement}}
Diamond enhancements are specific treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which are designed to better the gemological characteristics of the stone in one or more ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=kCc80Q4gzSgC&pg=PA115|page=115|title=The diamond formula|last = Barnard | first =  A. S. |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-4244-0}}</ref>

Coatings are increasingly used to give a diamond simulant such as cubic zirconia a more "diamond-like" appearance. One such substance is [[diamond-like carbon]]—an amorphous carbonaceous material that has some physical properties similar to those of the diamond. Advertising suggests that such a coating would transfer some of these diamond-like properties to the coated stone, hence enhancing the diamond simulant. Techniques such as [[Raman spectroscopy]] should easily identify such a treatment.<ref>

===Identification===
Early diamond identification tests included a scratch test relying on the superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered [[thermistor]]s mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop.

Whereas the thermal probe can separate diamonds from most of their simulants, distinguishing between various types of diamond, for example synthetic or natural, irradiated or non-irradiated, etc., requires more advanced, optical techniques. Those techniques are also used for some diamonds simulants, such as silicon carbide, which pass the thermal conductivity test. Optical techniques can distinguish between natural diamonds and synthetic diamonds. They can also identify the vast majority of treated natural diamonds.<ref name=raman>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W2cSkEsWbSkC&pg=PA387|pages=387–394|title=Raman spectroscopy in archaeology and art history|last1 = Edwards | first1 = H.

Laboratories use techniques such as spectroscopy, microscopy and luminescence under shortwave ultraviolet light to determine a diamond's origin.<ref name=raman/> They also use specially made instruments to aid them in the identification process. Two screening instruments are the ''DiamondSure'' and the ''DiamondView'', both produced by the [[Diamond Trading Company|DTC]] and marketed by the GIA.<ref>

Several methods for identifying synthetic diamonds can be performed, depending on the method of production and the color of the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the [[Swiss Gemmological Institute]]'s<ref>

==Stolen diamonds==
Occasionally large thefts of diamonds take place. In February 2013 armed robbers carried out a raid at Brussels Airport and escaped with gems estimated to be worth $50m (£32m; 37m euros). The gang broke through a perimeter fence and raided the cargo hold of a Swiss-bound plane. The gang have since been arrested and large amounts of cash and diamonds recovered.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22447516</ref>

The identification of stolen diamonds presents a set of difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river - alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than those that have been mined. Determining the provenance of cut and polished stones is much more complex.

The [[Kimberley Process]] was developed to monitor the trade in rough diamonds and prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated by the government of the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.

Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks invisible to the naked eye. [[Lazare Kaplan International|Lazare Kaplan]], a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21525403</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21504112</ref>
