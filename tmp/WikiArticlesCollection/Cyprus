==Etymology==
[[File:Geology of Cyprus-SkiriotissaMine.jpg|thumb|left|A copper mine on Cyprus. In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], Cyprus was a major source of copper.]]
The earliest attested reference to ''Cyprus'' is the 15th-century BC [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''ku-pi-ri-jo'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Strange|first=John|title=Caphtor : Keftiu : a new investigation|year=1980|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-06256-6|page=167|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=c9QUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA154}}</ref> meaning "Cypriot", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages</ref>
The classical Greek form of the name is {{lang|grc|Κύπρος ''Kýpros''}}.

The etymology of the name is unknown.
Suggestions include:
* the Greek word for the [[Cupressus|Mediterranean cypress tree]] (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''), ''κυπάρισσος'' (''kypárissos'')
* the Greek name of the [[henna]] plant (''Lawsonia alba''), ''κύπρος'' (''kýpros'')
* an [[Eteocypriot]] word for [[copper]]. Georges Dossin, for example, suggests that it has roots in the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] word for copper (''zubar'') or for [[bronze]] (''kubar''), from the large deposits of copper ore found on the island.

Through overseas trade, the island has given its name to the [[Classical Latin]] word for copper through the phrase ''aes Cyprium'', "metal of Cyprus", later shortened to ''Cuprum''.<ref>Fisher, Fred H. ''Cyprus: Our New Colony And What We Know About It''. London: George Routledge and Sons 1878, pp. 13–14.</ref>

Cyprus, more specifically the seashore at [[Paphos]], was also one of the birthplaces given in Greek mythology for [[Aphrodite]], who was known as ''Kýpria''. This was because [[Astarte]], goddess of love and beauty in [[Canaanite religion|Phoenician mythology]], for whom Cyprus was an important cult centre, was later [[interpretatio graeca|identified with]] Aphrodite.

The standard [[demonym]] relating to Cyprus or its people or culture is ''[[Cypriot (disambiguation)|Cypriot]]''. The terms ''Cypriote'' and ''[[Cyprian (disambiguation)|Cyprian]]'' are also used, though less frequently.

Cyprus was ruled by [[Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] for a century starting in 708&nbsp;BC, before a brief spell under Egyptian rule and eventually [[Persian people|Persian]] rule in 545&nbsp;BC.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> The Cypriots, led by [[Onesilus]], king of Salamis, joined their fellow Greeks in the [[Ionia]]n cities during the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] in 499&nbsp;BC against the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The revolt was suppressed, but Cyprus managed to maintain a high degree of autonomy and remained oriented towards the Greek world.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

The island was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] in 333&nbsp;BC. Following his death and the subsequent [[Wars of the Diadochi|division of his empire between his successors]], Cyprus became part of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic empire]] of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]].

[[File:Nicosia by Giacomo Franco.jpg|thumb|The [[Venetian walls of Nicosia]] were built by the Venetians to defend the city in case of an Ottoman attack]]

When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into Eastern and Western parts in 395, Cyprus became part of the East Roman, or [[Byzantine Empire]], and would remain part of it until the [[Crusades]] some 800 years later. Under Byzantine rule, the Greek orientation that had been prominent since antiquity developed the strong Hellenistic-Christian character that continues to be a hallmark of the Greek Cypriot community.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

Beginning in 649, Cyprus [[Arab–Byzantine wars|suffered from devastating raids launched by Arab armies]] from the [[Levant]], which continued for the next 300 years.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Many were quick piratical raids, but others were large-scale attacks in which many Cypriots were slaughtered and great wealth carried off or destroyed.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

There are no Byzantine churches which survive from this period; thousands of people were killed, and many cities – such as [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] – were destroyed and never rebuilt.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Byzantine rule was restored in 965, when Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] scored decisive victories on land and sea.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

In 1191, during the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I of England]] captured the island from [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus]]<ref>Riddle, J.M. ''A History of the Middle Ages.'' Lanham, MD, USA: Rowman & Littlefield 2008. p. 326. [http://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&pg=PA326]</ref> He used it as a major supply base that was relatively safe from the [[Saracen]]s. A year later Richard sold the island to the [[Knights Templar]], who, following a bloody revolt, in turn sold it to [[Guy of Lusignan]]. His brother and successor [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric]] was recognized as [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]] by [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

Following the death in 1473 of [[James II of Cyprus|James II]], the last Lusignan king, the [[Republic of Venice]] assumed control of the island, while the late king's Venetian widow, Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]], reigned as figurehead. Venice formally annexed Cyprus in 1489, following the abdication of Catherine.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> The Venetians fortified [[Nicosia]] by building the [[Venetian walls of Nicosia|Venetian Walls]], and used it as an important commercial hub. Throughout Venetian rule, the [[Ottoman Empire]] frequently raided Cyprus. In 1539 the [[Ottomans]] destroyed [[Limassol]] and so fearing the worst, the Venetians also fortified [[Famagusta]] and [[Kyrenia]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

During the almost four centuries of Latin rule, there existed two societies on Cyprus. The first consisted of Frankish nobles and their retinue, as well as Italian merchants and their families. The second, the majority of the population, consisted of Greek Cypriots, serfs and labourers. Although a determined effort was made to supplant native traditions and culture, the effort failed.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

===Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire===
{{Main|Ottoman Cyprus}}

In 1570, a full scale Ottoman assault with 60,000 troops brought the island under Ottoman control, despite stiff resistance by the inhabitants of [[Nicosia]] and [[Famagusta]]. The previous Latin elite was destroyed and the first significant demographic change since antiquity took place when Ottoman [[Janissaries]] were settled on the island.<ref name=Mallinson>{{cite book | last = Mallinson | first = William | title = Cyprus: A Modern History | publisher = I.

The Ottomans abolished the [[feudal]] system previously in place and applied the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]] to Cyprus, under which non-Muslim peoples were governed by their own religious authorities. In a reversal from the days of Latin rule, the head of the [[Church of Cyprus]] was invested as leader of the Greek Cypriot population and acted as mediator between Christian Greek Cypriots and the Ottoman authorities. This status ensured that the Church of Cyprus was in a position to end the constant encroachments of the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/Embassies/Embassy_Madrid.nsf/all/6A33D29D666143A6C1257A36002ECA14/$file/ChipreUnaVisionHistorica.pdf?openelement

[[File:Hosting the British flag at Nicosia.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoisting the British flag at Nicosia]]
In the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Congress of Berlin]], Cyprus was [[Cyprus Convention|leased]] to the [[British Empire]] which de facto took over its administration in 1878 (though, in terms of [[sovereignty]], it remained a [[de jure]] Ottoman territory until 1914, together with [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt and Sudan]]) in exchange for guarantees that Britain would use the island as a base to protect the Ottoman Empire against possible Russian aggression.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

The island would serve Britain as a key military base in its colonial routes. By 1906, when the Famagusta harbour was completed, Cyprus was a strategic naval outpost overlooking the [[Suez Canal]], the crucial main route to India which was then Britain's most important overseas possession. Following the outbreak of World War I and the decision of the Ottoman Empire to join the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]], the British Empire formally annexed Cyprus, Egypt and Sudan on 5 November 1914 as a response.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

===Independence===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F012976-0007, Bonn, Staatsbesuch Präsident von Zypern.jpg|thumb|The first president of Cyprus was [[Makarios III]].]]
On 16 August 1960, Cyprus attained independence after the [[Zürich and London Agreement]] between the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. The UK retained the two [[Sovereign Base Areas]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], while government posts and public offices were allocated by ethnic quotas, giving the minority Turkish Cypriots a permanent veto, 30% in parliament and administration, and granting the three mother-states guarantor rights.

In 1963, inter-communal violence broke out, partially sponsored by both "motherlands". As a result, Turkish Cypriots were forced into [[Turkish Cypriot enclaves|enclaves]] and Cypriot President Archbishop [[Makarios III]] called for unilateral [[Zürich and London Agreement#13 Amendments proposed by Makarios III|constitutional changes]] as a means to ease tensions over the whole island. The United Nations deployed forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP) at flash points.<ref>{{cite book |author= Hoffmeister, Frank |title= Legal aspects of the Cyprus problem: Annan Plan and EU accession |publisher= EMartinus Nijhoff Publishers|year= 2006 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=LZXbg3ZwvGoC&dq= | pages = 17–20 |isbn= 978-90-04-15223-6}}</ref>

On 15 July 1974, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|Greek military junta]] under [[Dimitrios Ioannides]] carried out a [[coup d'état]] in Cyprus, to unite the island with [[Greece]]. The coup ousted president [[Makarios III]] and replaced him with pro-[[enosis]] nationalist [[Nikos Sampson]].<ref name="TIME">{{Cite journal |title=CYPRUS: Big Troubles over a Small Island |date=29 July 1974|journal=TIME |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911440,00.html }}</ref> Five days later, on 20 July 1974, the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish army invaded]] the island on the pretext of restoring the constitutional order of the Republic of Cyprus by claiming a right to intervene as one of the guarantors of the 1960 [[Treaty of Guarantee (1960)|Treaty of Guarantee]].

The Turkish air force began bombing Greek positions on Cyprus, hundreds of paratroops were dropped in the area between [[Nicosia]] and [[Kyrenia]], where well-armed Turkish Cypriot enclaves had been long-established, while off the Kyrenia coast, 30 Turkish troop ships protected by destroyers landed 6,000 men as well as tanks, trucks, and armoured vehicles.

Three days later, when a ceasefire had been agreed, Turkey had landed 30,000 troops on the island and captured Kyrenia, the corridor linking Kyrenia to Nicosia, and Turkish Cypriot quarter of Nicosia itself. The junta in Athens, and then the Sampson regime in Cyprus fell from power. In Nicosia, [[Glafkos Clerides]] assumed the presidency and constitutional order was restored, removing the pretext for the Turkish invasion. But during the peace negotiations in Geneva, the Turkish government reinforced their Kyrenia bridgehead and prepared for a second invasion. The invasion began on 14 August and resulted in the seizure of [[Morphou]], [[Karpass Peninsula|Karpass]], [[Famagusta]] and the [[Mesaoria]]. The Greek-Cypriot forces were unable to resist the Turkish advance.

International pressure led to a ceasefire, and by then 37% of the island had been taken over by the Turks and 180,000 Greek-Cypriots had been evicted from their homes in the north.<ref>U.S. Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 3, 8 March 2001 to 26 March 2001 [http://books.google.com/books?id=fJ9DhiRRtIoC&pg=PA4095]</ref> At the same time, around 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved to the areas under the control of the Turkish Forces and settled in the properties of the displaced Greek Cypriots.

Cyprus is the third largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], after the Italian islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] (both in terms of area and population). It is also the [[List of islands by area|world's 81st largest by area]] and [[List of islands by population|world's 51st largest by population]]. It measures {{convert|240|km|mi|0}} long from end to end and {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} wide at its widest point, with Turkey {{convert|75|km|mi|0}} to the north. It lies between latitudes [[34th parallel north|34°]] and [[36th parallel north|36° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian east|32°]] and [[35th meridian east|35° E]].

Other neighbouring territories include [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] to the east ({{convert|105|km|mi|0}} and {{convert|108|km|mi|0}}, respectively), [[Israel]] {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} to the southeast, [[Egypt]] {{convert|380|km|mi|0}} to the south, and [[Greece]] to the northwest: {{convert|280|km|mi|0}} to the small [[Dodecanese|Dodecanesian]] island of [[Kastelorizo]] (Megisti), {{convert|400|km|mi|0}} to [[Rhodes]], and {{convert|800|km|mi|0}} to the Greek mainland.

The physical relief of the island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the [[Troodos Mountains]] and the smaller [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]], and the central plain they encompass, the [[Mesaoria]]. The Mesaoria plain is drained by the [[Pedieos River]], the longest on the island. The Troodos Mountains cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The highest point on Cyprus is [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] at {{convert|1952|m|abbr=on}}, located in the centre of the Troodos range. The narrow Kyrenia Range, extending along the northern coastline, occupies substantially less area, and elevations are lower, reaching a maximum of {{convert|1024|m|abbr=on}}.

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is subdivided into four main segments. The Republic of Cyprus occupies the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] occupies the northern third (34.85%), and the United Nations-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] provides a [[buffer zone]] that separates the two and covers 2.67% of the island. Lastly, [[Sovereign Base Areas|two bases under British sovereignty]] are located on the island: [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], covering the remaining 2.74%.

===Water supply===
Cyprus suffers from a shortage of water. The country relies heavily on rain to provide household water, and for many years now the average annual rainfall seems to be decreasing. Between 2001 and 2004, exceptionally heavy annual rainfall pushed water reserves up, with supply exceeding demand, allowing total storage in the island's reservoirs to rise to an all-time high by the start of 2005.
However, since then demand has increased annually – a result of local population growth, foreigners relocating to Cyprus and the number of visiting tourists – while supply has fallen. Cyprus has a total of 107 dams (plus one currently under construction) and reservoirs, with a total water storage capacity of about {{convert|330000000|m3|-9|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/wdd/Wdd.nsf/All/F1C37F7EC2249715C2256CC50039DDD5?OpenDocument&highlight=108%20dams Dams of Cyprus] Water Development Department, Republic of Cyprus.</ref>

Dams remain the principal source of water both for domestic and agricultural use. Water desalination plants are gradually being constructed to deal with recent years of prolonged drought.
The Government has invested heavily in the creation of water desalination plants which have supplied almost 50 per cent of domestic water since 2001. Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Cyprus}}
Cyprus is a [[presidential republic]]. The head of state and of the government is elected by a process of [[universal suffrage]] for a five-year term. Executive power is exercised by the government with legislative power vested in the House of Representatives whilst the Judiciary is independent of both the executive and the legislature.

The 1960 Constitution provided for a presidential system of government with independent executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as a complex system of checks and balances including a weighted power-sharing ratio designed to protect the interests of the Turkish Cypriots. The executive was led by a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president elected by their respective communities for five-year terms and each possessing a right of veto over certain types of legislation and executive decisions. Legislative power rested on the House of Representatives who were also elected on the basis of separate voters' rolls.

[[File:Cyprus European Union Presidency flags at top of Nicosia Building.JPG|thumb|Cyprus has been a member state of the [[European Union]] since 2004.]]
Since 1965, following clashes between the two communities, the [[Turkish Cypriot]] seats in the House remain vacant. Turkish Cypriots refused to establish the state of affairs before the invasion of Cyprus as is evident in the Secretary-General of the United Nations who said "The Turkish Cypriot leaders have adhered to a rigid stand against any measures which might involve having members of the two communities live and work together, or which might place Turkish Cypriots in situations where they would have to acknowledge the authority of Government agents. Indeed, since the Turkish Cypriot leadership is committed to physical and geographical separation of the communities as a political goal, it is not likely to encourage activities by Turkish Cypriots which may be interpreted as demonstrating the merits of an alternative policy.<ref name="Coe1">Quotation from 1965 in a report submitted by Cyprus in the framework of the Convention for the Protectino of Mational Minorities citing [http://web.archive.org/web/20090125115646/http://www.humanrights.coe.int/minorities/eng/FrameworkConvention/StateReports/1999/cyprus/B.htm United Nations Secretary General Report S/6426] Quote: "10. Despite this policy, a certain degree of normality gradually returned to Cyprus and with the active encouragement of the Government, by 1974 a large proportion of Turkish Cypriots were living and working alongside with their Greek Cypriot fellow citizens." via Internet Archive Retrieved 1 June 2011</ref> By 1974 the two communities had returned to a more tolerant state of living.<ref name="Coe1"/>

In 1974 Cyprus was divided ''de facto'' when the Turkish army occupied the northern third of the island. The Turkish Cypriots subsequently declared independence in 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] but were recognized only by [[Turkey]]. In 1985 the TRNC adopted a constitution and held its first elections. The United Nations recognises the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island of Cyprus.

The House of Representatives currently has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian]], [[Roman Catholicism in Cyprus|Latin]] and [[Maronites in Cyprus|Maronite]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] community but remain vacant since 1964. The political environment is dominated by the communist [[Progressive Party of Working People|AKEL]], the liberal conservative [[Democratic Rally]], the [[centrism|centrist]]<ref>{{cite web|author=DotNetNuke |url=http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070611174508/http://www.diko.org.cy/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=24 |archivedate=11 June 2007 |title=Ιδεολογική Διακήρυξη του Δημοκρατικού Κόμματος |publisher=Diko.org.cy |accessdate=6 January 2009}}</ref> [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]], the [[social democracy|social-democratic]] [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]] and the centrist [[European Party (Cyprus)|EURO.KO]].
On 17 February 2008 [[Dimitris Christofias]] of the AKEL was elected President of Cyprus, on AKEL's first electoral victory without being part of a wider coalition. Christofias took over government from [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] of the Democratic Party who had been in office since February 2003.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Districts of Cyprus|List of cities, towns and villages in Cyprus}}
The Republic of Cyprus is divided into six districts:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/maps/members/cyprus_en.htm |title=EUROPA – The EU at a glance – Maps – Cyprus |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> [[Nicosia]], [[Famagusta]], [[Kyrenia]], [[Larnaca]], [[Limassol]] and [[Paphos]].

===Exclaves and enclaves===
[[File:20061019 Episkopi Bay.jpg|thumb|right|[[Episkopi Cantonment]] in south-southwest Cyprus]]
Cyprus has four [[exclave]]s, all in territory that belongs to the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|British Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia]]. The first two are the villages of [[Ormidhia]] and [[Xylotymvou]]. The third is the [[Dhekelia Power Station]] which is divided by a British road into two parts. The northern part is an exclave, like the two villages, whereas the southern part is located by the sea and therefore not an exclave although it has no [[territorial waters]] of its own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geosite.jankrogh.com/dhekelia.htm|title=Dhekelia |publisher=Geosite.jankrogh.com |date=  30 January 2012 |accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>

The [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|UN buffer zone]] runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side off [[Ayios Nikolaos, SBA|Ayios Nikolaos]] and is connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin land corridor. In that sense the buffer zone turns the [[Paralimni]] area on the southeast corner of the island into a ''de facto'', though not ''[[de jure]]'', exclave.

The National Guard is a required 24-month service for all men upon completing their 18th birthday. The land forces of the Cypriot National Guard comprise the following units:
* First Infantry Division (Ιη Μεραρχία ΠΖ)
* Second Infantry Division (ΙΙα Μεραρχία ΠΖ)
* Fourth Infantry Brigade (ΙVη Ταξιαρχία ΠΖ)
* Twentieth Armoured Brigade (ΧΧη ΤΘ Ταξιαρχία)
* Third Support Brigade (ΙΙΙη Ταξιαρχία ΥΠ)
* Eighth Support Brigade (VIIIη Ταξιαρχία ΥΠ)

The air force includes the 449th Helicopter Gunship Squadron (449 ΜΑΕ) – operating [[Aerospatiale Gazelle|SA-342L]] and [[Bell 206]] and the 450th Helicopter Gunship Squadron (450 ME/P) – operating [[Mi-24|Mi-35P]], [[Britten-Norman Islander|BN-2B]] and [[PC-9]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Cyprus}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Cyprus.jpeg|thumb|350px|Graphical depiction of Cyprus's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]

The Cypriot economy has diversified and become prosperous in recent years.<ref name=econ/> However, in 2012 it became affected by the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|Eurozone financial and banking crisis]]. In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need €{{Nowrap|1.8 billion}} of foreign aid to support the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]], and this was followed by [[Fitch Group|Fitch]] downgrading Cyprus's credit rating to [[junk status]].<ref name=BBCJune>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18577983 |title=Cyprus's credit rating cut to junk status by Fitch |author= |date=25 June 2012 |work= |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> Fitch said Cyprus would need an additional €{{Nowrap|4 billion}} to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of [[Bank of Cyprus]], Cyprus Popular Bank and [[Hellenic Bank]], Cyprus's three largest banks, to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek financial crisis]].<ref name=BBCJune/>

The [[2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis]] led to an agreement with the [[Eurogroup]] in March 2013 to split the country's second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), into a "bad" bank which would be wound down over time and a "good" bank which would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus. In return for a €10 billion [[bailout]] from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], the Cypriot government would be required to impose a significant [[haircut (finance)|haircut]] on [[deposit insurance|uninsured deposits]], a large proportion of which were held by wealthy [[Russians]] who used Cyprus as a [[tax haven]].

[[Cyta]], the [[Public ownership|state-owned]] telecommunications company, manages most telecommunications and Internet connections on the island. However, following the recent liberalization of the sector, a few private telecommunications companies have emerged including [[MTN Group|MTN]], [[Cablenet]], [[OTEnet Telecom]], [[Omega Telecom]] and [[PrimeTel]]. In the Turkish-controlled area of Cyprus, three companies are also present: [[Turkcell]], [[Vodafone]] and [[Turk Telekom]].

According to the first population census after the declaration of independence, carried out in December 1960 and covering the entire island, Cyprus had a total population of 573,566; of whom 442,138 (77.1%) were Greeks, 104,320 (18.2%) Turkish, and 27,108 (4.7%) others.<ref name="Shrinking">Hatay, Mete "Is the Turkish Cypriot Population Shrinking?", International Peace Research Institute, 2007.

Due to the inter-communal ethnic tensions between 1963 and 1974, an island-wide census was regarded as impossible. Nevertheless, the Greek Cypriots conducted one in 1973, without the Turkish Cypriot populace.<ref>{{cite book |last=St John-Jones|first=L.W.|year=1983|title=The Population of Cyprus: Demographic Trends and Socio-Economic Influences|place=London|publisher=Maurice Temple Smith Ltd|page=17|isbn=0-85117-232-6}}</ref> According to this census, the Greek Cypriot population was 482,000. One year later, in 1974, the Cypriot government's Department of Statistics and Research estimated the total population of Cyprus at 641,000; of whom 506,000 (78.9%) were Greeks, and 118,000 (18.4%) Turkish.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cyprus Ministry of Interior|year=1992|title=The Demographic Structure of Cyprus|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/20C7614D06858E9FC2256DC200380113/$file/cuco%20report.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=Parliamentary Assembly|page=6}}</ref> After the partition of the island in 1974, Greeks conducted four more censuses: in 1976, 1982, 1992 and 2001; these excluded the Turkish population which was resident in the northern part of the island.<ref name="Shrinking"/>

According to the Republic of Cyprus's latest estimate, in 2005, the number of Cypriot citizens currently living in the Republic of Cyprus is around 871,036. In addition to this, the Republic of Cyprus is home to 110,200 foreign permanent residents<ref>{{cite web |author=Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service|year=2006|title=Demographic Report 2005|url=|location=Nicosia|publisher=Republic of Cyprus Statistical Service|page=12}}</ref> and an estimated 10,000–30,000 undocumented illegal immigrants currently living in the south of the island.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nicos|first1=Trimikliniotis|last2=Demetriou|first2=Corina |year=2007|title=Active Civic Participation of Immigrants in Cyprus|url=http://www.politis-europe.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Cyprus.pdf|publisher=POLITIS|page=8}}</ref>

According to the 2006 census carried out by Northern Cyprus, there were 256,644 ([[de jure]]) people living in Northern Cyprus. 178,031 were citizens of Northern Cyprus, of whom 147,405 were born in Cyprus (112,534 from the north; 32,538 from the south; 371 did not indicate what part of Cyprus they were from); 27,333 born in Turkey; 2,482 born in the UK and 913 born in Bulgaria.

===Education===
{{For|a complete list|List of universities and colleges in Cyprus}}
[[File:NICOSIA, 11 AUGUST, 2011 186.jpg|thumb|[[Faneromeni School]] is the oldest all-girl primary school in Cyprus.]]

Cyprus has a highly developed system of primary and secondary education offering both public and private education. The high quality of instruction can be attributed to a large extent to the above-average competence of the teachers{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} but also to the fact that nearly 7% of the GDP is spent on education which makes Cyprus one of the top three spenders of education in the EU along with Denmark and Sweden.<ref>[http://www.childinfo.org/files/IND_Cyprus.pdf UNICEF, Division of Policy and Practice, Statistics and Monitoring Section] childinfo.org, May 2008.</ref>

[[State school]]s are generally seen as equivalent in quality of education to private-sector institutions. However, the value of a state high-school diploma is limited by the fact that the grades obtained account for only around 25% of the final grade for each topic, with the remaining 75% assigned by the teacher during the semester, in a minimally transparent way. Cypriot universities (like universities in Greece) ignore high school grades almost entirely for admissions purposes. While a high-school diploma is mandatory for university attendance, admissions are decided almost exclusively on the basis of scores at centrally administered university entrance examinations that all university candidates are required to take.

The majority of Cypriots receive their higher education at Greek, British, Turkish, other European and North American universities. It is noteworthy that Cyprus currently has the highest percentage of citizens of [[Legal working age|working age]] who have higher-level education in the EU at 30% which is ahead of Finland's 29.5%. In addition 47% of its population aged 25–34 have tertiary education, which is the highest in the EU. The body of Cypriot students is highly mobile, with 78.7% studying in a university outside Cyprus.

==Culture==
[[File:Classic aristocratic houses in Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical Cypriot architecture in old part of [[Nicosia]], Cyprus]]

The culture of Cyprus is divided between the two distinct cultures of Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Each community maintains its own culture, linked to the cultures of Greece and Turkey, and there is little cultural interchange between the two groups. The Greek culture first has been present on the island since antiquity.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> The Turkish culture arrived with the invasion of the Ottoman Empire in 1570, and it was under this rule that the divide between the two communities became prominent and encouraged by government policies. The British did nothing to change this, leaving the island in its divided state with no unified culture.<ref name="CyprusinEurope">{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-35-number-1/download.aspx?id=2001 |title=Cyprus in Europe: Seizing the Momentum of Nice |author=Patrick R.

===Art===
The art history of Cyprus can be said to stretch back up to 10,000 years, following the discovery of a series of [[Chalcolithic]] period carved figures in the villages of [[Khoirokoitia]] and [[Lempa (Lemba)|Lempa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcl.ed.ac.uk/arch/lemba/homepage.html |title=Lemba Archaeological Research Centre |publisher=Arcl.ed.ac.uk |accessdate=25 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> The island is the home to numerous examples of high quality religious [[icon painting]] from the [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] as well as [[List of painted churches in Cyprus|many painted churches]]. Cypriot architecture was heavily influenced by [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] and Italian [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]] introduced in the island during the era of Latin domination (1191–1571).

In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883–1958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice.<ref>Chrysanthos Christou, ''A short History of Modern and Contemporary Cypriot Art,'' Nicosia 1983.</ref> Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900–1994) who studied at London's [[Royal College of Art]] and Christopheros Savva (1924–1968) who also studied in London, at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]].<ref>Ministry of Education and Culture, ''State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art'' (Nicosia: MOEC,1998)</ref> In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England<ref>Michael Paraskos, 'The Art of Modern Cyprus', in ''Sunjet,'' Spring 2002, 62f</ref> while others train at art schools in [[Greece]] and local art institutions such as the [[Cyprus College of Art]], [[University of Nicosia]] and the [[Frederick Institute of Technology]].
[[File:Aphrodite.jpg|thumb|[[Aphrodite]]; Greek goddess of love, beauty and sexuality, is said to have been born in Cyprus.]]

One of the features of Cypriot art is a tendency towards figurative painting although [[conceptual art]] is being rigorously promoted by a number of art "institutions" and most notably the Nicosia Municipal Art Centre [http://www.nimac.com.cy/]. Municipal art galleries exist in all the main towns and there is a large and lively commercial art scene. Cyprus was due to host the international art festival [[Manifesta]] in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital [[Nicosia]].<ref name="schools out">{{cite web | url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/schools_out | title= Schools Out | date=2006-09 | publisher=[http://www.frieze.com/]}}</ref><ref name="Manifestaartnet">{{cite web | url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/zenakos/zenakos6-5-06.asp | title= Manifesta no more | publisher=[http://www.artnet.com/]}}</ref> <!-- The ensuing furore over this event resulted in questions in Cyprus as to whether Manifesta was a [[CIA]]-backed plot to undermine the Greek Cypriot side in on-going negotiations over the reunification of Cyprus.<ref>Michael Paraskos, 'Was Manifesta a CIA Plot?' in ''Artcyprus,'' issue 2, Autumn 2006, 2</ref>{{Dead link|date=February 2011}} : see chat-->

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Cyprus}}
[[File:Ren-lute-ref.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lute]]; dominant instrument of the Cypriot traditional music.]]

The traditional [[folk music]] of Cyprus has several common elements with [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]], and [[Arabic Music|Arabic]] music including Greco-Turkish dances such as the ''[[sousta]]'', ''[[syrtos]]'', ''[[zeibekikos]]'', ''[[tatsia]]'', and ''[[karsilamas]]'' as well as the Middle Eastern-inspired ''[[tsifteteli]]'' and ''arapies''. There is also a form of musical poetry known as ''chattista'' which is often performed at traditional feasts and celebrations. The instruments commonly associated with Cyprus folk music are the [[bouzouki]], [[oud]] ("outi"), violin ("fkiolin"), [[lute]] ("laouto"), [[accordion]], Cyprus [[flute]] ("pithkiavlin") and percussion (including the "[[goblet drum|toumperleki]]"). Composers associated with traditional Cypriot music include [[Evagoras Karageorgis]], [[Marios Tokas]], Solon Michaelides and Savvas Salides. Among musicians is also the acclaimed pianist [[Cyprien Katsaris]].

[[Hip Hop]], [[R&B]] and [[reggae]] have been supported by the emergence of Cypriot [[rap music|rap]] and the [[urban music]] scene at [[Ayia Napa]]. Cypriot rock music and ''[[Éntekhno]]'' rock is often associated with artists such as [[Michalis Hatzigiannis]] and [[Alkinoos Ioannidis]]. [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] also has a small following in Cyprus represented by bands such as Armageddon (rev.16:16), Blynd, [[Winter's Verge]] and Quadraphonic.

The Cypria is one of the very first specimens of Greek and European poetry.<ref>"An indication that at least the main contents of the ''Cypria'' were known around 650 BC is provided by the representation of the [[Judgment of Paris]] on the [[Chigi vase]]" (Burkert 1992:103). On the [[proto-Corinthian]] [[ewer]] of c. 640 BC known as the [http://www.wisc.edu/arth/ah300/13-myth/33.image.html Chigi "vase"]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}, Paris is identified as ''Alexandros'', as he was apparently called in ''Cypria''.</ref> The Cypriot [[Zeno of Citium]] was the founder of the Stoic School of Philosophy.

Epic poetry, notably the "acritic songs", flourished during [[Middle Ages]]. Two chronicles, one written by [[Leontios Machairas]] and the other by Georgios Voustronios, cover the entire Middle Ages until the end of Frankish rule (4th century–1489). Poèmes d'amour written in medieval Greek Cypriot date back from the 16th century. Some of them are actual translations of poems written by [[Petrarch]], [[Bembo]], [[Ariosto]] and G. [[Sannazzaro]].<ref>Th. Siapkaras- Pitsillidés, Le Pétrarchisme en Cypre.

Modern literary figures from Cyprus include the poet and writer Kostas Montis, poet [[Kyriakos Charalambides]], poet Michalis Pasiardis, writer [[Nicos Nicolaides]], [[Stylianos Atteshlis]], [[Altheides]], Loukis Akritas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=256|title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Loukis Akritas}}</ref> and Demetris Th.

[[Dimitris Lipertis]], [[Vasilis Michaelides]] and Pavlos Liasides are folk poets who wrote poems mainly in the [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot-Greek]] dialect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=91|title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Cyprus Poets}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=252|title=Cyprus Stamp Issue: Centenary Birthday Anniversary of Poet Pavlos Liasides}}</ref> [[Lawrence Durrell]] lived in Northern Cyprus from 1952 until 26 August 1956 and wrote the book [[Bitter Lemons]] concerning his time there which won the second [[Duff Cooper Prize]] in 1957. The majority of the play ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] is set on the island of Cyprus. Cyprus also figures in religious literature such as the [[Acts of the Apostles]] according to which the Apostles [[Barnabas]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] preached on the island.

===Cinema===
The most renowned Cypriot director to have worked abroad is [[Michael Cacoyannis]].

Cypriot cinema was born much later than that of other countries.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[George Filis]] produced and directed ''Gregoris Afxentiou'', ''Etsi Prodothike i Kypros'' (''Cyprus Betrayal''), and ''The Mega Document''.

In 1994, cinematographic production received a boost with the establishment of the Cinema Advisory Committee. As of the year 2000, the annual amount set aside in the national budget stands at Cy Pounds 500,000 (about 850,000 Euros). In addition to government grants, Cypriot co-productions are eligible for funding from the [[Council of Europe]]'s Eurimages Fund, which finances European film co-productions. To date, four feature-length films in which a Cypriot was executive producer have received funding from [[Eurimages]]. The first was ''[[I Sphagi tou Kokora]]'' (1992), completed in 1996, ''Hellados'' (''[[And the Trains Fly to the Sky]]'', 1995), which is currently in post-production, and [[Costas Demetriou]]'s ''O Dromos gia tin Ithaki'' (''[[The Road to Ithaka]]'', 1997) which premiered in March 2000. The theme song to ''The Road to Ithaka'' was composed by [[Costas Cacoyannis]] and sung by [[Alexia Vassiliou]]. In September 1999, ''[[To Tama]]'' (''The Promise'') by [[Andreas Pantzis]] also received
funding
from the Eurimages Fund.<ref>"[http://www.filmbirth.com/cyprus.html Film Birth – History of Cinema – Cyprus]".</ref>
