'''British Railways''' ('''BR'''), which from 1965 traded as '''British Rail''', was the operator of most of the [[rail transport in Great Britain]] between 1948 and 1997.  It was formed from the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|"Big Four" British railway companies]] and lasted until the gradual [[privatisation of British Rail]], in stages between 1994 and 1997. Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the [[British Transport Commission]], it became an independent [[statutory corporation]] in 1962: the [[British Railways Board]].

The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network. A process of [[dieselisation]] and [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]] took place, and in 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric power, except for one narrow-gauge tourist line. [[Passenger train|Passengers]] replaced [[freight train|freight]] as the main source of business, and one third of the network was closed by the [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s.

The British Rail "double arrow" logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a [[double track]] railway and was nicknamed "the arrow of indecision".<ref>{{cite web  | last = Shannon| first = Paul| title = Blue Diesel Days| work = <!--This webpage is actually a publisher's advert for the book (ISBN 9780711032255), but shows online the usage of the phrase referenced.

===Nationalisation in 1948===

[[File:cyclinglion.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The "cycling lion" emblem, used on locomotives between 1950 and early 1956]]

The rail transport system in Great Britain developed during the 19th century. After the grouping of 1923 under the [[Railways Act 1921]] there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR). During [[World War I]] the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete [[nationalisation]] had been considered, and the [[Railways Act 1921]]<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1920/aug/03/the-state-and-the-railways | publisher = [[Hansard]] | house=[[House of Lords]] | date=1920-08-03 | accessdate= 2009-07-18 | column_start=711 | column_end=713 }}</ref> is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected; nationalisation was subsequently carried out after [[World War II]], under the [[Transport Act 1947]]. This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, as part of a policy of nationalising public services by [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government. British Railways came into existence as the [[business name]] of the [[Railway Executive]] of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=67| title=Transport Act 1947| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1947| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref>

There were also [[joint railway]]s between the big four and a few light railways to consider (see [[list of constituents of British Railways]]). Excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the [[Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway]]. Narrow-gauge railways, like the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] were also excluded, apart from three already owned by a company that was itself nationalised. The [[London Underground]] — publicly owned since 1933 — was also nationalised, becoming the [[London Transport Executive]] of the British Transport Commission. The [[Bicester Military Railway]] was already run by the government. The electric [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] was also excluded from nationalisation.

The Railway Executive was conscious that some lines on the (then very dense) network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially, and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation. However, the general financial position of BR became gradually poorer, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955. The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred directly to the parent Commission. Other changes to the British Transport Commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector.

====Regions====
British Railways was divided into regions as follows:
* [[Southern Region of British Railways]]
* [[Western Region of British Railways]]
* [[London Midland Region of British Railways]]
* [[Eastern Region of British Railways]]
* [[North Eastern Region of British Railways]]
* [[Scottish Region of British Railways]]

The North Eastern Region was merged with the Eastern Region in 1967.{{Missing information|What about Anglia Region?|date=November 2013}} In the 1980s, the regions were abolished and replaced by "business sectors", a process known as [[sectorisation]].

===1955 Modernisation Plan===
{{see also|1955 Modernisation Plan}}
The report latterly known as the "Modernisation Plan"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=23| title=Modernisation and Re-Equipment of British Rail| author=British Transport Commission| publisher=(Originally published by the British Transport Commission)|year=1954| work=The Railways Archive| accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref> was published in January 1955. It was intended to bring the [[Rail transport|railway system]] into the 20th century. A government [[White Paper]] produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962, but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis.<ref name="last trains">Loft, Charles (2013) Last Trains - Dr Beeching and the Death of Rural England ISBN 9781849545006</ref> The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety, and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic lost to the roads. Important areas included:
* [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] of principal main lines, in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]], [[Kent]], Birmingham Liverpool/Manchester and Central [[Scotland]]
* Large-scale [[dieselisation]] to replace [[steam locomotives of British Railways|steam locomotives]]
* New passenger and freight [[rolling stock]]
* [[Railway signalling|Resignalling]] and track renewal
* Modern [[marshalling yard]]s
* The closure of an unspecified, but relatively small, number of lines 

The government appeared to endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2&nbsp;billion), but did so largely for political reasons.<ref name="last trains"/> This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs. The dieselisation program gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, and a lack of standardisation.<ref name="b4873">{{cite book|title=British Railways, 1948-73: a business history|author=Terence Richard Gourvish|author2= N. Blake|publisher =Cambridge University Press| year =1986 |pages = 286–288}}</ref> At the same time containerised freight was being developed.<ref name="b4873"/> The marshalling yard building programme was a failure; being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition, and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight.<ref name="b4873">{{cite book|title=British Railways, 1948-73: a business history|author=Terence Richard Gourvish|author2= N. Blake|publisher =Cambridge University Press| year =1986 |pages = 288–290}}</ref>

===The Beeching report===
[[File:Beeching2.svg|thumb|right|upright|Network for development proposed in 1965 report ''"The Development of the Major Trunk Routes"'' (bold lines)]]
During the late 1950s, railway finances continued to worsen, and in 1959 the government stepped in, limiting the amount the BTC could spend without ministerial authority. A White Paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year, and a new structure was brought into effect by the Transport Act 1962.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=116| title=Transport Act 1962| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1962| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref> This abolished the Commission and replaced it by a number of separate Boards. These included a British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963.
[[File:British Railways Delivery Truck London 1962.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Scammell Scarab]] truck in [[British Railways]] livery, London, 1962. British Railways was involved in numerous related businesses including  road haulage]]

Following semi-secret discussions on railway finances by the government-appointed Stedeford Committee in 1961, one of its members, [[Richard Beeching, Baron Beeching|Dr Richard Beeching]], was offered the post of chairing the BTC while it lasted, and then becoming the first Chairman of the British Railways Board.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/beeching_prog1.shtml "Back to Beeching"], BBC Radio 4, 27 February 2010</ref>

A major traffic census in April 1961, which lasted one week, was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network. This report—''The Reshaping of British Railways''—was published by the BRB in March 1963.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=13| title=The Reshaping of British Railways - Part 1: Report| author=British Transport Commission| year=1963| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=35| title=The Reshaping of British Railways—Part 2: Maps| author=British Transport Commission| year=1963| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-25 }}</ref> The proposals, which became known as the "[[Beeching Axe]]", were dramatic.  A third of all passenger services and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would close. Beeching, who is thought to have been the author of most of the report, set out some dire figures. One third of the network was carrying just 1% of the traffic. Of the 18,000 passenger coaches, 6,000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less. Although maintaining them cost between £3m and £4m a year, they earned only about £0.5m.<ref>Richard Beeching "The Reshaping of British Railways",p.15</ref>

Most of the closures were carried out between 1963 and 1970 (including some which were not listed in the report) while other suggested closures were not carried out. The closures were heavily criticised at the time,<ref>[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=236 "The Economics and Social Aspects of the Beeching Plan"]—Lord Stoneham, House of Lords, 1963</ref> and continue to be controversial.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/06/can-beeching-be-undone.html| title=Can Beeching be undone?| year=2009}}</ref> A small number of stations and lines closed under the Beeching programme have been reopened, with further reopenings proposed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8099912.stm "Move to reinstate lost rail lines"], BBC, 15 June 2009</ref>

A second Beeching report, "The Development of the Major Trunk Routes", followed in 1965.<ref>{{citation| url = http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=14| title = The Development Of The Major Railway Trunk Routes | work =The Railways Archive|publisher = British Railways Board|date = February 1965}}</ref> This did not recommend closures as such, but outlined a "network for development". The fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report.

===Post-Beeching===

The basis for calculating passenger fares changed in 1964. In future, fares on some routes—such as rural, holiday and commuter services—would be set at a higher level than on other routes; previously, fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled, which at the time was 3d per mile second class, and 4½d per mile first class<ref>{{cite journal |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |year=1964 |month=July |title=Notes and News: New fares structure |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=110 |issue=759 |page=592 |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster }}</ref> (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|{{#expr: 3 / 240}}|1964|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=2}}}} and £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|{{#expr: 4.5 / 240}}|1964|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=2}}}} respectively, as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}).

Passenger levels decreased steadily from the late 1950s to late 1970s,<ref>The UK [http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_transstats/documents/divisionhomepage/031571.hcsp Department for Transport] (DfT), specifically Table 6.1 from [http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_transstats/documents/downloadable/dft_transstats_613483.pdf Transport Statistics Great Britain 2006] (4MB PDF file)</ref> but experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the high-speed [[InterCity 125]] trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name="BRMP">{{cite book |last=Marsden |first=Colin J. |title=British Rail 1983 Motive Power: Combined Volume |year=1983 |publisher=Ian Allen |location=London |isbn=0-7110-1284-9}}</ref> Network improvements included completing electrification of the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] from London to Norwich between 1976 and 1986 and the [[East Coast Main Line]] from London to Edinburgh between 1985 and 1990.  A main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the 1500V DC-electrified [[Woodhead Line]] between Manchester and Sheffield: passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981.

A further British Rail report, from a committee chaired by Sir [[David Serpell]], was published in 1983.  The [[Serpell Report]] made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km.  This report was not welcomed, and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf.  Meanwhile, BR was gradually re-organised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors. This process, known as "sectorisation", led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.

[[File:Charing Cross station geograph-3300926-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|[[Network SouthEast]] with a [[Networker (train)|Networker]] at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] serving [[Kent]].]]
Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]], operating principal express services; London & South East (renamed [[Network SouthEast]] in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed [[Regional Railways]] in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services.<ref name="Thomas"/>  In the [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] local services were managed by the [[Passenger Transport Executive]]s.  Provincial was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors; upon formation, its costs were four times its [[revenue]].<ref name="Thomas">{{cite book | first=David St John | last=Thomas | coauthors=Whitehouse, Patrick | year=1990 | title=BR in the Eighties | publisher= David & Charles | location=Newton Abbot | isbn=0-7153-9854-7 }}</ref>

===British Rail Investment===
{{incomplete|section|date=February 2013}}
British Rail rebuilt [[London Liverpool Street]] in 1991, opened by [[Elizabeth II|H.M. Queen Elizabeth II]]. British Rail constructed a new station at [[Stansted Airport railway station|Stansted Airport]] in 1991. British Rail re-opened the line to [[Aberdare]] in 1988 and the [[Maesteg Line]] in 1992. Electrified the line to [[King's Lynn railway station|King's Lynn]] in 1992.

===Privatisation of British Rail===

Between 1994 and 1997, [[Privatisation of British Rail|British Rail was privatised]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office)| accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref> Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to [[Railtrack]] on 1 April 1994; afterwards passenger operations were franchised to individual private-sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises); and the freight services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ews-railway.co.uk/about/history.html |title=EWS Railway—Company History |accessdate=2006-11-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060930234359/http://www.ews-railway.co.uk/about/history.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-09-30}}</ref> [[File:Waterloo-city-1992.jpg|thumb|[[Waterloo and City line]] was part of [[Network SouthEast]].]]
The [[Waterloo and City line]] had been part of BR Network SouthEast and was not included in the privatisation. It was transferred to [[London Underground]] in December 1994. The remaining obligations of British Rail not mentioned above were transferred to [[BRB (Residuary) Ltd.]]

== Network ==
[[File:York station 20041113.jpg|thumb|right|[[York railway station]] on the [[East Coast Main Line]]]]
The former BR network, with the trunk routes of the [[West Coast Main Line]], [[East Coast Main Line]], [[Great Western Main Line]] and [[Midland Main Line]], remains mostly unchanged since privatisation. Several lines have reopened and more are proposed, particularly in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] where the control of railway passenger services is devolved from central government. However, in England passenger trains have returned to Mansfield, [[Corby railway station|Corby]], [[Chandlers Ford railway station|Chandlers Ford]], the reopened line to [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]] and there are numerous other proposals to restore services, such as Oxford-Milton Keynes/Aylesbury, [[Wealden Line|Lewes-Uckfield]], Bristol-Portishead and Plymouth-Tavistock.

In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government successfully supported the re-opening to passenger services, of the [[Vale of Glamorgan Line]] between Barry and Bridgend in 2005. In 2008 the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] reopened between [[Ebbw Vale Parkway railway station|Ebbw Vale Parkway]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]], with services to Newport scheduled to commence by 2011. (The Barry-Bridgend route was included in the closures proposed in the Beeching report of March 1963 and its services were duly withdrawn in June 1964, but Ebbw Vale had already been closed to passengers before the report was published.)

In Scotland the Scottish Government have reinstated the lines between [[Argyle Line#Extensions|Hamilton and Larkhall]], [[Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link|Stirling and Alloa]], and [[Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link|Airdrie to Bathgate]]. The biggest line reinstatement project is the former [[Waverley Line|Waverley railway]] Edinburgh to Borders line.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.waverleyrailwayproject.co.uk/route.php| title=Waverley Rail Project route}}</ref>

==Preserved Railway Lines==
Preserved lines, or [[Heritage railways]], have reopened some lines previously closed by British Rail.  These range from picturesque rural branch lines like the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]] to sections of mainline such as the [[Great Central Railway]].  Many have links to the National Rail network, both station interchange, for instance the [[Severn Valley Railway]] between {{stnlnk|Kidderminster}} and [[Kidderminster Town]], and physical rail connections like the [[Watercress Line]] at {{stnlnk|Alton}}.

Although most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources, and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the nationalised industry.

==Ships==
{{main|British Railways ships}}
British Railways operated a number of ships from its formation in 1948 on a variety of routes. Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, [[Sealink]]. Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under [[TOPS]] as [[British Rail Class 99|Class 99]].

Under the process of British Rail's privatisation, operations were split into more than 100 companies. The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by [[Railtrack]]. The Telecomms infrastructure and [[British Rail Telecommunications]] was sold to [[Racal]], which in turn was sold to [[Global Crossing]] and merged with [[Thales Group]]. The rolling stock was transferred to three private [[rolling stock operating company|ROSCO]]s (rolling stock companies). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set number of years, whilst freight services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off.

British Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of [[ScotRail]]; the final train that the company operated was a [[Railfreight Distribution]] freight train in Autumn 1997. The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the [[Strategic Rail Authority]].

Since privatisation, the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed a number of times as franchises have been relet and the areas covered by franchises restructured. Franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include:

*[[Midland Mainline]]—superseded in 2007 by [[East Midlands Trains]]
*[[Great North Eastern Railway]]—superseded in 2007 by [[National Express East Coast]], which has since been brought back full circle into public ownership with the creation of the new government controlled [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast]] operator.
*[[Virgin Trains]] (West Coast)
*[[Virgin CrossCountry]]—superseded in 2007 by [[CrossCountry]]
*[[ScotRail]] ''operated by National Express''—superseded in 2004 by [[First ScotRail]] (now branded as ''ScotRail—Scotland's Railway'')
*[[Great Western Trains]]—from 1998: [[First Great Western]]
*[[Wales and West]]—became [[Wessex Trains]] and [[Wales and Borders]] (including the [[Valley Lines (train operating company)|Cardiff Railway Company]] services operated as Valley Lines) in 2001, after being split into two separate franchises, and now run by [[First Great Western]] and [[Arriva Trains Wales]]
*[[Arriva Trains Northern]] originally [[Northern Spirit]], succeeded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail]]
*[[First North Western]] originally [[North Western Trains]], succeeded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail]]
*[[Anglia Railways]], Great Eastern (later [[First Great Eastern]]), and the West Anglia section of [[West Anglia Great Northern|WAGN]] were all merged to become ONE later renamed [[National Express East Anglia]], superseded in 2012 by [[Abellio (transport company)|Abellio]]'s [[Greater Anglia]]
*[[Thameslink]] and Great Northern Section of [[West Anglia Great Northern|WAGN]] grouped together to form [[First Capital Connect]] as part of the Thameslink Great Northern Franchise
*[[LTS Rail|LTS]] later renamed [[c2c]]
*[[Connex South Eastern]] became [[South Eastern Trains]], then [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]
*[[Connex South Central]] became South Central and later renamed [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]]
*[[Merseyrail Electrics]] superseded by [[Arriva Trains Merseyside]] and now [[Merseyrail]]
*[[South West Trains]]
*[[Central Trains]]—divided in 2007 between [[London Midland]], [[CrossCountry]] and [[East Midlands Trains]]
*[[London Underground]] for the short underground [[Waterloo & City line]]
*[[Silverlink Trains]]—divided in 2007 between [[London Overground]] and [[London Midland]]
