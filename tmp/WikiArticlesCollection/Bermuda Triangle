The '''Bermuda Triangle''', also known as the '''Devil's Triangle''', is an undefined region in the western part of the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], where a number of [[aircraft]] and [[Surface ship|ships]] are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. According to the [[US Navy]], the triangle does not exist, and the name is not recognized by the [[United States Board on Geographic Names|US Board on Geographic Names]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm|title=USCG: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Uscg.mil |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> [[Popular culture]] has attributed various disappearances to the [[paranormal]] or activity by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].<ref name="Cochran,2003">{{cite journal | last = Cochran-Smith | first = Marilyn | year = 2003 | title = Bermuda Triangle: dichotomy, mythology, and amnesia | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 54 | doi = 10.1177/0022487103256793 | page = 275 | issue = 4 }}</ref> Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by later authors.<ref  name=navy,2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm |title=Bermuda Triangle |publisher=History.navy.mil |date=2003-07-13 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref><ref name=navy,1996>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-3.htm |title=Bermuda Triangle |publisher=History.navy.mil |date=1996-05-12 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/triangle.asp |title=USCG: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Uscg.mil |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref> In a 2013 study, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] identified the world’s 10 most dangerous waters for shipping, but the Bermuda Triangle was not among them.<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22806362|title =Study finds shipwrecks threaten precious seas|date =7 June 2013|accessdate = 7 June 2013|publisher =BBC News/science}}</ref>
Contrary to popular belief, insurance companies do not charge higher premiums for shipping in this area.<ref name=navy,2011/>

==Triangle area==
The first written boundaries date from an article by [[Vincent Gaddis]] in a 1964 issue of the pulp magazine ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'',<ref name="Gaddis,1964"/> where the triangle's three [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are in [[Miami]], Florida peninsula; in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]; and in the mid-Atlantic island of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="navy,1996"/> But subsequent writers did not follow this definition.<ref name="navy,1996"/> Every writer gives different boundaries and vertices to the triangle, with the total area varying from 500,000 to 1.5 million square miles.<ref name=navy,1996/> Consequently, the determination of which accidents have occurred inside the triangle depends on which writer reports them.<ref name=navy,1996/> The [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] does not recognize this name, and it is not delimited in any map drawn by US government agencies.<ref name="navy,1996"/>

The area is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships crossing through it daily for ports in the Americas, [[Europe]], and the Caribbean Islands. Cruise ships are also plentiful, and pleasure craft regularly go back and forth between Florida and the islands. It is also a heavily flown route for commercial and private aircraft heading towards Florida, the Caribbean, and [[South America]] from points north.

==History==

===Origins===
The earliest allegation of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in a September 17, 1950 article published in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' ([[Associated Press]]) <ref>[http://www.physics.smu.edu/pseudo/BermudaTriangle/evwjones.html]</ref> by Edward Van Winkle Jones.<ref name="Jones,1950">{{cite news
| title = ''Same Big World'', Sea's Puzzles Still Baffle Men In Pushbutton Age| agency = Associated Press| author = E.V.W. Jones
| date = September 16, 1950}}</ref> Two years later, ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine published "Sea Mystery at Our Back Door",<ref name="Sand,1952">{{cite journal| title = Sea Mystery at Our Back Door| author = George X. San| journal = [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]| month = October| year=1952}}</ref> a short article by George X. Sand covering the loss of several planes and ships, including the loss of [[Flight 19]], a group of five [[U.S. Navy]] [[TBM Avenger]] bombers on a training mission. Sand's article was the first to lay out the now-familiar triangular area where the losses took place. Flight 19 alone would be covered again in the April 1962 issue of ''American Legion'' magazine.<ref name="Eckert,1962" >{{cite journal| title = The Mystery of The Lost Patrol| journal = American Legion Magazine|author = Allen W. Eckert| month = April| year=1962}} Cited in [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] (editor), ''Satanism Today: An Encyclopedia of Relgion, Folklore, and Popular Culture'', page 72, segment by [[Jerome Clark]] (ABC-CLIO, Inc., 2001). ISBN 1-57607-292-4</ref> In it, author [[Allan W. Eckert]] wrote that the flight leader had been heard saying, "We are entering white water, nothing seems right. We don't know where we are, the water is green, no<!-- NB: "no" is correct, "not" is incorrect"--> white." He also wrote that officials at the Navy board of inquiry stated that the planes "flew off to Mars." <ref>Diana Formisano Willett, ''Paranormal Fright'', page 9 (AuthorHouse, 2013), ISBN 978-1-4817-3268-0</ref> Sand's article was the first to suggest a supernatural element to the Flight 19 incident. In the February 1964 issue of ''Argosy'', Vincent Gaddis' article "The Deadly Bermuda Triangle" argued that Flight 19 and other disappearances were part of a pattern of strange events in the region.<ref name="Gaddis,1964">{{citation|last = Gaddis| first = Vincent|title = The Deadly Bermuda Triangle| journal = Argosy| year = 1964}}</ref> The next year, Gaddis expanded this article into a book, ''Invisible Horizons''.<ref name="Gaddis,1965">{{cite book| title = Invisible Horizons| author = Vincent Gaddis| year = 1965}}</ref>

Others would follow with their own works, elaborating on Gaddis' ideas: John Wallace Spencer (''Limbo of the Lost'', 1969, repr. 1973);<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#refSpencer,1969|Spencer, 1969]].</ref> [[Charles Berlitz]] [[The Bermuda Triangle (book)|(''The Bermuda Triangle'', 1974)]];<ref name="ReferenceB">[[#refBerlitz,1974|Berlitz, 1974]].</ref> [[Richard Winer]] (''The Devil's Triangle'', 1974),<ref name="Winer, 1974">{{harv|Winer|1974}}</ref> and many others, all keeping to some of the same supernatural elements outlined by Eckert.<ref name="Eckert, 2004">{{cite journal

===Larry Kusche {{anchor|Kusche's explanation}}===
[[Larry Kusche|Lawrence David Kusche]], a research librarian from [[Arizona State University]] and author of ''The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved'' (1975)<ref name="Kusche, 1975">[[#refKusche,1975|Kusche, 1975]].</ref> argued that many claims of Gaddis and subsequent writers were often exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed a number of inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman [[Donald Crowhurst]], which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an ''Atlantic'' port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the ''Pacific'' Ocean. Kusche also argued that a large percentage of the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.

Kusche concluded that:
* The number of ships and aircraft reported missing in the area was not significantly greater, proportionally speaking, than in any other part of the ocean.
* In an area frequented by [[tropical storm]]s, the number of disappearances that did occur were, for the most part, neither disproportionate, unlikely, nor mysterious;
* Furthermore, Berlitz and other writers would often fail to mention such storms or even represent the disappearance as having happened in calm conditions when meteorological records clearly contradict this.
* The numbers themselves had been exaggerated by sloppy research. A boat's disappearance, for example, would be reported, but its eventual (if belated) return to port may not have been.
* Some disappearances had, in fact, never happened. One plane crash was said to have taken place in 1937 off [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], in front of hundreds of witnesses; a check of the local papers revealed nothing.
* The legend of the Bermuda Triangle is a manufactured mystery, perpetuated by writers who either purposely or unknowingly made use of misconceptions, faulty reasoning, and sensationalism.<ref name="Kusche, 1975"/>

===Further responses===
When the UK Channel 4 television program ''The Bermuda Triangle'' (1992)<ref name="BFI">{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/477884 |title=Equinox: The Bermuda Triangle |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref> was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the ''Equinox'' series, the marine insurance market [[Lloyd's of London]] was asked if an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the Bermuda Triangle area. Lloyd's determined that large numbers of ships had not sunk there.<ref name="WoodsHole Bermuda"/> Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area.<ref name=navy,2011/> [[United States Coast Guard]] records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.<ref name="Kusche, 1975"/>

The Coast Guard is also officially skeptical of the Triangle, noting that they collect and publish, through their inquiries, much documentation contradicting many of the incidents written about by the Triangle authors. In one such incident involving the 1972 explosion and sinking of the tanker {{SS|V. A. Fogg}}, the Coast Guard photographed the wreck and recovered several bodies,<ref name="USCG Fogg">{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/moa/boards/vafog.pdf |title=V A Fogg |format=PDF |publisher=USCG |deadurl=no |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref> in contrast with one Triangle author's claim that all the bodies had vanished, with the exception of the captain, who was found sitting in his cabin at his desk, clutching a coffee cup.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  In addition, ''V. A. Fogg'' sank off the coast of Texas, nowhere near the commonly accepted boundaries of the Triangle.

The [[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]/[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] episode ''The Case of the Bermuda Triangle'', aired on June 27, 1976, was highly critical, stating that "When we've gone back to the original sources or the people involved, the mystery evaporates. Science does not have to answer questions about the Triangle because those questions are not valid in the first place&nbsp;... Ships and planes behave in the Triangle the same way they behave everywhere else in the world."<ref name="NOVA,1976">{{cite episode

David Kusche pointed out a common problem with many of the Bermuda Triangle stories and theories: "Say I claim that a parrot has been kidnapped to teach aliens human language and I challenge you to prove that is ''not'' true. You can even use Einstein's Theory of Relativity if you like. There is simply no way to prove such a claim untrue. The burden of proof should be on the people who make these statements, to show where they got their information from, to see if their conclusions and interpretations are valid, and if they have left anything out."<ref name="NOVA,1976" /> Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves<ref name="Taves,1978">{{cite journal

They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint. Finally, if the Triangle is assumed to cross land, such as parts of Puerto Rico, the [[Bahamas]], or Bermuda itself, there is no evidence for the disappearance of any land-based vehicles or persons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The city of [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]], located inside the Triangle, operates a major shipyard and an airport that handles 50,000 flights annually and is visited by over a million tourists a year.<ref name="CIA">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html |title=CIA World Factbook – Bahamas, The |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

==Supernatural explanations==
Triangle writers have used a number of supernatural concepts to explain the events. One explanation pins the blame on leftover technology from the mythical lost continent of [[Atlantis]]. Sometimes connected to the Atlantis story is the submerged rock formation known as the [[Bimini Road]] off the island of [[Bimini]] in the Bahamas, which is in the Triangle by some definitions. Followers of the purported psychic [[Edgar Cayce]] take his prediction that evidence of Atlantis would be found in 1968 as referring to the discovery of the Bimini Road. Believers describe the formation as a road, wall, or other structure, though geologists consider it to be of natural origin.<ref name="CSI,2004">{{cite journal

}} {{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>

Other writers attribute the events to [[UFO]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ufos.about.com/od/classicufocases/a/bermudatriangle.htm |title=UFO over Bermuda Triangle |publisher=Ufos.about.com |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref> This idea was used by [[Steven Spielberg]] for his [[science fiction film]] ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', which features the lost Flight 19 aircrews as [[Alien abduction|alien abductees]].

[[Charles Berlitz]], author of various books on anomalous phenomena, lists several theories attributing the losses in the Triangle to anomalous or unexplained forces.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

==Natural explanations==

===Compass variations===
[[Compass]] problems are one of the cited phrases in many Triangle incidents. While some have theorized that unusual local magnetic anomalies may exist in the area,<ref name="USNAVY">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq8-1.htm|title=Bermuda Triangle|publisher=US Navy|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> such anomalies have not been found. Compasses have natural [[magnetic variation]]s in relation to the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic poles]], a fact which navigators have known for centuries. [[magnetic north pole|Magnetic (compass) north]] and [[true north|geographic (true) north]] are only exactly the same for a small number of places – for example, as of 2000 in the United States only those places on a line running from [[Wisconsin]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|title=<nowiki>National Geomagnetism Program &#124; Charts &#124; North America &#124; Declination</nowiki>|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|url=http://geomag.usgs.gov/charts/IGRF2000.dec.na.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> But the public may not be as informed, and think there is something mysterious about a compass "changing" across an area as large as the Triangle, which it naturally will.<ref name="Kusche, 1975"/>

[[File:Gulfstream1.jpg|thumb|upright|False-color image of the Gulf Stream flowing north through the western Atlantic Ocean. (NASA)]]

===Gulf Stream===
The [[Gulf Stream]] is a deep ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and then flows through the [[Straits of Florida]] into the North Atlantic. In essence, it is a river within an ocean, and, like a river, it can and does carry floating objects. It has a surface velocity of up to about 2.5 metres per second (5.6&nbsp;mi/h).<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Pamela|title=The Gulf Stream|url=http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/student/phillips/|publisher=USNA/Johns Hopkins|accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> A small plane making a [[water landing]] or a boat having engine trouble can be carried away from its reported position by the current.

===Human error===
One of the most cited explanations in official inquiries as to the loss of any aircraft or vessel is human error.<ref name="NATGEO">{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1205_021205_bermudatriangle.html|title=Bermuda Triangle: Behind the Intrigue|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> Human stubbornness may have caused businessman Harvey Conover to lose his sailing yacht, the ''Revonoc'', as he sailed into the teeth of a storm south of Florida on January 1, 1958.<ref name="CaptainScott">{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Captain Thomas A. |title=Histories & Mysteries: The Shipwrecks of Key Largo}}</ref>

===Violent weather===
[[Tropical cyclone]]s are powerful storms, which form in tropical waters and have historically cost thousands of lives lost and caused billions of dollars in damage. The sinking of [[Francisco de Bobadilla]]'s Spanish fleet in 1502 was the first recorded instance of a destructive hurricane. These storms have in the past caused a number of incidents related to the Triangle.

A powerful [[microburst|downdraft of cold air]] was suspected to be a cause in the sinking of the ''[[Pride of Baltimore]]'' on May 14, 1986. The crew of the sunken vessel noted the wind suddenly shifted and increased velocity from 20&nbsp;mph to 60–90&nbsp;mph. A National Hurricane Center satellite specialist, James Lushine, stated "during very unstable weather conditions the downburst of cold air from aloft can hit the surface like a bomb, exploding outward like a giant squall line of wind and water."<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h8wlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TPMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1085,6357771&dq=bermuda-triangle&hl=en ''Downdraft likely sank clipper'', The Miami News, May 23, 1986, p. 6A]</ref> A similar event occurred to the ''[[Concordia (ship)|Concordia]]'' in 2010 off the coast of Brazil.

===Methane hydrates===
{{Main|Methane clathrate}}
[[File:Gas hydrates 1996.svg|thumb|Worldwide distribution of confirmed or inferred offshore gas hydrate-bearing sediments, 1996.<br />Source: [[USGS]]]]
An explanation for some of the disappearances has focused on the presence of large fields of [[methane]] hydrates (a form of natural gas) on the [[continental shelves]].<ref name="Energy Citations Database (ECD) -  - Document #616279">{{cite web

It has been hypothesized that periodic methane [[eruption]]s (sometimes called "[[mud volcano]]es") may produce regions of frothy water that are no longer capable of providing adequate [[buoyancy]] for ships. If this were the case, such an area forming around a ship could cause it to sink very rapidly and without warning.

==Notable incidents==
{{Main|List of Bermuda Triangle incidents}}

===''Ellen Austin''===
The ''Ellen Austin'' supposedly came across a derelict ship, placed on board a [[prize crew]], and attempted to sail with it to New York in 1881. According to the stories, the derelict disappeared; others elaborating further that the derelict reappeared minus the prize crew, then disappeared again with a second prize crew on board. A check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of the ''Meta'', built in 1854 and that in 1880 the ''Meta'' was renamed ''Ellen Austin''. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared.<ref name="Bermuda Triangle, Ellen Austin">{{cite web

===USS ''Cyclops''===
{{main|USS Cyclops (AC-4)}}

The incident resulting in the single largest loss of life in the history of the US Navy not related to combat occurred when the collier USS ''Cyclops'', carrying a full load of manganese ore and with one engine out of action, went missing without a trace with a crew of 309 sometime after March 4, 1918, after departing the island of [[Barbados]]. Although there is no strong evidence for any single theory, many independent theories exist, some blaming storms, some capsizing, and some suggesting that [[World War I|wartime enemy activity]] was to blame for the loss.<ref name="DMerrill">{{cite web

Both ships were transporting heavy loads of metallic ore similar to that which was loaded on ''Cyclops'' during her fatal voyage. In all three cases structural failure due to overloading with a much denser cargo than designed is considered the most likely cause of sinking.

===''Carroll A. Deering''===
{{main|Carroll A. Deering}}

A five-masted schooner built in 1919, the ''Carroll A. Deering'' was found hard aground and abandoned at Diamond Shoals, near [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]] on January 31, 1921. Rumors and more at the time indicated the ''Deering'' was a victim of piracy, possibly connected with the illegal rum-running trade during [[Prohibition]], and possibly involving another ship, {{SS|Hewitt}}, which disappeared at roughly the same time. Just hours later, an unknown steamer sailed near the lightship along the track of the ''Deering'', and ignored all signals from the lightship. It is speculated that ''Hewitt'' may have been this mystery ship, and possibly involved in the ''Deering'' crew's disappearance.<ref name="Deering">{{cite web

===Flight 19===
{{main|Flight 19}}
[[File:TBF (Avengers) flying in formation.jpg|upright|thumb|US Navy Avengers, similar to those of Flight 19.]]
Flight 19 was a training flight of five [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBM Avenger]] torpedo bombers that disappeared on December 5, 1945, while over the Atlantic. The squadron's flight plan was scheduled to take them due east from [[Fort Lauderdale]] for 141 miles, north for 73 miles, and then back over a final 140-mile leg to complete the exercise. The flight never returned to base. The disappearance is attributed by Navy investigators to navigational error leading to the aircraft running out of fuel.

One of the search and rescue aircraft deployed to look for them, a [[Martin PBM Mariner|PBM Mariner]] with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion<ref name = "The_Loss_of_Flight_19">{{cite web

{{main|1948 Airborne Transport DC-3 (DST) disappearance}}

On December 28, 1948, a [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft, number [[NC16002 disappearance|NC16002]], disappeared while on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami. No trace of the aircraft or the 32 people on board was ever found. From the documentation compiled by the Civil Aeronautics Board investigation, a possible key to the plane's disappearance was found, but barely touched upon by the Triangle writers: the plane's batteries were inspected and found to be low on charge, but ordered back into the plane without a recharge by the pilot while in San Juan. Whether or not this led to complete electrical failure will never be known. However, since piston-engined aircraft rely upon [[ignition magneto|magneto]]s to provide spark to their cylinders rather than a battery powered [[ignition coil]] system, this theory is not strongly convincing.<ref name="Aviation Safety DC3">{{cite web

===KC-135 Stratotankers===
On August 28, 1963, a pair of [[US Air Force]] [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft collided and crashed into the Atlantic. The Triangle version (Winer, Berlitz, Gaddis<ref name="Gaddis,1964"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Winer, 1974"/>) of this story specifies that they did collide and crash, but there were two distinct crash sites, separated by over {{convert|160|mi|km}} of water. However, Kusche's research<ref name="Kusche, 1975"/> showed that the unclassified version of the Air Force investigation report stated that the debris field defining the second "crash site" was examined by a search and rescue ship, and found to be a mass of [[seaweed]] and [[driftwood]] tangled in an old [[buoy]].

===''Connemara IV''===
A pleasure yacht was found adrift in the Atlantic south of Bermuda on September 26, 1955; it is usually stated in the stories (Berlitz, Winer<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="Winer, 1974"/>) that the crew vanished while the yacht survived being at sea during three hurricanes. The [[1955 Atlantic hurricane season]] shows [[Hurricane Ione]] passing nearby between the 14th and 18th of that month, with Bermuda being affected by winds of almost gale force.<ref name="Kusche, 1975"/> In his second book on the Bermuda Triangle, Winer quoted from a letter he had received from Mr J.E. Challenor of Barbados:

<blockquote><p>On the morning of September 22 ''Connemara IV'' was lying to a heavy mooring in the open [[roadstead]] of [[Carlisle Bay, Barbados|Carlisle Bay]]. Because of the approaching hurricane, the owner strengthened the mooring ropes and put out two additional anchors. There was little else he could do, as the exposed mooring was the only available anchorage.
<br/>
...
<br/>
In Carlisle Bay, the sea in the wake of [[Hurricane Janet]] was awe-inspiring and dangerous. The owner of ''Connemara IV'' observed that she had disappeared. An investigation revealed that she had dragged her moorings and gone to sea.</p></blockquote> <ref name="Winer, 1975">{{harv|Winer|1975|pp=95–96}}</ref>

==Influence on culture==

* Composer [[Isao Tomita]] released an album, ''[[Bermuda Triangle (Tomita album)|Bermuda Triangle]]'', inspired by the region.
* Singer-songwriter [[Barry Manilow]]'s single, "[[Bermuda Triangle (song)|Bermuda Triangle]]" (released in 1981), was taken from his album ''[[Barry (album)|Barry]]'' (1980).
* The first film based on the Triangle was ''[[The Bermuda Triangle (1978 film)|The Bermuda Triangle]]'' (1978). Later films include ''[[The Triangle (film)|The Triangle]]'' (2001) and the ''[[The Triangle (TV miniseries)|eponymous TV miniseries]] (2005).
