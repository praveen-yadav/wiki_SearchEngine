'''Azad Jammu and Kashmir''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|آزاد جموں و کشمیر}}}} ''Azad Jammu o Kashmir'') abbreviated '''AJK''' or, for short, '''Azad Kashmir''' (literally "Free Kashmir") is the southernmost and the smaller of two political entities which together constitute the [[Pakistan]]i-controlled part of the former [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], which ceased to exist as a result of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|first Kashmir war]] in 1947. The northernmost and the larger of the two political entities is the Pakistani-controlled territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. Azad Jammu and Kashmir borders the Indian-controlled state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] to the east (separated from it by the [[Line of Control]]), Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] Province to the west, the Pakistani-controlled territory of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] to the north, and Pakistan's [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] Province to the south. With its capital at [[Muzaffarabad]], Azad Jammu and Kashmir covers an area of {{convert|13297|km2|sqmi}} and has an estimated population of about four million.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan together constitute the region referred to as "Pakistani-controlled Kashmir" by the United Nations<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/afghan?page=news&id=4547518b2 Afghans in Pakistan: documenting a population on the move – UNHCR]</ref><ref>[http://ochaonline.un.org/humanitarianappeal/webpage.asp?Page=1893 Humanitarian Appeal: About the CAP – Copy of CAP Pakistan 2010 – Flash Appeal (PIFERP) Rev2<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and other international organizations and as "Pakistan-occupied Kashmir" in India,<ref>[http://www.sify.com/news/china-has-major-presence-in-pakistan-occupied-kashmir-gilgit-activist-news-international-kjcnubijjdc.html China has major presence in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir: Gilgit activist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in contrast to the names "Indian-administered Kashmir" and "Indian-occupied Kashmir" (in Pakistan), referring to the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The area which comprises Azad Jammu and Kashmir was captured from the princely state by rebelling militias and the [[Pakistani army]]. 

==History==
{{Main|History of Azad Kashmir}}
{{Further2|[[History of Kashmir]]}}

[[File:Kashmir region 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the entire Kashmir region]]
At the time of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the British abandoned their [[suzerainty]] over the [[princely states]], which were left with the options of joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent. [[Hari Singh]], the [[maharaja]] of Jammu and Kashmir, wanted his state to remain independent. In order to buy some time, he signed a stand-still agreement, which sidestepped the encouragement of the princely states to join either India or Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatogether.org/peace/kashmir/intro.htm |title=The J&K conflict: A Chronological Introduction |publisher=India Together |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref> Later, there was a revolution by Muslims in the western part of the state,<ref name = britannica>{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312908/Kashmir |title=Kashmir (region, Indian subcontinent) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref> as raiders from what was then the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] and the tribal areas feared that Hari Singh might accede to the Union of India. In October 1947, they attacked Kashmir in an attempt to take control of the princely state. Initially, Hari Singh tried to counter the invasion but failed. He then requested the military assistance of India, which responded that it would not help him unless he acceded to India. On October 26, 1947, Hari Singh signed an [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]],<ref name="BBC2739993">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2739993.stm BBC News Kashmir dispute]</ref> and Indian troops were immediately airlifted into Srinagar. Pakistan intervened subsequently.<ref name = britannica /> Fighting ensued between the Indian and Pakistani armies, with the two areas of control stabilized, more or less, around what is now known as the "[[Line of Control]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southasianmedia.net/magazine/journal/grasping_nettle.htm|title=Grasping the Nettle|author=Prem Shankar Jha|work=South Asian Journal}}</ref>

Later, India approached the United Nations, asking it to solve the dispute, and resolutions were passed in favor of the holding of a plebiscite with regard to Kashmir's future. However, no such plebiscite has ever been held on either side, since there was a precondition which required the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army along with the non-state elements and the subsequent partial withdrawal of the Indian Army.<ref name="UN Resolution 47">{{cite web|title=UN resolution 47|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=S/RES/47%20(1948)&Lang=E&Area=RESOLUTION|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref>  from the parts of Kashmir under their respective control – a withdrawal that never took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianembassy.org/policy/Kashmir/uncip(s1100).htm|title= UNCIP Resolution of August 13, 1948 (S/1100) – Embassy of India, Washington, D.C.}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref> In 1949, a cease-fire line separating the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir was formally put into effect.

Following the 1949 cease-fire agreement, the government of Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir which it held into the following two separately-controlled political entities:
* Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) – the narrow, southern part, {{convert|250|mi|km}} long, with a width varying from {{convert|10|to|40|mi|km}}.
* [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] formerly called the [[Federally Administered Northern Areas]] (FANA) – the much larger political entity to the north of AJK with an area of {{convert|72496|km2|sqmi}}. It was directly administered by Pakistan as a de facto dependent territory, i.e., a non-self-governing territory. However, it was ostensibly granted "full autonomy" on August 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=David |url=http://www.daily.pk/pakistan-grants-full-autonomy-to-northern-areas-9753/ |title=Pakistan grants full autonomy to northern areas &#124; Pakistan Daily |publisher=Daily.pk |date=August 30, 2009 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref>

An area of Kashmir that was once under Pakistani control is the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract|Shaksgam tract]], a small region along the northeastern border of Gilgit-Baltistan that was provisionally ceded by Pakistan to the People's Republic of China in 1963 and which now forms part of China's [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region. 

In 1972, the then-current border between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir was designated as the "[[Line of Control]]". The Line of Control has remained unchanged<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmogip/|title= UNMOGIP: United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan}}</ref> since the 1972 [[Simla Agreement]], which bound the two countries "to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations". Some political experts claim that, in view of that pact, the only solution to the issue is mutual negotiation between the two countries without involving a third party such as the United Nations.

===Kashmir-related holidays===
[[Azad Kashmir Day]] is celebrated in Azad Jammu and Kashmir on October 24, which is the day that the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government was created in 1947. Pakistan has celebrated [[Kashmir Solidarity Day]] on February 5 of each year since 1990 as a day of protest against [[India]]'s ''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty over its State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Pakistan to observe Kashmir Solidarity Day today |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/05/stories/2007020503731300.htm |work=The Hindu  |date=February 5, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-05 }}</ref> That day is a [[Public holidays in Pakistan|national holiday]] in Pakistan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kashmir Day being observed today |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=36715 |work=[[The News International]] |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-05 }}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Muzaffarabad Azad Kashmir.svg|thumb|150px|Districts of Azad Kashmir]]
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a self-governing state under Pakistani control, but under [[Constitution of Pakistan|Pakistan's constitution]] the state is not actually part of Pakistan.{{clarify|date=June 2013}}.<ref name=brit/><ref name=ajk144/> Azad Kashmir has its own elected [[President]], [[Prime Minister]], [[Legislative Assembly]], [[High Court]], with Khawaja Shahad Ahmad as its present chief justice, and official flag.  The government of Pakistan has not yet allowed Azad Kashmir to issue its own postage stamps, meaning that those of Pakistan are used instead. [[Brad Adams]] the Asia director at Human Rights Watch has said in 2006 <blockquote>Although ‘azad’ means ‘free,’ the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but, The Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir with strict controls on basic freedoms.<ref name=Adams>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Brad|title=Pakistan: ‘Free Kashmir’ Far From Free|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/20/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref></blockquote> 

Azad Kashmir's financial matters, i.e., budget and tax affairs, are dealt with by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council rather than by Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council is a supreme body consisting of 11 members, six from the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and five from the government of Pakistan. Its chairman/chief executive is the president of Pakistan. Other members of the council are the president and the prime minister of Azad Kashmir and a few other AJK ministers.<ref name=brit>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46696/Azad-Kashmir# Azad Kashmir]" at britannica.com</ref><ref name=ajk144>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajk.gov.pk/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2257&Itemid=144|title=Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Introduction|accessdate=June 22, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927000235/http://www.ajk.gov.pk/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2257&Itemid=144|archivedate=Sep 27, 2007}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Kashmir}}
The culture of Azad Kashmir has many similarities to that of northern Punjabi ([[Pothohar Plateau|Potohar]]) culture in [[Punjab]] province. The natives of Azad Kashmir speak [[Urdu]],  [[Potwari language|Potwari]], and the [[Pahari languages|Pahari]] languages. The traditional dress of Kashmiri women is the [[shalwar kameez]] in Pahari style. The shalwar kameez is commonly worn by both men and women. Women use the [[shawl]] or [[pashmina|Kashmir shawl]] to cover their head and upper body.

The popular and traditional cuisines of Azad Kashmir are Kashmiri Raan (Fried leg of lamb in Kashmiri style), Rogan Josh, Balti Gosht, Kashmiri Dal Chawal (A mixture of [[split peas]], split red lentils, and boiled rice), and Dam Aloo (Fried Potatoes in Kashmiri style).

==Ethnic groups==
{{Main|Ethnic groups of Azad Kashmir}}

Azad Jammu and Kashmir is predominantly Muslim. The majority of the population is culturally, linguistically, and ethnically related to the people of northern Punjab.

The principal languages spoken are [[Pahari languages|Pahari]], [[Gojri]], [[Dogri]], [[Pothohari language|Potohari]], [[Urdu]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Pashto]], and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

A large number of residents of this area have relatives who live in England.

==Economy and resources==
{{Main|Economy of Azad Kashmir}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

In the mid-1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in Azad Kashmir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pndajk.gov.pk/history.asp|title= History of Planning & Development Department in AJK}}</ref> In the 1960s, with the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]] in [[Mirpur District]], the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government began to receive royalties from the Pakistani government for the electricity that the dam provided to Pakistan. During the mid-2000s, a multi-billion dollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].<ref name="dawn.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/10/01/nat9.htm|title=‘Rs1.25 trillion to be spent in Azad Kashmir’: Reconstruction in quake-hit zone|last=Naqash|first=Tariq|date=October 1, 2006|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|location=Muzaffarabad}}</ref>

Agriculture is a major part of Azad Kashmir's economy. Low-lying areas that have high populations grow crops like [[barley]], [[mango]]es, [[millet]], [[maize|corn]] (maize), and wheat, and also raise cattle. In the elevated areas that are less populated and more spread-out, forestry, corn, and livestock are the main sources of income.

There are mineral and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Muzaffarabad]]. There are also graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are also reservoirs of low-grade coal, [[chalk]], [[bauxite]], and [[zircon]]. Local household industries produce carved wooden objects, textiles, and dhurrie carpets.<ref name=brit/> There is also an arts and crafts industry that produces such cultural goods as namdas, shawls, pashmina, pherans, [[Papier-mâché]], basketry copper, rugs, wood carving, silk and woolen clothing, patto, carpets, namda gubba, and silverware. Agricultural goods produced in the region include mushrooms, honey, walnuts, apples, cherries, medicinal herbs and plants, resin, deodar, kail, chir, fir, maple, and ash timber.<ref name=brit/><ref name=ajk144/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajk.gov.pk/tourism/administrative.html|title=Azad Jammu & Kashmir – Tourism|accessdate=June 22, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080529093455/http://www.ajk.gov.pk/tourism/administrative.html|archivedate=May 29, 2008}}</ref>

In addition to agriculture, textiles, and arts and crafts, remittances have played a major role in the economy of Azad Kashmir. One analyst estimated that the figure for Azad Kashmir was 25.1% in 2001. With regard to annual household income, people living in the  higher areas are more dependent on remittances than are those living in the lower areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sdpi.org/whats_new/recent_publications/BGPaper_Remittances_Pakistan.pdf |title=Remittances in crises: a case study from Pakistan |author=Abid Qaiyum Suleri|coauthors=Kevin Savage|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-06-05}}</ref>

In the latter part of 2006, billions of dollars for development were mooted by [[international aid agencies]] for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake-hit zones in Azad Kashmir, though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels, leading to considerable delays in help getting to the most needy. Hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake.<ref name="dawn.com"/> A land-use plan for the city of [[Muzaffarabad]] was prepared by the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]].

Remittances by [[British Pakistanis]] form an important part of the region's economy.
