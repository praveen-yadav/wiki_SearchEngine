'''''Batman Returns''''' is a 1992 American [[superhero film]] produced and directed by [[Tim Burton]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. It is the second installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Burton/Schumacher Batman film series|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Michael Keaton]] reprising the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The film introduces the characters of [[Max Schreck#Cultural references|Max Shreck]] ([[Christopher Walken]]), a business tycoon who teams up with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Danny DeVito]]) to take over [[Gotham City]], as well as the character of [[Catwoman]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]).

Burton originally did not want to direct another Batman film because of his mixed emotions toward the [[Batman (1989 film)|previous film]] in 1989. [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] delivered a script that satisfied Burton; [[Wesley Strick]] did an uncredited rewrite, removing the characters of [[Harvey Dent]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and rewriting the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]. Before Pfeiffer's casting, [[Demi Moore]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] were each offered the role of Catwoman, but both of them turned it down. Filming of ''Batman Returns'' started in [[Burbank, California]] in June 1991.

''Batman Returns'' was released on June 19, 1992 to financial and critical success, though it caused some controversy for being darker than its predecessor. The film's budget was an estimated $80 million, while it made $45,687,710 in the United States during its opening weekend (June 19–21, 1992), grossing $282,800,000 worldwide.<ref name="imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/</ref> The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], as well as winning the [[Saturn Award for Best Makeup]]. It was also nominated for a Saturn Award in the categories of [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Burton, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for DeVito and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]].<ref name="imdb.com"/>

==Plot==
In [[Gotham City]], a wealthy couple, Tucker and Ester Cobblepot ([[Paul Reubens]] and [[Diane Salinger]]) throw their deformed infant son into the sewer; the boy survives, however, and is found by a flock of [[penguin]]s. Thirty-three years later, the child, Oswald Cobblepot ([[Danny DeVito]]), resurfaces as a criminal, the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], who kidnaps millionaire industrialist Max Shreck ([[Christopher Walken]]). With evidence of his corporate crimes, Cobblepot blackmails Shreck into helping him leave the sewers to become part of Gotham's elite. The Penguin arranges for the Mayor's child to be kidnapped, whom he then "rescues" in order to set himself up as a public hero. Late one night, upon returning to his office, Shreck surprises his secretary [[Selina Kyle]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), in the course of her preparation for being saved by [[Batman]] ([[Michael Keaton]]) regarding Shreck's proposed [[power plant]].

While innocently pulling relevant documents, Selina accesses Shreck's protected files, uncovering compromising information, revealing that the plant will drain Gotham's power supply. Realizing Selina knows too much, Shreck pushes her out of a window, leaving her for dead on the ground many stories below. Selina survives the fall after being revived by alley cats. She returns to her apartment, then suffers a [[psychotic break]] and reinvents herself as [[Catwoman]], a catsuit-clad burglar dedicated to getting revenge on her boss. Shreck then hatches a plan to [[recall election|recall]] Gotham City's current mayor ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]) and elect the Penguin in his place, in order to cement his control over the city and complete his power plant project. The Penguin's gang of circus performers cause chaos around Gotham to create bad press for the Mayor. Meanwhile, Bruce's alter-ego [[Batman]] tries to defend Gotham from Catwoman and the Penguin's gang.

Selina falls in love with Bruce, a situation complicated by Catwoman's teaming with the Penguin in an effort to rid Gotham of Batman. They kidnap The Ice Princess ([[Cristi Conaway]]), a woman chosen to turn on the Gotham Christmas Tree lights, and frame Batman for the crime. Finding The Princess balancing precariously on the ledge of a high building, Batman tries to save her, but to no avail; the Penguin unleashes an umbrella full of bats which frighten The Princess into plunging to her death, and makes it look like Batman killed her. When Catwoman rejects his advances, the Penguin tries, unsuccessfully, to kill her. When Batman returns to the [[Batmobile]], he finds that the Penguin has sabotaged it; as the Penguin takes the [[Batmobile]] on a remote-controlled rampage through Gotham, he gloats about fooling the entire city. Batman ultimately escapes the Penguin's trap, however. When Bruce exposes the Penguin's plans to dupe Gotham, thereby ruining his election chances, the Penguin initiates a plan to murder all of Gotham's first-born sons by kidnapping and taking them into his lair to drown them in a pool of water that has been contaminated with Shreck's toxic waste.

He personally attempts to take Max's son, Charles "Chip" Shreck ([[Andrew Bryniarski]]), but agrees to take Max instead. Batman foils the Penguin's scheme, whereupon the Penguin then decides to launch missiles around Gotham using mind-controlled penguins. However, Batman is able to jam the frequency used to control the penguins and has missiles launched at the Penguin's base. Batman confronts the Penguin, which culminates in the Penguin falling into the toxic waters in his lair. Batman tries to persuade Catwoman to turn Shreck over to the police, even unmasking himself in the process, but Shreck draws a gun. Catwoman claims that she still has six of her [[Cat#History and mythology|nine lives]] left, and remains standing after Shreck shoots her four times. Catwoman uses a [[taser]] which she took from a circus clown's body earlier in the film to cause an explosion, electrocuting Shreck and apparently sacrificing herself (using up her "eighth life"). The Penguin then emerges from the toxic water and tries to kill Batman, but he succumbs to his wounds. His penguins then take his body into the sewer waters as a final resting place.

Later, Bruce is being driven around the city at night with butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] ([[Michael Gough]]) and sees what looks like Catwoman's shadow on a wall. Alfred stops the car, and Bruce finds Selina's cat Miss Kitty, which he takes with him and leaves. It's implied she's leaving the cat with him. As the [[Bat-Signal]] lights up the night sky, we see a rear shot of Catwoman gazing up at it.

==Production==

===Development===
After the success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] were hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at [[Pinewood Studios]]. They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. [[Tim Burton]] had mixed emotions about directing another film in the franchise after his experiences with the previous film. "I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting", he said in 1989. "Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea."<ref>Alan Jones (November 1989). "Batman in Production", ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', pp. 75—88. Retrieved August 14, 2008.</ref> Burton decided to direct ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Meanwhile, [[Sam Hamm]] from the previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script, while [[Bob Kane]] was brought back as a creative consultant.<ref name=cinema>[[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[Denise Di Novi]], [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Dark Side of the Knight'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Hamm's script had [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and [[Catwoman]] going after hidden treasure.<ref name=Mad/>

Burton was impressed with [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]' work on ''[[Heathers]]''; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. Warner Bros. then granted Burton a large amount of creative control, demoting producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] to executive producers. Dissatisfied with the Hamm script, Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters.<ref name=cinema/><ref name=beetle>Judy Sloane (August 1995). "Daniel Waters on Writing", ''Film Review'', pp. 67—69. Retrieved August 14, 2008.</ref><ref name=forever/> Waters "came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor's office by the Penguin", Waters reported. "I wanted to show that the true villains of our world don't necessarily wear costumes."<ref name=Mad/> The [[plot device]] of Penguin running for Mayor came from [[Batman (TV series)|the 1960s TV series]] episodes "Hizzoner the Penguin" and "Dizzoner the Penguin".<ref name=Mad>Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). "Three Go Mad in Gotham", ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 39—46. Retrieved August 14, 2008.</ref> Waters wrote a total of five drafts.<ref name=forever>{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | pages =117–122 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Batman on Burton's Terms}}</ref>

On the characterization of Catwoman, Waters explained "Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary."<ref name=beetle/> [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. Waters quoted, "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie."<ref name=beetle/> In early scripts Max Shreck was the "golden boy" of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother.<ref name=villain>[[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], [[Alex Ross]], ''Batman Returns: Villains'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Max Shreck was also a reference to actor [[Max Schreck]], known for his role as [[Count Orlok]] in ''[[Nosferatu]]''.<ref name=forever/> According to casting director Marion Dougherty, Burton was reportedly uncomfortable with casting [[Christopher Walken]] as Shreck, on the basis that the actor scared him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP9JVmHBOno#t=44s |title=Christopher Walken as Max Shreck |publisher=YouTube |date=September 2, 2011 |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

Burton hired [[Wesley Strick]] to do an uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, "When I was hired to write ''Batman Returns'' (''Batman II'' at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'."<ref name=stick>{{cite book | author=David Hughes | title =Comic Book Movies | publisher =[[Virgin Books]] | year =2003 | pages =33–46 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6| chapter = Batman}}</ref> Warner Bros. presented Strick with warming or freezing [[Gotham City]] (a plot point later to be used in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''). Strick gained inspiration from a [[Moses]] parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby.<ref name=stick/> [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [Batman as] the loner of loners." Robin started out as a juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenaged garage mechanic.<ref name=beetle/> Waters explained, "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the [[Batmobile]], which I notice they used in the [[Batman Forever|third film]]!"<ref name=beetle/> [[Marlon Wayans]] was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.<ref>{{cite news | author = Nathan Rabin | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23240 | title = Wayans world | work = [[The A.V.

[[Michael Keaton]] returned after a significant increase in his salary at $10 million.

===Filming===
[[File:Batman Returns set.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gotham City]] Square set built inside Studio 16 on Warner Bros. Studios.]]
In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest [[sound stage]]s (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at [[Universal Studios]]) were being prepared for the filming of ''Batman Returns''.<ref name=Mad/> Filming started in June 1991.<ref name=Sally/> Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on [[Rockefeller Center]]. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used.<ref name=Mad/> Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable.<ref name=Sally/> Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used, over 50% of their property was occupied by [[Gotham City]] sets.<ref name=Mad/>

[[Animal rights]] groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs. Richard Hill, the [[curator]] of the penguins, explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable.<ref name=Ow/> "On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees", recalls Hill. "In Hollywood, they were given a refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks. Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees."<ref name=Ow>Owain Yolland (August 1992).

Warner Bros. devoted a large amount of secrecy for ''Batman Returns''. The [[art department]] was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's [[Working title#Title ruse|fake working title]] ''Dictel'' to go anywhere near the sets.<ref>{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310819,00.html | title = Sets Appeal: Designing ''Batman Returns'' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}</ref> [[Kevin Costner]] was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a [[private investigator]] to track down the accomplice.<ref name=Mad/> $65 million was spent during the production of ''Batman Returns'', while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million.<ref name=Mac/> The final shot of Catwoman looking at the [[Bat-Signal]] was completed during [[post-production]] and was not part of the [[shooting script]]. After ''Batman Returns'' was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a [[body double]] was chosen.<ref name=cinema/>

===Design and effects===
[[Bo Welch]], Burton's collaborator on ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', replaced [[Anton Furst]] as [[production designer]], since Furst was unable to return for the sequel due to contractual obligations.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/when-hell-burst-through-the-pavement-and-grew-anton-furst-conjured-up-batmans-gotham-city-in-england-he-was-a-creator-of-dreams-but-in-hollywood-his-dreams-ended-simon-garfield-reports-1531040.html When hell burst through the pavement and grew: Anton Furst conjured up Batman's Gotham City.

===Music===

[[Danny Elfman]] had great enthusiasm for returning because "I didn't have to prove myself from the first film.

The musician co-orchestrated "[[Face to Face (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Face to Face]]", which was written and performed by [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.<ref name=inside/>

===Critical reception===
''Batman Returns'' was generally well received by both reviewers and audiences. Based on 63 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 81% of reviewers enjoyed the film, and the consensus: "Director Tim Burton's dark, brooding atmosphere, Michael Keaton's work as the tormented hero, and the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken, make the sequel better than the first."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_returns/ | title = Batman Returns | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = April 25, 2013}}</ref>

[[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought that "Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits, all of them rendered with the mixture of horror, sympathy and playfulness that has become this director's hallmark." She described [[Michael Keaton]] as showing "appropriate earnestness", [[Danny DeVito]] as "conveying verve", [[Christopher Walken]] as "wonderfully debonair", [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as "captivating... fierce, seductive", [[Bo Welch]]'s production design as "dazzling", Stefan Czapsky's cinematography as "crisp", and [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]'s screenplay as "sharp."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 | title = Movie Review—Batman Returns |work=The New York Times | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =November 17, 2009|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225309/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 |archivedate = May 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[Peter Travers]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: "Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams." He praised the performances: "Pfeiffer gives this feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit; she's a classic dazzler... Michael Keaton's manic-depressive hero remains a remarkably rich creation. And Danny DeVito's mutant Penguin—a balloon-bellied ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' with a kingdom of sewer freaks—is as hilariously warped as [[Jack Nicholson]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and even quicker with the quips."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns | title = Batman Returns | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | author = [[Peter Travers]] | date = February 7, 2001 | accessdate =August 14, 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071104160020/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns |archivedate = November 4, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[Desson Thomson|Desson Howe]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: "Director Burton not only re-creates his one-of-a-kind atmosphere, he one-ups it, even two-ups it. He's best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds in which his characters reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Phantom of the Opera]]''-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owner's inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a ''Batman'' movie. But ''Returns'' comes closer than ever to [[Bob Kane]]'s dark, original strip, which began in 1939." He described Walken as "engaging", DeVito as "exquisite" and Pfeiffer as "deliciously purry."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/batmanreturnspg13howe_a07fbb.htm | title = Batman Returns |work=The Washington Post | author = Desson Howe | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}</ref>

Todd McCarthy in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but the result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses." He praised the contributions of [[Stan Winston]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Bo Welch]] and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that "the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains", calling DeVito "fascinating" and Pfeiffer "very tasty."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901465.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 | title = Batman Returns |work = Variety | author = Todd McCarthy | date = June 15, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}</ref>

Conversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two stars, writing: "I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a ''Batman'' story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and [[film noir]] don't go together; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes." He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role."<ref>{{cite news | work = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920619/REVIEWS/206190301/1023 | title = Batman | accessdate =August 14, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080807203730/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920619/REVIEWS/206190301/1023| archivedate= August 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] called DeVito "a pale substitute for [[Jack Nicholson]] from the first film" and felt that "there's no suspense in ''Batman Returns'' whatsoever".<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | title = Batman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/771_BATMAN_RETURNS | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}</ref> Batman comic book writer/artist [[Matt Wagner]] was quoted as saying: "I hated how ''Batman Returns'' made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked."<ref>{{cite news | author = Bill "Jett" Ramey | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_mattwagner_jett_2006.html | title = Interview: Matt Wagner | work = Batman-on-Film | date = September 30, 2006 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}</ref>

Ty Burr in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B-; he wrote that "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by ''Batman Returns'': Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film."<ref>{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|title=Video Review: Batman Returns|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312091,00.html|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 23, 1992}}</ref>

''Batman Returns'' was also criticized for propagating [[anti-Semitic]] overtones, more particularly the Penguin's character as a [[Jewish stereotypes|stereotypical Jew]] who is out for revenge and murdering every first-born.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roiphe |first1=Rebecca |last2=Cooper |first2=Daniel |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19920707&id=tUtWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WeoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1284,2131409 |title='Batman' allegory disturbing |work=The Gainesville Sun |date=July 7, 1992 |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

''Batman Returns'' was the last film in the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] that featured [[Tim Burton]] and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor, respectively. With the following film, ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Warner Bros. decided to go in a "lighter" direction to be more [[mainstream]] in the process of a [[family film]]. Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer and approved of [[Joel Schumacher]] as director.<ref name=Russo>{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html | title = 'Batman 3' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = October 1, 1993 | accessdate = August 16, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080921055255/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html| archivedate= September 21, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> With [[Warner Bros.]] moving on development for ''Batman Forever'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] was announced. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in ''Forever'' because of "her own little movie".<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR107881 | title = Dish | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = June 17, 1993 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}</ref>

Burton became attached as director, while producer [[Denise Di Novi]] and writer [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] also returned to the ''Catwoman'' spin-off with Burton.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR109036 | title = Another life at WB for ''Catwoman'' and Burton? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = July 22, 1993 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}</ref> In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct ''Catwoman'' or an adaptation of ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR117395 | title = Seagal on the pulpit may be too much for WB | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = January 13, 1994 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}</ref> On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his ''Catwoman'' script to Warner Bros., the same day ''Batman Forever'' was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, "turning it in the day ''Batman Forever'' opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. ''Catwoman'' is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script."<ref name=beetle/> The film labored in [[development hell]] for years, with Pfeiffer getting replaced by [[Ashley Judd]]. The film ended up becoming the critically panned ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004) starring [[Halle Berry]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117796285 | title = WB: Judd purr-fect as ''Cat'' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = April 2, 2001 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/ | title = Catwoman | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = August 15, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080814183849/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/| archivedate= August 14, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
