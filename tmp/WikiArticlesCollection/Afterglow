An '''afterglow''' is a broad high arch of whitish or rosy light appearing in the [[sky]] due to very fine particles of [[dust]] suspended in the high regions of the [[earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of deepening [[twilight]], or [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] from the high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[white]] [[light]].  

After the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. These were due to an enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust blown to a great height by the volcano's explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric currents. [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]'' possibly depicts an afterglow during this period.
