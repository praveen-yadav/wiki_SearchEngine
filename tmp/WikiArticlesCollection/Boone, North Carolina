'''Boone''' is a town located in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of western [[North Carolina]], United States.  Boone's population was 17,122 in 2010. Boone is the [[county seat]] of [[Watauga County, North Carolina|Watauga County]] and the home of [[Appalachian State University]].
The town is named for famous [[American pioneer]] and explorer [[Daniel Boone]], and every summer since 1952 has hosted an outdoor amphitheatre portrayal of the life and times of its namesake.

In 2012, Boone was listed among the 10 best places to retire in the U.S. by U.S. News.<ref>[http://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/2011/10/17/the-10-best-places-to-retire-in-2012 The 10 Best Places to Retire in 2012]</ref>

==Boone==

[[File:Boone NC - aerial.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Boone as seen from [[Howard's Knob]]]] Boone took its name from the famous pioneer and explorer [[Daniel Boone]], who on several occasions camped at a site generally agreed to be within the present city limits.  Daniel's nephews, Jesse and Jonathan (sons of brother Israel Boone), were founders of the town's first church, Three Forks Baptist, still in existence today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
Boone was served by the [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad]] (nicknamed "[[Tweetsie Railroad|Tweetsie]]") until the flood of 1940.  The flood washed away much of the tracks and it was decided not to replace them.

Boone is the home of [[Appalachian State University]], a constituent member of the [[University of North Carolina]].
Appalachian State is the sixth largest university in the seventeen-campus system.
[[Caldwell Community College & Technical Institute]] also operates a satellite campus in Boone.

"''[[Horn in the West]]''", a dramatization of the life and times of the early settlers of the mountain area, which features Daniel Boone as one of its characters, has been performed in an outdoor [[amphitheatre]] above the town every summer since 1952.
The original actor in the role of "Daniel Boone" was [[Ned Austin]]. His "Hollywood Star" stands on a pedestal on King Street in downtown Boone.  He was followed in the role by Glenn Causey, who portrayed the rugged frontiersman for 41 years, and whose image is still seen in many of the depictions of Boone featured in the area today.

The late guitarist [[Michael Houser]] was born in Boone.
He is best known as a founding member of and lead guitarist for the band [[Widespread Panic]].
The late, [[Grammy|Grammy Award-winning]] guitar player [[Doc Watson]] also came from the Boone area, as do many [[bluegrass music]]ians and [[Appalachia]]n [[storytelling|storytellers]].

==Geography and climate==
Boone is located at {{Coord|36|12|41|N|81|40|7|W|type:city}} (36.211364, −81.668657){{GR|1}} and has an elevation of 3,333 feet (1015.9 m) above mean sea level. An earlier survey gave the elevation as 3,332&nbsp;ft and since then it has been published as having an elevation of 3,333&nbsp;ft (1,016 m). Boone has the highest elevation of any town of its size (over 10,000 population) east of the [[Mississippi River]]. As such, Boone features, depending on the [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] used, a [[oceanic climate|subtropical highland]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''), or a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfb''), a rarity for the Southeastern United States, and straddles the boundary between [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]]s 6B and 7A;<ref>[http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=28607&submit=Look+it+up%21]</ref> the elevation also results in enhanced precipitation, with {{convert|52.7|in|sigfig=3}} of average annual precipitation. Compared to the lower elevations of the Carolinas, winters are long and cold, with frequent [[Ice pellets|sleet]] and [[snowfall]]. The daily average temperature in January is {{convert|31.2|°F|1}},<ref name = NOAA /> which gives Boone a winter climate more similar to coastal southern [[New England]] rather than the Southeast, where a [[humid subtropical]] climate dominates. Blizzard-like conditions are not unusual during many winters. Summers are warm, but far cooler and less humid than lower regions to the south and east, with a July daily average temperature of {{convert|68.5|°F|1}}.<ref name = NOAA /> Boone typically receives on average nearly {{convert|35|in|cm|0}} of snowfall annually, far higher than the lowland areas in the rest of North Carolina.

As of the census{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 13,472 people, 4,374 households, and 1,237 families residing in the town. The [[population density]] was 2,307.0 people per square mile (890.7/km²). There were 4,748 housing units at an average density of 813.0 per square mile (313.9/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 93.98% [[White American|White]], 3.42% [[African American|Black or African American]], 0.30% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 1.19% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.05% [[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]], 0.46% from [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census#Race|other races]], and 0.60% from [[Multiracial American|two or more races]]. 1.64% of the population were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] of any race.{{GR|2}}

There were 4,374 households out of which 9.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 21.0% were married couples living together, 5.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 71.7% were non-families. 38.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.97 and the average family size was 2.63.{{GR|2}}

The age distribution is 5.8% under 18, 65.9% from 18 to 24, 12.1% from 25 to 44, 9.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% who were 65 or older. The median age was 21 years. Both the overall age distribution and the median age are driven by the presence of the local university, Appalachian State. For every 100 females there are 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.7 males.{{GR|2}}

The median household income is $20,541, and the median family income is $49,762. The [[per capita income]] is $12,256. 37.0% of the population and 9.2% of families were below the [[poverty line]].{{GR|2}}

Men had a median income of $28,060 versus $20,000 for women.  However, poverty statistics that are based on surveys of the entire population can be extremely misleading in communities dominated by students, such as Boone. Out of the total population, 6.3% of those under the age of 18 and 9.1% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.{{GR|2}}

==Development==

Industrial, commercial, and residential development in the town of Boone is a controversial issue due to its location in the mountains of Appalachia. On October 16, 2009, the town council accepted the "Boone 2030 Land Use Plan."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boone2030.blogspot.com/ |title=Boone2030Blogspot |publisher=TownOfBoone |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> While the document itself is not in any way actual law, it is used by the town council, board of adjustment, and other committees to guide decision making as to what types of development are appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelawrencegroup.com/boone2030/finalDocs/BooneReportFinalBook110609.pdf |title=Boone 2030 Land Use Plan PDF |publisher=Lawrence Group |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] began widening 1.1 miles of U.S. 421 (King Street) to a four to six-lane divided highway with a raised concrete median from U.S. 321 (Hardin Street) to east of N.C. 194 (Jefferson Road), including a new entrance and exit to the new Watauga High School, at a cost of $16.2 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/us421widening/ |title=NC DOT US421 Widening Project |publisher=NCDOT |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> The widening has displaced 25 businesses and 63 residences east of historic downtown King Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wataugademocrat.com/2007/0312web/statedotpaves.php |title=statedotpaves |publisher=Wataugademocrat.com |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> The project was slated to be completed by December 31, 2011; as of 16 March 2012, construction is ongoing.
