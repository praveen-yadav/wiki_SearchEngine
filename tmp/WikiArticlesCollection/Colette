'''Colette''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ.lɛt|pron}}) was the surname of the [[France|French]] [[novelist]] and performer '''Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette''' (28 January 1873 – 3 August 1954). She is best known for her novel ''[[Gigi]]'', upon which [[Lerner and Loewe]] based the stage and film [[Musical comedy|musical comedies]] of the same title.

==Early life and marriage==
Colette was born to retired military officer Jules-Joseph Colette and his wife Adèle Eugénie Sidonie "Sido" Colette (nėe Landoy) in [[Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye]], [[Yonne]], in the [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy Region]] of France. She studied piano as a child and received her primary school diploma with high marks in mathematics and dictation.<ref>{{cite book |title= Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette|last= Thurman|first= Judith|year=1999 |publisher= Ballantine Books|location= New York|isbn=0-345-37103-8 |page=36}}</ref> In 1893, at age 20, she married [[Henry Gauthier-Villars]], a famous wit known as "Willy", who was 15 years her senior.  He was a writer, music critic, and described as a "literary charlatan and degenerate".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/colette.htm |title=Colette |publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi |date=3 August 1954 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>

Her first books, the ''[[Claudine (book series)|Claudine]]'' series, were published under her husband's pen name "Willy".  ''Claudine'' still has the power to charm; in ''belle époque'' France it was downright shocking, much to Willy's satisfaction and profit.

==Music hall career, affairs with women==
In 1906, she left the unfaithful Gauthier-Villars, living for a time at the home of the American writer and salonist [[Natalie Clifford Barney]]. The two had a short affair, and remained friends until Colette's death.<ref name="rodriguez">{{cite book | last = Rodriguez | first = Suzanne | year = 2002 | title = Wild Heart: A Life: Natalie Clifford Barney and the Decadence of Literary Paris | location = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | isbn = 0-06-093780-7 | page = 131}}</ref>

Colette went to work in the [[music hall]]s of Paris, under the wing of [[Mathilde de Morny, Marquise de Belbeuf]], known as Missy, with whom she became romantically involved. In 1907, the two performed together in a pantomime entitled ''Rêve d'Égypte'' at the [[Moulin Rouge]]. Their onstage kiss nearly caused a riot, which the police were called in to suppress. As a result of this scandal, further performances of ''Rêve d'Égypte'' were banned, and Colette and de Morny were no longer able to live together openly, though their relationship continued for five years.<ref>{{cite book | last = Benstock | first = Shari | year = 1986 | title = Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900&ndash;1940 | location = Texas | publisher = University of Texas Press | isbn = 0-292-79040-6 | pages = 48–49}}</ref> She also was involved in a heterosexual relationship during this time, with the Italian writer [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. Another affair during this period was with the automobile-empire scion [[Auguste Heriot]].

==Second marriage, affair with stepson==
In 1912, Colette married Henri de Jouvenel, the editor of the newspaper ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]''. The couple had one daughter, [[Colette de Jouvenel]], known to the family as Bel-Gazou ("beautiful babbling/chirping" in [[Provençal dialect|local dialect]]). Colette de Jouvenel later stated that her mother did not want a child and left her in the care of an English nanny, only rarely visiting her.

In 1914, during [[World War I]], Colette was approached to write a ballet for the [[Paris Opera]], which she outlined under the title "Divertissements pour ma fille". After Colette herself chose [[Maurice Ravel]] to write the music, he reimagined the work as an opera, to which Colette agreed. Ravel received the libretto to ''[[L'enfant et les sortilèges]]'' in 1918, and it was first performed on 21 March 1925.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laphil.org/resources/piece_detail.cfm?id=93 |title=LA Phil Presents &#124; Piece Detail - Maurice Ravel: L'enfant et les sortilèges |publisher=Laphil.org |date=21 March 1925 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref> 

During the war, she converted her husband's [[Saint-Malo]] estate into a hospital for the wounded, and was made a [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honour]] (1920). She divorced Henri de Jouvenel in 1924 after a much talked-about affair with her stepson, [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]].

==Third marriage==
[[Image:Jacques Humbert - Colette.jpg|thumb|left|Colette, painted ca. 1896 by [[Jacques Humbert]]]]
In 1935, Colette married [[Maurice Goudeket]], an uncle of Juliet Goudeket alias [[Jetta Goudal]].<ref>Slide, Anthony. ''Silent Players:A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses''. University Press of Kentucky, 2002. ISBN 0-8131-2249-X. page 148.</ref> After 1935, her legal name was simply Sidonie Goudeket. Maurice Goudeket published a book about his wife, ''Close to Colette: An Intimate Portrait of a Woman of Genius''. An English translation was published in 1957 by Farrar, Straus & Cudahy, New York.

==Continued writings==
Post-war, her writing career bloomed following the publication of ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'' (1920). Chéri tells a story of the end of a six-year affair between an aging retired [[courtesan]], Léa, and a pampered young man, Chéri. Turning stereotypes upside-down, it is Chéri who wears silk pajamas and Léa's pearls, and who is the object of gaze.{{clarify|date=March 2012}} In the end, Léa demonstrates all the survival skills which Colette associates with femininity. (The story continued in ''[[La Fin de Chéri]]'' (1926), which contrasts Léa's strength and Chéri's fragility and decline.) Considered nowadays to be Colette's masterpiece, ''Chéri'' was originally met with controversy because of its choice of setting - the [[demimonde]] of the Parisian courtesans - and also because of its portrayal of the hedonistic Chéri. 

After ''Chéri'', Colette entered the world of modern poetry and painting revolving around [[Jean Cocteau]], who was later her neighbor in [[Palais Royal|Jardins du Palais-Royal]]. Their relationship and life is vividly depicted in their books. By 1927, she was frequently acclaimed as France's greatest woman writer. "It ... has no plot, and yet tells of three lives all that should be known", wrote [[Janet Flanner]] of ''Sido'' on its publication in 1930. "Once again, and at greater length than usual, she has been hailed for her genius, humanities and perfect prose by those literary journals which years ago ... lifted nothing at all in her direction except the finger of scorn."

She spent her final years in a wheelchair, being cared for by Goudeket, whom she called "a saint".  In 1951 she attended the premiere of a documentary about her life, and at the end she was heard saying to Goudeket, ''"What a beautiful life I've had"''.

Upon her death in Paris in 1954, Colette left 50 published novels in total, many with autobiographical elements. Her themes can be roughly divided into idyllic natural tales or dark struggles in relationships and love. All her novels were marked by clever observation and dialogue with an intimate, explicit style. 

Her popular novella ''[[Gigi]]'' was made into a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play and a highly successful [[Hollywood]] [[Gigi (1958 film)|motion picture of the same name]], starring [[Leslie Caron]], [[Louis Jourdan]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]]. Colette is directly credited with the discovery of a young, unknown [[Audrey Hepburn]], whom the elder chose on sight to play the eponymous Broadway lead in ''[[Gigi]]''. According to Hepburn herself, she was garrisoned with the 1952 film production company of [[Monte Carlo Baby]] at a hotel in the south of France for brief location shooting, the relatively unglamorous assignment part of a standard contract. Hepburn at the time commanded barely more stature than many unknowns after the Armistice in a European film industry decimated by World War II. Colette chanced to see the young Hepburn walking across the lobby of the hotel and immediately said to her companion of the moment, "There is my Gigi!" In 2009, an adaptation by [[Christopher Hampton]] of both ''Chéri'' and ''La Fin de Chéri'' was made into a [[Chéri (film)|film]] starring [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Rupert Friend]] and [[Kathy Bates]] and directed by [[Stephen Frears]].

==Legacy==
A controversial figure throughout her life, Colette flaunted her [[lesbian]] affairs. 

She was a member of the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Belgian Royal Academy]] (1935), president of the [[Edmond Louis Antoine Huot de Goncourt|Académie Goncourt]] (1949) (and the first woman to be admitted into it, in 1945), and a Chevalier (1920) and a Grand Officier (1953) of the [[Légion d'honneur]]. 

During the [[German occupation of France during World War II]], she aided her Jewish friends, including hiding her husband in her attic all through the war. When she died in Paris on 3 August 1954, she was the first woman given a state funeral in France, although she was refused [[Roman Catholic]] rites because of her divorces.  Colette is interred in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

Singer-songwriter [[Rosanne Cash]] paid tribute to the writer in the song, "The Summer I Read Colette", on her 1996 album ''[[10 Song Demo]]''.

Truman Capote wrote a short story about her (1970) called "The White Rose".
