The '''Australian Labor Party''' (also '''ALP''' and '''Labor''', was '''Labour''' before 1912) is an Australian political party. It is currently in opposition at federal level with [[Bill Shorten]] as the party's federal parliamentary leader. In the [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state and territory parliaments]], Labor governs in South Australia, [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The party competes against the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] for political office at the [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state]] (and sometimes [[Local government in Australia|local]]) level.

Labor's constitution states: "The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} This "socialist objective" was introduced in 1921, but has always been heavily qualified by wording which makes it clear that Labor supports private property.<ref>[http://socialistobjective.wordpress.com/] {{Verify credibility|date=July 2013}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2013}} It has been a dead letter since the 1940s, when the Chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks. Today Labor defines itself as "a coalition that includes reformers, radicals, progressives and social democrats united by a critique of the inequalities in society, a commitment to a more just and equal society, and the achieving of this aim by democratic means.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The ALP was founded as a [[Federalism in Australia|federal party]] prior to the first sitting of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] in 1901, but is descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging [[Australian labour movement|labour movement in Australia]], formally beginning in 1892. Labor is thus the country's oldest political party. Colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891, and federal seats following the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 federal election]]. Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian Parliament, at the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 federal election]]. The ALP pre-dates both the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in party formation, government, and policy implementation.

<!-- do not add a second image of a current Labor prime minister here, this is for previous Labor prime ministers -->
The present Australian Labor Party has its origins in the Labour parties founded in the 1890s in the Australian colonies prior to federation. Labor tradition ascribes the founding of Queensland Labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree (the "[[Tree of Knowledge (Australia)|Tree of Knowledge]]") in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in 1891. The [[Balmain, New South Wales]] branch of the party claims to be the oldest in Australia. Labour as a parliamentary party dates from 1891 in New South Wales, [[South Australian state election, 1893|1893 in South Australia]] and Queensland, and later in the other colonies.

The first election contested by Labour candidates was the 1891 New South Wales election, when Labour candidates (then called the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales) won 35 of 141 seats. The major parties were the [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] and [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]] parties and Labour held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. It offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions.<ref>''So Monstrous a Travesty'', Ross McMullen. Scribe Publications 2004. p.4.</ref> Also in 1891, 3 United Labor Party candidates were elected to Legislative Council of South Australia.<ref name=PHA>[http://www.sahistorians.org.au/175/chronology/may/9-may-1891-united-labor-party-elected-to-legislati.shtml Professional Historians Association (South Australia)]</ref> At the [[South Australian state election, 1893|1893 South Australian elections]] the United Labor Party won 10 of the 54 seats in the House of Assembly, and went into coalition with the Liberal Party. By 1905 [[Thomas Price]] became the first Labor [[Premier of South Australia]].<ref name=PHA /> In 1899, [[Anderson Dawson]] formed a minority Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> government in [[Queensland]], the first in the world, which lasted one week while the [[Conservatism|conservatives]] regrouped after a split.

The colonial Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the [[Federation of Australia]]. Some Labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming the Senate as proposed was too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist colonial upper houses and the [[House of Lords|British House of Lords]]. They feared federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The first Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> leader and Prime Minister, [[Chris Watson]], however, was a supporter of federation.

===Early decades at federal level===
The first election to the [[Australian federal election, 1901|federal Parliament in 1901]] was contested by the each state Labour party. In total, they won 14 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Labour members now met as the federal parliamentary Labour<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> Party (informally known as the [[caucus]]) on 8 May 1901 at [[Parliament House, Melbourne]], the meeting place of the first federal Parliament.<ref>Faulkner; Macintyre (2001) p. 3</ref> The caucus decided to support the Protectionist government against the opposition Free Trade Party. It was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level. Labour <!-- do not change spelling, is correct in historical context -->under [[Chris Watson]] more than doubled its vote to 23 at the [[Australian federal election, 1903|1903 federal election]] and continued to hold the balance of power. In April 1904, however, Watson and Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the [[Conciliation]] and [[Arbitration]] Bill to cover state public servants, the fallout causing Deakin to resign. Free Trade leader [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] declined to take office, which saw Watson become the first Labour<!-- do not change spelling, is correct in historical context --> [[Prime Minister of Australia]], and the world's first Labour head of government at a national level ([[Anderson Dawson]] had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899), though his was a [[minority government]] that lasted only four months. He was aged only 37, and is still the youngest Prime Minister in Australia's history.<ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last= Nairn |first= Bede |year= 1990 |id= A120450b |title= Watson, John Christian (1867–1941)  | accessdate =9 February 2010 }}</ref>

[[Andrew Fisher]] then formed another minority government 1908–09. At the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 election]], Fisher led Labor to victory. The Fisher government was Australia's first federal [[majority government]], held Australia's first [[Australian Senate|Senate]] majority, and was the world's first labour party majority government. This was the first time a labour party had controlled any house of a legislature, and the first time it controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature.<ref name=adb>{{cite web

The state branches formed their first majority governments in [[New South Wales]] and South Australia in 1910, in Western Australia in 1911, in [[Queensland]] in 1915 and in [[Tasmania]] in 1925. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.

Analysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals "a band of unhappy amateurs", made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, a doctor, and even a mine owner, indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies&nbsp;– in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders.

In the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], support for socialism grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for "the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange." As a result, Labor's Federal Conference in 1922 adopted a similarly worded "socialist objective," which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the "[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment," which said that "socialisation" was desirable only when was necessary to "eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features."<ref>McKinlay (1981) p. 53</ref> In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia|Commonwealth Bank]].

The Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php|title= National Constitution of the ALP|year= 2009|work= Official Website of the Australian Labor Party|publisher= Australian Labor Party|accessdate=26 December 2009|quote= The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia Policy]], a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.<ref>McKinlay (1981) p. 19</ref> Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], White Australia and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism.

Historically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the [[White Australia Policy]] which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about "racial purity" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.

The ALP adopted the formal name "Australian Labour Party"<!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --> in 1908, but changed the spelling to "Labor" in 1912. While it is standard practice in [[Australian English]] both today and at the time to spell the word labour with a "u", the party was influenced by the [[Labor history of the United States|United States labour movement]] and a prominent figure in the early history of the party, the American–born [[King O'Malley]], was successful in having the spelling "modernised".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=History of the Australian Labor Party}}</ref> The change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the [[labour movement]] in general.<ref>Clarke, FG, ''Australia: A Concise Political and Social History'' (Sydney: Harcourt Brace & Company 1996), p 205</ref> Furthermore, the spelling "labor" had been acceptable in both British and Australian English in earlier periods. (See also: [[Australian spelling|Spelling in Australian English]])

===World War II and beyond===

The [[Curtin Government|Curtin]] and [[Chifley Government|Chifley]] governments governed Australia through the latter half of [[World War II]] and initial stages of transition to peace. Labor leader [[John Curtin]] became prime minister in October 1941 when two independents crossed the floor of Parliament. Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]]. In December 1941, Curtin announced that "Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom", thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government]]). Remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 election]], Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by [[Ben Chifley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/ |title=John Curtin – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Chifley Labor won the [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946 election]] and oversaw Australia's initial transition to a peacetime economy. Labor was defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 election]]. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifley sought to define the labour movement as having:

{{quotation|[A] great objective&nbsp;– the light on the hill&nbsp;– which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind... [Labor would] bring something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happiness to the mass of the people.|Ben Chifley|source=<ref>{{cite web |url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/in-office.aspx |title=In office&nbsp;– Ben Chifley&nbsp;– Australia's PMs&nbsp;– Australia's Prime Ministers |accessdate=13 July 2011 |date=24 February 2009 |publisher=National Archives of Australia | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110613100927/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/in-office.aspx| archivedate= 13 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>}}

To a large extent, Chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions. With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office at in 1949 to [[Robert Menzies]]' Liberal-National Coalition. Labor commenced what would be a 23-year period in opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/ |title=Ben Chifley – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date=13 June 1951 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/elections.aspx |title=Elections – Robert Menzies – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref>

Various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under [[Gough Whitlam]], resulting in what is now known as the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more [[social progressivism|socially progressive]] ideals, and [[Labor Right]], the now dominant faction that tends to be more [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and focus to a lesser extent on social issues. The Whitlam Labor government, marking a break with Labor's socialist tradition, pursued [[social democracy|social-democratic]] policies rather than [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] policies. Whitlam, in contrast to earlier Labor leaders, also cut [[tariff]]s by 25 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/ |title=Tariff Reduction |publisher=The Whitlam Institute |work=The Whitlam Collection}}</ref> Whitlam led the Federal Labor Party back to office at the [[Australian federal election, 1972|1972]] and [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 elections]], and passed a large amount of legislation. The [[Whitlam Government]] lost office following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] and dismissal by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]] after the Coalition blocked [[Loss of supply|supply]] in the Senate after a series of political scandals, and was defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 election]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/general/the-dismissal-a-brief-history/2005/11/10/1131578175136.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=The dismissal: a brief history | date=11 November 2005}}</ref> Whitlam remains the only Prime Minister to have his commission terminated in that manner.

[[Bob Hawke]] led Labor back to office at the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]] and the [[Hawke-Keating Government]] remained in power until defeated by [[John Howard]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]].

[[Kim Beazley]] led the party to the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 election]], winning 51 percent of the [[two-party preferred vote]] but falling short on seats, and lost ground at the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]]. [[Mark Latham]] led Labor to the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] but lost further ground. Beazley replaced Latham in 2005. Beazley in turn was challenged by [[Kevin Rudd]] who went on to defeat John Howard at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]] with 52.7 percent of the two-party vote. The [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] ended prior to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]] with the replacement of Rudd as leader of the Party by deputy leader [[Julia Gillard]]. The [[Gillard Government]] was commissioned to govern in a [[hung parliament]] following the 2010 election with a one-seat parliamentary majority and 50.12 percent of the two-party vote.

Between the 2007 federal election and the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|2008 Western Australian state election]], Labor was in government nationally, as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures. This was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the ACT and the NT gained self-government.<ref>In 1969–1970, before the ACT and NT achieved self-government, the Liberal and National Coalition was in power federally and in all six states.

===Labor Acts in government===

====Watson and Fisher====
Existing for over a century, the Australian Labor Party has been responsible for the carriage of many [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] in the [[Parliament of Australia]]. Passing 113 Acts, the 1910–13 Labor government was a period unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s. The first federal Labor Party led by [[Chris Watson]], holding the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] (Watson being [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] for four months in 1904), was very influential in [[Edmund Barton]] and [[Alfred Deakin]] [[Protectionist Party]] government policy since the beginning of the [[Parliament of Australia]] in 1901. With a change of Labor leader in 1907, [[Andrew Fisher]] was a Labor prime minister three times between 1908 and 1915, collectively four years and ten months, second only to [[Bob Hawke]]'s eight years. Fisher's [[Andrew Fisher#Second government 1910–13|second government]] resulting from the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 federal election]] represented a number of firsts: it was the first time a party had been elected to [[majority government]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], it was also the first time a party received a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] majority, and it was the world's first [[List of Labour Parties|Labour Party]] majority government at a national level. The ALP vote rose rapidly, going from 15 percent against two larger and more established parties in [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901]], to 50 percent in [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910]], after a majority of the Protectionist Party merged with the [[Anti-Socialist Party]] (formerly [[Free Trade Party]]), creating the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] led by Deakin which received 45 percent. At the time, it represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, with success that eluded [[List of Labour Parties|Labour Parties]] in other countries for decades. Labour implemented many Acts in defence, constitutional matters, finance, transport and communications, and social security, achieving the vast majority of his aims in his first government, such as establishing old-age and disability pensions, improved working conditions including a [[maternity]] allowance and [[Workers' compensation|workers compensation]], issuing Australia's first [[paper currency]], forming the [[Royal Australian Navy]], the commencement of construction for the [[Trans-Australian Railway]], expanding the bench of the [[High Court of Australia]], founding [[Canberra]] and establishing the government-owned [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]]. Fisher carried out measures to break up land monopolies, put forward proposals for more regulation of working hours, wages and employment conditions, and amended the 1904 Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide greater authority for the court president and to allow for Commonwealth employees' industrial unions, registered with the Arbitration Court. A land tax, aimed at breaking up big estates and to provide a wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while coverage of the Arbitration system extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, the age at which women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from 65 to 60. The introduction of the [[maternity]] allowance enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality. Labour was renamed Labor in 1912. Labor lost the [[Australian federal election, 1913|1913 election]] by one seat, but retained a Senate majority, and returned to government at the [[Australian federal election, 1914|1914 election]]. Fisher resigned as prime minister and left Parliament in 1915, [[Australian Labor Party#Party splits|Labor had split]] following Labor leader and Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] being expelled over his support for [[Conscription in Australia]] as a result of [[World War I conscription in Australia|World War I]]. Hughes and his supporters eventually led the Commonwealth Liberal Party replacement, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]]. The [[Australian plebiscite, 1916|1916]] and [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|1917 referendums]] for conscription failed. The [[National Party of Australia]] (then Country Party) started contesting elections from the [[Swan by-election, 1918|1918 Swan by-election]], after which full-preference [[instant-runoff voting]] was introduced by the Nationalist Party government. Days before the global [[Great Depression]] struck, the one-term [[James Scullin]] government was elected at the [[Australian federal election, 1929|1929 election]] but with a minority in the Senate. As such, Labor would remain without workable lower/upper house majorities on the floor until the 1940s.<ref>References at [[Chris Watson]], [[Andrew Fisher]], and their government and election articles, and [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Browse/ByYearNumber/Acts/Historical/0/0/ Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia] at ComLaw.gov.au</ref>

====Curtin and Chifley====
Labor under [[John Curtin]] formed a [[minority government]] in 1941 after the [[crossbench]] consisting of two independent MPs [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], bringing down the [[United Australia Party]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] minority government of [[Robert Menzies]] which resulted from the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 election]]&nbsp;– aside from the formulative early parliaments, the only other [[hung parliament]] has resulted from the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]]. Curtin led federal Labor to the greatest win of an Australian federal political party with two-thirds of seats in the lower house and 58.2 percent of the [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party preferred]] vote at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 election]], and a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] majority. Child endowment payments were introduced in 1941, widow's pensions in 1942, and Commonwealth unemployment benefits in 1945. Curtin led Australia when the [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|Australian mainland came under direct military threat during the Japanese advance in 1942]] during [[World War II]]. He is widely regarded as one of the country's greatest Prime Ministers; General [[Douglas MacArthur]] said that Curtin was "one of the greatest of the wartime statesmen", while Curtin's Prime Ministerial predecessor and 1943 election Coalition leader, [[Arthur Fadden]] of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] wrote: "I do not care who knows it but in my opinion there was no greater figure in Australian public life in my lifetime than Curtin." [[Ben Chifley]] became Labor leader and Prime Minister when Curtin died in 1945. Chifley Labor went on to retain a majority in both houses of [[Australian Parliament]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946 election]] with 54.1 percent of the two-party preferred vote against the newly formed [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in their Coalition with the Country Party. Amongst Chifley's [[Act of Parliament|Acts]], he expanded [[health care in Australia]] with a [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (PBS) and free [[List of hospitals in Australia|hospital]] ward treatment, introduced the [[Australian citizenship]], a post-war immigration scheme, the founding of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), the reorganisation and enlargement of the Australian scientific organisation CSIR to the [[CSIRO]], the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]], improvements in social services, the establishment of a Universities Commission for the expansion of university education, the creation of the [[Commonwealth Employment Service]] (CES), the introduction of federal funds to the States for public housing construction, the creation of a civilian rehabilitation service, over-viewing the foundation of airlines [[Qantas]] and [[TAA]], and the creation of the [[Australian National University]]. One of the few successful [[referendums in Australia|referendums]] to modify the [[Australian Constitution]], the [[Australian referendum, 1946 (Social Services)|1946 Social Services referendum]], took place during Chifley's term. It was a period not matched until the 1970s, the number of Chifley government Acts was such that between 1946 and 1949, the Australian Parliament passed 299 Acts, a new record up until Whitlam, and well beyond Fisher. The Senate was changed to [[proportional voting]] prior to Labor's defeat at the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 election]], Labor has not held a majority in both houses since. [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|Labor had split in 1955]], key people in the split were Labor leader [[H. V. Evatt|H. V. "Doc" Evatt]], and the ruling mind behind the "Catholic Social Studies Movement" or "the Movement" and the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]], [[B. A. Santamaria]].<ref>References at [[John Curtin]], [[Ben Chifley]], and their government and election articles, and [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Browse/ByYearNumber/Acts/Historical/0/0/ Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia: ComLaw.gov.au]</ref>

====Whitlam====
[[Gough Whitlam]] led Labor to power at the [[Australian federal election, 1972|1972 election]] and retained government at the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 election]], before his dismissal during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]]. Whitlam and his government massively expanded the federal budget to implement an extensive number of new programs and policy changes, such as [[Free education|fee-free tertiary education]], the formal removal of the [[White Australia Policy]], the implementation of [[legal aid]] programs, the elimination of [[Conscription in Australia|military conscription]] and [[Capital punishment|criminal execution]], [[health care in Australia]] became [[universal health care|universal]] with the creation of [[Medicare (Australia)#Medibank|Medibank]], and [[tariff]]s were cut across the board by 25 percent. His government passed around one-thousand [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] in total. The Whitlam government passed more Acts in one term of parliament than any other previous government, and remains the only government in history to hold a [[Joint meetings of the Australian Parliament|joint sitting of federal Parliament]], the [[Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament of 1974|1974 joint sitting]], for the purposes of passing twice-rejected legislation. The [[Australian Senate|Senate]] had a shared [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] which drifted between the [[Democratic Labor Party|DLP]], the [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], and independents or any from the Coalition who [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]].<ref>References at [[Gough Whitlam]], and his government and election articles, and [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Browse/ByYearNumber/Acts/Historical/0/0/ Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia: ComLaw.gov.au]</ref>

====Hawke and Keating====
[[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] led Labor to victory at five consecutive federal elections: [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983]], [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984]], [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987]], [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990]] and [[Australian federal election, 1993|1993]], before being defeated in [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996]]. Hawke was defeated as Labor leader in a [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, December 1991|1991 spill]] against Keating who had been [[Treasurer of Australia]] since 1983. Hawke is Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister and Australia's [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by time in office|third-longest-serving Prime Minister]]. The Hawke and Keating Labor governments radically transformed the Australian economy, departing from a historical bipartisan [[Keynesian]] approach to the Australian economy, with the change of the Australian dollar from a government-fixed exchange rate to a [[floating exchange rate]]. Extensive deregulation of financial and banking systems occurred, both of which made Australia significantly more integrated with the global economy. Privatisation of state sector industries occurred, including [[Qantas]] and [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia|Commonwealth Bank]]. The [[tariff]] system was dismantled, and the subsidisation of some loss-making industries ended. Low-income centralised wage fixing was introduced through the [[Prices and Incomes Accord]], and [[enterprise bargaining]] was introduced. The tax system was changed, including the introduction of fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax. [[Superannuation in Australia]] was implemented with a nine percent employer contribution. [[Tertiary education fees in Australia]] saw a HECS payment system introduced as a replacement for fee-free tertiary education which had been removed after Whitlam. [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] was introduced as a replacement for [[Medicare (Australia)#Medibank|Medibank]] which had also been removed after Whitlam. [[Dental insurance]] through the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was introduced, but was removed after Labor lost government. Funding for schools was considerably increased, financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer, [[native title in Australia]] was recognised, and progress was made in directing assistance to the most disadvantaged recipients over a whole range of welfare benefits. The Parliament of Australia itself was reformed in several ways. The duration of the 13-year Labor government saw thousands of [[Act of Parliament|Acts]] passed by the Australian Parliament. The [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] was held by the [[Australian Democrats|Democrats]], but with Labor nine seats short of an upper-house majority from the 1993 election, it was shared between seven Democrats, two [[Greens Western Australia|WA Greens]] and independent [[Brian Harradine]].<ref>References at [[Bob Hawke]], [[Paul Keating]], and their government and election articles, and [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Browse/ByYearNumber/Acts/Historical/0/0/ Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia: ComLaw.gov.au]</ref>

====Rudd and Gillard====
Labor led by [[Kevin Rudd]] won the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]] with a 23-seat, 5.5 percent [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-party-preferred]] swing, but in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]], Labor was seven seats short of a majority, with a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] shared between five [[Australian Greens|Greens]], [[Family First Party|Family First]]'s [[Steve Fielding]] and [[Independent (politics)|independent]] [[Nick Xenophon]]. The [[First Rudd Government|Rudd government]] signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and delivered an apology to [[Indigenous Australian]]s for the [[Stolen Generations]]. The previous Coalition government's [[WorkChoices]] [[industrial relations]] system was largely dismantled and [[Fair Work Australia]] was created. [[National Broadband Network]] (NBN) discussions and the final agreement with [[Telstra]] occurred and construction and rollout commenced, remaining [[Iraq War]] combat personnel were withdrawn, and the "[[Australia 2020 Summit]]" was held. Labor reduced income tax rates in 2008, 2009 and 2010, and pensions were increased, as well as additional funding for health and education. A new Teen Dental Plan was launched,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/2011-2012/DentalSchemes |title=Dental reform: an overview of universal dental schemes – Parliament of Australia |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> while around 100 laws relating to [[recognition of same-sex relationships in Australia|same-sex relationships]] in the [[LGBT rights in Australia|LGBT]] community were changed after a [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission|HREOC]] enquiry found them to be discriminatory. In response to the [[Global Financial Crisis]], the government provided [[National fiscal policy response to the late 2000s recession#Australia|economic stimulus packages]], and Australia was one of the few [[Western World|western countries]] to avoid the [[late-2000s recession]]. [[Julia Gillard]] replaced Rudd as Labor leader and Prime Minister in a [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, 2010|2010 spill]]. At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]], the first [[hung parliament]] occurred since the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 election]], the incumbent [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor government]] formed a [[minority government]] in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with four [[crossbencher]]s&nbsp;– three [[Independent (politics)|independents]] and one Green, a one-seat parliamentary majority. (However, on 19 February 2013, the Greens announced that Labor had ended the alliance between the two parties.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/milne-blasts-labor-on-miners-environment-20130219-2eopq.html | title=Milne blasts Labor on miners, environment | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=19 February 2013 | agency=AAP | accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>) Later changes in speaker and government support increased the parliamentary majority to three seats, then two seats. In the Senate, the Greens with nine seats went from a shared balance of power position to a sole balance of power position. The Gillard Labor government introduced the [[Clean Energy Bill 2011|Clean Energy Bill]] as a replacement for the [[Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme]] (CPRS) in conjunction with compensation including further income tax cuts and an increase in the tax-free threshold, a [[Minerals Resource Rent Tax]] (MRRT) was introduced as a replacement for the [[Resource Super Profits Tax]] (RSPT), Gillard reached a health care agreement with state and territory leaders, introduced [[Paid time off|paid]] [[parental leave]], [[plain cigarette packaging]] laws, the biggest cuts on consumer prices of medicines in Australian history under the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] (PBS), and allocated funding for children and concession holders to receive [[dental insurance]] through [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]. The 2011 Labor conference saw an agreement to a [[conscience vote]] for [[same-sex marriage in Australia]] through a [[private members bill]]. Under Rudd and Gillard, around 500 Acts have been passed by the Australian Parliament, including many in the former hung parliament.<ref>References at [[Kevin Rudd]], [[Julia Gillard]], their government and election articles, and [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Browse/ByYearNumber/Acts/Historical/0/0/ Acts of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia] at ComLaw.gov.au</ref>

===Historic ALP splits===
The Labor Party has split three times:

* In 1916 over the issue of [[conscription]] during the [[First World War]].<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090395b.htm Hughes, William Morris (Billy) (1862–1952)], [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], [[Australian National University|ANU]] web site</ref> Labor Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] supported the introduction of [[conscription]], while the majority of his colleagues in the ALP and trade union movement opposed it. After failing to gain majority support for conscription in two national [[plebiscite]]s which bitterly divided the country in the process, Hughes and his followers were expelled from the Labor Party. He first formed the [[National Labor Party]] before merging with the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] which formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]], and remained Prime Minister until 1923. At the state level [[William Holman]], also a supporter of conscription, quit the party at the same time and became Nationalist Party [[Premier of New South Wales]].
* In 1931 over economic issues revolving around how best to handle the [[Great Depression in Australia]]. At the House-only [[Australian federal election, 1929|1929 election]], the one-term Labor government led by [[James Scullin]] won a lower house majority but remained in minority in the upper house. The ALP was essentially split three ways, between those who believed in radical policies such as NSW Premier [[Jack Lang (Australia)|Jack Lang]], who wanted to repudiate Australia's debt to British bondholders; proto-[[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] such as federal Treasurer [[Ted Theodore]]; and believers in orthodox finance such as Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] and a senior minister in his government, [[Joseph Lyons]]. In 1931 Lyons and his supporters left the party and joined the Nationalist Party of Australia to form the [[United Australia Party]], and became Prime Minister in 1932.
* The [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|1955 split]] on communism occurred during a period of the 1950s when the issue of communism and support for communist causes or governments caused great internal conflict in the Labor party and the trade union movement in general. From 1945 onward, staunchly [[anti-Communist]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] members (Catholics being an important traditional support base) in opposition to communist infiltration of unions, formed [[Industrial Groups]] to gain control of them, fostering intense internal conflict. After Labor's loss of the 1954 election, federal leader [[H.V. Evatt|Dr H.V. Evatt]] "issued a statement attacking the Victorian ALP state executive".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au:80/news/Gerard-Henderson/Paranoia-split-Labor-for-25-years/2005/04/11/1113071910309.html |title=Paranoia split Labor for 25 years&nbsp;– Gerard Henderson&nbsp;– www.smh.com.au |publisher=Smh.com.au:80 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> He blamed subversive activities of the "Groupers" for the defeat. After bitter public dispute many Groupers were expelled from the ALP and formed the [[Democratic Labor Party|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP) whose intellectual leader was [[B.A. Santamaria]]. The DLP was heavily influenced by [[Catholic social teaching]] and had the support of the Catholic Archbishop of [[Melbourne]], [[Daniel Mannix]]. Because of its "veto with a view to reunification" strategy, the DLP's preferences (see [[Australian electoral system]]) helped the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] remain in power for over two decades, but it was successfully undermined by the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor Government during the 1970s, so that after 1978 the DLP was reduced to a small "rump" based in Victoria, which nevertheless continued to contest federal elections as the DLP (according to the parliamentary library election results for 1980 and onward),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/RB/2004-05/05rb11.pdf |title=IRS Research Brief Dec04 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> although it failed to win a federal seat until the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] when [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] was elected as the final [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], despite having received only 2.34% of the popular vote.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/svic-results.htm</ref>

In addition, founding member [[Joseph Cook]] left the party in 1894, and went on to be [[Prime Minister of Australia]] with the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] in 1913–14.

==National platform==
The policy of the Australian Labor Party is contained in its National Platform, which is approved by delegates to Labor's National Conference, held every three years. According to the Labor Party's website, "The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007}}</ref>

The platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that "Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely." While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: "Labor believes in a strong role for national government&nbsp;– the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote." Labor "will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions." The Platform and Labor "believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential." For Labor, "government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status." Further sections of the Platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.

In practice, the Platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the Platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the Platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the Platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the Platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the Platform, Labor governments have sought to change the Platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the Platform.

==ALP structure==
The Australian Labor Party is a democratic and federal party, which consists of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office. The majority of trade unions in Australia are affiliated to the party, and their affiliation fees, based on the size of their memberships, makes up a large part of the party's income. The party consists of six state and two territory branches, each of which consists of local branches which any Australian resident can join, plus affiliated trade unions. Individual members pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income. Members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members only become active during election campaigns. The party has about 35,000 individual members,<ref name="review">[http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/review2010/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> although this figure tends to fluctuate along with the party's electoral fortunes.

The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.

The party holds a national conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference). The national conference approves the party's platform and policies, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|national executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the national secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is George Wright. The most recent National Conference was held from 2 to 4 December 2011.

The federal parliamentary leader of the Labor Party is elected by the Labor members of the national Parliament (the [[Caucus]]), not by the conference. Until recently the national conference elected the party's national president, but since 2003 the position has rotated amongst a presidential team of three, directly elected by the party's individual members. Each member of the team serves a one-year term as national president, with the other members serving as vice-presidents.<ref>[http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/bligh-joins-alp-national-president-team-20090330-9gcd.html Bligh joins ALP national president team], ''The Age'', 30 March 2009.</ref> The current national president is [[Jenny McAllister]],<ref>[http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/member-news/welcome-to-new-alp-national-president/ Welcome to New ALP National President], Australian Labor Party, 6 July 2011.</ref> the national vice-presidents are [[Tony Sheldon (trade unionist)|Tony Sheldon]] and [[Jane Garrett]].

The Labor Party contests national, state and territory elections. In some states it also contests local government elections: in others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two. Labor candidates are required to sign a pledge that if elected they will always vote in Parliament in accordance with the platform and decisions made by a vote of the Caucus. They are also sometimes required to donate a portion of their salary to the party, although this practice has declined with the introduction of public funding for political parties.

===Factions===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
The Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which some party members belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (on the right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]]. Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The national Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more progressive on social issues. The factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based.

Labor-affiliated trade unions are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA), and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU). Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Voice]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMEU), the [[Australian Services Union]] (ASU) and the [[Maritime Union of Australia]] (MUA). These affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. The AWU and the NUW, for example, are bitter rivals and the NUW sometimes aligns itself with the left. Moreover, in some cases different union branches may have different factional alignments. On some issues, such as opposition to the [[Howard Government]]'s industrial relations policy, all the unions were in agreement and worked as a bloc within the party.

[[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.

===Labor Networks===
The Australian Labor Party, is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party. Examples of such groups include the [[Labor Environment Action Network]],<ref>http://www.lean.net.au/</ref> Rainbow Labor,<ref>http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/</ref> Labor for Refugees<ref>https://www.facebook.com/labor4refugees</ref> and Labor Renewal.<ref>http://laborrenewal.org/</ref> The Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party recently gave these groups, known as Policy Action Caucuses, voting and speaking rights at their state conference.
