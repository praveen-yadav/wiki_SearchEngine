'''Alphonsus a Sancta Maria''', or '''Alphonso de Cartagena''' (1396 &ndash; July 12, 1456), [[Spain|Spanish]] historian, was born at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], and succeeded his father, Paulus, as bishop of [[Burgos]]. In 1431 he was deputed by [[John II of Castile|John II, king of Castile]], to attend the council of [[Basel]], in which he made himself conspicuous by his learning.  He was the author of several works, the principal of which is entitled ''Rerum Hispanorum Romanorum imperatorum, summorum pontificum, nec non regum Francorum anacephaleosis''. This is a history of [[Spain]] from the earliest times down to 1456, and was printed at [[Granada]] in 1545, and also in the ''Rerum Hispanicarum Scriptores aliquot'', by R. Bel (Frankfort, 1579).
