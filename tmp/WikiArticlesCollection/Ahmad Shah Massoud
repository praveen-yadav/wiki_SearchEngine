'''Ahmad Shah Massoud''' ({{lang|fa|احمد شاه مسعود}}; ''Aḥmad Šāh Masʻūd''; September 2, 1953{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 2001) was an Afghan political and military leader, who was a central figure in the resistance against the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet occupation]] between 1979 and 1989 and in the following years of civil war. He was assassinated on September 9, 2001.

Massoud came from an ethnic [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Sunni]] [[Muslim]] background from the [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]] valley in northern Afghanistan. He studied engineering at [[Kabul University]] in the 1970s, where he became involved with Muslim anti-communist movements around [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. After the Soviet occupation of 1979, his role as an insurgence leader earned him the nickname of "Lion of Panjshir" ({{lang|fa|شیر پنجشیر}}). In 1992, he was appointed as the minister of defense through the [[Peshawar Accord]], a peace and power-sharing agreement, in the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]]—a position he held until 2001. He fought against an alliance of militias led by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] and eventually the [[Taliban]], who started to lay siege to the capital in January 1995.

Following the rise of the Taliban in 1996, Massoud, who rejected the Taliban's fundamentalist interpretation of Islam,<ref name="Grad_310">{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = | title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310  | publisher =  Webster University Press| isbn= }}</ref> returned to the armed opposition. He served as the military and political leader of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] (also known in the West as ''Northern Alliance''). He was assassinated, probably at the instigation of [[al-Qaeda]], in a [[suicide bombing]] on September 9, 2001, just two days before the [[September 11 attacks]] in the
United States, which led to the U.S. and [[NATO]] to intervene in Afghanistan, allying with Massoud's forces.

Massoud was posthumously named "National Hero" by the order of Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]. The date of his death, September 9, is observed as a national holiday known as "Massoud Day" in Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/afghanistan/events "Afghanistan Events"], ''Lonely Planet Travel Guide.''</ref> His followers call him ''Āmir Sāhib-e Shahīd'' ("Our Beloved Martyred Commander").<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marsden, M.|year=2009|title=Talking the talk: Debating debate in northern Afghanistan|journal=Anthropology Today|volume=25|issue=2|pages=20–24|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8322.2009.00656.x|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2009.00656.x}}</ref>

==Early life==
Ahmad Shah Massoud was born in the year 1953<ref>According to his biographer Michael Barry, his exact date of birth was not recorded (M. Barry, ''Massoud: de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p.56). Some sources give his birth date as 1 September 1953 (E. Girardet, ''Killing the Cranes'', p.180).</ref> in [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]], [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], to a well-to-do family native to the Panjshir valley. His name at birth was Ahmed Shah; he took the name "Massoud" as a ''[[nom de guerre]]'' when he went into the resistance movement in 1974.<ref>Barry, Michael, ''Massoud: de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p.57.</ref> His father, Dost Mohammad Khan, was a colonel in the Royal Afghan army. From his native Panjshir, his family moved briefly to [[Herat]] and then to [[Kabul]], where Massoud spent most of his childhood.<ref>M. Barry, ''Massoud'', p. 57.</ref>

Massoud attended the renowned Franco-Afghan [[Lycée Esteqlal]].<ref name="Grad">{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = | title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |pages=310 |publisher =Webster University Press|isbn= }}{{Verify credibility|date=October 2012}}</ref> Regarded as a gifted student, he studied engineering at [[Kabul University]] after his graduation from the Lycée.<ref name=Vollmer>{{Cite book|last=Vollmer|first=Susan|title=Legends, Leaders, Legacies|year=2007|publisher=Bootheel Publishing|isbn=978-0979523311|page=|quote=}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2012}} Massoud spoke Persian, Pashto, Urdu and French and had good English reading skills.<ref name="Grad">{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = | title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |pages=310  |publisher =Webster University Press|isbn= }}</ref>

In 1973, [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] was brought to power in a [[coup d'état]] backed by the Afghan communist party, and the Republic of Afghanistan was established. These developments gave rise to the Islamist and Islamic movement opposed to the increasing communist and Soviet influence over Afghanistan.<ref name="Roy Gutman"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} During that time, while studying at Kabul University, Massoud became involved with the [[Muslim Youth|Sazman-i Jawanan-i Musulman]] ("Organization of Muslim Youth"), the student branch of the [[Jamiat-i Islami]] ("Islamic Society"), whose chairman then was the professor [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]. Kabul University was a centre for political debate and activism during that time.<ref name="Akbarzadeh & Yasmeen">{{Cite book| last =Shahram Akbarzadeh, Samina Yasmeen | authorlink = | title =Islam And the West: Reflections from Australia|edition=2005 |pages=81–82| publisher = University of New South Wales Press}}</ref>

By 1975, after a failed uprising by the Muslim Youth, a "profound and long-lasting schism" within the Islamist and Islamic movement began to emerge.<ref name="Roy Gutman"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} The "Islamic Society" split between supporters of the more moderate forces around Massoud and Rabbani, who led the Jamiat-i Islami, and more radical Islamist elements surrounding [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], who founded the [[Hezb-i Islami]].<ref name="Akbarzadeh & Yasmeen"/> The conflict reached such a point that Hekmatyar reportedly tried to kill Massoud, then 22 years old.<ref name="Grad"/><ref name="Roy Gutman"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

==The Soviet invasion and PDPA communism==

===Communist revolution in Afghanistan (1978)===
{{Main|Saur Revolution}}
The government of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] tried to scale back the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]]'s influence, dismissing PDPA members from their government posts, appointing conservatives to replace them, and finally announcing the dissolution of the PDPA, with the arrests of senior party members.<ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi"/><ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi (2)">{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=39| publisher = Palgrave, New York}}</ref>

On April 27, 1978, the PDPA and military units loyal to it killed Daoud Khan, his immediate family, and bodyguards in a violent coup, and seized control of the capital Kabul.<ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi (3)">{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=41| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}</ref> The new PDPA government, led by a revolutionary council, did not enjoy the support of the masses.<ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi (4)">{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=42| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}</ref> It announced and implemented a doctrine hostile to political dissent, whether inside or outside the party.<ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi (4)"/>

The PDPA started reforms along [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and Soviet lines. The reforms and the PDPA's affinity to the Soviet Union were met with strong resistance by the population, especially as the government attempted to enforce its Marxist policies by arresting or executing those who resisted. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people were estimated to have been arrested and killed by communist troops in the countryside alone.<ref name="Oliver Roy">{{Cite book| last =Oliver Roy | authorlink = | title =Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan|edition=1990 |page=95| publisher = Cambridge University Press}}</ref> Due to the repression, large parts of the country, especially the rural areas, organized into open revolt against the PDPA government.<ref name="Oliver Roy (2)">{{Cite book| last =Oliver Roy | authorlink = | title =Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan|edition=1990 |page=| publisher = Cambridge University Press}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} By spring 1979 unrest had reached 24 out of 28 Afghan provinces, including major urban areas. Over half of the Afghan army either deserted or joined the insurrection.

Believing that an uprising against the Soviet-backed communists would be supported by the people, Massoud, on July 6, 1979, started an insurrection in the Panjshir, which initially failed. Massoud decided to avoid conventional confrontation with the larger government forces and to wage a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]].<ref>{{cite book | first = David | last = Isby | title = War in a distant country, Afghanistan: invasion and resistance | year = 1989 | publisher = Arms and Armour Press |isbn= 0 85368 769 2| page=107}}</ref> He subsequently took full control of Panjshir, pushing out Afghan communist troops. Oliver Roy writes that in the following period, Massoud's "personal prestige and the efficiency of his military organisation persuaded many local commanders to come and learn from him."<ref name="Oliver Roy (3)">{{Cite book| last =Oliver Roy | authorlink = | title =Islam and Resistance in Afghanistan|edition=1990 |page=132| publisher = Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

===Resistance against the Soviet Union (1979–1989)===
{{Main|Soviet war in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|290px|Major resistance forces against the Soviets 1985; Army-green depicts locations of Jamiat-i Islami. [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Massoud's alliance) comprised many Jamiat positions but also those of other groups.]]

Following the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|1979 Soviet invasion]] and occupation of Afghanistan, Massoud devised a strategic plan for expelling the invaders and overthrowing the communist regime. The first task was to establish a popularly based resistance force that had the loyalty of the people. The second phase was "active defense" of the Panjshir stronghold, while carrying out [[asymmetric warfare]]. In the third phase, the "strategic offensive", Massoud's forces would gain control of large parts of Northern Afghanistan. The fourth phase was the "general application" of Massoud's principles to the whole country, and the defeat of the Afghan communist government.

From the start of the war, Massoud's [[mujahideen]] attacked the occupying Soviet forces, ambushing Soviet and Afghan communist convoys travelling through the [[Salang Pass]], and causing fuel shortages in Kabul.<ref name="Iyer">{{cite news |first2= Pico |last2= Iyer |last1 = van Voorst |first1 = Bruce | last3= Aftab | first3 = Mohammad

The Soviets mounted a [[Panjshir offensives|series of offensives]] against the Panjshir. Between 1980 and 1985, these offensives were conducted twice a year. Despite engaging more men and hardware on each occasion, the Soviets were unable to defeat Massoud's forces. In 1982, the Soviets began deploying major combat units in the Panjshir, numbering up to 30,000 men. Massoud pulled his troops back into subsidiary valleys, where they occupied fortified positions. When the Soviet columns advanced onto these positions, they fell into ambushes. When the Soviets withdrew, Afghan army garrisons took over their positions. Massoud and his mujahideen forces attacked and recaptured them one by one.<ref>Roy, p.199.</ref>

In 1983, the Soviets offered Massoud a temporary truce, which he accepted in order to rebuild his own forces and give the civilian population a break from Soviet attacks. He put the respite to good use. In this time he created the [[Shura-e Nazar]] (Supervisory Council), which subsequently united 130 commanders from 12 Afghan provinces in their fight against the Soviet army. This council existed outside the Peshawar parties, which were prone to internecine rivalry and bickering, and served to smooth out differences between resistance groups, due to political and ethnic divisions. It was the predecessor of what could have become a unified Islamic Afghan army.<ref>Barry, Michael (2002). ''Massoud, de l'islamisme à la liberté'', p. 216. Paris: Audibert. {{Language icon|fr}} ISBN 2-84749-002-7</ref>

Relations with the party headquarters in [[Peshawar]] were often strained, as Rabbani insisted on giving Massoud no more weapons and supplies than to other Jamiat commanders, even those who did little fighting. To compensate for this deficiency, Massoud relied on revenues drawn from exports of [[emerald]]s<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bowersox, Gary; Snee, Lawrence; Foord, Eugene; Seal, Robert |first=|url=http://www.gems-afghan.com/articles/page26a.jpg|title=''Emeralds of the Panjshir valley, Afghanistan'' |year=1991|publisher=  www.gems-afghan.com|accessdate=August 17, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928075908/http://www.gems-afghan.com/articles/page26a.jpg| archivedate= 28 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and [[lapis lazuli]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commission-refugies.fr/IMG/pdf/Afghanistan-les_seigneurs_de_guerre.pdf|title=''Le pouvoir des seigneurs de guerre et la situation sécuritaire en Afghanistan''| language=French|publisher=  [http://www.commission-refugies.fr/ Commission des Recours des Réfugiés]|accessdate=August 16, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928075907/http://www.commission-refugies.fr/IMG/pdf/Afghanistan-les_seigneurs_de_guerre.pdf| archivedate= 28 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> that are traditionally exploited in Northern Afghanistan.

To organize support for the mujahideen, Massoud established an administrative system that enforced law and order (''nazm'') in areas under his control. The Panjshir was divided into 22 bases (''qarargah'') governed by a military commander and a civilian administrator, and each had a judge, a prosecutor and a [[public defender]].<ref>Davies, L. Will; Shariat, Abdullah (2004). ''Fighting Masoud's War'', Melbourne: Lothian, p. 200. ISBN 0-7344-0590-1</ref> Massoud's policies were implemented by different committees: an economic committee was charged with funding the war effort. The health committee provided health services, assisted by volunteers from foreign [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as [[Aide médicale internationale]]. An education committee was charged with the training of the military and administrative [[En cadre|cadre]]. A culture committee and a judiciary committee were also created.<ref>Barry, p.194.</ref>

This expansion prompted [[Babrak Karmal]] to demand that the Red Army resume their offensives, in order to crush the Panjshir groups. However, Massoud had received warning of the attack through his intelligence agents in the government and he evacuated all 130,000 inhabitants from the valley into the Hindukush mountains, leaving the Soviet bombings to fall on empty ground and the Soviet battalions to face the mountains.<ref>Roy, p. 201.</ref>

With the defeat of the Soviet-Afghan attacks, Massoud carried out the next phase of his strategic plan, expanding the resistance movement and liberating the northern provinces of Afghanistan. In August 1986, he captured [[Farkhar]] in [[Takhar Province]]. In November 1986, his forces overran the headquarters of the government's 20th division at Nahrin in [[Baghlan Province]], scoring an important victory for the resistance.<ref>Roy, p.213.</ref> This expansion was also carried out through diplomatic means, as more mujahideen commanders were persuaded to adopt the Panjshir military system.

Despite almost constant attacks by the Red Army and the Afghan army, Massoud increased his military strength. Starting in 1980 with a force of less than 1,000 ill-equipped guerrillas, the Panjshir valley mujahideen grew to a 5,000-strong force by 1984.<ref name="Iyer" /> After expanding his influence outside the valley, Massoud increased his resistance forces to 13,000 fighters by 1989.<ref>Isby, p.98.</ref> These forces were divided into different types of units: the locals (mahalli) were tasked with static defense of villages and fortified positions. The best of the mahalli were formed into units called grup-i zarbati (shock troops), semi-mobile groups that acted as [[Military reserve|reserve]] forces for the defense of several strongholds. A different type of unit was the mobile group (grup-i-mutaharek), a lightly equipped [[commando]]-like formation numbering 33 men, whose mission was to carry out [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] attacks outside the Panjshir, sometimes as far as 100&nbsp;km from their base. These men were professional soldiers, well-paid and trained, and, from 1983 on, they provided an effective strike force against government outposts. Uniquely among the mujahideen, these groups wore uniforms, and their use of the ''[[pakul]]'' made this headwear emblematic of the Afghan resistance.

Massoud's military organization was an effective compromise between the traditional Afghan method of warfare and the modern principles of guerrilla warfare which he had learned from the works of [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Che Guevara]]. His forces were considered the most effective of all the various Afghan resistance movements.<ref>Roy, p.202.</ref>

The United States provided Massoud with close to no support. Part of the reason was that it permitted its funding and arms distribution to be administered by Pakistan, which favored the rival mujahideen leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In an interview, Massoud said, "We thought the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] knew everything. But they didn't. They supported some bad people [meaning Hekmatyar]."{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Primary advocates for supporting Massoud were the US [[State Department]]'s Edmund McWilliams and Peter Tomsen, who were on the ground in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Others included two [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analysts, [[Michael Johns (business executive)|Michael Johns]] and James A. Phillips, both of whom championed Massoud as the Afghan resistance leader most worthy of U.S. support under the [[Reagan Doctrine]].<ref>Phillips, James A. (May 18, 1992).

The Soviet army and the Afghan communist army were mainly defeated by Massoud and his mujahideen in numerous small engagements between 1984 and 1988. In 1989, after describing the Soviet Union's military engagement in Afghanistan "a bleeding wound", Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] began a withdrawal of Soviet troops from the nation. On February 15, 1989, in what was depicted as an improbable victory for the mujahideen, the last Soviet soldier left the nation.

===Fall of the Afghan communist regime (1992)===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)}}

After the [[Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|departure of Soviet troops]] in 1989, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] regime, then headed by [[Mohammad Najibullah]], held its own against the mujahideen. Backed by a massive influx of weapons from the Soviet Union, the Afghan armed forces reached a level of performance they had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. They maintained control over all of Afghanistan's major cities. By 1992, however, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the regime began to crumble. Food and fuel shortages undermined the capacities of the government's army, and a resurgence of factionalism split the regime between [[Khalq]] and [[Parcham]] supporters.<ref name="LoC">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0120) ''The Fall of Kabul, April 1992''], [[Library of Congress]] country studies. Retrieved April 2, 2007.</ref>

A few days after Najibullah had lost control of the nation, his army commanders and governors arranged to turn over authority to resistance commanders and local warlords throughout the country. Joint councils (''shuras'') were immediately established for local government, in which civil and military officials of the former government were usually included. In many cases, prior arrangements for transferring regional and local authority had been made between foes.<ref name="LoC" />

Collusions between military leaders quickly brought down the Kabul government. In mid-January 1992, within three weeks of the demise of the Soviet Union, Massoud was aware of conflict within the government's northern command. General Abdul Momim, in charge of the [[Hairatan]] border crossing at the northern end of Kabul's supply highway, and other non-[[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] generals based in [[Mazari Sharif]], feared removal by Najibullah and replacement by Pashtun officers. When the generals rebelled, [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], who held [[General Officer|general rank]] as head of the [[Jowzjan]]i militia, also based in Mazari Sharif, took over.

He and Massoud reached a political agreement, together with another major militia leader, Sayyed Mansour, of the [[Ismaili]] community based in Baghlan Province. These northern allies consolidated their position in Mazar-i-Sharif on March 21. Their coalition covered nine provinces in the north and northeast. As turmoil developed within the government in Kabul, no government force stood between the northern allies and the major [[Bagram Air Base|air force base at Bagram]], some seventy kilometers north of Kabul. By mid-April 1992, the Afghan air force command at Bagram had capitulated to Massoud.<ref name="LoC" /> On March 18, 1992, Najibullah announced he would resign. On April 17, as his government fell, he tried to escape but was stopped at [[Kabul Airport]] by Dostum's forces. He took refuge at the United Nations mission, where he remained unharmed until 1996, while Massoud controlled the area surrounding the mission.

Senior communist generals and officials of the Najibullah administration acted as a transitional authority to transfer power to Ahmad Shah Massoud's alliance.<ref name = "Library of Congress Country Studies">{{Cite web| date= | url =http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0120%29| title =The Fall of Kabul, April 1992| publisher = [[Library of Congress]]}}</ref><ref name = "Library of Congress Country Studies (2)">{{Cite web| date= | url =http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+af0121%29| title =The United Nations Plan for Political Accommodation| publisher = [[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> The Kabul interim authority invited Massoud to enter Kabul as the new Head of State, but he held back.<ref name="Roy Gutman">{{Cite book| last =Roy Gutman| authorlink = | title =How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |page=34| publisher = Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}</ref> Massoud ordered his forces, positioned to the north of Kabul, not to enter the capital until a political solution was in place.<ref name="Roy Gutman (2)">{{Cite book| last =Roy Gutman| authorlink = | title =How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|edition=1st ed., 2008 |pages=| publisher = Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC.}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2012}} He called on all the senior Afghan party leaders, many then based in exile in [[Peshawar]], to work out a political settlement acceptable to all sides and parties.<ref name="Amin Saikal">{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=214| publisher = I.B.

With United Nations support, most Afghan political parties decided to appoint a legitimate national government to succeed communist rule, through an elite settlement.<ref name="Amin Saikal"/><ref name="Peter Tomsen 2">{{Cite book| last =Peter Tomsen | authorlink = | title =The Wars of Afghanistan|edition= |pages=461ff.| publisher = }}</ref> While the external Afghan party leaders were residing in Peshawar, the military situation around Kabul involving the internal commanders was tense.

Massoud supported the Peshawar process of establishing a broad coalition government inclusive of all resistance parties, but Hekmatyar sought to become the sole ruler of Afghanistan, stating, "In our country coalition government is impossible because, this way or another, it is going to be weak and incapable of stabilizing the situation in Afghanistan."<ref name="Amin Saikal (3)">{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=215| publisher = I.B.

Massoud wrote:
<blockquote>"All the parties had participated in the war, in jihad in Afghanistan, so they had to have their share in the government, and in the formation of the government. Afghanistan is made up of different nationalities. We were worried about a national conflict between different tribes and different nationalities. In order to give everybody their own rights and also to avoid bloodshed in Kabul, we left the word to the parties so they should decide about the country as a whole.

A recorded radio communication between the two leaders showed the divide as Massoud asked Hekmatyar: "The Kabul regime is ready to surrender, so instead of the fighting we should gather. ... The leaders are meeting in Peshawar. ... The troops should not enter Kabul, they should enter later on as part of the government." Hekmatyar's response: "We will march into Kabul with our naked sword. No one can stop us. ... Why should we meet the leaders?"

On April 24, 1992, the leaders in Peshawar agreed on and signed the [[Peshawar Accord]], establishing the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]]. The creation of the Islamic State was welcomed by the General Assembly of the United Nations<ref name="Max Planck Yearbook">{{Cite book| last =| authorlink = | title =Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law|edition=2005 |page=400| publisher = }}</ref> and the Islamic State of Afghanistan was recognized as the legitimate entity representing Afghanistan until June 2002, when its successor, the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]], was established under the interim government of [[Hamid Karzai]].<ref name="Columbia World Dictionary">{{Cite book| last =Olivier Roy, Antoine Sfeir| authorlink = | title =The Columbia World Dictionary of Islamism|edition= |page=25| publisher =Columbia University Press }}</ref> Under the 1992 Peshawar Accord, the Defense Ministry was given to Massoud while the Prime Ministership was given to Hekmatyar. Hekmatyar refused to sign. With the exception of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, all of the other Peshawar resistance parties were unified under this peace and power-sharing accord in April 1992.

====War against Hekmatyar (1992–1995)====
Although repeatedly offered the position of prime minister, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar refused to recognize the peace and power-sharing agreement. His [[Hezb-e Islami]] militia initiated a massive bombardment campaign against the Islamic State and the capital city Kabul. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from neighboring [[Pakistan]].<ref name="Neamatollah Nojumi">{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}</ref><ref name="Amin Saikal"/> The Director of the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies at the [[Australian National University]], [[Amin Saikal]], writes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'' that without Pakistan's support, Hekmatyar "would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul."<ref name="Amin Saikal"/> Saikal states that Pakistan wanted to install a favorable regime under Hekmatyar in Kabul so that it could use Afghan territory for access to [[Central Asia]].<ref name="Amin Saikal"/>

Hekmatyar's rocket bombardments and the parallel escalation of violent conflict between two militias, Ittihad and Wahdat, which had entered some suburbs of Kabul, led to a breakdown in law and order. Shia [[Iran]] and Sunni Wahabbi [[Saudi Arabia]], as competitors for regional [[hegemony]], encouraged conflict between the Ittihad and Wahdat factions. On the one side was the Shia Hazara [[Hezb-i Wahdat]] of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]] and on the other side, the Sunni Pashtun [[Ittihad-i Islami]] of [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]].<ref name="Human Rights Watch (4)">{{Cite web|date= |url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref>

"The major criticism of Massoud's human rights record" is the escalation of the Afshar military operation in 1993.<ref name="Roy Gutman 2"/> A report by the Afghanistan Justice Project describes Massoud as failing to prevent atrocities carried out by his forces and those of their factional ally, Ittihad-i Islami, against civilians on taking the suburb of Afshar during a [[Afshar operation|military operation]] against an anti-state militia allied to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.

Anthony Davis, who studied and observed Massoud's forces from 1981 to 2001, reported that during the observed period, there was "no pattern of repeated killings of enemy civilians or military prisoners" by Massoud's forces.<ref name="Roy Gutman 2"/> Edward Girardet, who covered Afghanistan for over three decades, was also in Kabul during the war. He states that while Massoud was able to control most of his commanders well during the anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban resistance, he was not able to control every commander in Kabul. According to this and similar testimonies, this was due to a breakdown of law and order in Kabul and a war on multiple fronts, which they say, Massoud personally had done all in his power to prevent.<ref name="Grad"/>

Although Massoud was responsible for the financing of the foundation, he did not interfere with its cultural work. A council led the foundation and a jury, consisting of impartial university lecturers, decided on the works of artists. The Ghazali foundation enabled Afghan artists to exhibit their works at different places in Kabul, and numerous artists and authors were honoured for their works; some of them neither proponents of Massoud nor the Islamic State government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

<blockquote>"Hekmatyar had become prime minister ... But after chairing one cabinet meeting, Hekmatyar never returned to the capital, fearing, perhaps, a [[lynching]] by Kabulis infuriated over his role in destroying their city.

The second was to ensure the Rabbani government acquired no capacity to dispense patronage, and to dissuade the Kabul population from giving more than limited support to the government.

Ahmad Shah Massoud created the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban advance. The United Front included forces and leaders from different political backgrounds as well as from all ethnicities of Afghanistan. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001, the United Front controlled territory in which roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population was living, in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghōr Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

====Cross-factional negotiations====
[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|220px|Ahmad Shah Massoud (right) with Pashtun anti-Taliban leader Abdul Qadir (brother of Abdul Haq) (left) in November 2000]]

From 1999 onwards, a renewed process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks as well as several Pashtun commanders under his United Front. Besides meeting with Pashtun tribal leaders and acting as a point of reference, Abdul Haq received increasing numbers of Pashtun Taliban themselves who were secretly approaching him.<ref name=PeterTomsen>{{Cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1586487638|page=565}}</ref> Some commanders who had worked for the Taliban military apparatus agreed to the plan to topple the Taliban regime<ref name="Edwards">{{cite web |year=|url =http://lucymorganedwards.com/ |title = The Afghan Solution| publisher = Lucy Morgan Edwards|quote= The central theme of the book is Edward's investigation into a major Afghan-led plan for toppling the Taliban: a plan which existed for two years prior to 9/11, and which had buy-in from senior tribal leaders, commanders within the military axis of the Taliban, possibly the Haqqani network, Commander Massoud and senior Taliban who were willing to bring about a new order. The ex-King was to provide the 'glue' around which these different groups would coalesce.}}</ref> as the Taliban lost support even among the Pashtuns. Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert [[Peter Tomsen]] wrote that ''"[t]he ‘Lion of Kabul’ [Abdul Haq] and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ [Ahmad Shah Massoud] would make a formidable anti-Taliban team if they combined forces. Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan’s three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide."''<ref name=PeterTomsen2>{{Cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1586487638|page=566}}</ref> [[Steve Coll]] referred to this plan as a "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance".<ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars">{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| authorlink = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition=February 23, 2004 |page=558| publisher =Penguin Press HC | isbn= }}</ref> The senior Hazara and Uzbek leaders took part in the process just like later Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]]. They agreed to work under the banner of the exiled Afghan king [[Zahir Shah]] in Rome.

In November 2000, leaders from all ethnic groups were brought together in Massoud's headquarters in northern Afghanistan, travelling from other parts of Afghanistan, Europe, the United States, Pakistan and India to discuss a [[Loya Jirga]] for a settlement of Afghanistan's problems and to discuss the establishment of a post-Taliban government.<ref name="Corbis">{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/AAEC001272/council-of-afghan-opposition?popup=1 |title = Council of Afghan opposition| publisher = Corbis}}</ref><ref name="Grad_65">{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=1 March 2009 |page=65 | publisher = Webster University Press| isbn= }}</ref> In September 2001, an international official who met with representatives of the alliance remarked, ''"It's crazy that you have this today ...

In early 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud with leaders from all ethnicities of Afghanistan addressed the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]], asking the international community to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan.<ref name="EU Parliament (2)">{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}</ref> He stated that the Taliban and [[Al Qaeda]] had introduced "a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]" and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.<ref name="EU Parliament"/> On that visit to Europe, he also warned the US about Bin Laden.<ref name="nineeleven">{{Cite news|last=Boettcher|first=Mike|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-11-06/us/massoud.cable_1_bin-qaeda-sheikh-osama?_s=PM:US|title=How much did Afghan leader know?|publisher=CNN.com|date=November 6, 2003|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

====The areas of Massoud====

Life in the areas under direct control of Massoud was different from the life in the areas under Taliban or Dostum's control. In contrast to the time of chaos in which all structures had collapsed in Kabul, Massoud was able to control most of the troops under his direct command well during the period starting in late 1996.<ref name="Girardet">{{Cite book| last =Edward Girardet in | authorlink = | title =Massoud. An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=2009 1st |pages=167–187| publisher = Webster University Press | isbn= }}</ref>{{Citation broken|date=October 2012}} Massoud always controlled the [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], [[Takhar]], parts of [[Parwan]] and [[Badakhshan]] during the war. Some other provinces (notably [[Kunduz]], [[Baghlan]], [[Nuristan]] and the north of [[Kabul]]) were captured by his forces from the Taliban and lost again from time to time as the frontlines varied.

Massoud created democratic institutions which were structured into several committees: political, health, education and economic.<ref name="Grad"/> Still, many people came to him personally when they had a dispute or problem and asked him to solve their problems.<ref name="Grad"/>

In September 2000, Massoud signed the Declaration of the Essential Rights of Afghan Women drafted by Afghan women. The declaration established gender equality in front of the law and the right of women to political participation, education, work, freedom of movement and speech. In the areas of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa by law. They were allowed to work and to go to school. Although it was a time of war, girls' schools were operating in some districts. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage in favour of the women to make their own choice.<ref name="Grad"/>

While it was Massoud's stated personal conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion, that could only be achieved through education.<ref name="Grad"/> Author Pepe Escobar wrote in ''Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'':
{{quote|"Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that 'the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression.' His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women -- they would have the same rights as men."<ref name="Grad"/>|Pepe Escobar| in 'Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'}}

Humayun Tandar, who took part as an Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that "strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day."<ref name="Grad"/> This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask the Jewish [[Princeton University|Princeton]] Professor Michael Barry or his Christian friend Jean-José Puig: "Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language."<ref name="Grad"/>

====International relations====

U.S. policy regarding Massoud, the Taliban and Afghanistan remains ambiguous and differed between the various U.S. government agencies.

In 1997, U.S. State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] suggested to Massoud he should surrender to the Taliban. He soundly rejected the proposal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

At one point in the war, in 1997, two top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan in an attempt to convince Massoud not to take advantage of a strategic opportunity to make crucial gains against the Taliban.<ref name="U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher">{{cite web |year=2004 |url =http://rohrabacher.house.gov/911-represented-dramatic-failure-policy-and-people|title =9/11 Represented a Dramatic Failure of Policy and People | publisher = U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2012}}

In 1998, a US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] analyst, Julie Sirrs, visited Massoud's territories privately, having previously been denied official permission to do so by her agency. She reported that Massoud had conveyed warnings about strengthened ties between the Taliban and foreign Islamist terrorists. Returning home, she was sacked from her agency for insubordination, because at that time the US administration had no trust in Massoud.<ref name="U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher"/>

In the meantime, the only collaboration between Massoud and another U.S. intelligence service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), consisted of an effort to trace [[Osama bin Laden]] following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]].<ref name="risen">Risen, James. "State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration", 2006</ref> The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.

A change of policy, lobbied for by CIA officers on the ground who had visited the area of Massoud, regarding support to Massoud, was underway in the course of 2001. According to Steve Coll's book ''Ghost Wars''<ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"/> (who won the 2005 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Non-Fiction):

{{quote|"The CIA officers admired Massoud greatly. They saw him as a [[Che Guevara]] figure, a great actor on history's stage. Massoud was a poet, a military genius, a religious man, and a leader of enormous courage who defied death and accepted its inevitability, they thought.... In his house there were thousands of books: Persian poetry, histories of the Afghan war in multiple languages, biographies of other military and guerilla leaders. In their meetings Massoud wove sophisticated, measured references to Afghan history and global politics into his arguments. He was quiet, forceful, reserved, and full of dignity, but also light in spirit. The CIA team had gone into the Panshjir as unabashed admirers of Massoud. Now their convictions deepened...."<ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"/> |[[Steve Coll]]|in "Ghost Wars"}}

U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher also recalled: "[B]etween Bush's inauguration and 9/11, I met with the new national security staff on 3 occasions, including one meeting with Condoleezza Rice to discuss Afghanistan. There were, in fact, signs noted in an overview story in The Washington Post about a month ago that some steps were being made to break away from the previous administration's Afghan policy."<ref name="U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher"/> CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counterterrorist Center, began to draft a formal, legal presidential finding for Bush's signature authorizing a new covert action program in Afghanistan, the first in a decade that sought to influence the course of the Afghan war in favour of Massoud.<ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"/>  This change in policy was finalized in August 2001 when it was too late.

After Pakistan had funded, directed and supported the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, Massoud and the United Front received some assistance from India.<ref>Peter Pigott: [http://books.google.com/books?id=XaQPHbHb_fkC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Mohammad+Najibullah+delhi&source=bl&ots=P99ziKKf3-&sig=9msSFGE-gWwa8jtpVoHSC9g-_A4&hl=en&ei=qsMZStLsHpeWMZKphJoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4 Canada in Afghanistan]</ref> India was particularly concerned about Pakistan's Taliban strategy and the Islamic militancy in its neighborhood; it provided US$70 million in aid including two [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-17]] helicopters, three additional helicopters in 2000 and US$8 million worth of high-altitude equipment in 2001.<ref>Duncan Mcleod: [http://books.google.com/books?id=EqDdfZwSc3EC&pg=PA93&dq=india+hijacking+ahmed+shah+massoud&client=firefox-a India and Pakistan]</ref> Furthermore, the alliance supposedly also received minor aid from [[Tajikistan]], Russia and [[Iran]] because of their opposition to the Taliban and the Pakistani control over the Taliban's Emirate. Their support, however, remained limited to the most needed things. Meanwhile, Pakistan engaged up to 28,000 Pakistani nationals and regular Pakistani army troops to fight alongside the Taliban and Al Qaeda forces against Massoud.<ref name="National Geographic"/><ref name="History Commons">{{Cite web|year=2010 |url =http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_shah_massoud |title = History Commons| publisher = [[History Commons]]}}</ref>

In April 2001, the president of the [[European Parliament]], [[Nicole Fontaine]] (who called Massoud the "pole of liberty in Afghanistan"), invited Massoud with the support of French and Belgian politicians to address the European Parliament in [[Brussels]], Belgium. In his speech, he asked for humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan. Massoud further went on to warn that his intelligence agents had gained limited knowledge about a large-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil being imminent.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher= [http://www.cooperativeresearch.org History Commons]|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a040601massoudspeech#a040601massoudspeech |title=''April 6, 2001: Rebel Leader Warns Europe and US About Large-Scale Imminent Al-Qaeda Attacks''|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}</ref>

==Assassination==

[[File:Massoud Memorial.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Afghan National Army honouring Massoud's resistance at his tomb and memorial in September 2010.]]
Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of a [[suicide attack]] at Khwaja Bahauddin, in [[Takhar Province]] in northeastern Afghanistan on September 9, 2001.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html "Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb"]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/world/threats-responses-assassination-afghans-too-mark-day-disaster-hero-was-lost.html "THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASSASSINATION; Afghans, Too, Mark a Day of Disaster: A Hero Was Lost"]</ref>  The attackers' names were alternately given as Dahmane Abd al-Sattar, husband of [[Malika El Aroud]], and Bouraoui el-Ouaer; or 34-year-old Karim Touzani and 26-year-old Kacem Bakkali.<ref>Pinto, Maria do Ceu. "Islamist and Middle Eastern Terrorism: A Threat to Europe?". p. 72.</ref>

The attackers claimed to be [[Belgium|Belgians]] originally from [[Morocco]]. Their passports turned out to be stolen and their nationality was later determined to be [[Tunisia]]n. Waiting for almost three weeks (during which they also interviewed [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]]) for an interview opportunity, on September 8, 2001, an aide to Massoud recalls the would-be suicide attackers "were so worried" and threatened to leave if the interview did not happen in the next 24 hours (until September 10, 2001). They were finally granted an interview. During the interview, they set off a bomb composed of explosives hidden in the camera and in a battery-pack belt. Commander Massoud died in a helicopter that was taking him to a military field hospital in nearby Tajikistan.<ref>http://www.timofranc.com/LION%20OF%20PANJSHIR.PDF</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2012}}<ref>http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3550</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2012}} The explosion also killed Mohammed Asim Suhail, a United Front official, while [[Mohammad Fahim Dashty]] and [[Massoud Khalili]] were injured. One of the suicide attackers, [[Bouraoui]], was killed by the explosion, while Dahmane Abd al-Sattar was captured and shot while trying to escape.

Despite initial denials by the United Front, news of Massoud's death was reported almost immediately, appearing on the BBC, and in European and North American newspapers on September 10, 2001. On September 16, the United Front officially announced that Massoud had died of injuries in the suicide attack. Massoud was buried in his home village of [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]] in the Panjshir Valley.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/world/rebel-chief-who-fought-the-taliban-is-buried.html "Rebel Chief Who Fought The Taliban Is Buried"]</ref> The funeral, although in a remote rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of people. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq-zqA1DMWs see video]).

Massoud had survived assassination attempts over a period of 26 years, including attempts made by al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Pakistani ISI and before them the Soviet KGB, the Afghan communist KHAD and Hekmatyar. The first attempt on Massoud's life was carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975 when Massoud was 22 years old.<ref name="Roy Gutman"/> In early 2001, al-Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.<ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"/>

;Connection to September 11, 2001

The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3,000 people. It appeared to have been the major terrorist attack which Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.

Analysts believe [[Osama bin Laden]] ordered Massoud's assassination to help his Taliban protectors and ensure he would have their co-operation in Afghanistan. Following the assassination, bin Laden had an emissary deliver Dahmane Abd al-Sattar's widow a cassette of  him speaking of his love for his wife and his decision to blow himself up, as well as $500 in an envelope to settle a debt.<ref>"Suicide Bomber's Widow Soldiers On" http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/elaroud/index.html</ref> The Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) and [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]], an Afghan [[Wahhabi]] Islamist, have also been mentioned as possible organizers or collaborators of the Massoud assassins.<ref name = "mlqamx">Anderson, Jon Lee (June 10, 2002).

'''Investigative commission'''

In April 2003, the [[Karzai administration]] announced the creation of a commission to investigate the assassination of Massoud.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/29/world/aftereffects-briefly-noted-afghan-panel-to-investigate-massoud-s-death.html "AFTEREFFECTS: Briefly Noted; AFGHAN PANEL TO INVESTIGATE MASSOUD'S DEATH"]</ref> In 2003, French investigators announced that they and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had been able to trace the provenance of the camera used in the assassination, which had been stolen in France some time earlier.<ref>[http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2003/october/oct172003.html "TV camera rigged to kill Afghan rebel Masood stolen in France: police"], ''Agence France-Presse'', October 16, 2003.</ref>

===Lion of Panjshir===
Massoud's byname, "Lion of Panjshir" ({{lang-fa|شیر پنجشیر}}, "Shir-e-Panjshir"), earned for his role during the Soviet occupation, is a rhyming play on words in [[Persian language|Persian]], as the name of the valley means "five lions".

Declassified [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) documents from November 2001 show that Massoud had gained "limited knowledge... regarding the intentions of [Al-Qaeda] to perform a terrorist act against the U.S. on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania."<ref name="nineeleven"/><ref name="gwu.edu">Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal31.pdf</ref> They noted that he warned about such attacks.<ref name="nineeleven"/><ref name="gwu.edu"/>

==Personal life==
Massoud was married to Sediqa Massoud. They have one son (Ahmad born in 1989) and five daughters (Fatima born in 1992, Mariam born in 1993, Ayesha born in 1995, Zohra born in 1996 and Nasrine born in 1998). In 2005 Sediqa Massoud published a personal account on her life with Massoud (co-authored by two women's rights activists and friends of Sediqa Massoud, Chékéba Hachemi and Marie-Francoise Colombani) called ''"Pour l'amour de Massoud"'' (For the love of Massoud), in which she describes a decent and loving husband.

The family has a great deal of prestige in the politics of Afghanistan.
