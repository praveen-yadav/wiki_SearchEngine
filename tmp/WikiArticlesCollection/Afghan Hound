The '''Afghan Hound''' is a [[hound]] that is one of the oldest [[dog]] breeds in existence. Distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and its tail with a ring curl at the end, the breed acquired its unique features in the cold mountains of [[Afghanistan]]. Its local name is '''Tāžī Spay''' ({{lang-ps|تاژي سپی}}) or '''Sag-e Tāzī''' ([[Dari Persian]]: سگ تازی). Other alternate names for this breed are ''[[Koochee dog|Kuchi Hound]]'', ''Tāzī'', ''Balkh Hound'', ''Baluchi Hound'', ''Barutzy Hound'', ''Shalgar Hound'', ''Kabul Hound'', ''Galanday Hound'', or sometimes incorrectly ''African Hound''.

==History==
[[Sighthound]]s are among the oldest recognisable [[Dog type|types]] of dogs, and genetic testing has placed the Afghan Hound breed among those with the least genetic divergence from the wolf on some markers;<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2007/5/genetics-and-the-shape-of-dogs| title= Genetics and the Shape of Dogs; Studying the new sequence of the canine genome shows how tiny genetic changes can create enormous variation within a single species| accessdate= 09/22 2008| last= Ostrander| first= Elaine A.| date= September–October 2007| work= American Scientist (online)| publisher= www.americanscientist.org| pages= also see chart page 4}}</ref> this is taken to mean that such dogs are descended from the oldest [[dog type]]s, not that the breeds tested had in antiquity their exact modern form. Today's modern purebred breed of Afghan Hound descends from dogs brought in the 1920s to Great Britain, and are a blending of types and varieties of long haired sighthounds from across Afghanistan and the surrounding areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afghan-network.net/Culture/afghan-hound.html |title=Afghan Hound: A History |publisher=Afghan Network |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> Some had been kept as hunting dogs, others as guardians.<ref>''Afghan Hounds''; Pisano, Beverly; TFH Publications; June 1988; pg. 12; ISBN 0-87666-682-9 and ISBN 978-0-87666-682-1</ref>

Although demonstrably ancient, verifiable written or visual records that tie today's Afghan Hound breed to specific Afghan owners or places is absent, even though there is much speculation about possible connections with the ancient world among [[Animal fancy|fanciers]] and in non-scientific breed books and breed websites. Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, Tazi (sag-e-tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the [[Caspian Sea]] area of [[Russia]] and [[Turkmenistan]].Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous [[Tian Shan]] region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the [[Barakzay]], or [[Kurram Valley]] Hound. There are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan,<ref name="historie">{{cite web|url=http://www.nika-afghani.unas.cz/historie.htm |title=Historie afgánského chrta |language=Czech |trans_title=History of the Afghan Hound |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> and some are being developed (through breeding and recordkeeping) into modern purebred breeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/~w-40770/star/rare/rare2.html |title=List of Rare Sighthounds |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> As the lives of the peoples with whom these dogs developed change in the modern world, often these [[landrace]] types of dogs lose their use and disappear; there may have been many more types of longhaired sighthound in the past.

Once out of [[Afghanistan]], the history of the Afghan Hound breed becomes an important part of the history of the very earliest dog shows and [[The Kennel Club]] (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from [[British India]] (which at the time included), Afghanistan, and [[Persia]], and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds.<ref name="historie" /> They were also called "Persian Greyhounds" by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.

One dog in particular, ''Zardin'', was brought in 1907 from India by Captain Bariff,<ref>http://www.afghanhoundtimes.com/zardinb.htm Zardin painting - F T Daws</ref> and became the early ideal of [[breed type]] for what was still called the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing of the first breed standard in 1912, but breeding of the dogs was stopped by World War I.<ref name="historie" />

Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to [[Scotland]] from [[Balochistan (Afghanistan)|Baluchistan]] by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the ''Bell-Murray strain''. These dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in [[Kabul]] owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her ''Ghazni strain'' were the more heavily coated mountain type.  Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain.<ref>[http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/chien/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/afghan-hound--from-the-streets-of-kabul-to-the-main-rings-of-the-world/index.htm Chien Magazine Afghan Hound history]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.

The spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable showdogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, ''Sirdar'', won BIS at [[Crufts]] in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of [[Life Magazine]], November 26, 1945. "Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s…and won most of the major shows".<ref>[http://www.aniwa.com/en/chien/document/en/general/magazine/discover/dog-breeds/a-bunch-of-internationally-famous-breeders/index.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 [[World Dog Show]] in Budapest. Afghan hounds were BIS at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1957 and again in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/history/biswinners.html |title=Best In Show Winners |publisher=The Westminster Kennel Club |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> That win also marked the most recent win at Westminster for breeder-owner-handler, Chris Terrell.

The Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of [[lure coursing]].<ref>[http://www.peds.co.uk/afghan/coursing.htm Afghan Hound Lure Coursing]</ref>

==Descriptions==
[[Image:Afghan-Hound.jpg|thumb|left|This Afghan hound is black and [[brindle]]; however, the photo shows it with a reddish tinge to the coat, which can occur in a black-coated dog.]]
The Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height 24–29&nbsp;inches and weighing 45–60 pounds. The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a [[melanistic mask|black facial mask]]. A specimen may have facial hair that looks like a [[Fu Manchu moustache]].  The moustache is called "mandarins." Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-colour hounds (white with islands of red or black) are not acceptable and may indicate impure breeding. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.

The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hounds' reasoning skills have made it a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion.  Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.<ref>P. Savolainen et al. Science 298, 1610 Nov 22, 2002</ref>

The breed has a reputation among some dog trainers of having a relatively slow "obedience intelligence" as defined by author [[Stanley Coren]] in ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs (book)|The Intelligence of Dogs]]''.

Although seldom used today for hunting in [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]] where they are popular, Afghan hounds are frequent participants in [[lure coursing]] events and are also popular in the [[List of dog sports|sport]] of [[conformation show]]ing.

==Variants==
The Khalag Tazi is a variety of the Afghan. It was introduced to [[Europe]] in 1920 when an [[Indian Army]] officer, Major G Bell-Murray, brought some animals back from [[Afghanistan]].<ref>[http://afghanhoundtimes.com/nz2.htm]; compuserve.{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>{{dead link|date=January 2011}} ''Tazi'' is a current and ancient name for [[hunting dog]]s of the sighthound type in the [[Middle East]]. It has been used to denote the [[Saluki]], Afghan, [[Taigan]], [[Persian Greyhound]], [[greyhound]] types of [[hound]].

==Health==

===Lifespan===
Afghan Hounds in UK surveys had a median lifespan of about 12 years.<ref name="Cassidy Data">http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Breed Data page. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved July 5, 2007</ref> which is similar to other breeds of their size.<ref name="Cassidy Weight">http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/weight_and_lifespan.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Weight and Longevity page. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved July 5, 2007</ref> In the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (31%), old age (20%), cardiac (10.5%), and urologic (5%). Those that die of old age had an average lifespan of 13 to 14 1/2 years.<ref name="KC Survey">http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004. Purebred Dog Health Survey. Retrieved July 5, 2007</ref>

===Health concerns===
Major health issues are [[allergy|allergies]], [[cancer]], and [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]]. Sensitivity to [[anesthesia]] is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the [[sighthound]] group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop [[chylothorax]], a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of [[Chyle|chyle fluid]] to enter the dog's chest cavity.<ref>[http://www.akcchf.org/pdfs/whitepapers/HoundGroup07.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> This condition commonly results in a lung torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, "barrel"-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is not necessarily, but often, fatal.

==In popular culture==
Because of its distinctive appearance, the Afghan hound has been represented in animated feature films, including Universal Pictures' ''[[Balto]]'' (Sylvie), Disney's ''[[Lady and the Tramp II]]'' (Ruby), an Afghan hound also appeared on ''101 Dalmatians'' as well as in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' as one of the dogs in [[Cruella De Vil]]'s party and the television series [[What-a-Mess]] (Prince Amir of Kinjan; based on children's books by [[Frank Muir]]) and, as Prissy in the 1961 [[Disney]] animated film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]''. Afghan hounds have also been featured in television advertisements and in fashion magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afghanhoundactors.com/about.html |title=Afghan Hound Actors for Film, Television, Print and Stage |publisher=Afghan Hound Actors |year=2008 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref> The Afghan hound is represented in books as well, including being featured in a series of mystery novels by Nina Wright (Abra), and a talking Afghan Hound in David Rothman's ''The [[Solomon Scandals]]'' (2008, Twilight Times Books). In the novel ''[[Between the Acts]]'', [[Virginia Woolf]] uses an Afghan hound (named Sohrab) to represent aspects of one of the book's human characters.<ref>The Philosophy of Virginia Woolf: A Philosophical Reading of the Mature Novels

On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist [[Hwang Woo-Suk]] announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully [[cloning|clone]] a dog, an Afghan Hound named [[Snuppy]]. In 2006 Hwang Woo-Suk was dismissed from his university position for fabricating data in his research. Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4784301 |title=Meet Snuppy, the World's First Cloned Dog |last=Palca |first=Joe |publisher=NPR |date=August 3, 2005 |accessdate=April 5, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110511185132/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4784301| archivedate= 11 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In the BBC Three Sitcom ''[[Mongrels (TV series)|Mongrels]]'' the character of Destiny is an Afghan Hound.

In the 2010 comedy ''[[Marmaduke (film)|Marmaduke]]'', two Afghan hounds appear in the dog park and are shown to resemble high school girls watching the more athletic dogs as if they were "jocks" and are also shown to be "air heads".

The Afghan Hound features prominently in the avant-garde music video of popular French band M83's, "Set in Stone (M83 Remix)." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.runproductions.tv/ |title=Fires of Rome - Set In Stone (M83 Remix) |last=Lessner |first=Matthew |publisher=Run Productions |year=2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref>

In the FX animated series ''[[Archer (TV series)|Archer]]'', the titular protagonist's mother mourns the death of her Afghan Hound "Duchess" as a recurring gag throughout the show.
