'''Birds''' ([[Class (biology)|class]] '''Aves''' or [[clade]] '''Avialae''') are [[feather]]ed, [[bird flight|wing]]ed, [[Bipedalism|two-legged]], [[warm-blooded]], [[egg (biology)|egg]]-laying [[vertebrate]]s. Aves ranks as the tetrapod class with the most living species, approximately ten thousand. [[Extant taxon|Extant]] birds belong to the subclass [[Modern birds|Neornithes]], living worldwide and ranging in size from the {{convert|5|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Bee Hummingbird]] to the {{convert|2.75|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[Ostrich]]. The [[Paleontology|fossil record]] indicates that birds emerged within the [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s during the [[Jurassic]] period, around {{ma|150| million years ago.}} Birds are the only living members of the [[clade]] that originated with the earliest dinosaurs.

[[Modern birds]] are [[body plan|characterised]] by [[feather]]s, a [[beak]] with no [[teeth]], the [[Oviposition|laying]] of [[Eggshell|hard-shelled]] eggs, a high [[metabolism|metabolic]] rate, a four-chambered [[heart]], and a lightweight but strong [[Bird skeleton|skeleton]]. Extant birds have wings; the most recent species without wings was the [[moa]], which is generally considered to have become extinct in the 16th century. Wings are evolved forelimbs, and most bird species can [[bird flight|fly]]. Flightless birds include [[ratite]]s, [[penguin]]s, and diverse [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] island species.  Some species of birds, particularly [[penguin]]s and members of the [[Anatidae]] family, are adapted to swim.  Birds also have [[digestive system|digestive]] and [[respiratory system]]s that are uniquely adapted for flight. Some birds, especially [[corvids]] and [[parrots]], are among the most intelligent animal species; several bird species [[Tool use by animals|make and use tools]], and many social species culturally transmit knowledge across generations.

Many species annually [[bird migration|migrate]] great distances, and many more perform shorter irregular movements. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and [[bird song|songs]], and participating in such social behaviours as [[Helpers at the nest|cooperative breeding]] and hunting, [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]], and [[Mobbing behavior|mobbing]] of predators. The vast majority of bird species are [[socially monogamous]], usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have [[polygyny|polygynous]] ("many females") or, rarely, [[polyandry|polyandrous]] ("many males") breeding systems. Eggs are usually laid in a nest and [[Avian incubation|incubated]] by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.

Many species are economically important, mostly as game or poultry. Some species, particularly [[songbird]]s and [[parrot]]s, are popular as pets. Another use of birds is harvesting [[guano]] (droppings) for use as a [[fertiliser]]. Birds [[List of fictional birds|prominently figure]] throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become [[extinction|extinct]] due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then.  Human acitivity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to [[bird conservation|protect]] them.

[[Phylogenetic taxonomy]] places Aves in the dinosaur [[clade]] [[Theropoda]].<ref name="Theropoda">{{Cite journal | month=January | year=2007 | title=Higher-order phylogeny of modern birds (Theropoda, Aves: Neornithes) based on comparative anatomy.

===Definition===
Aves and a sister group, the clade [[Crocodilia]], contain the only living representatives of the [[reptile]] clade [[Archosauria]]. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] as all descendants of the [[most recent common ancestor]] of modern birds and ''[[Archaeopteryx|Archaeopteryx lithographica]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Padian|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Padian|coauthor=L.M.

Gauthier defined Aves to include only the modern bird groups, the [[crown group]]. This was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the [[Avialae]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gauthier |first=Jacques|editor=Kevin Padian |title=The Origin of Birds and the Evolution of Flight|series= Memoirs of the California Academy of Science '''8'''|year=1986|pages=1–55|chapter=Saurischian Monophyly and the origin of birds|isbn=0-940228-14-9 |publisher=Published by California Academy of Sciences |location=San Francisco, CA}}</ref> in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of ''Archaeopteryx'' in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs.<!-- See WP:RS<ref>http://www.phylonames.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7</ref> --><!--Mayr et al. 2005 "A well-preserved Archaeopteryx specimen with theropod features" + comment + Mayr's comment on the comment-->

Gauthier<ref name="gauthier&dequeiroz2001"/> (page 34) identified four conflicting ways of defining the term "Aves", which is a problem because the same biological name is being used four different ways. Gauthier proposed a solution, number 4 below, which is to reserve the term Aves only for the [[crown group]], the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants. He assigned other names to the other groups.

# Aves can mean those advanced [[archosaur]]s with feathers (alternately [[Avifilopluma]])
# Aves can mean those that fly (alternately Avialae)

# Aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group"). (alternately [[Neornithes]])

Under the fourth definition ''Archaeopteryx'' is an avialan, and not a member of Aves. Gauthier's proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of paleontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. Avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of Aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term "bird" by these researchers.<ref name=Nature>{{Cite journal|author=[[Pascal Godefroit]], Andrea Cau, Hu Dong-Yu, François Escuillié, Wu Wenhao and Gareth Dyke |year=2013 |title=A Jurassic avialan dinosaur from China resolves the early phylogenetic history of birds |journal=Nature |volume=in press |issue= 7454|page= 359|doi=10.1038/nature12168 }}</ref>

Most researchers define Avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. Many authors have used a definition similar to "all [[theropod]]s closer to birds than to ''[[Deinonychus]]''."<ref name="weishampel2004">Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; Osmólska, Halszka (eds.)

The consensus view in contemporary [[paleontology]] is that the birds, or [[Avialae|avialans]], are the closest relatives of the [[deinonychosaur]]s, which include [[dromaeosaurid]]s and [[troodontid]]s.<ref name=Xiaotingia>{{cite journal |title=An ''Archaeopteryx''-like theropod from China and the origin of Avialae |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v475/n7357/full/nature10288.html |date=28 July 2011 |journal=Nature |volume=475 |pages=465–470 |doi=10.1038/nature10288 |issue=7357 |author=Xing Xu, Hailu You, Kai Du and Fenglu Han |pmid=21796204}}</ref> Together, these form a group called [[Paraves]].

The [[Late Jurassic]] ''Archaeopteryx'' is well known as one of the first [[transitional fossil]]s to be found, and it provided support for the theory of [[evolution]] in the late 19th century. ''Archaeopteryx'' was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers identical to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of modern birds, though it is possibly closely related to the real ancestor.<ref name="mayretal2007">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2006.00245.x | last1 = Mayr | first1 = G. | last2 = Pohl | first2 = B. | last3 = Hartman | first3 = S. | last4 = Peters | first4 = D.S. | year = 2007 | title = The tenth skeletal specimen of ''Archaeopteryx''| journal = Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 149 | pages = 97–116 }}</ref>

====Alternative scientific theories and controversies====
Early disagreements on the origins of birds included whether birds evolved from [[dinosaur]]s or more primitive [[archosaur]]s. Within the dinosaur camp, there were disagreements as to whether [[ornithischia]]n or [[theropod]] dinosaurs were the more likely ancestors.<ref name="Heilmann1927">Heilmann, Gerhard (1927). ''The Origin of Birds''. New York: Dover Publications.</ref> Although ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the hip structure of modern birds, birds are thought to have originated from the [[saurischia]]n (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs, and therefore evolved their hip structure [[Convergent evolution|independently]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rasskin-Gutman |first=Diego |month=March |year=2001 |title=Theoretical morphology of the Archosaur (Reptilia: Diapsida) pelvic girdle |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=59–78|doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2001)027<0059:TMOTAR>2.0.CO;2 |last2=Buscalioni |first2=Angela D.}}</ref> In fact, a bird-like hip structure evolved a third time among a peculiar group of theropods known as the [[Therizinosauridae]].

A small minority of researchers, such as paleornithologist [[Alan Feduccia]] of the [[University of North Carolina]], challenge the majority view, contending that birds are not dinosaurs, but evolved from early reptiles like ''[[Longisquama]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feduccia |first=Alan |month=November |year=2005|title=Do feathered dinosaurs exist?

The earliest known bird (avialan) fossils currently known hail from the [[Tiaojishan Formation]] of [[China]], which has been dated to the late [[Jurassic]] period ([[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] stage), about 160 million years ago.<ref name=Nature/> The avialan species from this time period include ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', ''[[Xiaotingia zhengi]]'', and ''[[Aurornis xui]]''. The well-known early avialan, ''Archaeopteryx'', dates from slightly later Jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from [[Germany]]. Many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. These features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or "hind wings" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.<ref name=zhengetal2013>Zheng X., Zhou Z., Wang X., Zhang F., Zhang X., Wang Y., Wei G., Wang S., and Xu X.

Avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the [[Cretaceous Period]].<ref name="chiappe2007">{{Cite book|last=Chiappe |first=Luis M. |year=2007 |title=Glorified Dinosaurs: The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds |location=Sydney |publisher=University of New South Wales Press |isbn=978-0-86840-413-4}}</ref> Many groups retained [[symplesiomorphy|primitive characteristics]], such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of bird groups, including [[modern birds]] (Neornithes).

The first large, diverse lineage of short-tailed birds to evolve were the [[enantiornithes]], or "opposite birds", so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds. Enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches, from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters. While they were the dominant group of land birds during the Cretaceous period, enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era.<ref name="chiappe2007"/>

Many species of the second major bird lineage to diversify, the [[Euornithes]] ("true birds", including the ancestors of modern birds), were semi-aquatic and specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms. Unlike the enantiornithes, which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats, most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebirds, waders, and swimming and diving species. The later included the superficially [[gull]]-like genus ''[[Ichthyornis]]'' (fish birds),<ref>

All modern birds lie within the crown group [[Neornithes]] (alternately Aves), which has two subdivisions: the [[Palaeognathae]], which includes the flightless [[ratite]]s (such as the [[ostrich]]es) and the weak-flying [[tinamou]]s, and the extremely diverse [[Neognathae]], containing all other birds.<ref name="Theropoda"/> These two subdivisions are often given the [[taxonomic rank|rank]] of [[superorder]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdbiogeography1.htm |title=Bird biogeography | last= Ritchison| first=Gary |accessdate=10 April 2008 |work=Avian Biology|publisher=Eastern Kentucky University}}</ref> although [[Bradley C.

Due largely to the discovery of ''[[Vegavis]]'', a late Cretaceous neognath member of the [[duck]] lineage, Neornithes is now known to have split into several modern lineages by the end of the Mesozoic era.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Clarke |first=Julia A. |year=2005 |title=Definitive fossil evidence for the extant avian radiation in the Cretaceous |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=433 |issue= 7023|pages=305–308 |doi=10.1038/nature03150 |pmid=15662422 |url=http://www.digimorph.org/specimens/Vegavis_iaai/nature03150.pdf|format=PDF |last2=Tambussi |first2=CP |last3=Noriega |first3=JI |last4=Erickson |first4=GM |last5=Ketcham |first5=RA}} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7023/suppinfo/nature03150.html Nature.com], Supporting information</ref> The earliest divergence from the remaining Neognathes was that of the [[Galloanserae]], the superorder containing the [[Anseriformes]] (ducks, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[screamer]]s) and the [[Galliformes]] (the [[pheasant]]s, [[grouse]], and their allies, together with the [[mound builder (bird)|mound builders]] and the [[guan (bird)|guan]]s and their allies). The dates for the splits are much debated by scientists. The Neornithes are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], but there are different opinions about whether the [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.<ref name="Ericson">{{Cite journal|last=Ericson |first=Per G.P. |year=2006 |title=Diversification of Neoaves: integration of molecular sequence data and fossils |journal=[[Biology Letters]] |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=543–547 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 |pmid=17148284 |url=http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/neoaves.pdf|format=PDF |last2=Anderson |first2=CL |last3=Britton |first3=T |last4=Elzanowski |first4=A |last5=Johansson |first5=US |last6=Källersjö |first6=M |last7=Ohlson |first7=JI |last8=Parsons |first8=TJ |last9=Zuccon |first9=D|displayauthors=9 |pmc=1834003|first10=G.}}</ref> This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while [[fossil]] evidence supports a [[Tertiary]] radiation.

The classification of birds is a contentious issue. [[Charles Sibley|Sibley]] and [[Jon Ahlquist|Ahlquist]]'s ''Phylogeny and Classification of Birds'' (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Sibley |coauthors=[[Jon Edward Ahlquist]] |year=1990 |title=Phylogeny and classification of birds |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-04085-7}}</ref> although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst W. Mayr |coauthors=Short, Lester L.|title=Species Taxa of North American Birds: A Contribution to Comparative Systematics |series=Publications of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, no. 9 |year=1970 |publisher=Nuttall Ornithological Club|location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=517185}}</ref> but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.

This is a list of the taxonomic orders in the subclass Neornithes, or modern birds. This list uses the traditional classification (the so-called [[James Clements|Clements]] order), revised by the Sibley-Monroe classification. The [[list of birds]] gives a more detailed summary of the orders, including families.

'''Subclass [[Neornithes]]'''<br/>
The subclass Neornithes has two extant [[superorder]]s&nbsp;–

Superorder [[Palaeognathae]]:

The name of the superorder is derived from ''paleognath'', the ancient Greek for "old jaws" in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate, which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds. The Palaeognathae consists of two orders that comprise 49 existing species.

* [[Struthioniformes]]—[[ostrich]]es, [[emu]]s, [[kiwi]]s, and allies
* [[Tinamiformes]]—tinamous

Superorder [[Neognathae]]:

The superorder Neognathae comprises 27 orders that have a total of nearly 10,000 species.
The Neognathae have undergone [[adaptive radiation]] to produce the staggering diversity of form (especially of the bill and feet), function, and behaviour that are seen today.

The orders comprising the Neognathae are:

* [[Anseriformes]]—waterfowl
* [[Galliformes]]—fowl
* [[Charadriiformes]]—[[gull]]s, [[button-quail]]s, [[plover]]s and allies
* [[Gaviiformes]]—loons
* [[Podicipediformes]]—grebes
* [[Procellariiformes]]—[[albatross]]es, [[petrel]]s, and allies
* [[Sphenisciformes]]—penguins
* [[Pelecaniformes]]—[[pelican]]s and allies
* [[Phaethontiformes]]—tropicbirds
* [[Ciconiiformes]]—[[stork]]s and allies
* [[Cathartiformes]]—New World vultures
* [[Phoenicopteriformes]]—flamingos
* [[Falconiformes]]—[[falcon]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s and allies
* [[Gruiformes]]—[[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and allies
* [[Pteroclidiformes]]—sandgrouse
* [[Columbiformes]]—[[Columbidae|doves and pigeons]]
* [[parrot|Psittaciformes]]—[[parrot]]s and allies
* [[Cuculiformes]]—[[cuckoo]]s and [[turaco]]s
* [[Opisthocomiformes]]—hoatzin
* [[owl|Strigiformes]]—owls
* [[Caprimulgiformes]]—[[nightjar]]s and allies
* [[Apodiformes]]—[[swift]]s and [[hummingbird]]s
* [[Coraciiformes]]—[[kingfisher]]s and allies
* [[Piciformes]]—[[woodpecker]]s and allies
* [[Trogoniformes]]—trogons
* [[Coliiformes]]—mousebirds
* [[Passerine|Passeriformes]]—passerines, the songbirds or perching birds

The radically different Sibley-Monroe classification ([[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]]), based on molecular data, found widespread adoption in a few aspects, as recent molecular, fossil, and anatomical evidence supported the [[Galloanserae]].<ref name = "Ericson"/>

Birds have one of the most complex [[respiratory system]]s of all animal groups.<ref name = "Gill"/> Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior [[Parabronchi|air sac]] which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maina |first=John N. |month=November |year=2006 |title=Development, structure, and function of a novel respiratory organ, the lung-air sac system of birds: to go where no other vertebrate has gone |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=81 |issue=4 |pages=545–79 |pmid=17038201 |doi=10.1017/S1464793106007111 }}</ref> Sound production is achieved using the [[syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea;<ref name = "Suthers">{{Cite book|last=Suthers |first=Roderick A. |coauthors=Sue Anne Zollinger |chapter=Producing song: the vocal apparatus |editor=H.

===Chromosomes===
Birds have two sexes: male and female. The sex of birds is determined by the [[ZW sex-determination system|Z and W sex chromosomes]], rather than by the X and Y chromosomes present in mammals. Male birds have two Z chromosomes (ZZ), and female birds have a W chromosome and a Z chromosome (WZ).<ref name = "Gill"/>

In nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilization. However, one recent study demonstrated [[temperature-dependent sex determination]] among [[Australian Brush-turkeys]], for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male [[sex ratio]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Göth|first=Anne|title=Incubation temperatures and sex ratios in Australian brush-turkey (''Alectura lathami'') mounds|journal=Austral Ecology|year=2007|volume=32|issue=4|pages=278–85|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01709.x}}</ref>

Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in [[Feathered dinosaurs|some dinosaurs]] not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate [[bird flight|flight]], provide insulation that aids in [[thermoregulation]], and are used in display, camouflage, and signaling.<ref name="Gill"/> There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called [[plumage]], may vary within species by age, [[social status]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belthoff |first=James R. |date=1 August 1994|title=Plumage Variation, Plasma Steroids and Social Dominance in Male House Finches |journal=The Condor |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=614–25 |doi=10.2307/1369464 |author2=Dufty, |author3=Gauthreaux,}}</ref> and [[sexual dimorphism|sex]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Guthrie| first=R.

Plumage is regularly [[moult]]ed; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the "non-breeding" plumage, or—in the [[Humphrey-Parkes terminology]]—"basic" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as "alternate" plumages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Humphrey |first=Philip S. |date=1 June 1959|title=An approach to the study of molts and plumages |journal=The Auk |volume=76 |pages=1–31 |url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v076n01/p0001-p0031.pdf |format=PDF |issue=1 |jstor=4081839|last2=Parkes|first2=K.

When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult).

{{Main|Bird flight}}

Most birds can [[Flying and gliding animals|fly]], which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb ([[wing]]) that serves as an [[airfoil|aerofoil]].<ref name = "Gill"/> Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.

===Diet and feeding===
[[File:BirdBeaksA.svg|thumb|upright|right|alt= Illustration of the heads of 16 types of birds with different shapes and sizes of beak|Feeding adaptations in beaks]]
Birds' diets are varied and often include [[nectar (plant)|nectar]], fruit, plants, seeds, [[carrion]], and various small animals, including other birds.<ref name = "Gill"/> Because birds have no teeth, their [[digestive system]] is adapted to process [[mastication|unmasticated]] food items that are swallowed whole.

Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists.<ref name = "Gill"/> Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds [[Gleaning (birds)|glean]] for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch.

Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the [[Columbidae|pigeon]], [[Estrildidae|finch]], [[Coliidae|mousebird]], [[Turnicidae|button-quail]] and [[Otididae|bustard]] families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sara L.|last=Hallager|title=Drinking methods in two species of bustards|journal=Wilson Bull.|volume=106|issue=4|year=1994|pages=763–764|id={{hdl|10088/4338}}}}</ref> Some desert birds depend on water sources and [[sandgrouse]] are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes.

===Feather care===
Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and [[Bird louse|birdlice]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The alterations of plumage of parasitic origin|first1=Principato |last1=Mario|first2=Lisi |last2=Federica|first3=Moretta |last3=Iolanda|first4= Samra|last4=Nada|first5=Puccetti |last5=Francesco| journal=Italian Journal of Animal Science |url=http://ijas.pagepress.org/index.php/ijas/article/download/ijas.2005.296/610|volume=4|pages=296–299|year=2005}}</ref> The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as [[Anting (bird activity)|anting]] in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Auk |volume=121|issue=4|pages=1262–1268| year=2004| doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2004)121[1262:BAFAOA]2.0.CO;2| title=Bactericidal and fungicidal activity of ant chemicals on feather parasites: an evaluation of anting behavior as a method of self-medication in songbirds| first1=Hannah C. |last1=Revis|first2=Deborah A. |last2=Waller}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Open Ornithology Journal| year=2010| volume=3|pages=41–71|title=How Birds Combat Ectoparasites|first1=Dale H.|last1=Clayton|first2= Jennifer A.

===Migration===
{{Main|Bird migration}}
Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of [[season]]al temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, [[shorebird]]s, and [[waterbird]]s undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the [[temperate]] or [[arctic]]/[[antarctic]] regions and a non-breeding season in the [[tropical]] regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.<ref name = "Battley"/><ref name = "Klaassen">{{Cite journal|last=Klaassen |first=Marc |date=1 January 1996|title=Metabolic constraints on long-distance migration in birds |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=199 |issue=1 |pages=57–64 |pmid=9317335 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/57 }}</ref> Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling.

===Flocking and other associations===
While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large [[flock (birds)|flocks]]. The principal benefits of flocking are [[safety in numbers]] and increased foraging efficiency.<ref name = "Gill"/> Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where [[ambush predation]] is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This has led to the development of many [[mixed-species feeding flock]]s, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Terborgh |first=John |year=2005 |title=Mixed flocks and polyspecific associations: Costs and benefits of mixed groups to birds and monkeys |journal=American Journal of Primatology |volume=21 |issue=2|pages=87–100 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350210203}}</ref> Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hutto |first=Richard L. |date=1 January 988|title=Foraging Behavior Patterns Suggest a Possible Cost Associated with Participation in Mixed-Species Bird Flocks |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=79–83 |doi=10.2307/3565809 |jstor=3565809}}</ref>

The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times.

Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their [[beak|bills]] in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. [[Passerine|Perching birds]] have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.

Other mating systems, including [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], [[polygamy]], [[polygynandry]], and [[promiscuity]], also occur.<ref name = "Gill"/> Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males.<ref name = "Gill"/> Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.

====Territories, nesting and incubation====
{{See also|Bird nest}}
Many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. Species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as [[seabird]]s and [[swift]]s, often breed in [[Bird colony|colonies]] instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. Colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H | last2 = Harris | first2 = M | last3 = Wanless | first3 = S | year = 2004 | title = Competition for breeding sites and site-dependent population regulation in a highly colonial seabird, the common guillemot ''Uria aalge'' | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = 2| pages = 367–76 | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00813.x }}</ref>

All birds lay [[amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].<ref name = "Gill"/> Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay [[camouflage]]d eggs. There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting [[nightjar]]s have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of [[brood parasites]] have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Booker | first1 = L | last2 = Booker | first2 = M | year = 1991 | title = Why Are Cuckoos Host Specific? | journal = [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 301–09 | doi = 10.2307/3565958 | jstor=3565958}}</ref>
[[File:Golden-backed Weaver.jpg|thumb|left|alt= Yellow weaver (bird) with black head hangs an upside-down nest woven out of grass fronds.|Male [[Golden-backed Weaver]]s construct elaborate suspended nests out of grass.]]
Bird eggs are usually laid in a [[Bird nest|nest]]. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.<ref name = "Hansell">Hansell M (2000). ''Bird Nests and Construction Behaviour''. University of Cambridge Press ISBN 0-521-46038-7</ref> Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; [[albatross]] nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lafuma | first1 = L | last2 = Lambrechts | first2 = M | last3 = Raymond | first3 = M | year = 2001 | title = Aromatic plants in bird nests as a protection against [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] flying insects? |  journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 56 | issue = 2| pages = 113–20 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-6357(01)00191-7 }}</ref> and feathers are often used for nest insulation.<ref name = "Hansell"/> Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting [[Common Guillemot]] lays its eggs on bare rock, and male [[Emperor Penguin]]s keep eggs between their body and feet. The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are [[precocial]].

[[File:Eastern Phoebe-nest-Brown-headed-Cowbird-egg.jpg|thumb|alt= Nest made of straw with five white eggs and one grey speckled egg|Nest of an [[Eastern Phoebe]] that has been parasitised by a [[Brown-headed Cowbird]].]]
Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.<ref name = "Gill"/> In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through [[brood patch]]es, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as {{convert|83|g}} of body weight per day of incubation.<ref>Warham, J. (1990) ''The Petrels: Their Ecology and Breeding Systems'' London: [[Academic Press]] ISBN 0-12-735420-4.</ref> The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of [[megapode]]s comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.<ref>Jones DN, Dekker, René WRJ, Roselaar, Cees S (1995). ''The Megapodes''. Bird Families of the World 3. [[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford. ISBN 0-19-854651-3</ref> Incubation periods range from 10 days (in [[woodpecker]]s, [[cuckoo]]s and [[passerine]] birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and [[kiwi]]s).<ref name = "Gill"/>

====Parental care and fledging====
At the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. Helpless chicks are termed ''[[altricial]]'', and tend to be born small, [[Blindness|blind]], immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed ''[[precocial]]''. Altricial chicks need help [[thermoregulation|thermoregulating]] and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. Chicks at neither of these extremes can be semi-precocial or semi-altricial.
[[File:Calliope-nest edit.jpg|thumb|alt= Hummingbird perched on edge of tiny nest places food into mouth of one of two chicks|left|A female [[Calliope Hummingbird]] feeding fully grown chicks.]]
[[File:White-breasted Woodswallow chicks in nest.jpg|thumb|alt=Looking down on three helpless blind chicks in a nest within the hollow of a dead tree trunk|right|[[Altricial]] chicks of a [[White-breasted Woodswallow]].]]

The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in [[megapode]]s ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.<ref>Elliot A (1994). "Family Megapodiidae (Megapodes)" in ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]. Volume 2; New World Vultures to Guineafowl'' (eds del Hoyo J, Elliott A, Sargatal J)  Lynx Edicions:Barcelona. ISBN 84-87334-15-6</ref> At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the [[Great Frigatebird]], whose chicks take up to six months to [[fledge]] and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.<ref>Metz VG, Schreiber EA (2002). "Great Frigatebird (''Fregata minor'')" In ''The Birds of North America, No 681'', (Poole, A. and Gill, F., eds) The Birds of North America Inc: Philadelphia</ref> The ''chick guard stage'' describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.<ref>Young, Euan. ''Skua and Penguin. Predator and Prey.''. Camebridge University Press, 1994, p. 453.</ref>

In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. In some species, [[helpers at the nest|other member]]s of the same species—usually close relatives of the [[breeding pair]], such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Family living amongst birds |  journal = [[Journal of Avian Biology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 289–98 | doi = 10.1111/j.2006.0908-8857.03666.x }}</ref> Such alloparenting is particularly common among the [[Corvida]], which includes such birds as the true [[Corvidae|crows]], [[Australian Magpie]] and [[Fairy-wren]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Cockburn A|editor=Floyd R, Sheppard A, de Barro P|title=Frontiers in Population Ecology|year=1996|publisher=CSIRO|location=Melbourne|pages=21–42|chapter=Why do so many Australian birds cooperate? Social evolution in the Corvida}}</ref> but has been observed in species as different as the [[Rifleman (bird)|Rifleman]] and [[Red Kite]]. Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. In birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.<ref name = "Gill"/> Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a [[division of labour]] in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|year=2006|title=Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3458|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|volume=273|issue=1592|pages=1375–83|pmid=16777726|pmc=1560291}}</ref>

The point at which chicks [[fledge]] varies dramatically. The chicks of the ''[[Synthliboramphus]]'' murrelets, like the [[Ancient Murrelet]], leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.<ref>Gaston AJ (1994). Ancient Murrelet (''Synthliboramphus antiquus''). In ''The Birds of North America, No. 132'' (A. Poole and F. Gill, Eds.). Philadelphia: The Academy of Natural Sciences; Washington, D.C.: The American Ornithologists' Union.</ref> Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly.

[[File:Reed warbler cuckoo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt= Small brown bird places an insect in the bill of much larger grey bird in nest|[[Reed Warbler]] raising a [[Common Cuckoo]], a [[brood parasite]].]]
[[Brood parasitism]], in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.<ref name = "brood">Davies N (2000). ''Cuckoos, Cowbirds and other Cheats''. [[T. & A. D. Poyser]]: London ISBN 0-85661-135-2</ref> After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either ''obligate brood parasites'', which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or ''non-obligate brood parasites'', which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of [[conspecific]]s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/beheco/8.2.153 | last1 = Sorenson | first1 = M | year = 1997 | title = Effects of intra- and interspecific brood parasitism on a precocial host, the canvasback, ''Aythya valisineria'' | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/2/153.pdf | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 153–61 }}</ref> One hundred bird species, including [[honeyguide]]s, [[icterid]]s, [[estrildid finch]]es and [[Black-headed Duck|ducks]], are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the [[cuckoo]]s.<ref name = "brood"/> Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Spottiswoode| first1=C.

==Ecology==

Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.<ref name = "flycatcher"/> While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the [[forest canopy]], others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be [[insectivore]]s, [[frugivore]]s, and [[nectarivore]]s. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or [[kleptoparasitism]]. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised [[scavenger]]s. [[Avivore]]s are animals that are specialized at predating birds.

Some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal.<ref name = "Clout">{{cite journal | last1 = Clout | first1 = M | last2 = Hay | first2 = J | year = 1989 | title = The importance of birds as browsers, pollinators and seed dispersers in New Zealand forests | url = http://www.newzealandecology.org/nzje/free_issues/NZJEcol12_s_27.pdf | journal = New Zealand Journal of Ecology | volume = 12 | pages = 27–33 }}</ref> Plants and pollinating birds often [[coevolution|coevolve]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Gary Stiles | first1=F. | title=Geographical Aspects of Bird-Flower Coevolution, with Particular Reference to Central America | journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden | volume=68 | issue=2 | pages=323–51 | year=1981 |doi= 10.2307/2398801 | jstor=2398801}}</ref> and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Temeles | first1 = E | last2 = Linhart | first2 = Y | last3 = Masonjones | first3 = M | last4 = Masonjones | first4 = H | year = 2002 | title = The Role of Flower Width in Hummingbird Bill Length–Flower Length Relationships | url = http://www.amherst.edu/~ejtemeles/Temeles%20et%20al%202002%20biotropica.pdf | journal = Biotropica | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 68–80 }}</ref>

Birds are often important to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the [[moa]]s were important browsers, as are the [[New Zealand Pigeon|Kereru]] and [[Kokako]] today.<ref name = "Clout"/> Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Bond | first1=William J. | last2=Lee | first2=William G. | last3=Craine | first3=Joseph M. | title=Plant structural defences against browsing birds: a legacy of New Zealand's extinct moas | journal=Oikos | volume=104 | pages=500–08 | year=2004 | doi = 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12720.x | issue=3}}</ref> Nesting [[seabird]]s may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of [[guano]], which may enrich the local soil<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wainright | first1 = S | last2 = Haney | first2 = J | last3 = Kerr | first3 = C | last4 = Golovkin | first4 = A | last5 = Flint | first5 = M | year = 1998 | title = Utilization of nitrogen derived from seabird guano by terrestrial and marine plants at St. Paul, Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, Alaska | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/DN8D70RYM7TUF42P.pdf | journal = Marine Ecology | volume = 131 | issue = 1| pages = 63–71 }}</ref> and the surrounding seas.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.3354/meps032247 | last1 = Bosman | first1 = A | last2 = Hockey | first2 = A | year = 1986 | title = Seabird guano as a determinant of rocky intertidal community structure | url = http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/32/m032p247.pdf | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 32 |pages = 247–57 }}</ref>

A wide variety of [[Avian ecology field methods]], including counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching avian ecology.

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Industrial-Chicken-Coop.JPG|thumb|alt= Two rows of cages in a dark barn with many white chickens in each cage|right|[[Industrial farming]] of [[chicken]]s]]

===Economic importance===
{{See also|Pet#Birds}}
Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called [[poultry]], are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, {{Nowrap|76 million}} tons of poultry and {{Nowrap|61 million}} tons of eggs were produced worldwide.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown|first1=Lester|title=Outgrowing the Earth: The Food Security Challenge in an Age of Falling Water Tables and Rising Temperatures |url= http://www.earth-policy.org/datacenter/xls/book_ote_ch3_2.xls|year=2005|publisher=earthscan |isbn=978-1-84407-185-2|chapter=3: Moving Up the Food Chain Efficiently. }}</ref> [[Chicken]]s account for much of human poultry consumption, though turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common. Many species of birds are also hunted for meat. Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas.

Other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the [[Down feather|down]] of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird feces ([[guano]]), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. The [[War of the Pacific]], sometimes called the Guano War, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/19cen/guanowar.html|title= The Guano War of 1865–1866|publisher= World History at KMLA|accessdate=18 December 2007}}</ref>

Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. Colourful birds, such as [[Parrot (family)|parrots]] and [[myna]]s, are bred in [[aviculture|captivity]] or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some [[endangered species]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0030605306000056 | last1 = Cooney | first1 = R | last2 = Jepson | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = The international wild bird trade: what's wrong with blanket bans? | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=409231 | journal = Oryx | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 18–23 }}</ref> [[Falcon]]s and [[cormorant]]s have long been used for [[Falconry|hunting]] and fishing, respectively.

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California Condor]] and [[Norfolk Parakeet]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1 = Butchart | first1 = S | last2 = Stattersfield | first2 = A | last3 = Collar | first3 = N | year = 2006 | title = How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url = http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal = Oryx | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 266–79 }}</ref>
