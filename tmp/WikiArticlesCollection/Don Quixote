{{lang|es|'''''Don Quixote'''''}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|_|k|iː|ˈ|h|oʊ|t|iː}}; {{IPA-es|ˈdoŋ kiˈxote|lang|Don Quijote-pronunciation-es 2.ogg}}), fully titled '''''The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha''''' ({{lang-es|El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha}}), is a Spanish novel by [[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]]. It follows the adventures of Alonso Quijano, an [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgo]] who reads so many [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric novels]] that he decides to set out to revive [[chivalry]], under the name ''Don Quixote''. He recruits a simple farmer, [[Sancho Panza]], as his squire, who often employs a unique, earthly wit in dealing with Don Quixote's rhetorical orations on antiquated [[knighthood]]. Don Quixote is met by the world as it is, initiating such themes as [[intertextuality]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[metatheatre]], and [[Representation (arts)|literary representation]].

Published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615, ''Don Quixote'' is considered the most influential work of literature from the [[Spanish Golden Age]] and the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, and one of the earliest canonical novels, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published. It has had major influence on the literary community, as evidenced by direct references in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Three Musketeers]] (1844) ''and [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]] (1884)''. In [[The 100 Best Books of All Time|a 2002 list]], ''Don Quixote'' was cited as the "best literary work ever written".<ref>{{cite web|last=Angelique|first=Chrisafis|title=Don Quixote is the world's best book say the world's top authors|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/may/08/humanities.books|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>

==Summary==

===Part 1===

====The First Sally====
Alonso Quijano, the protagonist of the novel, is a retired country gentleman nearing fifty years of age, living in an unnamed section of [[La Mancha]] with his niece and housekeeper. While mostly a rational man of sound reason, his reading of books of chivalry in excess has had a profound effect on him, leading to the distortion of his perception and the wavering of his mental faculties. In essence, he believes every word of these books of chivalry to be true though, for the most part, the content of these books is clearly fiction. Otherwise, his wits are intact. 

He decides to go out as a [[knight-errant]] in search of adventure. He dons an old suit of armour, renames himself "Don Quixote de la Mancha," and names his skinny horse "[[Rocinante]]". He designates Aldonza Lorenzo, a neighboring farm girl as his [[Courtly love|lady love]], renaming her [[Dulcinea|Dulcinea del Toboso]], while she knows nothing about this.

He sets out in the early morning and ends up at an inn, which he believes to be a castle. He asks the innkeeper, whom he thinks to be the lord of the castle, to dub him a knight. He spends the night holding vigil over his armor, where he becomes involved in a fight with [[Arriero|muleteers]] who try to remove his armor from the horse trough so that they can water their mules. The innkeeper then dubs him a knight to be rid of him, and sends him on his way. 

Don Quixote next "frees" a young boy who is tied to a tree and beaten by his master by making his master swear on the chivalric code to treat the boy fairly. The boy's beating is continued as soon as Quixote leaves. Don Quixote has a run-in with traders from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], who "insult" the imaginary Dulcinea, one of whom severely beats Don Quixote and leaves him on the side of the road. Don Quixote is found and returned to his home by a neighboring peasant.

====The Second Sally====
While Don Quixote is unconscious in his bed, his niece, the housekeeper, the parish [[curate]], and the local barber secretly burn most of the books of chivalry, and seal up his library pretending that a magician has carried it off. After a short period of feigning health, Don Quixote approaches his neighbor, [[Sancho Panza]], and asks him to be his squire, promising him governorship of an island. The uneducated Sancho agrees, and the pair sneak off in the early dawn. It is here that their series of famous adventures begin, starting with Don Quixote's attack on [[Tilting at windmills|windmills that he believes to be ferocious giants]]. 

The two next encounter a group of friars accompanying a lady in a carriage. They are heavily cloaked, as is the lady, to protect themselves from the hot climate and dust on the road. Don Quixote takes the friars to be enchanters who hold the lady captive. He knocks a friar from his horse, and is immediately challenged by an armed [[Basque people|Basque]] traveling with the company. As he has no shield, the Basque uses a pillow to protect himself, which saves him when Don Quixote strikes him. The combat ends with the lady leaving her carriage and commanding those traveling with her to "surrender" to Don Quixote.

=====The Pastoral Wanderings=====
Sancho and Don Quixote go on, and fall in with a group of goatherds. Don Quixote tells Sancho and the goatherds about the "Golden Age" of man, reminiscent of both [[Ages of man#Ovid's Four Ages|Ovid]] and the later [[Discourse on Inequality|Rousseau]] in which property does not exist, and men live in peace. The goatherds invite the Knight and Sancho to the funeral of Grisóstomo, once a student who left his studies to become a shepherd after reading [[Pastoral]] novels, seeking the shepherdess Marcela. At the funeral Marcela appears, delivering a long speech vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by Grisóstomo, claiming her own [[autonomy]] and freedom from expectations put on her by Pastoral [[clichés]]. 

She disappears into the woods, and Don Quixote and Sancho follow. Ultimately giving up, the two stop and dismount by a pond to rest. Some [[Galician people|Galicians]] arrive to water their ponies, and Rocinante (Don Quixote's horse) attempts to mate with the ponies. The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him, which Don Quixote takes as a threat and runs to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho leaving them in great pain.

=====The Adventures with Cardenio and Dorotea=====
After Don Quixote frees a group of [[galley slaves]], The Knight and Sancho wander into the [[Sierra Morena]], and there encounter the dejected [[Cardenio#Cardenio_in_Don_Quixote|Cardenio]]. Cardenio relates the first part of his [[Cardenio#Cardenio_in_Don_Quixote|story]], in which he falls deeply in love with his childhood friend Luscinda, and is hired as the companion to the Duke's son, leading to his friendship with the Duke's younger son, Don Fernando. Cardenio confides in Don Fernando his love for Luscinda and the delays in their engagement, caused by Cardenio's desire to keep with tradition. After reading Cardenio's poems praising Luscinda, Don Fernando falls in love with her. Don Quixote interrupts when Cardenio suggests that his beloved may have become unfaithful after the formulaic stories of spurned lovers in Chivalric novels.

[[File:Don Quijote and Sancho Panza.jpg|250px|thumb|''Don Quixote de la Mancha and Sancho Panza'', 1863, by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
In the course of their travels, the protagonists meet innkeepers, prostitutes, goatherds, soldiers, priests, escaped convicts, and scorned lovers. These encounters are magnified by Don Quixote’s imagination into chivalrous quests. Don Quixote’s tendency to intervene violently in matters which do not concern him, and his habit of not paying his debts, result in many privations, injuries, and humiliations (with Sancho often getting the worst of it). Finally, Don Quixote is persuaded to return to his home village. The author hints that there was a third quest, but says that records of it have been lost.

===Part 2===

====The Third Sally====
Although the two parts are now published as a single work, ''Don Quixote, Part Two'' was a sequel published ten years after the original novel. While Part One was mostly [[farce|farcical]], the second half is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception.

As ''Part Two'' begins, it is assumed that the literate classes of Spain have all read the first part of the history of Don Quixote and his squire. Cervantes's [[meta-fiction]]al device was to make even the characters in the story familiar with the publication of Part One, as well as with an actually published fraudulent Part Two. When strangers encounter the duo in person, they already know their famous history. A Duke and Duchess, and others, deceive Don Quixote for entertainment, setting forth a string of imagined adventures resulting in a series of practical jokes. Some of them are quite sadistic, and they put Don Quixote's sense of chivalry and his devotion to Dulcinea through many tests.

Even Sancho deceives him at one point. Pressured into finding Dulcinea, Sancho brings back three dirty and ragged peasant girls, and tells Don Quixote that they are Dulcinea and her ladies-in-waiting. When Don Quixote only sees the peasant girls, Sancho pretends that their derelict appearance results from an enchantment. 

Sancho later gets his comeuppance for this when, as part of one of the duke and duchess's pranks, the two are led to believe that the only method to release Dulcinea from her spell is for Sancho to give himself a surplus of three thousand lashes. Sancho naturally resists this course of action, leading to friction with his master. Under the duke's patronage, Sancho eventually gets a governorship, though it is false, and proves to be a wise and practical ruler; though this ends in humiliation as well.

Near the end, Don Quixote reluctantly sways towards sanity: an inn is just an inn, not a castle.

The lengthy untold "history" of Don Quixote's adventures in knight-errantry comes to a close after his battle with the Knight of the White Moon (actually a young man from Don Quixote's hometown) on the beach in [[Barcelona]], in which the reader finds him conquered. Bound by the rules of chivalry, Don Quixote submits to prearranged terms that the vanquished is to obey the will of the conqueror, which in this case, is that Don Quixote is to lay down his arms and cease his acts of chivalry for the period of one year (a duration in which he may be cured of his madness). Defeated and dejected, he and Sancho start their journey home.

Part Two of Don Quixote is often regarded as the birth of modern literature, as it explores the concept of a character understanding that he is being written about. This is a theme much explored in writings of the 20th Century.

Upon returning to his village, Don Quixote announces his plan to retire to the countryside and live the pastoral existence of shepherd, although his housekeeper, who has a more realistic view of the hard life of a shepherd, urges him to stay home and tend to his own affairs. Soon after, he retires to his bed with a deathly illness, possibly brought on by melancholy over his defeats and humiliations. One day, he awakes from a dream having fully recovered his sanity. 

Sancho tries to restore his faith, but Alonso Quixano, for that is his true name, can only renounce his previous existence and apologize for the harm he has caused. He dictates his will, which includes a provision that his niece will be disinherited if she marries a man who reads books of chivalry. After Alonso Quixano dies, the author emphasizes that there are no more adventures to relate, and that any further books about Don Quixote would be spurious.

==Meaning==
Various people have varying interpretations on the underlying meaning of the work.

Professor [[Tariq Ali]] suggests that by reading the preface and many paragraphs throughout the book in the context of the time and situation after the [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|expulsion of Jews]] and [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|Muslims from Spain]], it becomes clear that Cervantes was attacking the Catholic church, the Spanish Inquisition and the ruling Catholic Spanish nobility. Ali shows how Cervantes points to his Jewish ancestry and to the Jews' (and Muslims') plight in Spain and abroad following the expulsions and mass conversions.<ref>[http://www.cornell.edu/video/?videoID=869 Birth of Europe and the Expulsion of Jews and Muslims], a lecture by [[Tariq Ali]] at [[Cornell University]].  His explanation is highlighted in [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/protocols-of-the-elders-of-sodom-and-other-essays-by-tariq-ali-1764514.html a book review on 'Protocols of the Elders of Sodom and Other Essays' a compilation of Ali's recent work] in [[The Independent]].</ref>

In stark contrast [[Harold Bloom]] says that Don Quixote is the writing of radical nihilism and anarchy, preferring the glory of fantasy over the real world which includes imminent death, being "...the first modern novel"<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/dec/13/classics.miguelcervantes The Knight in the Mirror] a 2003 book report in [[The Guardian]] about [[Harold Bloom]]'s book.</ref>

[[Edith Grossman]], who wrote and published a highly acclaimed English translation of the novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, on the verge of both tragedy and comedy at the same time. 
::Grossman has stated "The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations... and how do I deal with that in my translation.
::I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it... so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep... As I grew older...my skin grew thicker... and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done... as Cervantes did it... by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise."<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muOZ6WdAg3o Edith Grossman about Don Quixote as tragedy and comedy] a discussion held in New York City on 5 February 2009 by [[Words Without Borders]]  ([[YouTube]])</ref>

The novel's structure is in [[episode|episodic]] form. It is written in the [[Picaresque novel|picaresco]] style of the late 16th century, and features reference other picaresque novels including ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' and ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. The full title is indicative of the tale's object, as ''ingenioso'' (Spanish) means "quick with inventiveness"<ref>{{lang|es|ingenio <sup>'''1'''</sup>}}, ''Real Academia Española''</ref> marking the transition of modern literature from [[Classical unities|Dramatic]] to thematic unity. The novel takes place over a long period of time, including many adventures all united by common themes of the nature of reality, reading, and dialogue in general.

Although [[farce|farcical]] on the surface, the novel, especially in its second half, is more serious and philosophical about the theme of deception. ''Quixote'' has served as an important thematic source not only in literature but also in much of art and music, inspiring works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. The contrasts between the tall, thin, fancy-struck, and idealistic Quixote and the fat, squat, world-weary Panza is a motif echoed ever since the book’s publication, and Don Quixote's imaginings are the butt of outrageous and cruel practical jokes in the novel. 

Even faithful and simple Sancho is unintentionally forced to deceive him at certain points. The novel is considered a satire of orthodoxy, veracity, and even nationalism. In going beyond mere storytelling to exploring the individualism of his characters, Cervantes helped move beyond the narrow literary conventions of the [[chivalric romance]] literature that he [[Parody|spoofed]], which consists of straightforward retelling of a series of acts that redound to the [[Knightly Virtues|knightly virtues]] of the hero.

From shepherds to tavern-owners and inn-keepers, the characterization in ''Don Quixote'' was groundbreaking. The character of Don Quixote became so well known in its time that the word ''[[Quixotism|quixotic]]'' was quickly adopted by many languages. Characters such as Sancho Panza and Don Quixote's steed, [[Rocinante]], are emblems of Western literary culture. The phrase "[[tilting at windmills]]" to describe an act of attacking imaginary enemies derives from an iconic scene in the book.

It stands in a unique position between medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]] and the modern novel. The former consist of disconnected stories featuring the same characters and settings with little exploration of the inner life of even the main character. The latter are usually focused on the psychological evolution of their characters. In Part I, Quixote imposes himself on his environment. By Part II, people know about him through "having read his adventures", and so, he needs to do less to maintain his image. By his deathbed, he has regained his sanity, and is once more "Alonso Quixano the Good".

When it was first published, ''Don Quixote'' was usually interpreted as a comic novel. After the [[French Revolution]] it was popular in part due to its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting—not comic at all. In the 19th century it was seen as a social commentary, but no one could easily tell "whose side Cervantes was on". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's innate idealism and nobility are viewed by the world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.

==Background==

===Sources===
Sources for ''Don Quixote'' include the Castillian novel ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', which had enjoyed great popularity throughout the 16th century. Another prominent source, which Cervantes evidently admires more, is ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'' which the priest describes in Chapter VI of ''Quixote'' as "the best book in the world."
The scene of the book burning gives us an excellent list of Cervantes's likes and dislikes about literature.

Cervantes makes a number of references to the Italian poem ''[[Orlando furioso]]''. In chapter 10 of the first part of the novel, Don Quixote says he must take the magical helmet of Mambrino, an episode from Canto I of ''Orlando'', and itself a reference to [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s ''[[Orlando innamorato]]''.<ref>''Don Quijote de la Mancha'', Miguel de Cervantes, Edicíon de Florencio Sevilla Arroyo, Área 2002 p.161</ref> The interpolated story in chapter 33 of Part four of the First Part is a retelling of a tale from Canto 43 of ''Orlando'', regarding a man who tests the fidelity of his wife.<ref>"Don Quixote" by Miguel de Cervantes, translated and annotated by Edith Grossman, p.272</ref>

Another important source appears to have been Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', one of the earliest known novels, a picaresque from late classical antiquity. The wineskins episode near the end of the interpolated tale "The Curious Impertinent" in chapter 35 of the first part of ''Don Quixote'' is a clear reference to Apuleius, and recent scholarship suggests that the moral philosophy and the basic trajectory of Apuleius's novel are fundamental to Cervantes's program.<ref>See chapter 2 of E. C. Graf's ''Cervantes and Modernity''.</ref> Similarly, many of both Sancho's adventures in Part II and proverbs throughout are taken from popular Spanish and Italian [[folklore]].

Cervantes's experiences as a [[galley slave]] in Algiers also influenced ''Quijote''.

===Spurious ''Second Part'' by Avellaneda===
It is not certain when Cervantes began writing ''Part Two'' of ''Don Quixote'', but he had probably not gotten much further than Chapter LIX by late July 1614. About September, however, a spurious Part Two, entitled ''Second Volume of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licenciado (doctorate) [[Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda]], of [[Tordesillas]]'', was published in [[Tarragona]] by an unidentified [[Aragon]]ese who was an admirer of [[Lope de Vega]], rival of Cervantes.<ref name="Ei">D. Eisenberg, "Cervantes, Lope and Avellaneda", ''Estudios cervantinos'' (Barcelona: Sirmio, 1991), pp. 119–41.</ref> 

Avellaneda's identity has been the subject of many theories, but there is no consensus as to who he was. In its prologue, the author gratuitously insulted Cervantes, who not surprisingly took offense and responded; the last half of Chapter LIX and most of the following chapters of Cervantes' ''Segunda Parte'' lend some insight into the effects upon him; Cervantes manages to work in some subtle digs at Avellaneda's own work, and in his preface to Part II, comes very near to criticizing Avellaneda directly.

In his introduction to ''The Portable Cervantes'', [[Samuel Putnam]], a noted translator of Cervantes' novel, calls Avellaneda's version "one of the most disgraceful performances in history".<ref>Cervantes, Miguel, [http://books.google.com/books?id=9eAOicE_b4AC&printsec=frontcover&dq=putnam+portable+cervantes&hl=en&ei=0A3QTfiaBIHz0gGF4aSfDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Portable Cervantes''], ed. Samuel Putnam (New York: Penguin, [1951] 1978), p. viii</ref>

The second part of Cervantes' ''Don Quixote'', finished as a direct result of the Avellaneda book, has come to be regarded by some literary critics<ref>{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Samuel|title=Introduction to The Portable Cervantes|year=1976|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0-14-015057-9|pages=14}}</ref> as superior to the first part, because of its greater depth of characterization, its discussions, mostly between Quixote and Sancho, on diverse subjects, and its philosophical insights.

===Other stories===
[[File:Quixo-panza.jpg|Don Quixote and Sancho Panza|thumb|250px|Don Quixote, his horse Rocinante and his squire Sancho Panza after an unsuccessful attack on a windmill. By [[Gustave Doré]].]]
''Don Quixote, Part One'' contains a number of stories which do not directly involve the two main characters, but which are narrated by some of the [[picaresque]] figures encountered by the Don and Sancho during their travels. The longest and best known of these is "El Curioso Impertinente" (the impertinently curious man), found in Part One, Book Four. This story, read to a group of travelers at an inn, tells of a [[Florence|Florentine]] nobleman, Anselmo, who becomes obsessed with testing his wife's fidelity, and talks his close friend [[Lothario]] into attempting to seduce her, with disastrous results for all. 

In ''Part Two'', the author acknowledges the criticism of his digressions in ''Part One'' and promises to concentrate the narrative on the central characters (although at one point he laments that his narrative muse has been constrained in this manner). Nevertheless, "Part Two" contains several back narratives related by peripheral characters.

Several abridged editions have been published which delete some or all of the extra tales in order to concentrate on the central narrative.<ref>An example is ''The Portable Cervantes'' (New York: Viking Penguin, 1949), which contains an abridged version of the Samuel Putnam translation.</ref>

==Style==

===Spelling and pronunciation===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Cervantes wrote his work in a form of [[Old Spanish language|Old Castilian]], the medieval form of the Spanish language. The language of ''Don Quixote'', although still containing [[archaisms]], is far more understandable to modern Spanish readers than is, for instance, the completely medieval Spanish of the ''[[Poema de mio Cid]]'', a kind of Spanish that is as different from Cervantes's language as [[Middle English]] is from [[Modern English]]. The Old Castilian language was also used to show the higher class that came with being a knight errant. 

In Don Quixote there are basically two different types of Castilian: Old Castilian is spoken only by Don Quixote, while the rest of the roles speak a modern version of Spanish. The Old Castilian of Don Quixote is a Humoristic resource - he copies the language spoken in the chivalric books that made him angry; and many times, when he talks nobody is able to understand him because his language is too old. This humorous effect is more difficult to see nowadays because the reader must be able to distinguish the two old versions of the language, but when the book was published it was much celebrated.

In Old Castilian the letter ''x'' represented the sound written with ''sh'' in modern English, so the name was originally pronounced "{{Respell|ki|SHOT|eh}} "{{IPA|[kiˈʃote]}}. However as Old Castilian became modern Spanish, the pronunciation of the sh sound changed, and came to be pronounced with a [[voiceless velar fricative]] sound like the [[Scots language|Scottish]] or German ''ch'' and today the Spanish pronunciation of "Quixote" is {{respell|ki|HO|teh}} {{IPA|[kiˈxote]}}. The original pronunciation is reflected in languages such as [[Astur-Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], French, Italian and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] that pronounce it with a "sh" or "ch" sound.

Today English speakers generally attempt something close to the modern Spanish pronunciation when saying ''Quixote'' (''Quijote''), as {{IPA|[dɒŋ kiːˈhoʊteɪ]}}, although the traditional English [[spelling pronunciation]] pronouncing the name with the value of the letter x in modern English is still sometimes used, resulting in {{IPA|/ˈkwɪksət/}} or {{IPA|/ˈkwɪksoʊt/}}. In [[Australian English]], the preferred pronunciation amongst members of the educated classes was {{IPA|/ˈkwɪksət/}} until well into the 1970s, as part of a tendency for the upper class to "anglicise its borrowing ruthlessly".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=P.

===Setting===
Cervantes' story takes place on the plains of [[La Mancha]], specifically the ''[[comarca]]'' of [[Campo de Montiel (Ciudad Real)|Campo de Montiel]].

{{quote|text=''En un lugar de La Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor.'' (Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, a gentleman lived not long ago, one of those who has a lance and ancient shield on a shelf and keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing.)|sign=Miguel de Cervantes|source=''Don Quixote'', Volume I, Chapter I (translated by [[Edith Grossman]])}}

The story also takes place in El Toboso where Don Quixote goes to seek Dulcinea's blessings.
The location of the village to which Cervantes alludes in the opening sentence of ''Don Quixote'' has been the subject of debate since its publication over four centuries ago. Indeed, Cervantes deliberately omits the name of the village, giving an explanation in the final chapter:

{{quote|text=Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentlemen of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer.|sign=Miguel de Cervantes|source=''Don Quixote'', Volume II, Chapter 74}}

In 2004, a multidisciplinary team of academics from [[Complutense University]], led by Francisco Parra Luna, Manuel Fernández Nieto and Santiago Petschen Verdaguer, deduced that the village was that of [[Villanueva de los Infantes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article404423.ece|title=To Quixote's village at the speed of a nag|publisher=Times Online}}</ref> Their findings were published in a paper titled ''"'El Quijote' como un sistema de distancias/tiempos: hacia la localización del lugar de la Mancha"'', which was later published as a book: ''El enigma resuelto del Quijote''. The result was replicated in two subsequent investigations: ''"La determinación del lugar de la Mancha como problema estadístico"'' and "The Kinematics of the Quixote and the Identity of the 'Place in La Mancha'".<ref>{{cite journal |title=La determinación del lugar de la Mancha como problema estadístico|trans_title= |location=Valencia |publisher=Department of Statistics, [[University of Malaga]] |language=Spanish |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate= | url=http://dmle.cindoc.csic.es/pdf/BEIO_2006_22_01_04.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Kinematics of the Quixote and the Identity of the "Place in La Mancha" |pages=7 |location=Valencia |publisher=Department of Applied Mathematics, [[University of Valencia]] |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate= |url=http://www.uv.es/pla/Quixote/Kinematics2.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>

===Language===
Because of its widespread influence, ''Don Quixote'' also helped cement the modern Spanish language. The opening sentence of the book created a classic Spanish cliché with the phrase {{lang|es| "de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme" }} ("whose name I do not wish to recall"): {{lang|es| "En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no hace mucho tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor."}} ("In a village of La Mancha, whose name I do not wish to recall, there lived, not very long ago, one of those gentlemen with a lance in the lance-rack, an ancient shield, a skinny old horse, and a fast greyhound.")

The novel's farcical elements make use of punning and similar verbal playfulness. Character-naming in ''Don Quixote'' makes ample figural use of contradiction, inversion, and irony, such as the names ''[[Rocinante]]''<ref>{{lang|es|rocinante: deriv. of ''rocín'', work horse; colloq., brusque labourer; rough, unkempt man. ''Real Academia Española.''}}</ref> (a reversal) and ''[[Dulcinea]]'' (an allusion to illusion), and the word {{lang|es|''quixote''}} itself, possibly a pun on {{lang|es|''quijada''}} (jaw) but certainly {{lang|es|''cuixot''}} (Catalan: thighs), a reference to a horse's [[rump (animal)|rump]].<ref>quijote<sup>'''1.2'''</sup>: rump or haunch.

As a military term, the word ''quijote'' refers to ''[[cuisses]]'', part of a full suit of [[plate armour]] protecting the thighs. The Spanish suffix ''-ote'' denotes the augmentative—for example, ''grande'' means large, but ''grandote'' means extra large. Following this example, ''Quixote'' would suggest 'The Great Quijano', a play on words that makes much sense in light of the character's delusions of grandeur. 

''La Mancha'' is a region of Spain, but ''mancha'' (Spanish word) means spot, mark, stain. Translators such as [[John Ormsby]] have declared La Mancha to be one of the most desertlike, unremarkable regions of Spain, the least romantic and fanciful place that one would imagine as the home of a courageous knight.

In July 1604, Cervantes sold the rights of ''El ingenioso hidalgo don Quixote de la Mancha'' (known as ''Don Quixote, Part I'') to the publisher-bookseller Francisco de Robles for an unknown sum. License to publish was granted in September, the printing was finished in December, and the book came out on 16 January 1605.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/bomarch/bomnov05.html | title=Don Quixote | publisher=[[King's College London]] | first=Hugh |last=Cahill | accessdate=2011-01-14}}</ref><ref name="BrO">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Cervantes, Miguel de|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=2002}}<br />J.

The novel was an immediate success. The majority of the 400 copies of the first [[Edition (book)|edition]] were sent to the [[New World]], with the publisher hoping to get a better price in the Americas.<ref name=Histoire>{{cite web |url= |title=Don Quichotte', best-seller mondial |author=Serge Gruzinski, teacher at the [[EHESS]] |date=July–August 2007 |work=n°322 |page=30 |publisher=[[L'Histoire]] |accessdate= }}</ref> Although most of them disappeared in a shipwreck near [[La Havana]], approximately 70 copies reached [[Lima]], from where they were sent to [[Cuzco]] in the heart of the defunct [[Inca Empire]].<ref name=Histoire/>

No sooner was it in the hands of the public than preparations were made to issue derivative (pirated) editions. "Don Quixote" had been growing in favour, and its author's name was now known beyond the [[Pyrenees]]. By August 1605 there were two Madrid editions, two published in Lisbon, and one in [[Valencia]]. A second edition was produced with additional copyrights for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and Portugal, which publisher Francisco de Robles secured.<ref name="Orm">J. Ormsby, [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/c/cervantes/c41d/preface1.html "About Cervantes and Don Quixote"]</ref> 

Sale of these publishing rights deprived Cervantes of further financial profit on ''Part One.'' In 1607, an edition was printed in [[Brussels]]. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet demand with a third edition, a seventh publication in all, in 1608. Popularity of the book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller issued an Italian edition in 1610. Yet another Brussels edition was called for in 1611.<ref name="BrO" /> In total, the novel is believed to have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.<ref>http://www.vanderbilt.edu/magazines/vanderbilt-magazine/archives/images/inclass_f05.pdf</ref>

In 1613, Cervantes published the ''Novelas Ejemplares'', dedicated to the [[Maecenas]] of the day, the [[Conde de Lemos]]. Eight and a half years after ''Part One'' had appeared, we get the first hint of a forthcoming ''Segunda Parte'' (Part Two). "You shall see shortly," Cervantes says, "the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza."<ref>See also the introduction to Cervantes, Miguel de (1984) ''Don Quixote'', Penguin p.18, for a discussion of Cervantes's statement in response to Avellaneda's attempt to write a sequel.</ref> ''Don Quixote, Part Two'', published by the same press as its predecessor, appeared late in 1615, and quickly reprinted in Brussels and Valencia (1616) and Lisbon (1617). Part two capitalizes on the potential of the first while developing and diversifying the material without sacrificing familiarity. Many people agree that it is richer and more profound.{{Who|date=February 2013}} Parts One and Two were published as one edition in Barcelona in 1617. Historically, Cervantes's work has been said to have “smiled [[Spanish chivalry|Spain’s chivalry]] away”, suggesting that Don Quixote as a chivalric satire contributed to the demise of Spanish Chivalry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prestage|first=Edgar| title=Chivalry|year=1928|pages=110}}</ref>

There are many translations of the book, and it has been adapted many times in shortened versions. Many derivative editions were also written at the time, as was the custom of envious or unscrupulous writers. Seven years after the ''Parte Primera'' appeared, ''Don Quixote'' had been translated into French, German, Italian, and English, with the first French translation of 'Part II' appearing in 1618, and the first English translation in 1620. One abridged adaptation, authored by Agustín Sánchez, runs slightly over 150 pages, cutting away about 750 pages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://belgrado.cervantes.es/Biblioteca/Fichas/Cervantes.%20Saavedra,%20Miguel%20de%20(1547-1616)_114_58_1.shtml |title=Library catalogue of the Cervantes Institute of Belgrade |accessdate=2012-12-26|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070814074311/http://belgrado.cervantes.es/Biblioteca/Fichas/Cervantes.%20Saavedra,%20Miguel%20de%20%281547-1616%29_114_58_1.shtml|archivedate=14 August 2007}}</ref>

[[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton]]'s English translation of the ''First Part'' appeared in 1612. Shelton is a somewhat elusive figure: some claim Shelton was actually a friend of Cervantes, although there is no credible evidence to support this claim. Although Shelton's version is cherished by some, according to [[John Ormsby]] and [[Samuel Putnam]], it was far from satisfactory as a carrying over of Cervantes's text.<ref name="Orm" /> Shelton's translation of the novel's ''Second Part'' appeared in 1620.

Near the end of the 17th century, [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]], a nephew of poet [[John Milton]], published what Putnam considered the worst English translation. The translation, as literary critics claim, was not based on Cervantes' text but mostly upon a French work by Filleau de Saint-Martin and upon notes which Thomas Shelton had written.

Around 1700, a version by [[Pierre Antoine Motteux]] appeared. Motteux's translation enjoyed lasting popularity; it was reprinted as the [[Modern Library]] Series edition of the novel until recent times.<ref name="peabody">Sieber, Harry. [http://quixote.mse.jhu.edu/Translation.html "''Don Quixote'' in Translation".] ''The Don Quixote Exhibit'', Tour 2, Chapter 5. George Peabody Library. 1996. Retrieved 26 December 2012.</ref> Nonetheless, future translators would find much to fault in Motteux's version: Samuel Putnam criticized "the prevailing slapstick quality of this work, especially where [[Sancho Panza]] is involved, the obtrusion of the obscene where it is found in the original, and the slurring of difficulties through omissions or expanding upon the text". John Ormsby considered Motteux's version "worse than worthless", and denounced its "infusion of Cockney flippancy and facetiousness" into the original.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://cervantes.tamu.edu/english/ctxt/DonQ-JohnOrmsby/DonQ-JohnOrmsby.html|title=Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, Translated by John Ormsby|chapter=Translator's Preface: About this translation}}</ref>

A translation by Captain [[John Stevens (translator)|John Stevens]], which revised Thomas Shelton's version, also appeared in 1700, but its publication was overshadowed by the simultaneous release of Motteux's translation.<ref name="peabody"/>

In 1742, the [[Charles Jervas]] translation appeared, posthumously. Through a printer's error, it came to be known, and is still known, as "the Jarvis translation". It was the most scholarly and accurate English translation of the novel up to that time, but future translator John Ormsby points out in his own introduction to the novel that the Jarvis translation has been criticized as being too stiff. Nevertheless, it became the most frequently reprinted translation of the novel until about 1885. Another 18th century translation into English was that of [[Tobias Smollett]], himself a novelist. Like the Jarvis translation, it continues to be reprinted today.

Most modern translators take as their model the 1885 translation by [[John Ormsby]]. It is said{{by whom|date=December 2012}} that his translation was the most honest of all translations, without expansions upon the text or changing of the proverbs.
 
An expurgated children's version, under the title ''The Story of Don Quixote'', was published in 1922 (available on [[Project Gutenberg]]). It leaves out the risqué sections as well as chapters that young readers might consider dull, and embellishes a great deal on Cervantes's original text. The title page actually gives credit to the two editors as if they were the authors, and omits any mention of Cervantes.<ref>http://www.gutenberg.org/files/29468/29468-h/29468-h.htm</ref>

The most widely read English-language translations of the mid-20th century are by [[Samuel Putnam]] (1949), [[J. M. Cohen]] (1950; [[Penguin Classics]]), and [[Walter Starkie]] (1957). The last English translation of the novel in the 20th century was by [[Burton Raffel]], published in 1996. The 21st century has already seen four new translations of the novel into English. The first is by [[John D. Rutherford]] and the second by [[Edith Grossman]]. Reviewing the novel in the ''New York Times'', [[Carlos Fuentes]] called Grossman's translation a "major literary achievement"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E1DE1431F931A35752C1A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |first=Carlos| last=Fuentes |title=Tilt |work=New York Times| date=2 November 2003}}</ref> and another called it the "most transparent and least impeded among more than a dozen English translations going back to the 17th century."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DD1438F937A25752C1A9659C8B63 |title=Beholding Windmills and Wisdom From a New Vantage |work=[[New York Times]]|date=14 November 2003|first=Richard|last=Eder}}</ref>

In 2005, the year of the novel's 400th anniversary, [[Tom Lathrop]] published a new English translation of the novel, based on a lifetime of specialized study of the novel and its history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~cervant/csa/artics08/McGraths08.pdf|title=Reviews: ''Don Quixote'' trans. Tom Lathrop|publisher=[[H-Net]]|first=Michael J|last=McGrath|year=2007}}</ref>
The fourth translation of the 21st century was released in 2006 by former Spanish professor James Montgomery, 26 years after he had begun it, in an attempt to "recreate the sense of the original as closely as possible, though not at the expense of Cervantes' literary style."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~cervant/csa/artics10/McGrathS10.pdf|title=Reviews: ''Don Quixote'' trans.
