==History==
Cantor Fitzgerald, formed in 1945 by [[B. Gerald Cantor|Bernard Gerald Cantor]] and John Fitzgerald, as an investment bank and brokerage business, became known for its computer-based bond brokerage{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}, the quality of its institutional distribution business model{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}, and as the market’s premier dealer of government securities.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In 1965, Cantor Fitzgerald began “large block” sales/trading of equities for institutional customers.  Cantor Fitzgerald became the world’s first electronic marketplace for U.S. Government Securities in 1972 and shortly thereafter, the firm became the first to offer worldwide screen brokerage services in U.S. Government Securities in 1983.

In 1991, [[Howard Lutnick]] was named President & CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and Chairman in Cantor Fitzgerald L.P. in 1996.

On September 11, 2001, the firm lost 658 of its 960 New York employees in the World Trade Center attacks. Since 9/11, the firm worked to rebuild and establish a new global headquarters in Manhattan. Two years after 9/11, Cantor Fitzgerald launched its fixed income sales and trading group.

In 2006 the U.S. Federal Reserve added Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to its Primary Dealer list.  In 2009, Cantor Fitzgerald launched Cantor Prime Services, a provider of multi-asset, Prime Brokerage platform exploiting the clearing, financing and execution capabilities of the firm.

Cantor Fitzgerald began building its real estate business with the launch of Cantor Commercial Real Estate in 2010.

On September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25 percent of the firm's profits for the next five years, and committed to paying for ten years of health care, for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, [[eSpeed]], and TradeSpark employees (profits which would otherwise have been distributed to the Cantor Fitzgerald [[Partnership|partners]]).<ref name="msnbc">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39038466/ns/us_news-911_nine_years_later/ns/us_news-911_nine_years_later?GT1=43001</ref> In 2006, the company completed its promise, having paid a total of $180&nbsp;million<ref name="msnbc" /> (and an additional $17&nbsp;million from a relief fund run by Lutnick's sister, Edie).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/cantor-fitzgerald/ |title=The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Cantor Fitzgerald: The firm that lost the most. |date=August 27, 2011 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Jessica Pressler}}</ref>

Before the attacks, Cantor handled about one-quarter of the daily transactions in the multi-trillion dollar [[treasury security]] market. Cantor has since rebuilt its [[infrastructure]], thanks in part to the efforts of its London office,<ref>http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23985273-the-city-firm-that-rose-from-the-911-ashes.do</ref> and now has its headquarters in [[midtown Manhattan]]. The company's effort to regain its footing is the subject of [[Tom Barbash]]'s 2003 book ''On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, and 9/11: A Story of Loss and Renewal''.

On September 2, 2004, Cantor filed a [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuit]] against the [[Saudi Arabia|Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] for allegedly providing money to the hijackers and Al Qaeda, one of a number of organizations to do so.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3646548.stm WTC agency sues Saudis over 9/11], BBC News Online, September 11, 2004</ref> It was later joined in the suit by the [[Port Authority of New York]].<ref>[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1094073283938 Port Authority to Join Suit Against Saudi Arabia Over 9/11 Attack], Associated Press, September 13, 2004</ref> Most of the claims against Saudi Arabia were dismissed on January 18, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Glovin|first=David|title=Saudi Arabia Wins Dismissal From Sept. 11 Lawsuits (Update1)|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aFC0nwCtmJyc&refer=top_world_news|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=19 October 2012|date=18 January 2005}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund was founded in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.  The Relief Fund has raised and distributed $180 million to over 800 families and 932 children of the victims of that tragedy. In the past few years, the Relief Fund's expanded scope has included such natural disasters as the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the tsunami of 2004 and the earthquake in Haiti as well as the wounded members of the U.S. military. In addition, the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund supports a wide variety of other charitable organizations providing assistance to those in need.

Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick and the partners of Cantor Fitzgerald underwrite all the expenses of the fund so that 100 percent of every dollar raised goes directly to those in need. The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, administered by its Co-Founder and Executive Director, Edie Lutnick has raised and distributed over $250 million in memory of the 658 men and women who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald and lost their lives on September 11, 2001.<ref>http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2013.2_Apr/Making%20a%20Difference/LEADERS-Edie-Lutnick-Cantor-Fitzgerald-Relief-Fund.html</ref>

Edie Lutnick is also the Author of “An Unbroken Bond: The Untold Story of How the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald Families Faced the Tragedy of 9/11 and Beyond,” in which 100% of the proceeds from the sale of the book benefit The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and the charities it assists.

The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund provided $10 million to families affected by [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Howard Lutnick and the Relief Fund "adopted" 19 elementary schools in impacted areas, distributing $1,000 prepaid debit cards to each family from the schools.<ref>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-25/cantor-fitzgerald-robin-hood-sandy-aid-tops-70-million.html#disqus_thread</ref>

===Charity Day===

Each year, on September 11, Cantor Fitzgerald and its affiliate BGC Partners donate 100% of their revenue to charitable causes on their annual Charity Day.  Charity Day was originally established to raise money for the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund to assist the families of Cantor employees who perished in the World Trade Center attacks. The company now marks the day by reaching out to help others, turning a tragic day into one that is positive and uplifting. Since Charity Day’s inception, the firm has raised $101 million for charities globally.<ref>http://www.looktothestars.org/news/10782-princes-break-trading-world-record-as-celebs-raise-12m-for-charity</ref><ref>http://news.yahoo.com/michael-j-fox-participates-9-11-charity-event-112705175.html</ref><ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/ryan-lochte-cantor-fitzgerald-charity_n_1877506.html?utm_hp_ref=impact</ref><ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edie-lutnick/honor-the-past-by-buildin_b_1873642.html</ref><ref>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012/09/11/many-use-911-anniversary-to-look-forward/57742560/1</ref><ref>http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/trending/post/_/id/7845/venus-lochte-upton-help-911-charity-day</ref>
