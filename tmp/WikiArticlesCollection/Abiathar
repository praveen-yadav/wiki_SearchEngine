'''Abiathar ''' (אביתר, Ebyathar, Evyatar, ''the [divine] father is pre-eminent'' or ''father of plenty''), in the [[Hebrew Bible]], son of [[Ahimelech]] or Ahijah, [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] at [[Nob, Israel|Nob]],<ref name=Chisholm>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abiathar|volume=1|page=62}}</ref> the fourth in descent from [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] (1 Sam. 23:6) and the last of Eli's House. The only one of the priests to escape from Saul's massacre, he fled to David at [[Keilah]], taking with him the [[ephod]] and other priestly regalies (1 Sam. 22:20 f., 23:6, 9). He was of great service to David, especially at the time of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] (2 Sam. 15:24, 29, 35, 20:25). In 1 Kings 4:4 [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] and Abiathar are found acting together as priests under Solomon. In 1 Kings 1:7, 19, 25, however, Abiathar appears as a supporter of Adonijah, and in 2:22 and 26 it is said that he was deposed by Solomon and banished to Anathoth.  In 2 Sam. 8:17 ''Abiathar, the son of Achimelech'' should be read, with the Syriac, for ''Achimelech, the son of Abiathar.'' A similar confusion occurs in [[Gospel of Mark]] 2:26:<ref name=Chisholm/><ref name=EB/> In reporting Jesus' words, [[Mark the Evangelist|the evangelist]] used the name Abiathar when we might expect to see Jesus mention his father [[Ahimelech]].<ref name=EB/> Suggestions made to resolve the difficulty — e.g. that father and son each bore the same double name, or that Abiathar officiated during his father's lifetime and in his father's stead—have been supported by great names, but have not been fully accepted.<ref name=EB>"Abiathar", ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref>

When his father and the priests of Nob were slain on the command of Saul, Abiathar escaped, bearing with him the [[ephod]]. Rabbinical literature that linked the later extermination of the male descendants of David with the priests of Nob, also link the survival of David's descendant [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash ]]with that of Abiathar. (Sanh. 95b)<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=265&letter=A&pid=0 Jewish Encyclopedia p.56]</ref>

Abiathar joined David, who was then in the cave of [[Adullam]] (1 Sam. 22:20-23; 23:6). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). When David ascended the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], Abiathar was appointed High Priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the "king's counselor" (1 Chr. 27:33-34). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made High Priest. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia Abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the [[Urim]] and Thummin could not be consulted.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=265&letter=A&pid=0 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' p.56]</ref> Another version says he was Co-Pontiff with Zadok during King David. He supported Prince Adonijah over Prince [[Solomon]], and was deposed by him and exiled in [[Anathoth]].

These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by [[Solomon]], because he took part in the attempt to raise [[Adonijah]] to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). Zadok now became sole high priest. Abiathar's removal from the Priesthood fulfilled that other part of the curse on the House of Eli—that the Priesthood would pass out of the House of Eli.

==Later use of the name==

In Georgian traditions, [[Abiathar and Sidonia]] were a legendary [[Jewish]] priest of [[Mtskheta]] and his daughter. Abiathar is said to have been the first person [[Saint Nino]] converted to [[Christianity]].

"Abiathar" (pronounced "Eviatar" in Modern Hebrew) is sometimes used a male given name in contemporary [[Israel]] (see [[Eviatar Banai]], [[Eviatar Zerubavel]], [[Eviatar Manor]]).
