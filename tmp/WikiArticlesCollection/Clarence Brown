'''Clarence Brown''' (May 10, 1890 &ndash; August 17, 1987) was an American film director.

==Early life==
Born in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], to a cotton manufacturer, Brown moved to the South when he was 11. He attended [[Knoxville High School (Tennessee)|Knoxville High School]]<ref>John Shearer, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/may/28/052810knoxhighbox2/ Famous alumni from Knoxville High School], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', May 28, 2010</ref> and the [[University of Tennessee]], both in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], graduating from the university at the age of 19 with two degrees in [[engineering]]. An early fascination in automobiles led Brown to a job with the [[Stevens-Duryea]] Company, then to his own Brown Motor Car Company in [[Alabama]]. He later abandoned the car dealership after developing an interest in motion pictures around 1913. He was hired by the Peerless Studio at [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], and became an assistant to the French-born director [[Maurice Tourneur]].

==Career==
After serving in [[World War I]], Brown was given his first co-directing credit (with Tourneur) for ''The Great Redeemer'' (1920). Later that year, he directed a major portion of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1920 American film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' after Tourneur was injured in a fall.

Brown moved to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] in 1924, and then to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], where he stayed until the mid-1950s. At MGM he was one of the main directors of their female stars&ndash;he directed [[Joan Crawford]] six times and [[Greta Garbo]] seven.

He not only made the difficult transition from silent cinema to sound cinema, but thrived there, proving himself to be a 'actor's director': listening to his actors', respecting their instincts, and often incorporating their suggestions into scenes. In doing so, Brown created believable, under-played, naturalistic dialogue scenes stripped of melodrama, pulsing with the honest rhythms of real-life conversation. He was nominated five times (see below) for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as a director, and once as a producer, but never received an Oscar. However, he did win Best Foreign Film for ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' starring Garbo at the 1935 [[Venice International Film Festival]].

Brown's films gained a total of 38 Academy Award nominations and earned nine Oscars. Brown himself received six Academy Award nominations and in 1949 won the British Academy Award for the film version of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Intruder in the Dust (1949 film)|Intruder in the Dust]].

In 1957, Brown was awarded [http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php The George Eastman Award], given by [[George Eastman House]] for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

Brown retired a wealthy man due to his real estate investments, but refused to watch new movies, as he feared they might cause him to restart his career. In the 1970s, Brown became a much-sought guest lecturer on the film-festival circuit, thanks in part to his connection with Garbo.

The Clarence Brown Theater, on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], is named in his honor. He is tied with [[Robert Altman]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] for the most Academy Award nominations for best director without a single win.
