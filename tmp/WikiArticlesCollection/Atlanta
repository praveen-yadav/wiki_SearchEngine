In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref name=W&ARR>{{cite web | title = Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad | work=About North Georgia | publisher=Golden Ink | url = http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html | accessdate =November 12, 2007}}</ref> The initial route was to run southward from Chattanooga to a terminus east of the [[Chattahoochee River]], which would then be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the "zero milepost" was driven into the ground in what is now [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]]. A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as “Terminus,” and later as “Thrasherville” after a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the area.<ref>[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm Thrasherville State Historical Marker], retrieved on November 13, 2009.</ref> By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents, and was renamed "Marthasville" to honor the [[Wilson Lumpkin|Governor’s]] daughter.<ref name=shorthistory>{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1782–1859 | publisher=CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date = September 22, 2007 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history1.htm | accessdate =December 1, 2007}}</ref> [[J.

In 1864, following the capture of Chattanooga, the [[Union Army]] moved southward and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army [[battle]]s, culminating with the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and a four-month-long siege of the city by the [[Union Army]] under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. On September 1, 1864, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] made the decision to retreat from Atlanta, ordering all public buildings and possible assets to the Union Army destroyed. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, General Sherman ordered the city’s civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, in preparation of the Union Army’s [[Sherman’s March to the Sea|march to Savannah]], Sherman ordered Atlanta to be burned to the ground, sparing only the city’s churches and hospitals.<ref name=shorthistory2>{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1860–1864 | publisher=CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date= September 22, 2007 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history2.htm | accessdate =December 1, 2007}}</ref>
[[File:AtlantaDuringCivilWar.jpg|thumb|left|Atlanta in ruins during the Civil War, 1864]]
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. Due to the city’s superior [[rail transportation]] network, the [[List of U.S. state historical capitals|state capital]] was moved to Atlanta from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] in 1868.<ref>{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Edwin L. | title = The Story of Georgia’s Capitols and Capital Cities | publisher=Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia | url = http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 | accessdate =November 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}</ref> In the 1880 Census, Atlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia’s largest city.
Beginning in the 1880s, [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ‘‘[[Atlanta Constitution]]’’ newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "[[New South]]" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now [[History of Georgia Tech|Georgia Tech]]) and the city’s black colleges had established the city as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]], which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South’s development to the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F40813FB3C5811738DDDA10894DE405B8585F0D3|title=The South: Vast Resources, Rapid Development, Wonderful Opportunities for Capital and Labor...|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1895-06-08}}</ref>

During the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta experienced a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades’ time, Atlanta’s population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs; the city’s skyline emerged with the construction of the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable]], [[Flatiron Building (Atlanta)|Flatiron]], [[J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building|Empire]], and [[Candler Building (Atlanta)|Candler]] buildings; and [[Sweet Auburn]] emerged as a center of black commerce. However, the period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1906atlantaraceriot.org/|title=Atlanta Race Riot | publisher=The Coalition to Remember the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot |accessdate=September 6, 2006}}</ref> In 1915, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish-American factory superintendent, convicted of murder, was hanged by a [[lynch mob]], drawing attention to [[antisemitism in the United States]].<ref>Klapper, Melissa, R., PhD.

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the [[film premiere]] of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta’s [[Margaret Mitchell]]. The film's legendary producer, [[David O. Selznick]], as well as the film's stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], and [[Olivia de Havilland]] attended the gala event at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]], but Oscar winner [[Hattie McDaniel]], an African American, was barred from the event due to the color of her skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind |title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone With The Wind |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref>

Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during [[World War II]] due the city’s war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network, and military bases, leading to rapid growth in the city's population and economy. In the 1950s, the city’s newly constructed freeway system allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs.

Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been particularly "southern”—because Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a [[Aristocracy (class)|patrician]] southern seaport like [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] or [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], many of the city’s landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest.<ref name="Gournay"/>
[[File:Midtown HDR Atlanta.jpg|thumb|The skyline of Midtown (viewed from [[Piedmont Park]]) emerged with the construction of modernist [[Colony Square]] in 1972.]]
During the Cold War era, Atlanta embraced global modernist trends, especially regarding commercial and institutional architecture. Examples of [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] include the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza]] (1976), [[Georgia-Pacific Tower]] (1982), the [[State of Georgia Building]] (1966), and the [[Atlanta Marriott Marquis]] (1985). In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as [[One Atlantic Center]] (1987), [[191 Peachtree Tower]] (1991), and the [[Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta]] (1992). Also completed during the era is Atlanta’s tallest skyscraper, the [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]] (1992), which, at {{convert|1023|ft|m|0}}, is the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|61st-tallest building in the world]] and the 9th-tallest building in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001338.html|title=World’s Tallest Buildings | publisher=Infoplease |accessdate=June 26, 2007}}</ref> The city’s embrace of modern architecture, however, translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, including the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable Building]] (1892-1971), [[Terminal Station (Atlanta)|Terminal Station]] (1905-1972), and the [[Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System#The Carnegie Library|Carnegie Library]] (1902-1977).

Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The [[gentrification of Atlanta]] has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through city’s the east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]]. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, [[gentrification]] expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. Gentrification was also aided by the [[Atlanta Housing Authority]]'s eradication of the city’s public housing.<ref>{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_4_atlanta-public-housing.html |title=Atlanta's Public-Housing Revolution by Howard Husock, City Journal Autumn 2010 |publisher=City-journal.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> The gentrification of the city’s neighborhoods has been the topic of social commentary, including ''[[The Atlanta Way (film)|The Atlanta Way]]'', a documentary detailing the negative effects gentrification has had on the city and its inhabitants.

[[Religion in Atlanta|Religion]], while historically centered around [[Protestant Christianity]], now involves many faiths as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. While Protestant Christianity still maintains a strong presence in the city, in recent decades Catholicism has gained a strong foothold due to migration patterns.

Atlanta began as a railroad town and [[logistics]] has remained a major component of the city’s economy to this day. Atlanta is an important rail junction and contains major [[classification yard]]s for [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]].

Information technology, an economic sector that includes publishing, software development, entertainment and data processing has, garnered a larger percentage of Atlanta's economic output. Indeed, as of 2013, Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of information technology jobs in the United States, numbering 85,000. Atlanta also ranks as the sixth-fastest growing city for information technology jobs, with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 16,000 jobs.

Compared to its peer cities, Atlanta’s economy has been disproportionately affected by the [[2007–2012 global financial crisis|2008 financial crisis]] and the subsequent recession. The city’s economic problems are displayed in its elevated unemployment rate, declining real income levels, and depressed housing market.<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/business-boosters-admit-atlanta-1464295.html, “Business boosters admit Atlanta in ‘crisis’ amid effort to boost city’s economy”, Greg Bluestein, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]</ref><ref>[http://www.ajc.com/opinion/new-olympic-moment-1448221.html, New Olympic moment, Christopher B.

Atlanta, while very much in the South, has a culture that is no longer strictly [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]]. This is because in addition to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., many recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the U.S.]] have chosen to make the city their home, making Atlanta one of the most [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garner |first=Marcus K. |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html |title=Foreign-born population continues to grow in metro Atlanta |publisher=ajc.com |date=December 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}</ref> Thus, although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta’s cultural fabric, it is mostly the backdrop to one of the nation’s leading international cities.

=== Arts and theater ===
{{Main|Arts in Atlanta}}
Atlanta is one of few United States cities with permanent, professional, resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera ([[Atlanta Opera]]), ballet ([[Atlanta Ballet]]), music ([[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]]), and theater (the [[Alliance Theatre]]). Atlanta also attracts many touring Broadway acts, concerts, shows, and exhibitions catering to a variety of interests. Atlanta’s performing arts district is concentrated in [[Midtown Atlanta]] at the [[Woodruff Arts Center]], which is home to the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Alliance Theatre]]. The city also frequently hosts touring Broadway acts, especially at The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]], a historic landmark that is among the highest grossing theatres of its size.<ref>"1988: ‘‘Performance’’ magazine names the Fox Theatre the number one grossing theatre in the 3,000–5,000 seat category with the most events, the greatest box office receipts, and the highest attendance in the U.S." and "2009: Billboard magazine names the Fox the No. 1 non-residency theatre for the decade with 5,000 seats or less." on [http://www.foxtheatre.org/foxtimeline.aspx ‘‘Timeline’’, Fox Theatre website]</ref>

The city’s lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found that Atlanta’s heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treenextdoor.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=148&Itemid=179 |title=Changes in Atlanta’s Tree Canopy |publisher=Treenextdoor.org |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}</ref> However, the problem is being addressed by community organizations and city government: [[Trees Atlanta]], a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 75,000 shade trees in the city,<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher=Trees Atlanta | url = http://www.treesatlanta.org/aboutus.html | accessdate =September 28, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922033545/http://www.treesatlanta.org/aboutus.html |archivedate = September 20, 2010}}</ref> while Atlanta’s government has awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees.<ref name="publicbroadcasting.net"/>
