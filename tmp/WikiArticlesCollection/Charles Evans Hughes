'''Charles Evans Hughes, Sr.''' (April 11, 1862 – August 27, 1948) was an American statesman, lawyer and [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician from New York. He served as the [[List of Governors of New York|36th Governor of New York]] (1907–1910), [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] (1910–1916), [[United States Secretary of State]] (1921–1925), a judge on the [[Permanent Court of International Justice|Court of International Justice]] (1928–1930), and the 11th [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (1930–1941). He was the Republican candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916 U.S. Presidential election]], losing narrowly to [[Woodrow Wilson]].

Hughes was a [[professor]] in the 1890s, a staunch supporter of Britain's [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|New Liberalism]],<ref name=hughescat>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/24.1/henretta.html#REF38 |title=Charles Evans Hughes and the Strange Death of Liberal America |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.is/WNDx |archivedate=2 August 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> an important leader of the [[progressive movement]] of the 20th century, a leading diplomat and New York lawyer in the days of Harding and Coolidge, and was known for being a swing voter when dealing with cases related to the [[New Deal]] in the 1930s.<ref name=hughescat /> Historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] has hailed him as a leading [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]].<ref>Clinton Rossiter, ''Conservatism in America'' (1962) p. 174</ref>

==Early life==
Charles Evans Hughes was born in [[Glens Falls, New York]], the son of Rev. David C. Hughes and Mary C. (Connelly) Hughes, a sister of State Senator [[Henry C. Connelly]] (1832–1912). He was active in the [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptist church]], a [[Mainline Protestant]] denomination.

==Education==
Hughes was educated in a private school. At the age of 14, he enrolled at Madison University (now [[Colgate University]]), where he became a member of [[Delta Upsilon]] [[List of social fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. He then transferred to [[Brown University]], continuing as a member of Delta Upsilon. He graduated third in his class at the age of 19, having been elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in his junior year. He [[read law]] and entered [[Columbia Law School]] in 1882, where he graduated in 1884 with highest honors.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2007|p=2}}</ref> While studying law, he taught at [[Delaware Academy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Marriage and family==
In 1885, Hughes met Antoinette Carter, the daughter of a senior partner of the law firm where he worked, and they were married in 1888. They had one son, [[Charles Evans Hughes, Jr.]] and three daughters, one of whom was [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett]], one of the first humans injected with insulin, and who later served as president of the [[Supreme Court Historical Society]].<ref name=Insulin>{{cite web |url=http://pro-tierisches-insulin.info/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=2 |title=Elizabeth Hughes: Fifty-eight years on animal-insulin |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> Hughes was the grandfather of [[Charles Evans Hughes III]] and [[Henry Stuart Hughes|H. Stuart Hughes]].

==Early career==
After graduating Hughes began working for Chamberlain, Carter & Hornblower where he met his future wife. In 1888, shortly after he was married, he became a partner in the firm, and the name was changed to Carter, Hughes & Cravath. Later the name was changed to [[Hughes, Hubbard & Reed]]. In 1891, Hughes left the practice of law to become a professor at the [[Cornell University Law School]], but in 1893, he returned to his old law firm in [[New York City]] to continue practicing until he ran for governor in 1906. He continued an association with Cornell as a special lecturer from 1893 to 1895. He was also a special lecturer for [[New York University Law School]], 1893–1900.

At that time, in addition to practicing law, Hughes taught at [[New York Law School]] with [[Woodrow Wilson]], who would later defeat him for the Presidency. In 1905, he was appointed as counsel to the New York [[State legislature (United States)|state legislative]] "Stevens Gas Commission", a committee investigating utility rates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60A10F93C5C1A728DDDAE0A94DC405B858CF1D3 |title=Stevens gas committee |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> His uncovering of corruption led to lower gas rates in New York City. In 1906, he was appointed to the "Armstrong Insurance Commission" to investigate the [[insurance]] industry in New York as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General.

==Governor of New York==
Hughes served as the [[Governor of New York]] from 1907 to 1910. He defeated [[William Randolph Hearst]] in the [[New York state election, 1906|1906 election]] to gain the position, and he was the only Republican statewide candidate to win office. An admirer of Britain's [[Liberalism in the United Kingdom|New Liberal]] philosophy, Hughes campaigned on a platform to improve the state of New York's [[standard of living]] by moving it away from [[laissez-faire]] tradition and enacting social reforms similar to that which had been enacted in Britain.<ref name=hughescat /> As a supporter of progressive policies, Hughes was able to play on the popularity of Theodore Roosevelt and weaken the power of the state's conservative Republican officials.<ref name=uoonvab>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100362100 |title=Charles Evans Hughes |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> In [[New York state election, 1908|1908]], he was offered the [[Vice President of the United States of America|vice-presidential]] nomination by [[William Howard Taft]], but he declined it to run again for Governor. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became an important supporter of Hughes.<ref>Schizer, David M. "Welcoming the J.D. Class of 2014", address at [[Columbia Law School]], August 2011, p. 4.</ref>

As the Governor, Hughes produced important reform legislation in three areas: improvement of the machinery and processes of government; extension of the state's regulatory authority over businesses engaged in public services; and expansion of governmental police and welfare functions.<ref name=uoonvab /> To counter political corruption, he secured campaign laws in 1906 and 1907 that limited political contributions by corporations and forced candidates to account for their receipts and expenses, legislation that was quickly copied in fifteen other states. He pushed the passage of the [[Moreland Act]], which enabled the governor to oversee city and county officials as well as officials in semi-autonomous state bureaucracies. This allowed him to fire many corrupt officials. He also managed to have the powers of the state's Public Service Commissions increased and fought strenuously, if not completely successfully, to get their decisions exempted from judicial review.

When two bills were passed to reduce railroad fares, Hughes vetoed them on the grounds that the rates should be set by expert commissioners rather than by elected ones. His ideal was not government by the people but for the people. As Hughes put it, "you must have administration by administrative officers."<ref name=hughescat />

Hughes, however, would be unsuccessful in achieving one of his main goals as governor: primary voting reform.<ref name=uoonvab /> Hoping to achieve a compromise with the state's party bosses, Hughes rejected the option of a direct primary in which voters could choose between declared candidates and instead proposed a complicated system of nominations by party committees. The state's party bosses, however, rejected this compromise and the state legislature rejected the plan on three occasions in 1909 and 1910.

On social issues, Hughes strongly supported relatively limited social reforms. He endorsed the Page-Prentice Act of 1907, which set an [[eight-hour day]] and forty-eight-hour week for factory workers—but only for those under the age of sixteen. By employing the well-established legal distinction between ordinary and hazardous work, the governor also won legislative approval for a Dangerous Trades Act that barred young workers from thirty occupations. To enforce these and other regulations, in 1907 Hughes reorganized the Department of Labor and appointed a well-qualified commissioner. Two years later, the governor created a new bureau for immigrant issues in the Department of Labor and appointed reformer Frances Kellor to head it.

In his final year as the Governor, he had the state comptroller draw up an executive budget. This began a rationalization of state government and eventually it led to an enhancement of executive authority. He also signed the Worker's Compensation Act of 1910, which required a compulsory, employer-paid plan of compensation for workers injured in hazardous industries and a voluntary system for other workers; after the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled the law unconstitutional in 1911, a popular referendum was held that successfully made the law an amendment in the [[New York Constitution]].

In 1908, Governor Hughes reviewed the clemency petition of [[Chester Gillette]] concerning the murder of [[Grace Brown]]. The governor denied the petition as well as an application for reprieve, and Gillette was electrocuted in March of that year.

When Hughes left office, a prominent journal remarked "One can distinctly see the coming of a New Statism ... [of which] Gov. Hughes has been a leading prophet and exponent". In 1926, Hughes was appointed by New York Governor [[Alfred E. Smith]] to be the chairman of a ''State Reorganization Commission'' through which Smith's plan to place the Governor as the head of a rationalized state government, was accomplished, bringing to realization what Hughes himself had envisioned.

In 1909, Hughes led an effort to incorporate [[Delta Upsilon]] [[fraternity]]. This was the first [[List of social fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] to incorporate, and he served as its first international president.

==Supreme Court==
On April 25, 1910, Hughes was appointed by President [[William H. Taft]] to a seat as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court vacated by [[David J. Brewer]]. Hughes was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on May 2, 1910, and received his commission the same day. As an associate justice of the Supreme Court from 1910 to 1916, Hughes remained an advocate of regulation and authored decisions that weakened the legal foundations of laissez-faire capitalism. He also mastered a new set of issues regarding the [[commerce clause]] and, in a deliberately restrained manner, wrote constitutional decisions that expanded the regulatory powers of both the state and federal governments.

The respective authority of federal and state governments under the Constitution's commerce clause had long been in dispute. In ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'' (1852) the Court headed by Roger B. Taney had allowed the states, in the absence of federal legislation, to control those aspects of commerce that did not require a single national policy. However, more recent decisions, such as ''Weldon v. Missouri'' (1875), had curtailed the power of the states to tax or license out-of-state products or sales agents. Influenced perhaps by his experience as a state governor, Hughes authored a series of decisions that upheld state laws that affected—and, it might be argued, infringed on—congressional authority over interstate commerce. For example, invoking police power arguments, he upheld a Georgia statute requiring electric headlights on locomotives, including those engaged in interstate commerce.

The most important of these federalism-related decisions were the Minnesota Rate Cases of 1913. In these, Hughes enhanced state regulation of railroads by reviving the ''Cooley'' doctrine of "concurrent powers." To persuade his colleagues, Hughes composed a detailed and carefully argued opinion. He began with the generally accepted proposition that Minnesota and the other states had the authority, using their police powers, to regulate commerce within their bounds. He then extended this logic to include rate-regulation when such internal commerce was intermeshed with interstate traffic to towns in bordering states.

Even as Hughes expanded the regulatory power of the states, he took a nationalist stance with respect to the authority of Congress over commerce, including that within the various states. Thus, in the important [[Houston E. & W. T. Ry. Co. v. United States|Shreveport Cases of 1914]], Hughes sustained a decision of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] voiding intrastate rates set by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The Texas rates encouraged the development of Dallas and Houston by blatantly discriminating against Texas shippers who marketed their goods via Shreveport, Louisiana. In striking down these rates as an interference with interstate commerce, Hughes recognized that the logic of his argument would permit federal regulation of any action that affected commerce. Thus, it might be used to challenge the sharp distinction made in ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]'' (1895) between commerce, which was subject to federal regulation, and manufacturing, which was not. Reluctant to infringe upon precedent, he inserted language that sought to limit the decision's reach to railroad carriers: "the agencies of interstate commerce." By leaving Knight intact, the associate justice restricted the authority of the federal government over local businesses or factories whose raw materials or products were part of interstate commerce. Yet the logic of his argument pointed to the position he would espouse during the constitutional crisis of 1937.

In cases involving the controversial issue of anti-trust regulation, the Supreme Court was divided. The faction led by John Marshall Harlan and Rufus Peckham embraced a small-producer ethic and a fully competitive market; these justices used the Sherman Act's prohibition of "restraint of trade" to outlaw price fixing by businesses. A second group, headed by Chief Justice Edward D. White and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., stood for "reasonable" market regulation, managed either by private agreements among producers (long permitted under common law) or by public administrative agencies. Preferring administrative regulation to the play of market forces, Hughes usually voted with White and Holmes in anti-trust cases.

In three other sets of cases, Hughes also authored opinions that bolstered the regulatory powers of state legislatures and administrative bodies. In the first line of decisions, he gave a narrow interpretation to the "contract clause" of the United States Constitution, which prohibits states from enacting any law "impairing the obligation of contracts." Refusing to give a literal reading to the state-granted charter of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which specified that the company could "collect and receive such tariffs ... as it may prescribe, Hughes contended that this clause "necessarily implies that the charges shall be reasonable and does not detract from the power of the State ... to prescribe reasonable rates."

In a second set of opinions, Hughes favored regulation over certain claims of individual rights. Thus, in ''Wilson v. U.S''. (1911), he asserted that corporate officers could not resist a subpoena for company records by invoking the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination. This decision made corporations more vulnerable to prosecution by limiting the rights of individuals as delineated in ''[[Boyd v. United States|Boyd v. U.S.]]'' (1886). The Court's reasoning in ''Boyd'' had extended "the personal security of the citizen" guaranteed by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to include an individual's personal papers. Sensing danger to Boyd's broad definition of individual rights, Justice McKenna dissented in ''Wilson'', declaring that Hughes's distinction between personal and corporate papers was "a limitation by construction" on an important "constitutional security for personal liberty." For his part, Hughes was unwilling to construe individual rights so that they frustrated the government's efforts to achieve a legitimate regulatory goal.

In a third set of pre-1916 cases, Hughes addressed the laissez-faire doctrine of "liberty of contract." Using this legal principle, many judges in Britain and the United States had voided, as an infringement of an individual's property rights, legislation that regulated common law bargains made in the marketplace between employers and their workers. But in a seminal article of 1881, "Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract," the Oxford political philosopher Thomas Hill Green disputed this reasoning. Green pointed out that the British Factory Acts had already limited the liberty of industrial capitalists and that legislation requiring compulsory schooling had circumscribed the freedom of parents. Extending the logic of these measures, Green adumbrated a positive and collectivist definition of liberty, a concept of "public freedom" that justified legislative oversight of economic life, especially land ownership and use. He likewise proposed legislative intervention into the terms of private bargains, to "provide against contracts being made which, from the helplessness of one of the parties to them, instead of being a security for freedom, become an instrument of disguised repression." Picking up this line of argument and declaring "a great departure from the principles of free contract," Gladstone created an [[Irish Land Court]] with complete control over rents and other landlord-tenant issues. Two decades later, Churchill and other New Liberals regularly invoked Green's arguments in parliamentary debates over English legislation.

Similar arguments appeared in the United States. In an article in the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'' in 1908, [[Roscoe Pound]] of the University of Chicago mounted a vigorous attack on "mechanical jurisprudence", the judicial practice of "rigorous logical deduction from predetermined conceptions in disregard of ... the actual facts." Citing ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', the controversial decision of 1905 upholding freedom of contract, Pound assailed the Supreme Court for giving "us rules which, when applied to the existing commercial and industrial situation, are wholly inadequate." In 1909 Pound continued his assault on [[conceptual thinking]] in an essay on "Liberty of Contract." Focusing upon ''Adair v. U.S.'' (1908), which invalidated another law regulating labor contracts, he berated the Court for not recognizing the "practical conditions of inequality."

The central problem, Pound argued, was that the legal system "exhibits too great a respect for the individual" and "too little respect for the needs of society." Pound came to this position partly through long debates with his former colleague at the University of Nebraska, the rising sociologist Edward A. Ross. "We have grown into an organic society," Ross argued, "in which the welfare of all is at the mercy of each." The two men continued their dialogue when Ross moved to the University of Wisconsin, where he became a colleague of Richard Ely. Influenced like Pound by German social and legal thinkers, Ely in 1903 had ascribed "the coercion of economic forces" in American society "to the unequal strength of those who make a contract."

Hughes undoubtedly was aware of these intellectual currents. There is no evidence that he was directly influenced by [[T. H. Green]]; however, he knew Ely through the AALL and had probably read Pound's essays. Whatever the precise links, the associate justice wrote opinions that mirrored the arguments of the Oxford philosopher of "positive liberty" and the sociologically inclined Midwestern professors. "Freedom of contract is a qualified and not an absolute right ...," Hughes declared in upholding an Iowa law that voided contracts limiting the legal rights of railroad workers: The state may "interfere where the parties do not stand upon an equality...." Using similar reasoning, the associate justice upheld a California law that mandated a forty-eight-hour work-week for women in various industries and allowed a federal statute to override a contract between an interstate railroad and its employees. Finally, Hughes joined Justice Day's dissent in ''[[Coppage v. Kansas]]'' (1915), a case in which a majority of the Court struck down a Kansas law forbidding "yellow dog contracts" that prevented workers from joining a union.<ref name=hughescat /> Citing the police power, Day and Hughes argued that a state could legitimately ban such contracts.

He wrote for the court in ''[[Bailey v. Alabama]]'' {{ussc|219|219|1911}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=219&invol=219 |title=Findlaw Bailey v.

Atchison T & SF R Co. |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> holding that the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] could regulate intrastate rates if they were significantly intertwined with interstate commerce.

On April 15, 1915, in the case of ''Frank v. Mangum'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://174.123.24.242/leagle/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=1915546237US309_1512.xml&docbase=CSLWAR1-1950-1985 |title=Leagle; Frank v.

Justice Hughes and Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] were the two dissenting votes.

==Presidential candidate==

Hughes resigned from the Supreme Court on June 10, 1916,<ref name="e2">[{{SCOTUS URL|about/members.pdf}} Supreme Court of the United States] ''Accessed December 13, 2007.''</ref> to be the Republican candidate for [[President of the United States|President]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1916|1916]]. He was also endorsed by the Progressive Party,<ref>Eisler, a Justice for All, page 39, ISBN 0-671-76787-9</ref> thanks to the support given to him from former President Theodore Roosevelt. Other Republican figures such as former President [[William Howard Taft]] endorsed Hughes and felt the accomplishments he made as Governor of New York would establish him as formidable progressive alternative to Wilson.<ref name=hughescat /> Many former leaders of the Progressive Party, however, endorsed Wilson because Hughes opposed the Adamson Act, the Sixteenth Amendment and diverted his focus away from progressive issues during the course of the campaign.<ref name=hughescat /> Hughes was defeated by [[Woodrow Wilson]] in a close election (separated by 23 electoral votes and 594,188 popular votes). The election hinged on [[California]], where Wilson managed to win by 3,800 votes and its 13 [[electoral votes]] and thus Wilson was returned for a second term; Hughes had lost the endorsement of the California governor and Roosevelt's 1912 Progressive running mate [[Hiram Johnson]] when he failed to show up for an appointment with him.

Despite coming close to winning the presidency, Hughes did not seek the Republican nomination again in 1920. Hughes also advocated ways to prevent the return of President Wilson's expanded government control over important industries such as the nation's railroads,<ref name=hughescat /> which he felt would lead to the eventual destruction of individualism and political self-rule.<ref name=hughescat /> After [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]]'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] advocated the return of such regulations during the 1924 US Presidential election, Hughes shifted rightwards believing that the federal bureaucracy should now have limited powers over individual liberties and property rights and that common law should be strictly enforced.<ref name=hughescat />

==Secretary of State==
[[File:Charles Evans Hughes residence.jpg|thumb|Hughes' residence in 1921]]
Hughes returned to government office in 1921 as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]]. On November 11, 1921, [[Armistice Day]] (changed to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]]), the [[Washington Naval Conference]] for the limitation of naval armament among the [[Great Powers]] began. The major naval powers of Britain, France, Italy, Japan and the United States were in attendance as well as other nations with concerns about territories in the Pacific — Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1354.html |title=Washington Naval Conference |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>

The American delegation was headed by Hughes and included [[Elihu Root]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], and [[Oscar Underwood]], the Democratic minority leader in the Senate. The conference continued until February 1922 and included the [[Four-Power Treaty|Four-power pact]] (December 13, 1921), [[Shandong Problem|Shantung Treaty]] (February 4, 1922), [[Washington Naval Treaty|Five-Power Treaty]], the [[Nine-Power Treaty]] (February 6, 1922), the "Six-power pact" that was an agreement between the Big Five Nations plus China to divide the German cable routes in the Pacific, and the Yap Island agreement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10A1FFF3A5A1B7A93C1A81789D95F458285F9 |publisher=New York Times |date=1921-12-13 |title=Text of the Agreement Reached on Yap And Other Mandated Pacific Islands |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref>

Hughes continued in office after Harding died and was succeeded by [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]], but resigned after Coolidge was elected to a full term. In 1922, June 30, he signed the ''Hughes–Peynado agreement'', that ended the occupation of [[Dominican Republic]] by the [[United States]] (since 1916).<ref name="Calder1984">{{cite book|last=Calder|first=Bruce J.|title=The impact of intervention: the Dominican Republic during the U.S. occupation of 1916-1924|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YFdkfzVaEa8C&pg=PA223|accessdate=22 September 2011|year=1984|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=978-1-55876-386-9|page=223}}</ref>

==Various appointments==
In 1907, Gov. Charles Evans Hughes became the first president of the newly formed [[Northern Baptist Convention]]--based at [http://calvarydc.org/ Calvary Baptist Church] in Washington, DC, of which Hughes was a member. He also served as President of the [[New York State Bar Association]].

After leaving the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], he again rejoined his old partners at the Hughes firm, which included his son and future [[United States Solicitor General]] Charles E. Hughes, Jr., and was one of the nation's most sought-after advocates. From 1925 to 1930, for example, Hughes argued over 50 times before the U.S. Supreme Court. From 1926 to 1930, Hughes also served as a member of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] and as a judge of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] from 1928 to 1930. He was additionally a delegate to the Pan American Conference on Arbitration and Conciliation from 1928 to 1930. He was one of the co-founders in 1927 of the National Conference on Christians and Jews, now known as the [[National Conference for Community and Justice]] (NCCJ), along with [[S. Parkes Cadman]] and others, to oppose the [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[anti-Catholicism]], and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Conference for Community and Justice |url=http://www.faithstreams.com/topics/members-and-partners/national-conference-for-community-and-justice.html |accessdate=19 December 2007}}</ref>

In 1925–1926, Charles Evans Hughes represented the API (American Petroleum Institute) before the FOCB (Federal Oil Conservation Board).<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Oil Conservation Board]] |title=Complete Record of Public Hearings |quote=February 10 and 11, 1926 |page=155 |place=Washington D.C. |publisher=[[Government Printing Office]]}}</ref>

In 1928 conservative business interests tried to interest Hughes in the GOP presidential nomination of 1928 instead of Herbert Hoover. Hughes, citing his age, turned down the offer.

[[File:Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Hughes as Chief Justice.]]
[[Herbert Hoover]], who had appointed Hughes's son as [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] in 1929, appointed Hughes [[Chief Justice of the United States]] on February 3, 1930. Hughes was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 13, 1930, and received commission the same day, serving in this capacity until 1941. Hughes replaced former President [[William Howard Taft]], a fellow Republican who had also lost a presidential election to Woodrow Wilson (in 1912) and who, in 1910, had appointed Hughes to his first tenure on the Supreme Court.

Hughes' appointment was opposed by progressive elements in both parties who felt that he was too friendly to big business. Idaho Republican [[William E. Borah]] said on the [[United States Senate]] floor that confirming Hughes would constitute "placing upon the Court as Chief Justice one whose views are known upon these vital and important questions and whose views, in my opinion, however sincerely entertained, are not which ought to be incorporated in and made a permanent part of our legal and economic system."<ref>{{harvnb|Wittes|2006|p=50}}</ref> Nonetheless Hughes was confirmed as Chief Justice with a vote of 52 to 26.

Hughes as Chief Justice swore in President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941.

Upon his return to the court, more progressives had joined the bench and Hughes seemed determined again to vote progressive and soon bring an end to the longstanding pro-business [[Lochner era]].<ref name=hughescat /> During his early years as Chief Justice, however, the fear he had developed for an overblown bureaucracy during World War I undermined his optimism.<ref name=hughescat /> Showing his old progressive image, he upheld legislation protecting civil rights and civil liberties<ref name=hughescat /> and wrote the opinion for the Court in ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'' {{ussc|283|697|1931}}, which held [[prior restraint]] against the press is unconstitutional. Concerning economic regulation, however, he was still willing to uphold legislation which supported "freedom of opportunity" for individuals on the one hand and the "police power" of the state on the other<ref name=hughescat /> but did not personally favor legislation that linked national economic planning and bureaucratic social welfare together.<ref name=hughescat /> At first resisting Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] and building a consensus of centrist members of the court, Hughes used his influence to limit the liberal scope of Roosevelt's changes<ref name=hughescat /> and would often strike down New Deal legislation he felt was poorly drafted and did not clearly specify how they were constitutional.<ref name=hucourtas>{{cite web |url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1399&context=facpubs |title=Government Lawyers and the New Deal |last=Devins |first=Neal |year=1996 |publisher=William & Mary Law School |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> By 1935, however, Hughes felt the court's [[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|four conservative Justices]] had disregarded common law and sought to curb their power.<ref name=hughescat />

Hughes was often aligned with the court's [[The Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|three liberal Justices]] [[Louis Brandeis]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]], and [[Benjamin Cardozo]] in finding some New Deal measures Constitutional,<ref name=hughescat /> On one occasion, Hughes would side with the conservatives in striking down the New Deal's Agricultural Adjustment Act in the 1936 case ''[[United States v. Butler]]'',<ref name=hughescat /> which held that the law was unconstitutional because its so-called tax policy was a coercive regulation rather than a tax measure and the federal government lacked authority to regulate agriculture,<ref name=hughescat /> but surprisingly did not assign the majority opinion,<ref name=hughescat /> a practice usually required for court's most senior justice who agrees with the majority opinion,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/447813?uid=3739616&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21103047940163 |title=The Chief Justices and Self-Assignment of Majority Opinions: A Research Note |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://epstein.usc.edu/blackmun.php?p=2 |title=Lee Epstein |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> and allowed Associate Justice [[Owen Roberts]] to speak for the entire majority in his own words.<ref name=hughescat /> It was accepted that he did not agree with the argument that the federal government lacked authority over agriculture and was going to write a separate opinion upholding the act's regulation policy while striking down the act's taxation policy on the grounds that it was a coercive regulation rather than a tax measure.<ref name=hughescat /> However, Roberts convinced Hughes that he would side with him and the three liberal justices in future cases pertaining to the nation's agriculture which involved the Constitution's [[General Welfare Clause]] if he agreed to join his opinion.<ref name=hughescat />

By 1936, Hughes sensed the growing hostility in the court and could do little about it.<ref name=hughescat /> In the 1936 case ''[[Carter v. Carter Coal Company]]'', Hughes took a middle ground for both doctrinal and court-management reasons.<ref name=hughescat /> Writing his own opinion, he joined the three liberal justices in upholding the [[Guffey Coal Act|Bituminous Coal Conservation Act]]'s marketing provision but sided with Roberts and the four conservatives in striking down the act's provision which regulated local labor.<ref name=hughescat /> By 1937, as the court leaned more in his favor, Hughes would renounce the position he took in the ''Carter'' case regarding local labor and ruled that the procedural methods that governed the [[Wagner Act]]'s labor regulation provisions bore resemblance to the procedural methods which governed the railroad rates that the Interstate Commerce Commission was allowed to maintain in the 1914 ''Shreveport'' decision and thus demonstrated that Congress could use its commerce power to regulate local industrial labor as well.<ref name=hughescat />

In 1937, when Roosevelt attempted to [[Court-packing Bill|pack the Court]] with six additional justices, Hughes worked behind the scenes to defeat the effort,<ref name=hughesconstitution /><ref name=hughesconstitution /> which failed in the Senate.<ref name=hughesconstitution>Jeff Shesol, ''Supreme power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. the Supreme Court'' (2010) pp. 394–7.</ref> by rushing important New Deal legislation- such as [[Wagner Act]] and the [[Social Security Act]]- through the court and ensuring that the court's majority would uphold their constitutionality.<ref name=hughescat /> The month after Roosevelt's court-packing announcement, Roberts, who had joined the [[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|four conservative Justices]] in striking down important New Deal legislation, [[The switch in time that saved nine|shocked the American public]] by siding with Hughes and the court's three liberal justices in striking down the court's previous ruling in the 1923 ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' case-which held that laws requiring minimum wage violated the Fifth Amendment's [[due process clause]]- and upholding the constitutionality of Washington state's minimum wage law in ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''. Because Roberts had previously sided with the four conservative justices and used the ''Adkins'' decision as the basis for striking down a similar [[minimum wage law]] the state of [[New York]] enforced in ''Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo''<ref name="ussc|298|587|1936">{{ussc|298|587|1936}}</ref> it was widely perceived that he only agreed to uphold the constitutionality of minimum wage as a result of the pressure that was put on the Supreme Court by the court-packing plan.<ref name="McKenna419"/> However, both Hughes and Roberts acknowledged that the Chief Justice, in fact, had already convinced Roberts to change his method of voting months before Roosevelt announced his court-packing plan<ref name=hucourtas/><ref name=refy422 /> and that the effort he put into defeating the plan played only a small significance in determining how the court's majority made their decisions in future cases pertaining to New Deal legislation.<ref name=refy422 />

Following the overwhelming support that voters showed for the New Deal through Roosevelt's [[United States presidential election, 1936|overwhelming re-election]] in November 1936,<ref name=hucourtas /> Hughes was able to persuade Roberts no longer to base his votes on political maneuvering and to side with him in future cases regarding New Deal related policies.<ref name=hucourtas /><ref name=refy422>{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Marian C. |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-packing Crisis of 1937. |publisher=Fordham University Press. |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8232-2154-7 |pages=422–23}}</ref> Roberts had [[Rule of four|voted]] to grant ''[[Writ of certiorari|certiorari]]'' to hear the ''Parrish'' case before the [[United States presidential election, 1936|election of 1936]].<ref name=uopqpvz32>{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Marian C. |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-packing Crisis of 1937. |publisher=Fordham University Press. |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8232-2154-7 |pages=412–13}}</ref> Oral arguments occurred on December 16 and 17, 1936, with counsel for Parrish specifically asking the court to reconsider its decision in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'',<ref>{{ussc|261|525|1923}}</ref> which had been the basis for striking down a [[New York]] [[minimum wage law]] in ''Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo''<ref name="ussc|298|587|1936"/> in the late spring of 1936.<ref name="McKenna413">{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Marian C. |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-packing Crisis of 1937. |publisher=Fordham University Press. |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8232-2154-7 |pages=413}}</ref>

Roberts indicated his desire to overturn ''Adkins'' immediately after oral arguments ended for the Parrish case on Dec. 17, 1936.<ref name="McKenna413"/> The initial conference vote on Dec. 19, 1936 was split 4-4; with this even division on the Court, the holding of the [[Washington Supreme Court]], finding the minimum wage statute constitutional, would stand.<ref name="McKenna414">{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Marian C. |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-packing Crisis of 1937. |publisher=Fordham University Press. |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8232-2154-7 |pages=414}}</ref> The eight voting justices anticipated [[Harlan Fiske Stone|Justice Stone]]—absent due to illness—would be the fifth vote necessary for a majority opinion affirming the constitutionality of the minimum wage law.<ref name="McKenna414"/> As Hughes desired a clear and strong 5-4 affirmation of the Washington Supreme Court's judgment, rather than a 4-4 default affirmation, he convinced the other justices to wait until Stone's return before both deciding and announcing the case.<ref name="McKenna414"/> In one of his notes from 1936, Hughes wrote that Roosevelt's re-election forced the court to depart from its "fortress in public opinion" and severely weakened its capability to base its rulings on either personal or political beliefs.<ref name=hucourtas />

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] announced his court reform bill on February 5, 1937, the day of the first conference vote after Stone's February 1, 1937 return to the bench. Roosevelt later made his justifications for the bill to the public on March 9, 1937 during his 9th [[Fireside Chat]]. The Court's opinion in ''Parrish'' was not published until March 29, 1937, after Roosevelt's radio address. Hughes wrote in his autobiographical notes that Roosevelt's court reform proposal "had not the slightest effect on our [the court's] decision,"<ref name="McKenna419">{{cite book |last=McKenna |first=Marian C. |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-packing Crisis of 1937. |publisher=Fordham University Press. |place=New York, NY |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8232-2154-7 |pages=419}}</ref> but due to the delayed announcement of its decision the Court was characterized as retreating under fire.<ref name="McKenna419"/>

Although Hughes wrote the opinion invalidating the [[National Recovery Administration]] in ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]''- though the decision was also a unanimous one upheld by all of the court's nine Justices-,<ref name=hughescat /> he also wrote the opinions for the Court in ''[[National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation|NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.]]'',<ref name=hugheslabor>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=301&invol=1 |title=N.L.R.B. v.

Parrish |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> which approved some New Deal measures. Hughes supervised the move of the Court from its former quarters at the U.S. Capitol to the newly constructed Supreme Court building.

Hughes wrote twice as many constitutional opinions as any of his court's other members. "His opinions, in the view of one commentator, were concise and admirable, placing Hughes in the pantheon of great justices."<ref name="oyez">{{cite web |url=http://www.oyez.org/justices/charles_e_hughes/ |title=Charles Evans Hughes |publisher=Official Supreme Court media at [[Oyez.org|Oyez project]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 November 2013}}</ref> His "remarkable intellectual and social gifts...made him a superb leader and administrator. He had a photographic memory that few, if any, of his colleagues could match. Yet he was generous, kind, and forebearing in an institution where egos generally come in only one size: extra large!"<ref name="oyez"/>

==Later life==
For many years, he was a member of the [[Union League Club of New York]] and served as its president from 1917 to 1919.

On August 27, 1948, Hughes died in what is now the Tiffany Cottage of the [[Wianno Club]] in [[Osterville]], [[Massachusetts]]. His remains are interred at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in Bronx, New York.<ref name="Christensen">{{cite web |publisher=[[Supreme Court Historical Society]] |url=http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html |title=Christensen, George A.
