The '''Telstar''' is a series of [[video game console]]s produced by [[Coleco]] from 1976 to 1978. Starting with Telstar ''[[Pong]]'' clone based on [[General Instrument]]'s [[AY-3-8500]] chip in 1976, there were 14 consoles released in the Telstar branded series. One million Telstar units were sold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herman|first=Leonard|title=Phoenix: the fall & rise of videogames|year=1997|publisher=Rolenta Press|location=Union, NJ|isbn=0-9643848-2-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=duITAQAAIAAJ|edition=2nd ed.|accessdate=16 February 2012|page=20|quote=Like Pong, Telstar could only play video tennis but it retailed at an inexpensive $50 that made it attractive to most families that were on a budget.

The large product lineup and the impending fading out of the ''Pong'' machines led Coleco to face near-bankruptcy in 1980{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.
