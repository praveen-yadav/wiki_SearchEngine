Until the 20th century, the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the [[Principality of Polotsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Belarus became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] and was renamed as the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR). Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 when some lands of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were incorporated into it after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] and were finalized after World War&nbsp;II.<ref name="uni1">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o85YDMTeMrUC&dq=reunification+of+western+belarus |title=National purpose in the world economy: post-Soviet states in comparative perspective |accessdate=10 November 2009 |last=Abdelal|first=Rawi |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |isbn=9780801438790}}</ref><ref name="uni2">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&pg=PA713&dq=reunification+of+western+belarus#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Europa World Year, Book1 |accessdate=10 November 2009 |last=Taylor & Francis Group |year=2004 |publisher=[[Routledge|Europa publications]] |isbn=9781857432541}}</ref><ref name="uni3"/> The nation and its territory were devastated in World War&nbsp;II, during which Belarus lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources.<ref name="axell">{{cite book | last = Axell | first = Albert | title = Russia's Heroes, 1941–45 | publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers | year= 2002 | page = 247 | url =  | isbn = 0-7867-1011-X }}</ref> The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945, the Belorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

The parliament of the republic declared the [[sovereignty]] of Belarus on {{Nowrap|27 July}} 1990, and during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Belarus declared independence on {{Nowrap|25 August}} 1991.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html Introduction ::Belarus]</ref>  [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president since 1994. Despite objections from Western governments, Lukashenko has continued Soviet-era policies, such as [[Planned economy|state ownership of the economy]].

Despite its proximity to the rest of Europe and the West, Belarus' [[Democracy Index]] rating continuously ranks the lowest in Europe, and the country is labelled as "Not Free" by [[Freedom House]] and "Repressed" in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]]. For this reason, the country is often referred to as the 'Last Dictatorship in Europe'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/07/belarus-inside-europes-last-dictatorship|accessdate=6 April 2013|title=Belarus: inside Europe's last dictatorship}}</ref>

Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49&nbsp;million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic Belarusian, with sizable minorities of Russians, [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and Russian. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare an official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second most popular, [[Roman Catholicism in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following, although both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter are celebrated as national holidays.

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The name ''Belarus'' corresponds literally with the term ''[[White Rus']]''. There are several claims to the origin of the name ''White Rus'.''<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2">{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}</ref> An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that had been populated mostly by early Christianized Slavs, as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which was predominantly inhabited by pagan Balts.<ref>Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. "About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia"), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.</ref> An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}</ref> A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] (i.e., Polatsk, Vitsiebsk and Mahilyow) had been referred to as "white." Other sources claim that, before 1267, the land not conquered by the Mongols was considered "White Rus'."<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/>

The name [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] is often conflated with its Latin forms [[Russia]] and [[Ruthenia]], thus Belarus is often referred to as ''White Russia'' or ''White Ruthenia''. The name first appeared in [[Medieval German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]; the chronicles of [[Jan of Czarnków]] mentions the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother at "Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto" in 1381.<ref name="vauchez">{{Harvnb|Vauchez|2001|p=163}}</ref>

The Latin term "Alba Russia" was used again by [[Pope Pius&nbsp;VI]] to recognize the [[Society of Jesus]] there 1783, exclaiming "Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo."<ref>{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}</ref> The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.<ref name="alies">{{cite book | last = Bely | first = Alies" | title = The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name | publisher=Encyclopedix | year= 2000 | location = Minsk, Belarus | isbn = 985-6599-12-1|ref=harv }}</ref> During the 17th century, Russian [[Tsar]]s used "White Rus" to describe the lands captured from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.<ref>{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}</ref>

[[File:Stemp Efrasinia Polackaja.jpg|thumb|upright|Stamp with the [[Cross of Saint Euphrosyne|Cross of St. Euphrasyne]] from 1992]]
The term ''Belorussia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Белоруссия}}; the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Россия, ''Russia'') first rose in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian Tsar was usually styled "Tsar of All the Russias", as ''Russia'' or the ''Russian Empire'' was formed by all the Russias — the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=Belorussia+Russian+Empire#v=onepage&q=Belorussia%20Russian%20Empire&f=false |title=Where Nation-States Come From: Institutional Change in the Age of Nationalism - Philip G.

In western Belarus under Polish control, ''Byelorussia'' became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ioffe | first = Grigory | title = Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc | date = 25 February 2008 | page = 41 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&pg=PA150&dq=west+belarus#v=onepage&q=west%20belarus&f=false | isbn=0-7425-5558-5 }}</ref>

The term ''Belorussia'' (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR|Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Republic of Belarus'' (“Республика Беларусь” spelled in Russian), as well its abridged form should be “Belarus”. The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their [[Belarusian language]] forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993.<ref name="bynamelaw">{{cite web|url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus — About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=19 September 1991 |publisher=Pravo — Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}</ref> Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the [[Constitution of Belarus]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ryder|1998|p=183}}</ref>

Accordingly, the name ''Belorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 4-5">{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|pp=4–5}}</ref> and to some extent in Russian (although the traditional name persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective). ''Belarusian'' is closer to the original Russian term of ''bielaruski''.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 4-5"/> Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from ''Belorussia'' to a form of ''Krivia'' because of the supposed connection with Russia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1999|p=230}}</ref> Some nationalists also object to the name for the same reason.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.euroradio.fm/en/909/news/35335 |title=Swedish government urged to change Belarus' official name |accessdate=2 February 2010 |date=13 July 2009 |work=European Radio for Belarus }}</ref><ref name="levy">{{Harvnb|Levy|Spilling|2009|p=95}}</ref> However, several popular newspapers published locally retain the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda|Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii]]'', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper.

==History==
{{Main|History of Belarus}}

===Early history===
From 5,000 to 2,000 BCE, [[Bandkeramik]] cultures predominated. In addition, remains from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] were found in Belarus and parts of [[Ukraine]].<ref name='shaw'>{{cite book | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jameson | first2 = Robert | title = A Dictionary of Archaeology | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | date = 23 April 2002 2003 | pages = 203–204 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zmvNogJO2ZgC&pg=PA203&dq=Neanderthal+remains+Belarus#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate =2 May 2011 | isbn = 978-0-631-23583-5}}</ref> [[Cimmerians]] and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BCE, and by 500 BCE, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the [[Scythians]] who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the [[Huns]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], swept through c. 400–600 CE, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.<ref>Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World, by John Haywood, 1998</ref>

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zaprudnik|first=Jan|title=Belarus: At a Crossroads in History|year=1993|publisher=Westview Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qtnTh3-2Ki8C&pg=PA7&dq=Belarus+5th+century#v=onepage&q=Belarus%205th%20century&f=false|isbn=9780813317946}}</ref>

A number of authors started publishing in the Belarusian language, including [[Jan Czeczot]], [[Władysław Syrokomla]] and [[Konstanty Kalinowski]].

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] forbade the use of the term ''Belarusia'' and renamed the region the "North-Western Territory". He also prohibited the use of Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded into a [[January Uprising|revolt]], led by Kalinowski.  After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Belarusian in 1864 and banned the use of the [[Latin alphabet]].

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of "Belarusianization" was followed in the newly formed B.S.S.R. (Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic).

===Music===

In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sialanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M.

Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of [[bread and salt]] when greeting a guest or visitor.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration&nbsp;– [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project&nbsp;– Eating the Belarusian Way].

In 2008, there were 3.718&nbsp;million phone landlines used in comparison to {{Nowrap|8.639 million}} cellular phones in Belarus. Most of the phone lines are operated by Beltelecom, a state-owned company. About two-thirds of all of the phone services are run on digital systems, and the mobile-cellular [[teledensity]] is about 90 phones per 100 persons. There are approximately 113,000 internet hosts in Belarus in 2009 to meet the needs of approximately {{Nowrap|3.107 million}} Internet users.<ref name="ciabo">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html |title=Belarus |accessdate=26 April 2010 |date=21 April 2010 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100424035944/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html| archivedate= 24 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The largest media holding group in Belarus is the state-owned [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|National State Teleradiocompany]]. It operates several television and radio stations that broadcast content domestically and internationally, either through traditional signals or the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvr.by/eng/about.asp |title=About us, National State Teleradiocompany |publisher=Tvr.by |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref> The Television Broadcasting Network is one of the major independent television stations in Belarus, mostly showing regional programming also a bootlegged version of The Big Bang Theory called The Theorists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bierly |first=Mandi |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/02/09/big-bang-theory-belarus/ |title='The Theorists': 'Big Bang Theory"s big Belarusian rip-off |publisher=Popwatch.ew.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref> Several [[List of newspapers in Belarus|newspapers]], printed either in Belarusian or Russian, provide general information or special interest content, such as business, politics or sports. In 1998, there were fewer than 100 radio stations in Belarus: 28 [[AM broadcasting|AM]], 37 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and 11 [[shortwave]] stations.<ref name="ciabo"/>

All media companies are regulated by the Law on Press and Other Mass Media, passed on {{Nowrap|13 January}} 1995.<ref name="presslaw">[http://www.law.by/work/EnglPortal.nsf/6e1a652fbefce34ac2256d910056d559/1f80c30387b1623dc2256dc00051dc63?OpenDocument Law On Press and Other Mass Media, Law of the Republic of Belarus]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref> This grants the freedom of press; however, Article 5 proscribes [[slander]] against the president of Belarus or other officials outlined in the national constitution.<ref name="presslaw"/>
The Belarusian Government has since been criticized for acting against media outlets. Newspapers such as ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' and the ''Belaruskaya Delovaya Gazeta'' have been targeted for closure by the authorities after they published reports critical of President Lukashenko or other government officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2006-04-19-newsitem-en.html |title=Independent Belarusian newspaper "Nasha Niva" to close |publisher=Eurozine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://belarusian.minsk.usembassy.gov/policy20030530.html |title=Media Freedom in Belarus |accessdate=26 April 2010 |date=30 May 2003 |work=2003 Policy Archive |publisher=United States Department of State }}</ref> The OSCE and [[Freedom House]] have commented regarding the loss of press freedom in Belarus. In 2009, Freedom House gave Belarus a score of 6.75 (not free) when it came to dealing with press freedom. Another issue for the Belarusian press is the unresolved disappearance of several journalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2009/belarus |title=Nations in Transit 2009&nbsp;– Belarus |accessdate=26 April 2010 |year=2009 |publisher=Freedom House}}</ref>
