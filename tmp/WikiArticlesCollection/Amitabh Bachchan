'''Amitabh Harivansh Bachchan''' ({{IPA-hi|əmɪˈtaːbʱ ˈbəttʃən|IPA}}; born 11 October 1942) is an Indian film actor. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s as the "angry young man" of [[Hindi cinema]], and has since appeared in over 180 Indian films in a career spanning more than four decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guru.bafta.org/amitabh-bachchan-interview-video |title=Amitabh Bachchan: A Life in Pictures |publisher=Bafta.org |accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=angryyoungman>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1945451.stm |title=Film legend promotes Bollywood |publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of [[Indian cinema]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wajihuddin|first=Mohammed|title=Egypt's Amitabh Bachchan mania|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-12-02/india/27839664_1_bachchan-fan-mania-indians|accessdate=22 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=2 December 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jatras|first=Todd|title=India's Celebrity Film Stars|url=http://www.forbes.com/2001/03/09/0309bollywood.html|work=Article|accessdate=22 November 2011|date=9 March 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bachchan Receives Lifetime Achievement Award at DIFF|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/newsmakers/2009/November/newsmakers_November64.xml&section=newsmakers&col=|work=Khaleej Times|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=25 November 2009}}</ref> So total was his dominance of the movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director [[François Truffaut]] called him a "one-man industry".<ref>{{cite web| work=China Daily |title= Truffaut labeled Bachchan a one-man industry |url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/history/00-07-07/l03-film.html |accessdate=1 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080201030338/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/history/00-07-07/l03-film.html| archivedate= 1 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-10-10/news-interviews/43032903_1_amitabh-bachchan-saat-hindustani-inquilab/ |title=Amitabh Bachchan: Indira Gandhi helped him get into films|publisher=timesofindia.com |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

He is the most-nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 39 nominations overall. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a [[playback singer]], film producer and television presenter. He also had a stint in politics in the 1980s. The [[Government of India]] honoured him with the [[Padma Shri]] in 1984 and the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 2001 for his contributions towards the [[The arts|arts]].

Bachchan made his Hollywood debut in 2013 with ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character, Meyer Wolfsheim.

==Early and personal life==
{{see also|Bachchan family}}
Bachchan was born in [[Allahabad]], Uttar Pradesh, in north central India. His father, [[Harivansh Rai Bachchan]], was a [[Hindi]] poet, and his mother, [[Teji Bachchan]], was a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] from [[Faisalabad]] (now in [[Pakistan]]).<ref name="sikh">{{cite book|title=Bollywood cinema: temples of desire|author=Mishra, Vijay|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-93015-4|page=131}}</ref> Bachchan was initially named ''Inquilaab'', inspired from the phrase made famous during the Indian independence struggle, ''[[Inquilab Zindabad]]'', which means "long live revolution". However, at the suggestion of fellow poet [[Sumitranandan Pant]], Harivansh Rai changed the name to Amitabh which means, "the light that will never die." Though his surname was [[Shrivastava]], his father had adopted the pen-name Bachchan (meaning "child-like" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all his works. It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films, and, for all public purposes, it has become the surname of all members of his family. Bachchan's father died in 2003 and his mother in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teji Bachchan passes away|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=2078579f-853d-48ae-b826-eeee479169e2&ParentID=d5c75cbf-62a5-49eb-a016-0cf71383854b&&Headline=Big+B's+mother+Teji+Bachchan+is+no+more|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|author=Khan, Alifiya|accessdate=10 February 2011}}</ref>

Amitabh has a younger brother, Ajitabh. His mother had a keen interest in theatre and had been offered a role in a film, but preferred her domestic duties. She had some degree of influence in Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should take the centre stage.<ref name="AB and his parents">{{cite web| title=Reviews on: To Be or Not To Be Amitabh Bachchan – Khalid Mohamed |url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/To-Be-or-Not-To-Be-Amitabh-Bachchan-Khalid-Mohamed-review-osmuomqns}}</ref>

Bachchan is married to actress [[Jaya Bhaduri]]. The couple have two children, Shweta Nanda and [[Abhishek Bachchan]]. Abhishek is also an actor and is married to actress [[Aishwarya Rai]].

==Career==

===Early work: 1969–1972===
Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film|National Award]] winning film ''[[Bhuvan Shome]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Suresh Kohli |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article3428922.ece |title=Arts / Cinema : Bhuvan Shome (1969) |work=The Hindu |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> Thereafter he got his first acting role as one of the seven protagonists in ''[[Saat Hindustani]]'', a film directed by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]] and featuring [[Utpal Dutt]], [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]] and [[Jalal Agha]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Avijit Ghosh, TNN 7 Nov 2009, 01.14pm IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-07/india/28085479_1_amitabh-bachchan-saat-hindustani-malayalam-actor |title=Big B's debut film hit the screens 40 yrs ago, today |work=The Times of India |accessdate=11 December 2012 |date=7 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="First national award">{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2007/aug/09amitabh.htm |title='I felt I did a good job in Black' |publisher=Rediff.com |date=9 August 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>

''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'' (1971) followed, where he starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. Bachchan's role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered him his first [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. He then played his first negative role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in ''[[Parwana (1971 film)|Parwaana]]'' (1971). This was followed by several films including ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film ''[[Guddi (1971 film)|Guddi]]'' which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film ''[[Bawarchi]]''. In 1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy ''[[Bombay to Goa]]'', directed by [[S. Ramanathan]]. Many of his films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change.<ref name=iconic1>{{cite web|title=80 iconic performances 1/10 |url=http://www.filmfare.com/details.php?id=950 |date=1 June 2010|accessdate=29 November 2011}}</ref>

===Rise to stardom: 1973–1983===
Director [[Prakash Mehra]] cast him in the leading role for the film ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973) as Inspector Vijay Khanna. The film was a sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it and established Amitabh in a new persona—the "angry young man" of [[Bollywood]] cinema.<ref name=angryyoungman/> Filmfare considers this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history.<ref name=iconic1/> The film was a huge success and one of the highest grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=179&catName=MTk3Mw== |title=Box Office 1973 |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref> From then onwards, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. He earned his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor for ''Zanjeer''. The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together; not only in ''Zanjeer'' but in films such as ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'' which followed and was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film ''[[Namak Haraam]]'', a social drama directed by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]].

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as ''[[Kunwara Baap]]'' and ''[[Dost (1974 film)|Dost]]'', before playing a supporting role in ''[[Roti Kapda Aur Makaan]]''. The film, directed and written by [[Manoj Kumar]], addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship and was the top earning film of 1974. Bachchan then played the leading role in film ''[[Majboor (1974 film)|Majboor]]'', released on 6 December 1974, which was a remake of the Hollywood film ''[[Zig Zag (1970 film)|Zig Zag]]''. The film was a success at the box office.<ref>[http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=180&catName=MTk3NA== Box Office India].</ref> Two of his other releases that year viz. Kasauti and Benaam also made money making his success at the box office consistent. In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'', the crime drama ''[[Faraar]]'' to the romantic drama ''[[Mili (film)|Mili]]''. 1975 was the year when he appeared in two films which are regarded as important in Hindi cinematic history. He starred in the [[Yash Chopra]] directed film ''[[Deewaar (1975 film)|Deewaar]]'', opposite [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Nirupa Roy]], and [[Neetu Singh]], which earned him a Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=181&catName=MTk3NQ== |title=Box Office 1975|work=BoxOffice India.com}}</ref> ''Indiatimes Movies'' ranks ''Deewaar'' amongst the ''Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films''.<ref name="mustsee"/> Released on 15 August 1975 was ''[[Sholay]]'', which became the highest grossing film of 1975 and also of all time in India, earning [[Indian rupee|INR]] {{formatnum:2364500000}} equivalent to US$60 million, after adjusting for inflation.<ref name=boxoffice>{{cite web|title=Sholay |url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |publisher=International Business Overview Standard |accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref> in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. In 1999, [[BBC]] India declared it the "Film of the Millennium" and like ''Deewar'', has been cited by ''[[Indiatimes]] movies'' as amongst the ''Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films''.<ref name="mustsee">{{cite news|author=Kanwar, Rachna |title=25 Must See Bollywood Movies |date=3 October 2005 |url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/Special_Features/25_Must_See_Bollywood_Movies/articleshow/msid-1250837,curpg-10.cms |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090220161340/http://movies.indiatimes.com/Special_Features/25_Must_See_Bollywood_Movies/articleshow/msid-1250837,curpg-10.cms |archivedate=20 February 2009 |publisher=Indiatimes movies |accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref> In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual [[Filmfare Awards]] awarded it with the special distinction award called [[Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years]].

Bachchan starred in comedies such as  ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975) and ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977) and in films such as ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976). In 1976, he was once again cast by director [[Yash Chopra]] in his second film, ''Kabhi Kabhie'', a romantic tale in which Bachchan starred as a young poet named Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja played by actress [[Raakhee]]. The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his "angry young man" roles like ''Zanjeer'' and ''Deewar''. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. In 1977, he won his first [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]] for his performance in ''Amar Akbar Anthony'' where he played the third lead opposite [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include ''[[Parvarish (1977 film)|Parvarish]]'', ''[[Khoon Pasina]]'' and ''[[Adalat (1976 film)|Adalat]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=183&catName=MTk3Nw== |title=Box Office 1977 |publisher=Boxofficeindia.com |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> He once again resumed double roles in films such as [[Kasme Vaade]] as Amit and Shankar and [[Don (1978 film)]] playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look alike Vijay. His performance won him his second [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]]. He also gave towering performances in ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' and ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations.

In 1979, Bachchan starred in ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'' which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like ''[[Mr. Natwarlal]]'', ''[[Kaala Patthar (1979 film)|Kaala Patthar]]'' and "[[The Great Gambler]]". Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film ''Mr. Natwarlal'' in which he starred alongside [[Rekha]]. His performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the [[Filmfare Best Male Playback Award]]s. In 1979, he also received Best Actor nomination for ''Kaala Patthar'' (1979) and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the [[Raj Khosla]] directed film ''[[Dostana (1980 film)|Dostana]]'', in which he starred opposite [[Shatrughan Sinha]] and [[Zeenat Aman]]. ''Dostana'' proved to be the top grossing film of 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&catName=MTk4MA== |title=BoxOffice India.com |publisher=BoxOffice India.com |accessdate=15 January 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100102005754/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&catName=MTk4MA==| archivedate= 2 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film ''[[Silsila]]'', where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and [[Rekha]].

===1982 injury while filming ''Coolie''===
On 26 July 1982, while filming ''[[Coolie (1983 film)|Coolie]]'' in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor [[Puneet Issar]].<ref name="Coolie fight scene">{{cite web|publisher=Rediff.com |title=Bachchan injured whilst shooting scene |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm |accessdate=11 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070304103635/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a [[splenic rupture]] from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency [[splenectomy]] and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Amitabh-Bachchan-no-longer-excited-about-birthdays/Article1-463669.aspx |title=Amitabh Bachchan no longer excited about birthdays |work=Hindustan Times |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref>

Nevertheless, he spent many months recovering and resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top grossing film that year.<ref name="Coolie">{{cite web|publisher=Box Office India |title=Coolie a success |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=125&catName=MTk4MC0xOTg5 |accessdate=11 March 2007}}</ref>

The director, [[Manmohan Desai]], altered the ending of ''Coolie'' after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&ID=250266&subcatg=&keyword=Bollywood&nid=250266 |title=30 years after the Coolie accident: Big B's "second birthday" |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref>

Later, he was diagnosed with [[Myasthenia gravis]]. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received and stated before every release, "Yeh film to flop hogi!" ("This film will flop").<ref name="Myasthenia Gravis">{{cite web|publisher=mouthshut.com|title=Reviews on: To Be or Not To Be Amitabh Bachchan |author=Mohamed, Khalid|url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/To_Be_or_Not_To_Be_Amitabh_Bachchan_-_Khalid_Mohamed-72513-1.html |accessdate=11 March 2007}}</ref>

===Politics: 1984–87===
In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. He contested Allahabad's seat of [[8th Lok Sabha]] against [[H. N. Bahuguna]], former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh]] and won by one of the highest victory margins in [[General elections in India|general election history]] (68.2% of the vote).<ref name=election>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm |title=Amitabh Bachchan: Stint in Politics |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=5 December 2005| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060109123607/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm| archivedate= 9 January 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a [[cesspool]]. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the "[[Bofors scandal]]" by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court. Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan |title=Interview with Amitabh Bachchan |publisher=sathnam.com| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5ppKBfYB7 | archivedate = 18 May 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

His old friend, [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]], helped him during a financial crisis due to the failure of his company ABCL. Therefore Bachchan started to support Amar Singh's political party, the Samajwadi party. Jaya Bachchan joined the [[Samajwadi Party]] and became a [[Rajya Sabha]] member.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/18/stories/2007021804271000.htm "Bachchan has no plans for election."] ''The Hindu''.</ref> Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently gotten him into trouble again in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5bPT62ngo |title=Bollywood's Bachchan in trouble over crime claim |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=4 October 2007}}</ref>

A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by ''[[Stardust (magazine)|Stardust]]'' and some of the other film magazines. In his own defence, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldbh.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/01/27/2173/index.html |title=The 15-year ban on Bachchan! |publisher=Oldbh.bollywoodhungama.com |date=27 January 2007 |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>

===Slump and retirement: 1988–1992===
In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in ''[[Shahenshah (1988 film)|Shahenshah]]'', which was a box office success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors&PHPSESSID=cfa06e3b5a051913d58987e99cd292ae |work=boxofficeindia.com/topactors.htm |title=Top Actor}}</ref> After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'', for which he won his third [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]], looked like it might reverse this trend, but the momentum was short-lived as his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this period that Bachchan won his first [[National Film Award for Best Actor]], for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film ''[[Agneepath (1990 film)|Agneepath]]''. These years would be the last he would be seen on screen for some time. After the release of ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'' in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of ''[[Insaniyat (1994 film)|Insaniyat]]'' (1994) which was also a box office failure, he did not appear in any new releases for five years.<ref name="boxoffice1994">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=200&catName=MTk5NA== |publisher=Box Office India |title=Box Office 1994}}</ref>

===Producer and acting comeback 1996–99===
Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation]], Ltd. (A.B.C.L.) in 1996, with the vision of becoming a 10 billion rupees (approx 250 million $US) premier entertainment company by the year 2000.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering the entire section of the India's entertainment industry. Its operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, celebrity and event management.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film produced by the company was ''[[Tere Mere Sapne (1996 film)|Tere Mere Sapne]]'', which failed to do well at the box office but launched the careers of actors such as [[Arshad Warsi]] and South films star [[Simran (actress)|Simran]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ABCL produced a few other films, none of which did well.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film ''[[Mrityudata]]'', produced by ABCL. Though ''Mrityudaata'' attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ABCL was the main sponsor of the ''[[Miss World 1996|1996 Miss World beauty pageant]]'', [[Bangalore]] but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by Indian Industries board.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay [[bungalow]] 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of [[Canara Bank]] were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010304/spectrum/main1.htm |title=Muqaddar Ka Sikandar |author=Patil, Vimla |date=4 March 2001}}</ref>

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with ''[[Bade Miyan Chote Miyan]]'' (1998),<ref name="boxoffice1994"/> and received positive reviews for ''[[Sooryavansham]]'' (1999)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/1999/may/22soo.htm |author=Taliculam, Sharmila |title=He's back!}}</ref> but other films such as ''[[Lal Baadshah]]'' (1999) and ''[[Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999 film)|Hindustan Ki Kasam]]'' (1999) were box office failures.

===Return to prominence: 2000–present===
[[File:Amitabh Bachchan.jpg|thumb|Bachchan at the [[IIFA Awards]] in 2006]]
In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in [[Yash Chopra]]'s box-office hit, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'', directed by [[Aditya Chopra]]. He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of [[Shahrukh Khan]]. His role won him his third [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in ''[[Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love]]'' (2001), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Baghban (film)|Baghban]]'' (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in ''[[Aks (film)|Aks]]'' (2001), ''[[Aankhen (2002 film)|Aankhen]]'' (2002), ''[[Khakee]]'' (2004) and ''[[Dev (film)|Dev]]'' (2004). One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an ageing teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] and fourth [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]]. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' tribute ''[[Sarkar (film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006).

It won him his third [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] and fifth [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]].
