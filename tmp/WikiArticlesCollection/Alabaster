'''Alabaster'''  is a name applied to varieties of two distinct [[mineral]]s, when used as a material: [[gypsum]] (a [[Water of crystallization|hydrous]] [[sulfur|sulfate]] of [[calcium]]) and [[calcite]], a [[carbonate]] of calcium, also known as onyx-marble, Egyptian alabaster or Oriental alabaster, in geological terms is "a [[stalagmitic]] [[limestone]] marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown".<ref>Grove, 1</ref> In general, but not always, ancient Alabaster in Egypt and the Near & Middle East is calcite. Alabaster in medieval Europe is gypsum. Modern Alabaster is probably calcite, but may be either. Both are easy to 'work' and as both are slightly water soluble, have been used for making a variety of indoor artworks and carvings, as they will not survive long outdoors. 

The two kinds are distinguished from one another readily by differences in their relative hardness. The gypsum kind is so soft as to be readily scratched with a fingernail ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 1.5 to 2), while the calcite kind is too hard to be scratched in this way ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] 3), although it does yield readily to a knife. Moreover, the calcite alabaster, being a [[carbonate]], [[effervescence|effervesces]] upon being touched with [[hydrochloric acid]], whereas the gypsum alabaster, when thus treated, remains practically unaffected.

Owing to the characteristic color of white alabaster, the term has entered the vernacular as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] for [[white]] things, particularly "alabaster skin", which means very light and quite translucent, and possibly derives from the use of alabaster for tomb effigies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word ''alabaster'' is in Middle English, through Old French ''alabastre'', in turn derived from the [[Latin]] ''alabaster'' and that from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀλάβαστρος'' (''alabastros'') or ''ἀλάβαστος'' (''alabastos''). The latter was a term used to identify a vase made of alabaster.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233809 Alabastos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus</ref>

This name may derive further from the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian word ''a-labaste'', which refers to vessels of the Egyptian goddess [[Bast (mythology)|Bast]].  She was represented as a lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels.<ref>[http://www.yourdictionary.com/alabaster alabaster - definition at YourDictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/alabaster "alabaster"], ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Other suggestions include derivation from the town of [[Alabastron]] in Egypt.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

== Types ==

=== Calcite alabaster ===
This substance, the "alabaster" of the [[List of ancient Egyptians|Ancient Egyptians]] and [[Bible]], often is termed ''Oriental alabaster'', since the early examples came from the [[Far East]]. The [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''alabastrites'' is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron, in [[Egypt]], where the stone was quarried.  The locality probably owed its name to the mineral; the origin of the mineral name is obscure.

The "Oriental" alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called [[alabastron|alabastra]]; the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name. In Egypt craftsmen used alabaster for [[canopic jar]]s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A [[sarcophagus]], sculptured in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron, is in the [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], [[London]]. This was discovered by [[Giovanni Belzoni]] in 1817 in the tomb of [[Seti I]] near [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It was purchased by Sir [[John Soane]].

When cut in thin sheets, alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows.  It was used for this purpose in [[medieval]] churches, especially in [[Italy]]. Large alabaster sheets are used extensively in the contemporary [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]], which was dedicated in 2002 by the [[Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California Archdiocese]]. The cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque.

Calcite alabaster is found as either a [[stalagmite|stalagmitic]] deposit, from the floor and walls of [[limestone]] [[cavern]]s, or as a kind of [[travertine]], similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water. Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross-section, from which it derives its name: onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply as [[onyx]].  The latter term should be restricted to siliceous minerals, however.

Egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near [[Suez]] and [[Assiut]]. Many ancient quarries are found in the hills overlooking the plain of [[Tell el Amarna]].

[[Algeria]]n onyx-marble has been quarried largely in the province of [[Oran]]. In [[Mexico]], there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at [[La Pedrara]], in the district of [[Tecali]], near [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. Onyx-marble occurs also in the district of [[Tehuacán]] and at several localities in [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], and [[Virginia]].

=== Gypsum alabaster ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Henry IV of England]] -->
Gypsum alabaster was very widely used for small [[sculpture]] for indoor use in the ancient world, especially in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Fine detail could be obtained in a material with an attractive finish without iron or steel tools.  Alabaster was used for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity Bast in the culture of the Ancient Egyptians, and thousands of gypsum alabaster [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating to the late [[4th millennium BC]] also have been found in [[Tell Brak]] (present day [[Nagar, Syria|Nagar]]), in [[Syria]].<ref>http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&item=1988.323.8&viewmode=0&isHighlight=1</ref> In Mesopotamia, gypsum alabaster was the typical material for figures of deities and devotees from temples, as in a figure believed to represent the deity, [[Abu (god)|Abu]], dating to the first half of the [[3rd millennium BC]] in New York.<ref>http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/viewOne.asp?dep=3&viewmode=0&item=40%2E156</ref>

Gypsum alabaster is a common mineral, which occurs in England in the [[Keuper]] [[marl]]s of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], especially at [[Chellaston]] in [[Derbyshire]], at Fauld in [[Staffordshire]], and near [[Newark, England|Newark]] in [[Nottinghamshire]]. Deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively. In the 14th and 15th centuries its carving into small statues and sets of [[relief]] panels for [[altarpiece]]s was a valuable [[Nottingham Alabaster|local industry in Nottingham]], as well as a major English export. These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on [[tomb monument]]s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble. Besides examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the [[Nottingham Castle Museum]], [[British Museum]], and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the [[Musée de Cluny]], Spain, and Scandinavia.

Alabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at [[Watchet]] in [[Somerset]], near [[Penarth]] in [[Glamorganshire]], and elsewhere. In [[Cumbria]] it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or "floors" in spheroidal masses known as "balls" or "bowls" and in smaller lenticular masses termed "cakes." At Chellaston, where the local alabaster is known as "Patrick," it has been worked into ornaments under the name of "Derbyshire spar"—a term more properly applied to [[fluorspar]].

In [[Europe]], the centre of the alabaster trade today is [[Florence, Italy]]. [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with [[marl]]s of [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] age. The mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries, in the district of [[Volterra]]. Several varieties are recognized—veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from [[Castellina Marittima|Castellina]], is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved locally, into vases, lights, and various ornamental objects. These items are objects of extensive trade, especially in Florence, [[Pisa]], and [[Livorno]]. Spain and many other countries have deposits which have been worked.

=== Black alabaster ===
''Black alabaster'' is a rare form of the gypsum-based mineral. This black form is found in only three veins in the world, one each in [[Oklahoma]], [[Italy]], and [[China]].

[[Alabaster Caverns State Park]], near [[Freedom, Oklahoma]] is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster. There are several types of alabaster found at the site, including pink, white, and the rare black alabaster.

The finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an [[stone masonry|ornamental stone]], especially for [[ecclesiastical]] decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls. Its softness enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms, but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work. If alabaster with a smooth, polished surface is washed with washing-up liquid ([[dishwashing liquid]]), it will become rough, dull and whiter, losing most of its translucency and lustre.

The purest alabaster is a snow-white material of fine tiniforni grain, but it often is associated with an oxide of [[iron]], which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone. The coarser varieties of alabaster are converted by calcination into [[plaster of Paris]], whence they sometimes are known as "plaster stone."

In order to diminish the [[Translucent|translucency]] of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble, the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually—nearly to the boiling-point—an operation requiring great care, for if the temperature is not regulated carefully, the stone acquires a dead-white, chalky appearance. The effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum. If properly treated, it very closely resembles true marble and is known as marmo di Castellina.

Sulphate of lime (gypsum) also was used by the ancients. It was employed, for instance, in Assyrian sculpture. So some of the ancient alabaster is identical to the modern stone.

Alabaster may be stained to disguise it, by being heated in various pigmentary solutions. In this way a very misleading imitation of [[Coral (precious)|coral]] that is called alabaster coral is produced.
