The term '''''anthem''''' means either a specific form of [[Anglican church music]] (in [[music theory]] and religious contexts), or more generally, a song (or composition) of celebration, usually acting as a symbol for a distinct group of people, as in the term "[[national anthem]]".

==Etymology==

The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίφωνα}} (''antiphōna'') via [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|''antefn''}}, a word which originally had the same meaning as [[antiphon]].

==Anthems and the church==

An anthem is a form of church music, particularly in the service of the [[Church of England]], in which it is appointed by the [[rubric]]s to follow the third [[collect]] at both morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation service]]. The words are selected from [[Holy Scripture]] or in some cases from the [[Liturgy]], and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of [[psalm]] or [[hymn tune]]s. Though the anthem of the Church of England is analogous to the [[motet]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Lutheran Church]]es, both being written for a trained [[choir]] and not for the congregation, it is as a [[musical form]] essentially English in its origin and development. 

The anthem developed as a replacement for the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] "votive antiphon" commonly sung as an appendix to the main [[Liturgy of the Hours|office]] to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] or other saints. Although anthems were written in the [[Elizabethan period]] by [[Thomas Tallis|Tallis]] (1505–1585), [[William Byrd|Byrd]] (1539–1623), and others, they are not mentioned in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] until 1662, when the famous [[rubric]] "In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem" first appears.

In common usage among many [[Protestant]] churches, an "anthem" often refers to any short sacred [[Choral_music#Historical_overview_of_choral_music|choral work]] presented during the course of a [[worship service]]. In the context of an Anglican service, an "anthem" is a composition to an English religious text. From this widening usage has come the more modern sense of the word.

==Music theory==

Early anthems tended to be simple and [[homophony|homophonic]] in texture, so that the words could be clearly heard. Late in the sixteenth century the "[[verse anthem]]", in which passages for solo voices alternated with passages for full choir, developed. This became the dominant form in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], when composers such as [[Henry Purcell]] (1659–1695) and [[John Blow]] (1649–1708) wrote elaborate examples for the [[Chapel Royal]] with orchestral accompaniment. In the nineteenth century [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]] (1810–1876) wrote anthems influenced by contemporary [[oratorio]] which  stretch to several [[movement (music)|movements]] and last twenty minutes or longer. Later in the  century, [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] (1852–1924) used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure.

Many anthems have been composed since this time, generally by [[organist]]s rather than professional [[composer]]s and often in a conservative style. Major composers have usually composed anthems in response to commissions and for special occasions. Examples include [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''Great is the Lord'' (1912) and ''Give unto the Lord'' (1914) (both with orchestral accompaniment), [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]'' (1943) (a modern example of a multi-movement anthem and today heard mainly as a concert piece), and, on a much smaller scale, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''O taste and see'' (1952) (written for the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]). With the relaxation of the rule, in [[England]] at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertoire.

==Modern use==

The word "anthem" is commonly used to describe a celebratory song or composition for a distinct group, as in the term "national anthem". Many [[Pop music|pop song]]s are used as anthems, such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[We Are the Champions]]", which is commonly used as a [[sports anthem]]. The term "anthemic" is a modern word coined to describe music with a celebratory connotation. Since the target audience of pop music can vary greatly, so can the celebrated subject of the anthem. Examples of this wider range of anthem subjects include [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s "[[Irresponsible Hate Anthem]]" and [[Silverchair]]'s "[[Anthem for the Year 2000]]".
