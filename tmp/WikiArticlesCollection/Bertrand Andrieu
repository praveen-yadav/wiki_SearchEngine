'''Bertrand Andrieu''' (November 4, 1761 &ndash; December 10, 1822) was a  French engraver of medals from [[Bordeaux]].  In [[France]] he was considered as the restorer of the art, which had declined after the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and during the last twenty years of his life the French government commissiond him to undertake several works.  Many of his medals are figured in the ''Medallic History of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]''.
