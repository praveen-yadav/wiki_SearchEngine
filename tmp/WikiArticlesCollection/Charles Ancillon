'''Charles Ancillon''' (28 July 1659 – 5 July 1715)<ref name=Brit>"Ancillon, Charles" in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|The New Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 378.</ref> was a French [[jurist]] and [[diplomat]].

Ancillon was born in [[Metz]] into a distinguished family of [[Huguenot]]s.  His father, [[David Ancillon]] (1617–1692), was obliged to leave [[France]] on the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], and became pastor of the French [[Protestant]] community in [[Berlin]].

Ancillon studied law at [[Marburg]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]], where he was called to the bar.  At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] "''juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin''." Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.

In 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called ''Academie des nobles,'' the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of "[[King in Prussia]]" by the elector.  In 1699 he succeeded [[Samuel Pufendorf]] as historiographer to the elector, and the same year replaced his uncle [[Joseph Ancillon]] as judge of all the French refugees in the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].

Ancillon is mainly remembered for what he did for education in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]],  and the share he took, in co-operation with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], in founding the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Berlin]]. Of his fairly numerous works the one of the most value is the "''Histoire de l'etablissement des Francais refugies dans les etats de Brandebourg''" published in Berlin in 1690.
