==History==

The American Film Institute was founded by a 1965 presidential mandate announced in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] of the [[White House]] by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – to establish a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of American film heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work.

Two years later, in 1967, AFI was established, supported by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].

The original 22-member [[Board of Trustees]] included Chair [[Gregory Peck]] and Vice Chair [[Sidney Poitier]] as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Jack Valenti]] and other representatives from the arts and academia.[1]

The Institute established a training program for filmmakers known then as the Center for Advanced Film Studies. Also created in the early years were a repertory film exhibition program at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and the [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] — the definitive scholarly source for American film history.

The Institute moved to its current eight-acre [[Hollywood]] campus in 1981.  The film training program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], an accredited graduate school, widely regarded as one of the top film schools in the world.

AFI moved its presentation of first-run and auteur films from the Kennedy Center to the historic [[AFI Silver|1938 Art Deco AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center]], which now hosts two major film festivals – AFI FEST and AFI DOCS –making AFI the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the world.

AFI continues to educate global audiences and recognize artistic excellence through its awards programs and [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10 Lists]].

==AFI Conservatory==

In 1969, the Institute established the Center for Advanced Film Studies at [[Greystone Mansion|Greystone, the Doheny Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]].  The first class included filmmakers [[Terrence Malick]], [[David Lynch]], [[Caleb Deschanel]] and [[Paul Schrader]].  That program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], a fully accredited graduate [[film school]] located in the hills above Hollywood, California, providing training in six filmmaking disciplines: [[Cinematography]], [[Film directing|Directing]], [[Film editing|Editing]], [[Film production#Production|Producing]], [[Production design|Production Design]] and [[Screenwriting]].  Mirroring a professional production environment, Fellows collaborate to make more films than any other graduate level program. Admission to AFI Conservatory is highly selective, with a maximum of only 140 graduates per year.

In 2013, [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]® and [[Oscars|Oscar]]®-winning director, producer and screenwriter [[James L. Brooks]] ([[AS GOOD AS IT GETS]], [[Broadcast News (film)|BROADCAST NEWS]], [[Terms of Endearment|TERMS OF ENDEARMENT]]) joined AFI as Artistic Director of the AFI Conservatory where he provides creative leadership for the prestigious film program renowned for its collaborative approach to hands-on filmmaking with masters of the art form.
