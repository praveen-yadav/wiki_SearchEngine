A '''caldera''' is a cauldron-like [[volcano|volcanic]] feature usually formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption. They are sometimes confused with [[volcanic crater]]s. The word comes from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''caldera'', and this from [[Latin]] <small>CALDARIA</small>, meaning "cooking pot".  In some texts the English term ''[[cauldron]]'' is also used.

The term ''caldera'' was introduced into the geological vocabulary by the German geologist [[Leopold von Buch]] when he published his memoirs of a 1815 visit to the [[Canary Islands]], where he saw the Las Cañadas caldera of [[Teide]] and the [[Caldera de Taburiente]].

==Caldera formation==
[[File:Origin of volcanic caldera via analogue model.gif|thumb|left|Animation of analogue experiment showing origin of volcanic caldera in box filled with flour.]]
[[File:Toba zoom.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat]] image of [[Lake Toba]], on the island of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. A [[resurgent dome]] formed the island of [[Samosir]]. (100 km/62 mi long and 30 km/19 mi wide, a caldera of the world's largest class)]]

A collapse is triggered by the emptying of the [[magma chamber]] beneath the volcano, usually as the result of a large [[volcano|volcanic eruption]]. If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the ''volcanic edifice'' above it. A roughly circular fracture, the ''ring fault'', develops around the edge of the chamber. Ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions which are also known as ring dykes. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may be hundreds or thousands of square kilometers.

===Explosive calderas===
{{Details|Explosive eruption}} 
If the [[magma]] is rich in [[silica]], the caldera is often filled in with [[ignimbrite]], [[tuff]], [[rhyolite]], and other [[igneous rock]]s. Silica-rich magma has a high [[viscosity]], and therefore does not flow easily like [[basalt]]. As a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the magma. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth, the rapid off-loading of overlying material causes the trapped gases to decompress rapidly, thus triggering explosive destruction of the magma and spreading [[volcanic ash]] over wide areas. The lava of explosive calderas is called [[A'a]]. Further [[lava]] flows may be erupted.

If volcanic activity continues, the centre of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a ''[[resurgent dome]]'' such as is seen at [[Galán|Cerro Galán]], [[Lake Toba]], [[Yellowstone]], and so on, by subsequent intrusion of magma. A ''silicic'' or ''[[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] caldera'' may erupt hundreds or even thousands of cubic kilometers of material in a single event. Even small caldera-forming eruptions, such as [[Krakatoa]] in 1883 or [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991, may result in significant local destruction and a noticeable drop in temperature around the world. Large calderas may have even greater effects.

When [[Yellowstone Caldera]] last erupted some 650,000 years ago, it released about 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> of material (as measured in dense rock equivalent (DRE)), covering a substantial part of [[North America]] in up to two metres of debris. By comparison, when [[Mount St. Helens]] erupted in 1980, it released ~1.2&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (DRE) of ejecta. The ecological effects of the eruption of a large caldera can be seen in the record of the [[Lake Toba]] eruption in [[Indonesia]].

====Toba====
About 74,000 years ago, this Indonesian volcano released about 2,800 </sup> km<sup>3</sup> DRE of ejecta, the largest known eruption within the [[Quaternary]] Period (last 1.8&nbsp;million years) and the largest known explosive eruption within the last 25&nbsp;million years. In the late 1990s, [[anthropologist]] Stanley Ambrose<ref>[http://www.anthro.illinois.edu/people/ambrose Stanley Ambrose page at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]</ref> proposed that a [[volcanic winter]] induced by this eruption reduced the [[human]] population to about 2,000 - 20,000 individuals, resulting in a [[population bottleneck]] (''see'' [[Toba catastrophe theory]]). More recently several geneticists, including Lynn Jorde and [[Henry Harpending]] have proposed that the human race was reduced to approximately five to ten thousand people.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC2]], 3 February 2000</ref> However, there is no direct evidence that the theory is correct. And there is no evidence for any other animal decline or extinction, even in environmentally sensitive species.<ref>Gathorne-Hardy F.J. & Harcourt-Smith W.E.H. 2003. The super-eruption of Toba: did it cause a human bottleneck? ''Journal of Human Evolution''. '''45''', 227-230</ref> There is evidence that human habitation continued in [[India]] after the eruption.<ref>Petraglia M ''et al.''  2007. [http://toba.arch.ox.ac.uk/pub_files/Petraglia2007Science.pdf "Middle Paleolithic assemblages from the Indian subcontinent before and after the Toba super-eruption"]. Science 317 (5834): 114–116. doi:10.1126/science.1141564. PMID 17615356.</ref> The theory in its strongest form may be incorrect.

Eruptions forming even larger calderas are known, especially [[La Garita Caldera]] in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], where the 5,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> Fish Canyon [[Tuff]] was blasted out in a single major eruption about 27.8&nbsp;million years ago.

At some points in [[geological time]], rhyolitic calderas have appeared in distinct clusters. The remnants of such clusters may be found in places such as the San Juan Mountains of Colorado (formed during the [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]], and [[Pliocene]] periods) or the [[Saint Francois Mountain Range]] of [[Missouri]] (erupted during the [[Proterozoic]]).

===Non-explosive calderas===
Some volcanoes, such as [[shield volcano]]es [[Kīlauea]] and [[Mauna Loa]] (respectively the most active and second largest on Earth, [first being recently found Tamu Massif], are both on the island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]]), form calderas in a different fashion. The magma feeding these volcanoes is [[basalt]] which is silica poor. As a result, the magma is much less [[viscous]] than the magma of a rhyolitic volcano, and the magma chamber is drained by large lava flows rather than by explosive events. The resulting calderas are also known as subsidence calderas, and can form more gradually than explosive calderas. For instance, the caldera atop [[Fernandina Island]] underwent a collapse in 1968, when parts of the caldera floor dropped 350 meters.<ref name=gvp>{{cite gvp | vnum=1503-01=&volpage=photos&photo=062078 | title=Fernandina: Photo}}</ref> [[Kilauea]] Caldera has an inner crater known as Halema‘uma‘u, which has often been filled by a lava lake.

In April 2007, during the eruption, the summit floor of the [[Piton de la Fournaise]] on the island of [[Réunion]] the floor of the main crater suddenly dropped about 300 m. This was attributed to the withdrawal of magma which was being erupted through a vent lower down on the southern flank of the volcano.

It is very frequent for a caldera to become emptied by drainage of melted lava through a breach on the caldera's rim.

==Extraterrestrial calderas==
Since the early 1960s, it has been known that volcanism has occurred on other planets and moons in the [[Solar System]]. Through the use of manned and unmanned spacecraft, volcanism has been discovered on [[Venus]], [[Mars]], the [[Moon]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]], a satellite of [[Jupiter]]. None of these worlds have [[plate tectonics]], which contributes approximately 60% of the Earth's volcanic activity (the other 40% is attributed to hot spot volcanism).<ref name = "Wilson">{{Citation

The average caldera diameter on Venus is 68&nbsp;km. The average caldera diameter of Io is close to 40&nbsp;km, and the mode is 6&nbsp;km. [[Tvashtar Paterae]] is likely the largest caldera on Io with a diameter of 290&nbsp;km. The average caldera diameter of Mars is 48&nbsp;km, smaller than Venus. Calderas on Earth are the smallest of all planetary bodies and vary from 1.6 to 80&nbsp;km as a maximum.<ref>Gottsmann 2008</ref>

===The Moon===
The [[Moon]] has an outer shell of low density crystalline rock that is a few hundred kilometers thick, which formed due to a rapid creation. The craters of the moon have been well preserved through time and were once thought to have been the result of extreme volcanic activity, but instead were formed by meteorites, nearly all of which took place in the first few hundred million years after the Moon formed. Around 500&nbsp;million years afterward, the Moon's mantle was able to be extensively melted due to the decay of radioactive elements. Massive basaltic eruptions took place generally at the base of large impact craters. Also, eruptions may have taken place due to a magma reservoir at the base of the crust. This forms a dome, possibly the same morphology of a shield volcano where calderas universally are known to form.<ref name = "Wilson"/>

===Mars===
The volcanic activity of [[Mars]] is concentrated in two major provinces, [[Tharsis quadrangle|Tharsis]] and [[Elysium quadrangle|Elysium]]. Each province contains a series of giant shield volcanoes that are similar to what we see on Earth and likely are the result of mantle hot spots. The surfaces are dominated by lava flows, and all have one or more collapse calderas.<ref name = "Wilson"/> Mars has the largest volcano in the Solar System called [[Olympus Mons]], which is more than three times the height of Mount Everest, with a diameter of 520&nbsp;km (323 miles). The summit of the mountain has six nested calderas.<ref>Book Title Philip's World reference Atlas Including Stars and Planets ISBN 0-7537-0310-6 Publishing House Octopus publishing Group Ltd Page 9</ref>

===Venus===
Because there are no plate tectonics on [[Venus]], heat is only lost by conduction through the lithosphere. This causes enormous lava flows, accounting for 80% of Venus' surface area. Many of the mountains are large shield volcanoes that range in size from 150–400&nbsp;km in diameter and 2–4&nbsp;km high. More than 80 of these large shield volcanoes have summit calderas averaging 60&nbsp;km across.<ref name = "Wilson"/>

===Io===
Io, unusually, is heated by solid flexing due to the [[Tidal force|tidal]] influence of [[Jupiter]] and Io's [[orbital resonance]] with neighboring large moons [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], which keeps its orbit slightly [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]]. Unlike any of the planets mentioned, Io is continuously volcanically active and contains many calderas with diameters tens of kilometers across. For example, in 1979, ''The Voyager&nbsp;1'' and ''The Voyager&nbsp;2'' spotted nine erupting volcanoes while passing Io.<ref name = "Wilson"/>

==Mineralization==
Some calderas are known to host rich [[ore deposit]]s. One of the world's best preserved mineralized calderas is the [[Neoarchean]] [[Sturgeon Lake Caldera]] in [[northeastern Ontario]], [[Canada]].<ref>[http://www.d.umn.edu/prc/workshops/S08workshop.html UMD: Precambrian Research Center]</ref>
