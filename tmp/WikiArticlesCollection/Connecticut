It is bordered by [[Rhode Island]] to the east, [[Massachusetts]] to the north, [[New York]] to the west, and [[Long Island Sound]] to the south. 
Its capital city is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. The state is named after the [[Connecticut River]], a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word is a French corruption of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word ''quinetucket'', which means "long tidal river".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881|publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company|page=60}}</ref> 

Connecticut is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|3rd least extensive]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|29th most populous]] and [[List of U.S. states by population density|4th most densely populated]] of the [[50 United States]]. Called the ''[[Connecticut#Constitutional history|Constitution State]]'', ''[[Nutmeg]] State'', and "The Land of Steady Habits",<ref name=SOTS/> it was influential in the development of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the United States. Much of southern and western Connecticut (along with the majority of the state's population) is part of the [[New York metropolitan area]]: three of Connecticut's eight counties are statistically included in the [[New York metropolitan area#Components of the metropolitan area|New York City combined statistical area]], which is widely referred to as the [[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|Tri-State area]]. Connecticut's center of population is in [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/COP/ct_links.htm|title= State of Connecticut Center of Population - From ngs.noaa.gov|accessdate=January 30, 2009 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvhYPB |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> which is also located within the Tri-State area.

Connecticut's first European settlers were [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]]. They established a small, short-lived settlement in present-day Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers, called ''[[Fort Hoop|Huys de Goede Hoop]]''. Initially, half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony, [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] rivers. The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by England. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers overland from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded what would become the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in North America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a [[royal charter]], making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This colony was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]].

The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong [[wikt:Maritime|maritime]] tradition, which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial-services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and [[hedge fund]]s in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]]. As of the 2010 Census, Connecticut features the highest per-capita income, [[Human Development Index]] (0.962), and [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| date=November 29, 2005| title=Highest wages in East, lowest in South|work=USA Today| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2005-11-29-wage_x.htm | first1=Stephen | last1=Ohlemacher | accessdate=April 30, 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvtVNF |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| date=March 18, 2000| title=Census 2000| publisher=United States Census Bureau| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-P14&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-format=US-9|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkweQ74 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| date=July 17, 2008| title=US slips down development index|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7511426.stm|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkxLjnC |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> Although it is a wealthy state by most measures, the income gap between its urban and suburban areas is unusually wide.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/nyregion/09income.html | work=The New York Times | title=Income Gap in Connecticut Is Growing Fastest, Study Finds | date=April 9, 2008}}</ref>

Connecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and third largest city is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.
[[File:Approaching Summit Again.JPG|left|thumb|155px|Bear Mountain, highest peak in Connecticut]]

The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42° 3' N; 73° 29' W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref>

The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in the southeastern [[New London County]], it features beaches and maritime activities.

Although Connecticut has a long maritime history, and a reputation based on that history, Connecticut has no direct access to the sea. The jurisdiction of New York actually extends east at [[Fishers Island]], where New York shares a sea border with [[Rhode Island]] dividing [[Narragansett Bay]]. Although Connecticut has easy access to the Atlantic, between [[Long Island Sound]] and [[Block Island Sound]], Connecticut has no direct ocean coast.

Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns center around a "[[village green|green]]", such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in the state), and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white church, a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or "[[inn]]e", several [[colonial house]]s, and so on, establishing a scenic historic appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism.

Connecticut consists of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of [[Quercus|oaks]], [[Carya|hickories]], and [[Acer (genus)|maple]] cover much of the state.<ref name = "ecoregions">{{cite journal |author=Olson |title = Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year = 2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages= 933–938 |url = http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkyhbI6 |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no |author-separator = , |author2 = D.

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5&nbsp;mile (4.0&nbsp;km) square detour into Connecticut. The actual origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which was finally concluded in 1804, when southern Southwick, (whose residents sought to leave Massachusetts), was split in half.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf | title=The Southwick Jog|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5p1plFeFC |archivedate = April 16, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm|title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog| publisher=Connecticut State Library|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkzcI4A |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The southwestern border of Connecticut, where it abuts New York State, is marked by a [[panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] and part of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm| title=Connecticut's "Panhandle"| publisher=Connecticut State Library|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKl03gYx |archivedate = November 18, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Climate===
Interior portions of Connecticut have a [[humid continental climate]], while the Connecticut shoreline (the state's southern four counties) has a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] (sometimes statistically meeting this climate's criteria, sometimes not) with seasonal extremes tempered by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The city of Bridgeport (on Long Island Sound), like most other areas in [[Tri-State Region|metropolitan New York]], typically falls within the humid subtropical climate zone under the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system. Hartford (35&nbsp;miles inland) has a humid continental climate. Consistent with its coastal reputation, Connecticut is a moderately sunny state, averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title= United States annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}</ref>

Summer is hot and humid throughout the state, with average highs in New London of 81&nbsp;°F (27&nbsp;°C) and 87&nbsp;°F (31&nbsp;°C) in Windsor Locks. Although summers are quite sunny in Connecticut, summer thunderstorms often bring quick downpours and thunder and lighting. Winters are generally cool to cold from south to north in Connecticut, with average temperatures ranging from 38&nbsp;°F (3&nbsp;°C) in the maritime influenced southeast to 29&nbsp;°F (−2&nbsp;°C) in the northwest in January. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about 50–60" in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only 20-25" along the southeast coast of Connecticut. Early Spring (April) is coolish and mid and late Spring (May/early June) is warm to hot. Fall months are mild and bring colorful foliage across northern parts of the state (the southern and coastal areas have more oak and hickory trees and fewer maples) in October and November. During hurricane season, tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer, occurring on average 30 times annually. These storms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name="tornadoes">{{cite web| url= http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif | title=Annual average number of tornadoes| publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center | format = [[GIF]] | accessdate =October 24, 2006}}</ref> Connecticut's warmest temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the coldest temperature is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943 and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Ctcolony.png|thumb|right|400px|A map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies]]
The name of the state is an Anglicized version of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word "quinatucquet", meaning "upon the long river".<ref name="Project">{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project|title=Connecticut: A Guide to Its Roads, Lore and People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CPYfSsQ-WE4C&pg=PA3|accessdate=September 23, 2010 | publisher =US History Publishers|isbn=978-1-60354-007-0|page=3}}</ref> The Connecticut region was inhabited by the [[Mohegan]] tribe prior to European colonization. The first European explorer in Connecticut was the Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]]. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River (then known by the Dutch as Versche Rivier – "Fresh River") and built a fort at Dutch Point in what is present-day Hartford, which they called "House of Hope" ({{lang-nl|Huis van Hoop}}).

[[John Winthrop the Younger|John Winthrop]], then of Massachusetts, received permission to create a new colony at [[Saybrook Colony|Old Saybrook]] at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635. This was the first of three distinct colonies that later would be combined to make up Connecticut. Saybrook Colony was a direct challenge to Dutch claims. The colony was not more than a small outpost and never matured. In 1644, the Saybrook Colony merged itself into the Connecticut Colony.

The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm |title=Early Settlers of Connecticut | publisher = Connecticut State Library |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> However, the main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. The settlers were [[Puritan]]s from Massachusetts, led by [[Thomas Hooker]]. Hooker had been prominent in England and was a professor of theology at Cambridge. He was also an important political writer and made a significant contribution to Constitutional theory. He broke with the political leadership in Massachusetts, and, just as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] created a new polity in [[Rhode Island]], Hooker and his cohort did the same and established the [[Connecticut Colony]] at Hartford in 1636. This was the second of the three colonies.

The third colony was founded in March 1638. [[New Haven Colony]] (originally known as the Quinnipiack Colony<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wmdJAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=%22Quinnipiack+Colony%22&source=bl&ots=qlhXg47WX5&sig=uRj95lwKPHciDkRu6pv33drPd6Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=F-JKUoWlCIe14AO5ioGQBg&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Quinnipiack%20Colony%22&f=false |title=New Englander and Yale Review, |volume=47 |pages=176-177 |editors=Edward Royall Tyler, William Lathrop Kingsley, George Park Fisher, Timothy Dwight |publisher=W.L. Kingsley |date=January 1, 1887 }}</ref>) was established by [[John Davenport (clergyman)|John Davenport]], [[Theophilus Eaton]], and others at New Haven. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution, "The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony", which was signed on June 4, 1639.

Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the flood of English settlers from Massachusetts, they left their fort in 1654.

Neither the establishment of the Connecticut Colony or the Quinnipiack Colony was carried out with the sanction of the English Crown, and they were independent political entities. They naturally were presumptively English, but in a legal sense, they were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay. In 1662, Winthrop took advantage of this void in political affairs and obtained in England the charter by which the colonies of Connecticut and Quinnipiack were united. Although Winthrop's charter favored the Connecticut colony, New Haven remained a seat of government with Hartford until after the American Revolution.

Winthrop was very politically astute and secured the charter from the newly restored [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who granted the most liberal political terms.

Historically important colonial settlements included:
:[[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (1633)
:[[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] (1634)
:[[Deep River, Connecticut|Saybrook]] (1635)
:[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] (1636)
:[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] (1638)
:[[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] (1639)
:[[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] (1639)
:[[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] (1639)
:[[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] (1639)
:[[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] (1640)
:[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] (1641)
:[[New London, Connecticut|New London]] (1646)

Its first constitution, the "[[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]]", was adopted on January 14, 1639, while its [[Connecticut Constitution|current constitution]], the third for Connecticut, was adopted in 1965. Connecticut is the fifth of the original 13 states. The original constitutions influenced the US Constitution as one of the leading authors was [[Roger Sherman]] of New Haven.

The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. According to the Hartford Treaty with the Dutch, signed on September 19, 1650, but never ratified by the British, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich Bay]] for a distance of 20&nbsp;miles<ref name="BOWEN">{{Citation | last = Bowen | first = Clarence Winthrop | title = Boundary Disputes of Connecticut | place = Boston, [[Massachusetts|MA]] | year = 1882 | pages = 17–18}}.</ref><ref name="FLICK">{{Citation | editor-last = Flick | editor-first = Alexander C | title = History of the State of New York | volume = 2 | place = New York City | publisher = [[Columbia University]] Press | year = 1933–37 | pages = 50–57}}.</ref> "provided the said line come not within {{convert |10|mi|km}} [16&nbsp;km] of Hudson River.

Connecticut took its grant seriously, and established a ninth county between the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River]]s, named [[Westmoreland County, Connecticut|Westmoreland County]]. This resulted in the brief [[Pennamite Wars]] with [[Pennsylvania]].

Connecticut's lands also extended across northern Ohio, called the [[Western Reserve]] lands. The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio. Agreements with Pennsylvania and New York extinguished the land claims by Connecticut within its neighbors, creating the [[Connecticut Panhandle]].  The Western Reserve lands were relinquished to the federal government, which brought the state to its present boundaries other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Connecticut was 3,590,347 on July 1, 2012, a 0.5% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name="PopEstUS">{{cite web|url= http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2012/ | title=Annual Estimates of the Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico:  April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|format=[[comma-separated values|CSV]]|work= Population Estimates| publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division| month =December | year = 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>

As of 2012, Connecticut has an estimated population of 3,590,347,<ref name="stateest">{{cite web|date=June 21, 2006| url = http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/totals/2012/index.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Population for the United States, Regions, States, and Puerto Rico:  April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012| format= [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] | work= 2012 Population Estimates|publisher= US Census Bureau, Population Division|accessdate= December 24, 2012}}</ref> which is an increase of 9,638, or 0.2%, from the prior year and an increase of 16,250, or 0.5%, since the year 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 people (that is 222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and [[Human migration|migration]] within the country produced a net loss of 34,273 people. Based on the 2005 estimates, Connecticut moves from the 29th most populous state to 30th.<ref name=stateest />

6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male.

In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as "rural". The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, it was only 12.3%. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]]) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state. Eastern Connecticut is more culturally influenced by the greater New England area, including the cities of Boston and Providence.

The [[center of population]] of Connecticut is located in the town of [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State | year = 2000 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate = December 4, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqyj8Y7G |archivedate = January 17, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Race, ancestry, and language===
According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Connecticut had a population of 3,574,097. Racially and ethnically the state was:
* 77.6% White (71.2% [[Non-Hispanic White]], 6.4% [[White Hispanic]])
* 10.1% Black or [[African American]]

The state's most populous ethnic group, Non-Hispanic White, has declined from 98% in 1940 to 71% in 2010.<ref>{{cite web | title =Connecticut – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1790 to 1990|publisher=US Census Bureau|url= http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref>

As of 2004, 11.4% of the population (400,000) was foreign-born. In 1870, native-born Americans had accounted for 75% of the state's population, but that had dropped to 35% by 1918.

As of 2000, 81.69% of Connecticut residents age 5 and older spoke English at home and 8.42% spoke Spanish, followed by Italian at 1.59%, French at 1.31% and Polish at 1.20%.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=9&mode=state_tops&order=r | title = Most spoken languages in Connecticut| accessdate = January 16, 2007| work= Language Map| publisher=The Modern Language Association|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930171318/http%3A//www.mla.org/map_data_results%26state_id%3D9%26mode%3Dstate_tops%26order%3Dr |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl= yes}}</ref>

Connecticut has large Italian American, Irish American and [[English American]] populations, as well as [[German American]] and [[Portuguese American]] populations, second highest percentage of any state, behind Rhode Island (19.3%). [[Italian American|Italian]] is the largest ancestry group in five of the state's counties, while the [[Irish American|Irish]] are the largest group in Tolland county, [[French Canadians]] the largest group in Windham county. African Americans and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]] (mostly [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]]) are numerous in the urban areas of the state. Connecticut is also known for its relatively large [[Hungarian American]] population, the majority of which live in and around [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Naugatuck, Connecticut|Naugatuck]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Connecticut also has a sizable [[Polish American]] population, with [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] containing the largest [[Polish American]] population in the state.

More recent immigrant populations include those from [[India]], [[Philippines]], Laos, [[Vietnam]], Thailand, [[Indonesia]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], Guatemala, [[Panama]], Jamaica, [[Haiti]], Cape Verde and former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries.

As of 2011, 46.1% of Connecticut's population younger than age 1 were minorities.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html |title=Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot|last=Exner|first=Rich|date=June 3, 2012|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}</ref>

Recent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low. Connecticut is also home to New England's largest Protestant Church: [[The First Cathedral]] in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]] located in [[Hartford County]]. Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic [[Archdiocese of Hartford]], which is sovereign over the [[Diocese of Bridgeport]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]].

===Taxation===
Prior to 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only [[income tax]] system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.

In 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], an Independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. Since then, [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], has become the headquarters for a large number of America's largest [[hedge fund]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As of 2011, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into six tax brackets of 3%, 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5% and 6.7%.<ref name = "2011Sect6Summary" /> All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.

Connecticut levies a 6.35% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.<ref name="2011Sect6Summary">{{Citation | url = http://www.ct.gov/drs/cwp/view.asp?A=1514&Q=480936 | publisher = The State of Connecticut | title = Summary of Tax Provisions Contained in 2011 Conn.

All real and personal property located within the state of Connecticut is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. All assessments are at 70% of [[fair market value]]. Another 20% of the value may be taxed by the local government though.

[[Oyster]] harvesting has historically been an important source of income to towns along the Connecticut coastline. In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns. In 1911, Connecticut's oyster production reached its peak at nearly 25 million pounds of oyster meats. This was, at the time, higher than production in New York, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts.<ref>[http://connecticuthistory.org/oystering-in-connecticut-from-colonial-times-to-today/] Ct history.org "Oystering in CT, from Colonial Times to the 21st Century"</ref> During this time, the Connecticut coast was known, in the shellfishing industry, as the oyster capital of the world. Until 1969, Connecticut laws enacted before World War I restricted the harvesting of oysters in state-owned beds to vessels under sail. These laws prompted the construction of the oyster sloop style vessel to last well into the 20th century.<ref>''This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound''. Tom Andersen. p.90</ref> ''[[Hope (sloop)|Hope]]'', completed in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] in 1948, is believed to be the last oyster sloop built in Connecticut.

A report issued by the Connecticut Commission on Culture & Tourism on December 7, 2006, demonstrated that the economic impact of the arts, film, history and tourism generated more than $14&nbsp;billion in economic activity and 170,000 jobs annually. This provides $9&nbsp;billion in personal income for Connecticut residents and $1.7&nbsp;billion in state and local revenue.<ref>{{Citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.cultureandtourism.org/cct/lib/cct/Econ_Summary_Web2_%282%29.pdf | title = The Economic Impact of the Arts, Film, History, and Tourism Industries in Connecticut (Highlights) | place = CT | publisher = Commission on Culture and Tourism}}.</ref>

As of November 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 9%.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.bls.gov/lau/ | publisher = BLS | title = Local Area Unemployment Statistics}}.</ref>

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Connecticut}}
[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|300px|right|thumb|Map of Connecticut showing major highways]]

===Roads===
{{main |List of State Routes in Connecticut}}
The [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] (the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) running southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] running southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] running north to south in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] running north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Route 15 (Connecticut)|State Route 15]], running from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and running parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut]]. Route 15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls.  A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ | title = Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) | publisher = NYC roads}}.</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7]] in the west running parallel to the NY border, [[Route 8 (Connecticut)|State Route 8]] farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and running north-south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with U.S. 7, and [[Route 9 (Connecticut)|State Route 9]] in the east. See [[List of State Routes in Connecticut]] for an overview of the state's highway system.

Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ctrides.com/ | title= CT rides |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref>

Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the US Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.

[[File:Metro-North train 1567 enters Stamford.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]] train leaving [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford Station]]]]

===Rail===
Southwestern Connecticut is served by MTA's [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]], providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing [[New Canaan Branch|New Canaan]], [[Danbury Branch|Danbury]], and [[Waterbury Branch|Waterbury]]. Connecticut lies along [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] which features frequent [[Northeast Regional]] and [[Acela Express]] service. Towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the [[Shore Line East]] commuter line. Operation of commuter trains from New Haven to Springfield on Amtrak's [[New Haven-Springfield Line]] is under consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhhsrail.com/ |title=NHHS Rail |publisher=NHHS Rail |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], servicing Hartford and other towns on the corridor.

===Bus===
Statewide [[bus]] service is supplied by [[Connecticut Transit]], owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. A three-year construction project to build a [[bus rapid transit|BRT]] [[New Britain–Hartford Busway|busway from New Britain to Hartford]] began in August 2009.<ref>{{cite press release |title=New Britain-to-Hartford ‘Busway’ Receives Final Federal Design Approval |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=October 31, 2006 |url= http://www.ct.gov/governorrell/cwp/view.asp?Q=326626&A=2425 |accessdate=January 29, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrapidtransit.com/ct_schedule.asp |title=New Britain-Hartford Rapid Transit Project Schedule |publisher=CT rapid transit |accessdate = July 25, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

===Air===
[[Bradley International Airport]] is located in [[Windsor Locks]], 15&nbsp;miles (24&nbsp;km) north of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Regional air service is provided at [[Tweed New Haven Regional Airport]]. Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut, and [[Groton-New London Airport]] in eastern Connecticut.  [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation.

===Ferry===
The [[Rocky Hill – Glastonbury Ferry]] and the [[Chester–Hadlyme Ferry]] cross the Connecticut River.  The [[Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry]] travels between [[Bridgeport, CT]] and [[Port Jefferson, New York]] by crossing [[Long Island Sound]].  Ferry service also operates out of [[New London, CT]] to [[Orient, NY]], [[Fishers Island, NY]] and [[Block Island, RI]].

[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] has been the sole capital of Connecticut since 1875. Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name="AboutCT"/>

===Constitutional history===
{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}
Connecticut is known as the "Constitution State". While the origin on this title is uncertain, the nickname may either refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638–39 or possibly the "Great Compromise" ("Connecticut Compromise") of the 1787 Constitutional convention. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of [[Connecticut Constitutional History]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.

Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.

The more likely source of the nickname "Constitution State" comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Although variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, Connecticut's plan is the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.

===Executive===
The governor heads the executive branch. [[Dan Malloy]] is the current [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]] and [[Nancy Wyman]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]], both are Democrats. Malloy, the former mayor of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], won the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 general election]] for Governor, and was sworn in on January 5, 2011. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut.  This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.

There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&q=246450| title=Connecticut's Executive Branch of Government| publisher=ct.gov}}</ref>

In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name="AboutCT"/>

===Legislative===
The legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name="AboutCT"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.  The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House.<ref name ="CT_CONST">{{Citation | url = http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392288/ | title = Constitution of the State of Connecticut | place = CT | publisher = Secretary of State | accessdate = April 30, 2012}}.</ref>  As of 2012, [[Christopher G. Donovan]] is the current Speaker of the House of Connecticut.

Connecticut's current [[United States Senators]] are [[Richard Blumenthal]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Murphy (politician)|Chris Murphy]] (Democrat). Connecticut currently has five [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from Connecticut|representatives in the U.S. House]], all of whom are Democrats.

Locally elected representatives also develop [[Local ordinance]]s to govern cities and towns.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/ordinances.htm |title= Ordinances and Charters by Town – Judicial Branch Law Libraries | publisher = Judiciary | location = CT |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref> The town ordinances often include [[noise pollution#Human|noise control]] and [[zoning]] guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|author=Town of Newtown, CT |url = http://www.newtown-ct.gov/Public_Documents/NewtownCT_Police/Ord%20Folder/Ordinances/262 |title= Noise Control Ordinance | publisher = The Government of Newtown |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref> However, the State of Connecticut does also provide state-wide ordinances for noise control as well.<ref>{{Citation | format = [[PDF]] | publisher = The Government of Connecticut | url = http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/regulations/22a/22a-69-1through7.pdf | title = Regulations}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

===Judicial===
The highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. The current [[Chief Justice]] is [[Chase T. Rogers]].

In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.<ref>[http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html History of the Connecticut Courts]. Last retrieved February 20, 2007.</ref> The Appellate Court is a lesser state-wide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.

The State of Connecticut also offers access to [[Arrest warrant]] enforcement statistics through the Office of Policy and Management.<ref>{{cite web|author=Enter your Company or Top-Level Office |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2969&Q=383588&opm_Nav_GID=1797 |title=OPM: Arrest Warrant Data |publisher=Ct.gov |date=May 15, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

Connecticut shares with the rest of [[New England]] a governmental institution called the [[New England town]]. The state is divided into 169 towns, which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.<ref name="AboutCT"/> There are also 21 cities,<ref name="AboutCT"/> most of which are coterminous with their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: [[Groton (city), Connecticut|City of Groton]], which is a subsection of the [[Groton (town), Connecticut|Town of Groton]], and the City of [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]] in the Town of [[Winchester, Connecticut|Winchester]].

===Registered Voters===
Connecticut residents who register to vote have the option of declaring an affiliation to a political party, may become unaffiliated at will, and may change affiliations subject to certain waiting periods. {{as of|2013}} about 58% of registered voters are enrolled (about 1% total in 18 [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] minor parties), and ratios among unaffiliated voters and the two major parties are about 8 unaffiliated for every 7 in the [[Democratic Party of Connecticut]] and for every 4 in the [[Connecticut Republican Party]].

(Among the minor parties, the [[Libertarian Party of Connecticut|Libertarian Party]] and [[Independent Party of Connecticut|Independent Party]] appeared in the Presidential-electors column in 2012, and drew, respectively, 0.81% and 0.35% of the vote.)

Many Connecticut towns show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party.{{Ref}}

=== Political Office ===
Elections in Connecticut take place mostly at the levels of town and/or city, state legislative districts for both houses, Congressional districts, and state-wide. In almost all races, the two major parties have some practical advantages granted on the basis of their respective performances in the most recent election covering the same constituency. Several processes, to varying degrees internal to either a major or minor party, are in practice nearly prerequisites to being permitted mention on the provided ballots, and even more so to winning office.

More specifically, the status of "major party" is usually reconfirmed every four years, as belonging to the two parties that polled best, statewide, in the gubernatorial column; this status includes the benefit of appearing in one of the top two rows on the ballot provided the party has at least one candidate on the ballot. Minor parties appear below major parties, and their performance in recent elections determines whether a candidates who wins in their nomination process must also meet a petitioning threshold in order to appear.

In a major party, a party convention for the office's constituency must be held; in practice, at the town level, a major party convention of voters of the town who are enrolled in the party usually is attended almost exclusively by members of the town party committee. The convention may choose to endorse a candidate, who will appear on the ballot unless additional candidates meet a petition threshold for a primary election; if at least one candidate meets the petition threshold, the endorsed candidate and all who meet the threshold appear on the primary ballot, and the winner of the primary election appears on the party line for that office.

A candidate wishing to run on the ballot line of a minor-party which has recently enough met a general-election vote threshold follows similar steps; candidates of other minor parties must meet petition thresholds, and if other candidates of the same party, for the same office, do so as well, only the winner of a resulting primary will appear on the ballot.

Campaigns by candidates not on the ballot generally are entirely symbolic, and while any voter can cast a write-in ballot, write-in ballots are not even tallied by election officials, except for candidates who have submitted a formal request that the tally be made.

In short, most winning candidates have won the endorsement of the applicable ''major''-party convention; nearly all of the rest have won with a ''professionally-managed'' primary-election campaign; and successful minor-party candidates are almost without exception major-party figures like [[Lowell Weicker]] whose minor parties disappear after that success. ([[A Connecticut Party]], which Weicker founded, became nominally the leading major party, and state law was changed during his administration to provide that in a situation such as his win, the top ''three ''parties in the governor's race all became major parties.<!-- Alert readers will notice that i have no idea whether that change remains in effect! -->)

The suburban towns of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] and [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in Fairfield County are considered the most Republican areas in the state. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], a wealthy town a few miles to the east, is often considered one of the most loyally Democratic, liberal towns in Fairfield County. The historically Republican-leaning wealthy town of [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] voted in the majority for [[Barack Obama]] in the 2008 Presidential Election. [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], two larger, mixed-income communities in Fairfield County, have in many elections favored moderate Republicans including former Governor [[John G. Rowland]] and former Congressman [[Chris Shays]], however they have favored Democrats in recent US presidential election years, with Shays being defeated by Democrat [[Jim Himes]] in the 2008 election.

The state's Republican-leaning areas are the rural [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]] and adjoining towns in the west of [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], the industrial towns of the [[Naugatuck River Valley]], and some of the affluent [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] towns near the New York border.

Lieberman's predecessor, [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], was the last Connecticut Republican to serve as Senator. Weicker was known as a liberal Republican. He broke with President [[Richard Nixon]] during [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] and successfully ran for governor in 1990 as an independent, creating [[A Connecticut Party]] as his election vehicle. Before Weicker, the last [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to represent Connecticut in the Senate was [[Prescott Bush]], the father of former President [[George H.W. Bush]] and the grandfather of former President [[George W. Bush]]. He served 1953–63.

===Democratic Areas===
[[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] has a Democratic registration edge, but usually favors conservative candidates of both traditional parties. In [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] unaffiliated voters outnumber voters registered with either major party. Other smaller cities including [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]] favor Democratic candidates.

As of 2011, Democrats controlled all five federal congressional seats. The remaining Republican, [[Chris Shays]], lost his seat to Democrat Jim Himes in the Congressional Election in 2008.

===Senators===
[[Chris Murphy (politician)|Chris Murphy]] and [[Richard Blumenthal]] are Connecticut's [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]]. Both senators from Connecticut are Democrats.

It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg (which in the 18th and 19th centuries was a very valuable spice).

It is also facetiously said to come from [[Yankee]] peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved nobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.<ref name = "cslib" /> [[George Washington]] gave Connecticut the title of ''"The Provisions State"''<ref name=SOTS/> because of the material aid the state rendered to the [[American Revolutionary War]] effort.

According to Webster's New International Dictionary, 1993, a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a "Connecticuter". There are numerous other terms coined in print, but not in use, such as: "Connecticotian" – [[Cotton Mather]] in 1702.  "Connecticutensian" – [[Samuel Peters]] in 1781.  "[[Nutmegger]]" is sometimes used,<ref name = "cslib">{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm| title= Connecticut's Nicknames| publisher= Connecticut State Library | accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> as is "[[Yankee]]" (the official state song is "[[Yankee Doodle]]"), though this usually refers someone from the wider [[New England]] region (and in the Southern United States, to anyone who lives north of the [[Mason-Dixon Line]]).  Linguist Allen Walker Read reports a more playful term, 'connecticutie.' The traditional abbreviation of the state's name is "Conn."; the official [[United States postal abbreviations|postal abbreviation]] is CT.

[[Commemorative stamp]]s issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] with Connecticut themes include [[Nathan Hale]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], [[Noah Webster]], [[Eli Whitney]], the [[whaling]] ship the [[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]] which is docked in [[Mystic Seaport]], and a [[decoy]] of a broadbill [[duck]].
