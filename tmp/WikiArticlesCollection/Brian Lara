'''Brian Charles Lara''', [[Trinity Cross|TC]], [[Order of the Caribbean Community|OCC]], [[Honorary Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] (born 2 May 1969) is a former [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian]] international [[cricket]] player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52337.html|title=Player Profile: Brian Lara|work=CricInfo|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/serialisations/article3694486.ece |title= Genius of Brian Lara hailed by Wisden |work=The Times |location=UK  | date=7 April 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Mike | last=Atherton}}</ref> He is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of his era<ref> {{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4472818.stm |title=Lara the best ever?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/268732.html |title='Lara the greatest among his peers'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Cricket/CricketFeatures/501-reasons-why-Lara-was-the-best/Article1-1071627.aspx |title='501 reasons why Lara the best'}}</ref> and one of the finest ever to have graced the game.

==Early life==
Lara was the 10th of 11 children. Lara's father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan secondary, which is located in Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to [[Fatima College]] where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.

Lara moved in with his future fellow Trinidadian cricketer [[Michael Carew]] in Woodbrook, [[Port of Spain]] (a 20 minute drive from Santa Cruz). Michael's father [[Joey Carew]] worked with him on his cricketing and personal career development. Michael got Lara his first job at [[House of Angostura|Angostura Ltd.]] in the marketing department. Lara played in Trinidad and Tobago junior [[soccer]] and [[table tennis]] sides but Lara believed that cricket was his path to success, saying that he wanted to emulate his idols [[Gordon Greenidge]], [[Viv Richards]] and [[Roy Fredericks]].

==Early First-class career==
1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by [[Carl Hooper]] set the previous year.<ref>[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html ''The Coming Foretold'']{{dead link|date=June 2012}} [[The Independent]]. Retrieved 30 July 2007.</ref> He captained the tournament-winning Trinidad and Tobago, who profited from a match-winning 116 from Lara.

In January 1988, Lara made his first-class debut for [[Trinidad and Tobago cricket team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[Red Stripe Cup]] against [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leeward Islands]]. In his second first-class match he made 92 against a [[Barbados cricket team|Barbados]] attack containing [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]], two greats of [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] teams. Later in the same year, he captained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bicentennial Youth World Cup where the West Indies reached the semi-finals. Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies under 23 XI against the touring Indian team further elevated his reputation.

His first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in [[Zimbabwe]] and scored 145.

In 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day [[Geddes Grant Shield]]. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11.

==International career==
In January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus Australia in Sydney. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2–1. Lara went on to name his daughter Sydney after scoring 277 at SCG.

Lara holds several world records for high scoring. He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were [[Roger Twose]] (115 partnership – 2nd wicket), [[Trevor Penney]] (314 – 3rd), [[Paul Smith (cricketer)|Paul Smith]] (51 – 4th) and [[Keith John Piper|Keith Piper]] (322 unbroken – 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.
[[File:BrianLaraUkexpat.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Brian Lara batting for the West Indies against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, in 2002.]]

He is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player after [[Donald Bradman]] to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second after [[Bill Ponsford]] to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, second only to Bradman's twelve. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2–2. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in an innings of 226 played at [[Adelaide Oval]], Australia in November 2005. This would be later broken by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[India]] on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] 2008.

Lara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Following this they played [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] in a four-Test series which was drawn 2–2, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.

The [[Wisden 100]] rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998–99 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936–37.

In 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty – including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test Match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever faced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/133274.html |title=Murali: 'Lara's still No. 1' |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>

Lara was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1–0 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy.

In March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal [[Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable & Wireless]] sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, [[Digicel]]. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars [[Chris Gayle]], [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and [[Dwayne Bravo]]. Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/146390.html |title='I'm ready to play if best team is selected' – Lara |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring [[South African cricket team|South African team]].

Lara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly appointed [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]]. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados which the West Indies eventually won.

On 26 April 2006 Lara was reappointed the captain of the West Indies cricket team for the third time.  This followed the resignation of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had been captain for thirteen months – in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed. In May 2006, Lara led the West Indies to successful One-Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India. Lara's team played Australia in the finals of the DLF Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy where they finished runners up in both finals.

On 16 December 2006 he became the first player for the West Indies to pass 10,000 One Day International runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingCareerRuns_ODI.asp?Stat=5000 |title= ODI Batting Statistics}}</ref> along with [[Sachin Tendulkar]] one of only two players, at the time, to do so in both forms of the game. On 10 April 2007 Lara confirmed his retirement from one day cricket post the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/west_indies/6543709.stm ''Lara confirms one-day retirement''] [[BBC News]].

Retrieved 30 July 2007.</ref>

Lara played his final international game on 21 April 2007 in a [[dead rubber]] World Cup game against England. He was run out for 18 after a mix up with Marlon Samuels; England won the game by 1 wicket. Before the end of this World Cup Glenn McGrath stated that Lara is the greatest batsman that he has ever bowled to.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/wc2007/2007/apr/28mcgrath.htm ''McGrath rates Lara just ahead of Tendulkar''].

==Retirement==
[[Image:Lara.kings.jpg|thumb|right|Lara in [[Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]] as the "ambassador" for the [[Bangladesh Premier League|BPL]] side [[Chittagong Kings]], 2013.]]
On 19 April 2007 Lara announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket, indicating that the West Indies vs England match on 21 April 2007 would be his last international appearance.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/lara-turns-his-back-on-cricket/2007/04/20/1176697042541.html ''Lara turns his back on cricket''] retrieved on 29 April 2007</ref> He was run out after a bad mixup with [[Marlon Samuels]] for 18, as England went on to win the match by one wicket.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6576083.stm ''West Indies v England''] [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 29 July 2007.</ref>

He announced before the 2007 Cricket World Cup that this would be his last appearance in One Day Internationals. After his last match, in the post-game presentation interview, he asked the fans, "Did I entertain?", to which he received a resounding cheer from the crowd,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/serialisations/article3694486.ece |title=Genius of Brian Lara hailed by Wisden |newspaper=Guardian |first=Mike |last=Atherton |date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref> after which he went out and took his 'lap of honour' where he met and shook hands with many of the fans. Lara stated this would be his last appearance in international cricket, he has also indicated his interest in retaining some involvement in the sport.

On 23 July 2007 Lara agreed to sign for the [[Indian Cricket League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/303309.html |title=Lara signs up for new Indian league |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> He is  the former captain of the [[Mumbai Champs]]. He volunteered to play for his home team Trinidad during the start of 2008 domestic season. He had not played for Trinidad for the last two years. He made his comeback a memorable one with a match winning hundred over Guyana, followed by a dismissive undefeated half-century in the second innings, scored at over two runs per ball. In the third round game (Trinidad got a bye in the second round).

Lara suffered a fractured arm against the Leeward Islands in St Maarten on 19 January, which kept him out of the ICL season. He nevertheless affirmed his commitment to returning to Twenty20 cricket,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/mcc/content/story/464785.html|title=Brian Lara maintains Twenty20 comeback plans|date=29 June 2010|work=[[Cricinfo]]|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> and on 27 June 2010 appeared for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] match against a touring Pakistan team, scoring 37 from 32 balls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/england-v-pakistan-2010/engine/current/match/462605.html|title=Scorecard: Pakistan tour of England – tour match Marylebone Cricket Club v Pakistanis|work=CricInfo|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>

==Controversies==
On the fourth day of the first Test match at Antigua Recreation Ground, St John's, Antigua during India's tour of West Indies, 2006, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]]'s flick off [[Dave Mohammed]] to the midwicket region was caught by [[Daren Ganga]]. As the batsman started to walk back, captain [[Rahul Dravid]] declared the innings when confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side, Brian Lara wanted Dhoni to walk-off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes. Ultimately, Dhoni walked-off and Dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed. Lara was called by the match referee for explanation of his actions but was not fined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wivind/content/story/250387.html |title=Lara did not cross the line |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>

==Records==
{{see also|List of international cricket centuries by Brian Lara}}
[[File:Brian Lara Graph.png|right|thumb|350px|Brian Lara's career performance graph.]]
* Lara struck 277 runs against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]], his '''maiden Test [[Century (cricket)|century]]''', the fourth highest maiden Test century by any batsman,<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/HIGHEST_MAIDEN_TONS.html Highest Maiden Tons] Stats from CricInfo. Retrieved 30 July 2007.</ref> the highest individual score in all Tests between the two teams and the fourth-highest century ever recorded against Australia by any Test batsman.
* He became the '''first man to score seven centuries in eight [[First-class cricket|first-class]] innings''', the first being the record 375 against [[English cricket team|England]] and the last being the record 501 not out against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]].
* After [[Matthew Hayden]] had eclipsed his '''Test record for highest individual score''' 375 by five runs in 2003, he '''reclaimed''' the record scoring 400 not out in 2004 against England. With these innings he became the second player to score two Test triple centuries, the second player to score two career quadruple centuries, the only player to achieve both these milestones, and regained the distinction of being the holder of both the record first-class individual innings and the record Test individual innings. He is the only player to break the world record twice.
* In the same innings, he became the second batsman to score 1000 Test runs in five different years, four days after Matthew Hayden first set the record.
* He was the '''all-time leading run scorer in Test cricket''', a record he attained on 26 November 2005<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/TEST_BAT_MOST_RUNS.html Most Test Runs] Stats from CricInfo retrieved 30 July 2007</ref> until surpassed by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] on 17 October 2008.

** Nine of his centuries are double centuries (surpassed only by [[Donald Bradman]])<ref name=C1/>
** Two of them are triple-centuries (matched by Australia's [[Donald Bradman]],<ref name=C1/> India's [[Virender Sehwag]], and West Indies' [[Chris Gayle]]).
** He has scored '''centuries against all Test-playing nations'''. He achieved this feat in 2005 by scoring his first Test century against Pakistan at the [[Kensington Oval]] in Bridgetown, Barbados.
* He became the sixth batsman to score a century in one session, doing so against Pakistan on 21 November 2006.<ref>[http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/100_BEFORE_LUNCH.html 100 Before Lunch] Stats from CricInfo retrieved 30 July 2007</ref>

Lara scored 688 runs (42% of team output, a record for a series of three or more Tests, and the second highest aggregate runs in history for a three-Test series) in the 2001–02 tour of [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://www.cricinfo.com/db/STATS/TESTS/BATTING/HI_AGG_RUNS_IN_SERIES.html Highest Aggregate runs in series] Stats from CricInfo retrieved 30 July 2007</ref>

* In 1994, he was awarded the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Overseas Personality]] Award. In 1995, he was chosen as one of the [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]].
* Comfortably [[batting average|averaging]] over 50 per innings (the benchmark for batting greatness in Test cricket), Lara has been ranked the '''number one batsman in Test cricket''' in the [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] Cricket Ratings several times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pwcratings.com |title=PricewaterhouseCoopers}}</ref>
* Lara has played some of his best innings in recent years. [[Wisden]] published a [[Wisden 100|top 100 list]] in July 2001, a distillation of the best performances from 1,552 Tests, 54,494 innings and 29,730 bowling performances. Three innings by Lara were placed in the top 15 (the most for any batsman in that range).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/30bat100.htm |publisher=rediff.com |work=Cricket channel |title=Top 100 Batsmen of all time}}</ref> His 153 not out in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]], during West Indies' 2–2 home series draw against Australia in *1998–1999 was deemed the second greatest Test innings ever played, behind Bradman's 270 against England in the Third Test of the 1936–1937 series at [[Melbourne cricket ground|Melbourne]].
