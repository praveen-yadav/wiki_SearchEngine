'''Bohrium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Bh''' and [[atomic number]] 107, named in honor of [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. It is a [[synthetic element]] (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>270</sup>Bh, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 61&nbsp;seconds.

In the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 7 elements]]. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[rhenium]] in group 7. The chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.

==History==
[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The element 107 was originally proposed to be named after [[Niels Bohr]] (left side), a [[Denmark|Danish]] nuclear physicist, with the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns). This name was later changed by [[IUPAC]] to ''bohrium'' (Bh).]]

===Official discovery===
Bohrium was first convincingly [[discovery of the chemical elements|synthesized]] in 1981 by a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]] at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|Institute for Heavy Ion Research]] (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in [[Darmstadt]]. The team bombarded a target of [[bismuth-209]] with accelerated nuclei of [[chromium]]-54 to produce 5 atoms of the [[isotope]] bohrium-262:<ref name="262Bh">{{cite doi|10.1007/BF01412623}}</ref>

:{{Nuclide|Link|bismuth|209}} + {{Nuclide|Link|chromium|54}} → {{Nuclide|Link|bohrium|262}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|neutron}}

The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.<ref name="93TWG">{{cite doi|10.1351/pac199365081757}}</ref>

===Proposed names===
The German group suggested the name ''nielsbohrium'' with symbol ''Ns'' to honor the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. The Soviet scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called [[dubnium]]) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1351/pac199365081815}}</ref>

There was an [[element naming controversy]] as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the [[IUPAC]] adopted ''unnilseptium'' (symbol ''Uns'') as a temporary, [[systematic element name]] for this element.<ref name=IUPAC97>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199769122471|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997)|year=1997|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=69|pages=2471|issue=12}}</ref> In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named ''bohrium'', not ''nielsbohrium'', since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element.<ref name=IUPAC97/><ref name=IUPAC94>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994)|year=1994|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=66|pages=2419|issue=12}}</ref> This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with [[boron]] and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective [[oxyanion]]s, ''bohrate'' and ''borate''. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name ''bohrium'', and thus the name ''bohrium'' for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997.<ref name=IUPAC97/> The IUPAC subsequently decided that bohrium salts should be called ''bohriates'' instead of ''bohrates''{{Citation needed|reason=there is no such word in the IUPAC site. IUPAC Red Book (2005) gives "bohrate"|date=November 2013}}.

Bohrium has no stable or naturally-occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eleven different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known [[metastable state]]. All of these decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.<ref name=nuclidetable/>

===Stability and half-lives===
The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100&nbsp;ms for <sup>260</sup>Bh, <sup>261</sup>Bh, <sup>262</sup>Bh, and <sup>262m</sup>Bh were observed. <sup>264</sup>Bh, <sup>265</sup>Bh, <sup>266</sup>Bh, and <sup>271</sup>Bh are more stable at around 1&nbsp;s, and <sup>267</sup>Bh and <sup>272</sup>Bh have half-lives of about 10&nbsp;s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with <sup>270</sup>Bh and <sup>274</sup>Bh having measured half-lives of about 61&nbsp;s and 54&nbsp;s respectively. The unknown isotopes <sup>273</sup>Bh and <sup>275</sup>Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90&nbsp;minutes and 40&nbsp;minutes respectively. Before its discovery, <sup>274</sup>Bh was also predicted to have a long half-life of 90&nbsp;minutes, but it was found to have a shorter half-life of only about 54&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=nuclidetable/>

The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 265, 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The four most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, and 274 appear in the decay chains of <sup>282</sup>113, <sup>287</sup>115, <sup>288</sup>115, and <sup>294</sup>117 respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from 8&nbsp;miliseconds to 1&nbsp;minute.<ref name="Doi_">{{cite journal|last1=Münzenberg|first1=G.|last2=Gupta|first2=M.|title=Handbook of Nuclear Chemistry|pages=877|year=2011|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0720-2_19|chapter=Production and Identification of Transactinide Elements|isbn=978-1-4419-0719-6}}</ref>

==Chemical properties==
===Extrapolated===
Bohrium is projected to be the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group VII in the Periodic Table, below [[manganese]], [[technetium]] and [[rhenium]]. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well.

The heavier members of the group are known to form volatile heptoxides M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO<sub>4</sub>.
Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO<sub>3</sub>Cl, so BhO<sub>3</sub>Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO<sub>3</sub>F and MO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub> for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF<sub>5</sub> and ReF<sub>7</sub>. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.

Bohrium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a [[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal structure (<sup>''c''</sup>/<sub>''a''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.62), similar to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] rhenium.<ref name=hcp/>

===Experimental===
In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malmbeck|first1=R.|last2=Skarnemark|first2=G.|last3=Alstad|first3=J.|last4=Fure|first4=K.|last5=Johansson|first5=M.|last6=Omtvedt|first6=J. P.|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=246|pages=349|year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1006791027906|issue=2}}</ref>

In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, the 107th element does behave like a typical [[group 7 element]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gäggeler|first1=H. W.|last2=Eichler|first2=R.|last3=Brüchle|first3=W.|last4=Dressler|first4=R.|last5=Düllmann|first5=Ch.E.|last6=Eichler|first6=B.|last7=Gregorich|first7=K. E.|last8=Hoffman|first8=D.

In 2000, a team at the PSI conducted a chemistry reaction using atoms of <sup>267</sup>Bh produced in the reaction between <sup>249</sup>Bk and <sup>22</sup>Ne ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O<sub>2</sub> mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, [[technetium]] (as <sup>108</sup>Tc) and [[rhenium]] (as <sup>169</sup>Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.<ref name=00Ei01>[http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf "Gas chemical investigation of bohrium (Bh, element 107)"], Eichler et al., ''GSI Annual Report 2000''.
