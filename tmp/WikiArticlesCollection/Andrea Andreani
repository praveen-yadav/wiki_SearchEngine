[[Image:Triunphus Caesaris plate 1 - Andreani.jpg|thumb|''Triumphus Caesari'', by Andreani, after a painting by Mantegna]]

'''Andrea Andreani''' (1540–1623) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[engraver]] on wood, who was among the first printmakers in Italy to use [[chiaroscuro]], which required multiple colours.
 
Born and generally active in [[Mantua]] about 1540 (Brulliot says 1560) and died at [[Rome]] in 1623. His engravings are scarce and valuable, and are chiefly copies of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Parmigianino]] and [[Titian]]. The most remarkable of his works are ''Mercury and Ignorance'', the ''Deluge'', ''Pharaoh's Host Drowned in the Red Sea'' (after Titian), the ''Triumph of Caesar'' (after Mantegna), and ''Christ retiring from the judgment-seat of Pilate'' after a relief by Giambologna. He was active 1584-1610 in Florence.<ref>ULAN</ref>
