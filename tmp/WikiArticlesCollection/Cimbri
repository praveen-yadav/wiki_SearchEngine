==History==

===Origins===
Archaeologists have not found any clear indications of a mass migration from [[Jutland]] in the early [[Iron Age]]. The [[Gundestrup Cauldron]], which was deposited in a bog in [[Himmerland]] in the 2nd or 1st century BC, shows that there was some sort of contact with southeastern Europe, but it is uncertain if this contact can be associated with the Cimbrian expedition.<ref>Kaul, F. & Martens, J. "Southeast European Influences in the Early Iron Age of Southern Scandinavia. Gundestrup and the Cimbri", ''[[Acta Archaeologica]]'' 66 (1995) 111-161.</ref>

Advocates for a northern homeland point to Greek and Roman sources that associate the Cimbri with the peninsula of [[Jutland]], Denmark. According to the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res gestae]]'' (ch. 26) of [[Augustus]], the Cimbri were still found in the area around the turn of the 1st century AD:

{{quote|My fleet sailed from the mouth of the Rhine eastward as far as the lands of the Cimbri, to which, up to that time, no Roman had ever penetrated either by land or by sea, and the Cimbri and [[Charudes|Charydes]] and [[Semnones]] and other peoples of the Germans of that same region through their envoys sought my friendship and that of the Roman people.}}

The contemporary Greek geographer [[Strabo]] testifies that the Cimbri still existed as a Germanic tribe, presumably in the "Cimbric peninsula" (since they are said to live by the North Sea and to have paid tribute to Augustus):

{{quote|As for the Cimbri, some things that are told about them are incorrect and others are extremely improbable. For instance, one could not accept such a reason for their having become a wandering and piratical folk as this that while they were dwelling on a Peninsula they were driven out of their habitations by a great flood-tide; for in fact they still hold the country which they held in earlier times; and they sent as a present to Augustus the most sacred kettle in their country, with a plea for his friendship and for an amnesty of their earlier offences, and when their petition was granted they set sail for home; and it is ridiculous to suppose that they departed from their homes because they were incensed on account of a phenomenon that is natural and eternal, occurring twice every day. And the assertion that an excessive flood-tide once occurred looks like a fabrication, for when the ocean is affected in this way it is subject to increases and diminutions, but these are regulated and periodical.|<ref>Strabo, ''Geogr.'' 7.2.1, trans. H.L. Jones; as a geologist, Strabo reveals himself as a [[Gradualism|gradualist]]; in 1998, however, the archaeologist B.J. Coles identified as "[[Doggerland]]" the now-drowned habitable and huntable lands in the coastal plain that had formed in the [[North Sea]] when sea level dropped, and that was re-flooded following the withdrawal of the ice sheets.</ref>}}

On the map of [[Claudius Ptolemaeus|Ptolemy]], the "Kimbroi" are placed on the northernmost part of the peninsula of Jutland.,<ref>Ptolemy, ''Geography'' 2.11.7: {{lang|grc|πάντων δ᾽ ἀρκτικώτεροι Κίμβροι}} "the Cimbri are more northern than all (of these tribes)"</ref> i.e. in the modern landscape of [[Himmerland]] south of [[Limfjorden]] (since [[Vendsyssel-Thy]] north of the fjord was at that time a group of islands). ''Himmerland'' (Old Danish ''Himbersysel'') is generally thought to preserve their name,<ref>Jan Katlev, ''Politikens etymologisk ordbog'', Copenhagen 2000:294; Kenneth W. Harl, ''Rome and the Barbarians'', The Teaching Company, 2004</ref> in an older form without [[Grimm's law]] ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''k'' > [[Germanic Languages|Germ.]] ''h''). Alternatively, Latin ''C-'' represents an attempt to render the unfamiliar Proto-Germanic ''h'' = {{IPA|[χ]}}, perhaps due to Celtic-speaking interpreters (a Celtic intermediary would also explain why Germanic *''Þeuðanōz'' became Latin ''Teutones'').

The origin of the name ''Cimbri'' is unknown. One etymology<ref>Vasmer, ''Russisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', 1958, vol. 3, p. 62; Z. Gołąb, "About the connection between kinship terms and some ethnica in Slavic", ''International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics'' 25-26 (1982) 166-7.</ref> is PIE ''{{PIE|*tḱim-ro-}}'' "inhabitant", from ''{{PIE|tḱoi-m-}}'' "home" (> Eng. ''home''), itself a derivation from ''{{PIE|tḱei-}}'' "live" (> Greek {{lang|grc|κτίζω}}, Latin ''sinō''); then, the Germanic *''χimbra-'' finds an exact cognate in Slavic ''sębrъ'' "farmer" (> Croatian, Serbian ''sebar'', Russ. ''sjabër'').

Because of the similarity of the names, the Cimbri were at times associated with [[Cymry]], the Welsh name for themselves.<ref>C. Rawlinson, "On the Ethnography of the Cimbri", ''Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' 6 (1877) 150-158.</ref> However, this word is regularly derived from Celtic *''Kombrogi'', meaning “compatriots”.<ref>C.T. Onions and R.W. Burchfield,  eds. ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', 1966, ''s.v.'' ''Cymry''; ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary''. Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, 2002: 321</ref> Cumry is an evoluted form of the [[Old Welsh]], with an assimilation of [b] to first [m], the second element ''brogi'' changed into ''bro'' “country” in Modern Welsh. It is hardly conceivable that the Romans would have recorded such a form as ''Cimbri''<ref>They recorded the Gaulish ethnonyms in ''-brogi'' as [[Allobroges]] and [[Nitiobroges]], that is the regular way to do it.</ref><ref>The form ''Cambria'' is Neo-Latin.</ref> The name has also been related to the word ''kimme'' meaning “rim”, i.e. the people of the coast.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfbe/0183.html ''Nordisk familjebok''], Projekt Runeborg</ref> Finally, since Antiquity, the name has been related to that of the [[Cimmerians]].<ref>[[Posidonius]] in Strabo, ''Geography'' 7.2.2; [[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibl.'' 5.32.4; [[Plutarch]], ''Vit.Mar.'' 11.11.</ref>

===Migration===
[[Image:Cimbrians and Teutons invasions.svg|thumb|300px|Journey of Cimbri and Teutones<br/>[[Image:Battle icon gladii red.svg|12px]] Cimbri and Teuton defeats<br/>[[Image:Battle icon gladii green.svg|12px]] Cimbri and Teuton victories]]
Some time before 100 BC many of the Cimbri, as well as the [[Teutons]] and [[Ambrones]] migrated south-east. After several unsuccessful battles with the [[Boii]] and other [[Celtic tribes]], they appeared ca 113 BC in [[Noricum]], where they invaded the lands of one of Rome's allies, the [[Taurisci]].

On the request of the Roman [[consul]] [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo (consul 113 BC)|Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]], sent to defend the Taurisci, they retreated, only to find themselves deceived and attacked at the [[Battle of Noreia]], where they defeated the Romans. Only a storm, which separated the combatants, saved the Roman forces from complete annihilation.

===Invading Gaul===
Now the road to Italy was open, but they turned west towards [[Gaul]]. They came into frequent conflict with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who usually came out the losers. In [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] the Aduaticii—Belgians of Cimbrian origin—repeatedly sided with Rome's enemies. In 109 BC, they defeated a Roman army under the consul [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 109 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]], who was the commander of [[Gallia Narbonensis]]. In 107 BC they defeated another Roman army under the consul [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Gaius Cassius Longinus]], who was killed at the [[Battle of Burdigala]] (modern day [[Bordeaux]]) against the [[Tigurini]], who were allies of the Cimbri.

===Attacking the Roman Republic===
It was not until 105 BC that they planned an attack on the Roman Republic itself. At the [[Rhône River|Rhône]], the Cimbri clashed with the Roman armies.  Discord between the Roman commanders, the proconsul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and the consul [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]], hindered Roman coordination and so the Cimbri succeeded in first defeating the legate [[Marcus Aurelius Scaurus]] and later inflicted a devastating defeat on Caepio and Maximus at the [[Battle of Arausio]]. The Romans lost as many as 80,000 men, excluding auxiliary cavalry and non-combatants who brought the total loss closer to 112,000.

Rome was in panic, and the ''terror cimbricus'' became proverbial. Everyone expected to soon see the ''new Gauls'' outside of the gates of Rome. Desperate measures were taken: contrary to the Roman constitution, [[Gaius Marius]], who had defeated [[Jugurtha]], was elected consul and supreme commander for five years in a row (104-100 BC).

===Defeat===
[[Image:The defeat of the Cimbri.jpg|right|thumb|''The Defeat of the Cimbri'' by [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps|Alexandre-Gabriel Décamps]]]]
In 103 BC, the Cimbri and their proto-Germanic allies, the [[Teutons]], had turned to the Iberian Peninsula where they pillaged far and wide. During this time C. Marius had the time to prepare and, in 102 BC, he was ready to meet the Teutons and the Ambrones at the Rhône. These two tribes intended to pass into Italy through the western passes, while the Cimbri and the Tigurines were to take the northern route across the [[Rhine]] and later across the [[German Tyrol|Tirol]]ian [[Alps]].

At the estuary of the [[Isère River]], the Teutons and the Ambrones met Marius, whose well-defended camp they did not manage to overrun. Instead, they pursued their route, and Marius followed them.  At [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], the Romans won two battles and took the Teuton king [[Teutobod]] prisoner.

The Cimbri had penetrated through the Alps into northern Italy. The consul [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]] had not dared to fortify the passes, but instead he had retreated behind the [[River Po]], and so the land was open to the invaders. The Cimbri did not hurry, and the victors of Aquae Sextiae had the time to arrive with reinforcements. At the [[Battle of Vercellae]], at the confluence of the [[Sesia River]] with the [[Po River]], in 101 BC, the long voyage of the Cimbri also came to an end.

It was a devastating defeat, two chieftains, [[Lugius]] and [[Boiorix]], died on the field, while the other chieftains [[Caesorix]] and [[Claodicus]] were captured.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sampson |first=Gareth S. |authorlink= |title=The crisis of Rome: the Jugurthine and Northern Wars and the rise of Marius |url=http://books.google.no/books?id=zUQpAQAAMAAJ&q=%22The+kings+Lugius+and+Boiorix+fell+on+the+battlefield;+Claodicus+and+Caesorix+were+captured%22&dq=%22The+kings+Lugius+and+Boiorix+fell+on+the+battlefield;+Claodicus+and+Caesorix+were+captured%22&hl=no&sa=X&ei=1DG6UP-DBcvU4QSZloCICQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |accessdate=1 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |location= |isbn= |page=175 |pages=}}</ref> The women killed both themselves and their children in order to avoid slavery. The Cimbri were annihilated, although some may have survived to return to the homeland where a population with this name was residing in northern [[Jutland]] in the 1st century AD, according to the sources quoted above. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling [[Gladiator]]s in the [[Third Servile War]].<ref name=strauss/>

However, [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s epitome of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Trogus]], 38.4, has [[Mithridates the Great]] state that the Cimbri are ravaging Italy while the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] is going on, i.e. at some time in 90 - 88 BCE, thus more than a decade later,<ref>[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans38.html Marcus Junianus Justinus, ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'', 38.4], 'all Italy, at the present time, was in arms in the Marsian war,... At the same time, too, the Cimbri from Germany, many thousands of wild and savage people, had rushed upon Italy like a tempest', The Latin text has not like this translation an imperfect and a pluperfect, but two perfect infinitives (consurrexisse... inundasse...)</ref> after having sent ambassadors to the Cimbri to request military aid;<ref>[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans38.html Marcus Junianus Justinus, ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'', 38.3], 'In the next place, well understanding what a war he was provoking, he sent ambassadors to the Cimbri, the Gallograecians, the Sarmatians, and the Bastarnians, to request aid'</ref> judging from the context they must then have been living in North Eastern Europe at the time.

===Descendants===
According to [[Julius Caesar]], the Belgian tribe of the [[Atuatuci]] "was descended from the Cimbri and [[Teutons (Germanic tribe)|Teutoni]], who, upon their march into our province and Italy, set down such of their stock and stuff as they could not drive or carry with them on the near (''i.e.'' west) side of the Rhine, and left six thousand men of their company there with as guard and garrison" (''Gall.'' 2.29, trans. Edwards). They founded the city of Atuatuca in the land of the [[Belgae|Belgic]] [[Eburones]], whom they dominated. Thus [[Ambiorix]] king of the Eburones paid tribute and gave his son and nephew as hostages to the Atuatuci (''Gall.'' 6.27). In the first century AD, the Eburones were replaced or absorbed by the Germanic [[Tungri]], and the city was known as Atuatuca Tungrorum, i.e. the modern city of [[Tongeren]].

The population of modern-day [[Himmerland]] claims to be the heirs of the ancient Cimbri. The adventures of the Cimbri are described by the Danish nobel-prize-winning author [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen|Johannes V. Jensen]], himself born in Himmerland, in the novel ''Cimbrernes Tog'' (1922), included in the epic cycle ''Den lange Rejse'' (English ''[[The Long Journey]]'', 1923). The so-called Cimbrian bull ("Cimbrertyren"), a sculpture by [[Anders Jensen Bundgaard|Anders Bundgaard]], was erected 14 April 1937 on a central town square in [[Aalborg]], the capital of the [[Region Nordjylland|region of North Jutland]].

A German ethnic minority speaking the [[Cimbrian language]] have settled in the mountains between Vicenza, Verona and Trento in Italy (also known as [[Seven Communities]]) is also called the ([[:it:Cimbri (minoranza linguistica)|Cimbri]]). For hundreds of years this isolated population consisting now of 4.400 inhabitants, has claimed to be the direct descendant of the Cimbri retreating in this area after the Roman aftermath. However it was more probably settlers from Bavaria in the Middle Ages. Most linguists remains committed to the hypothesis of medieval (11th to 12th century) immigration, to explain the presence of small German-speaking communities in the north of Italy.<ref>James R.

Beiträge zum Bremer Kolloquium über „Alte Sprachen und Sprachstufen“. (= Diversitas Linguarum, Volume 8)''. Verlag Brockmeyer, Bochum 2004, ISBN 3-8196-0664-5, S. 43–54.</ref> Some genetic studies seem to prove a Celtic descendence of most inhabitants in the region, but not Germanic in fact,<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11436126 National Center for Biotechnology Information, ''Haemochromatosis gene mutations in a clustered Italian population: evidence of high prevalence in people of Celtic ancestry'']</ref> that is reinforced by the Gaulish toponyms such as those ending with the suffix ''-ago'' < Celtic ''-*ako(n)'' (f.e. [[Asiago]] is clearly the same place-name as the numerous [[Azay-le-Rideau|Azay]], [[Aisy]], [[Aze (disambiguation)|Azé]], [[Ezy]] in France, all from ''*Asiacum'' < Gaulish ''*Asiāko(n)''). The Cimbrian origin is a myth that was popularized by the humanists in the 14th century.

On one occasion in 1709, for instance, [[Frederick IV of Denmark]], also paid them a visit and he was greeted as their king. The population, which kept its independence during the Venice Republic, was later severely devastated by [[World War I]]. As a result, many Cimbri have left the mountain region and are dispersed around the world, in places such as the [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state in Southern [[Brazil]].

==Culture==

===Religion===
[[Image:Gundestrup E.jpg|thumb|Gundestrup cauldron, Plate E]]

Strabo gives this vivid description of the Cimbric folklore (''Geogr.'' 7.2.3, trans. H.L. Jones):

{{quote|Their wives, who would accompany them on their expeditions, were attended by priestesses who were seers; these were grey-haired, clad in white, with flaxen cloaks fastened on with clasps, girt with girdles of bronze, and bare-footed; now sword in hand these priestesses would meet with the prisoners of war throughout the camp, and having first crowned them with wreaths would lead them to a brazen vessel of about twenty amphorae; and they had a raised platform which the priestess would mount, and then, bending over the kettle, would cut the throat of each prisoner after he had been lifted up; and from the blood that poured forth into the vessel some of the priestesses would draw a prophecy, while still others would split open the body and from an inspection of the entrails would utter a prophecy of victory for their own people; and during the battles they would beat on the hides that were stretched over the wicker-bodies of the wagons and in this way produce an unearthly noise.}}

The Cimbri are depicted as ferocious warriors who did not fear death. The host was followed by women and children on carts. Aged women, [[priest]]esses, dressed in white sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood, the nature of which allowed them to see what was to come.

If the Cimbri did in fact come from Jutland, evidence that they practised ritualistic sacrifice may be found in the [[Haraldskær Woman]] discovered in Jutland in the year 1835.  Noosemarks and skin piercing were evident and she had been thrown into a bog rather than buried or cremated. Furthermore, the [[Gundestrup cauldron]], found in Himmerland, may be a sacrificial vessel like the one described in Strabo's text. The work itself was of Thracian origin.

===Language===
A major problem in determining whether the Cimbri were speaking a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] is that at this time the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems to be one of the first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he has a political motive for doing so (it is an argument in favour of the Rhine border).<ref>A.A. Lund, ''Die ersten Germanen: Ethnizität und Ethnogenese'', Heidelberg 1998.</ref> Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe,<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Gallic Wars]]'' 1.33.3-4; [[Strabo]], ''Geographica'' 4.4.3, 7.1.3; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 4.100; [[Tacitus]], ''Germania'' 37, ''History'' 4.73.</ref> but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.<ref>[[Appian of Alexandria|Appian]], ''Civil Wars'' 1.4.29, ''Illyrica'' 8.3.</ref>

There are few direct testimonies to the language of the Cimbri: Referring to the Northern Ocean (the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or the [[North Sea]]), [[Pliny the Elder]] states:<ref>''Naturalis Historia'', 4.95: ''Philemon Morimarusam a Cimbris vocari, hoc est mortuum mare, inde usque ad promunturium Rusbeas, ultra deinde Cronium''.</ref> "Philemon says that it is called Morimarusa, i.e. the Dead Sea, by the Cimbri, until the promontory of Rubea, and after that Cronium." The contemporary Gaulish terms for “sea” and “dead” appear to have been ''mori'' and ''*maruo-''; compare their well-attested modern [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] cognates ''muir'' and ''marbh'' ([[Irish language|Irish]]), ''môr'' and ''marw'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), and ''mor'' and ''marv'' ([[Breton language|Breton]]).<ref>F. M. Ahl, "Amber, Avallon, and Apollo's Singing Swan", ''American Journal of Philology'' 103 (1982) 399.</ref> The same word for “sea” is also known from Germanic, but with an ''a'' (*''mari-''), whereas a cognate of ''marbh'' is unknown in all dialects of Germanic.<ref>Germanic has *''murþ(r)a'' "murder" (with the verb *''murþ(r)jan''), but uses *''daujan'' and *''dauða-'' for "die" and "dead".</ref> Yet, given that Pliny had not heard the word directly from a Cimbric informant, it cannot be ruled out that the word is in fact Gaulish instead.<ref>Accordingly, Pokorny, ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', 1959, p. 735, describes the word as "Gaulish?".</ref>

The known Cimbri chiefs have names that look Celtic, including [[Boiorix]] (which may mean "King of the Boii" or, more literally, "King of Strikers"), Gaesorix (which means "Spear King"), and Lugius (which may be named after the Celtic god [[Lugus]]), although this may not mean that they are Celtic as the elements could work in Germanic (compare the name of the [[Vandal]]ic king [[Gaiseric]], which is likely identical to Gaesorix).<ref name=RIVES>{{cite book
 Rives, J.B. (Trans.) (1999). ''Germania: Germania''. [[Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0-19-815050-4}}</ref> Also, although the kings of the Cimbri and Teutones carry what look like Celtic names, the origin of a name need not say anything about the ethnicity or language of the individual carrying the name. Other evidence to the language of the Cimbri is circumstantial: thus, we are told that the Romans enlisted Gaulish Celts to act as spies in the Cimbri camp prior to the final showdown with the Roman army in 101 BC. Some take this as evidence in support of "the Celtic rather than the German theory".<ref>Rawlinson, in ''Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'' ''6'' (1877) 156.</ref>

Jean Markale<ref>Markale, ''Celtic Civilization'' 1976:40.</ref> wrote that the Cimbri were associated with the [[Helvetii]], and more especially with the indisputably Celtic [[Tigurini]]. These associations may link to a common ancestry, recalled from two hundred years previous, though they may not. [[Henri Hubert]]<ref>Hubert, ''The Greatness and Decline of the Celts''1934 Ch. IV, I.</ref> states <!--a direct quote?-->"All these names are Celtic, and they cannot be anything else". Some authors take a different perspective.<ref name=celtshistory>{{Cite book |last=Ó hÓgáin |first=Dáithí |authorlink= |title=The Celts: A History |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2003 |location= |page=131 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-yd1huHoXJwC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-85115-923-0}}</ref>

[[Plutarch]] wrote that the Cimbri were tall and light-blue eyed:

‘‘The most prevalent conjecture was that they were some of the German peoples which extended as far as the northern ocean,<br> 
a conjecture based on their great stature, their light-blue eyes, and the fact that the Germans call robbers Cimbri.’’<ref>''Life of Marius'', XI. 3.</ref>
