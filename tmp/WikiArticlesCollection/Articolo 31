'''Articolo 31''' was a popular band from [[Milan]], [[Italy]], melding [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], pop and traditional [[Italy|Italian]] musical forms.  They are one of the most popular Italian hip hop groups.

==Band history==
Members are rapper [[J-Ax]] (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini). The band took its name from the [[Ireland|Irish]] constitutional [[Censorship_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#The_Troubles|law]] guaranteeing freedom of the press{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}.

'''Articolo 31''' was one of the first hip hop groups in Italy, releasing one of the first Italian hip hop records, ''Strade di città'', in 1993. Soon, they signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Ricordi]] and started to mix their rap with pop music, obtaining great success and popularity. However, the underground hip hop scene positioned them as traitors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Their producer was Franco Godi, who also produced the music for the ''Signor Rossi'' animated series.

In 1997, [[DJ Gruff]] dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled ''1 vs 2'' appearing on the first album of the beatmaker Fritz da Cat, but Articolo 31's [[lawyer]]s obtained a retraction of the record, and its reissue without the song.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

In 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American [[old school hip hop|old school]] rapper [[Kurtis Blow]] on the album ''XChé SI!''. In the same year, they made the movie ''Senza filtro'' (in English, ''"Without filter"'').

With ''Domani smetto'', Articolo 31 left the world of hip hop and moved to rap with many influences; even more so than previously, this album found them rapping and singing to rock and pop tracks.

In recent years, J Ax and DJ Jad have each released solo records, and in 2006, the group declared an indefinite [[Recess (break)|hiatus]].

Their posse, ''Spaghetti Funk'', includes other popular performers like Space One and pop rappers [[Gemelli DiVersi]].
