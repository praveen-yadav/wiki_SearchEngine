'''Alfred William Lawson''' (March 24, 1869 – November 29, 1954) was a professional [[baseball]] player, manager and league promoter from 1887 through 1916 and went on to play a pioneering role in the US aircraft industry, publishing two early aviation trade journals.  In 1904, he also wrote a novel, ''Born Again'', clearly inspired by the popular Utopian fantasy ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]], an early harbinger of the metaphysical turn his career would take with the theory of '''Lawsonomy'''. He is frequently cited as the inventor of the [[airliner]] and was awarded several of the first air mail contracts, which he ultimately could not fulfill. He founded the Lawson Aircraft Company in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], Wisconsin, to build military training aircraft and later the [[Lawson Airplane Company-Continental Faience and Tile Company|Lawson Airplane Company]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], to build airliners.<ref>[http://www.aviationhalloffamewisconsin.com/inductees/lawson.htm Aviation Hall of Fame, Wisconsin - Alfred W.

He made one start for the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Beaneaters]] and two for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pittsburgh Alleghenys]] during the 1890 season. His minor league playing career lasted through 1895. He later managed in the minors from 1905-1907.

===Union Professional League===
In 1908 he started a new professional baseball league known as the [[Union Professional League]]. The league took the field in April but folded one month later due to financial difficulties.<ref name=DC>{{cite news |last=Wagner |first=William |title=D.C.

==Aviation career (1908-1928)==
An early advocate or rather evangelist of aviation, in October 1908 Mr. Lawson started the magazine "Fly" to stimulate public interest and educate readers in the fundamentals of the new new science of aviation. It sold for 10 cents a copy from newsstands across the country.  In 1910, moving to New York City, he renamed the magazine "Aircraft" and published it until 1914.  The magazine chronicled the technical developments of the early aviation pioneers.  He was the first advocate for commercial air travel, coining he term "airline."  He also advocated for strong American flying force, lobbying Congress in 1913 to expand its appropriations for Army aircraft.

In early 1913, he learned to fly the Sloan-Deperdussin and the [[Blériot XI|Moisant-Bleriot]] monoplanes becoming an accomplished pilot. Later that year he bought a Thomas flying boat and he became the first air commuter regularly flying from his country house in Seidler's Beach NJ to the foot of 75th Street NYC (about 35 miles). In 1917, utilizing the knowledge gained from 10 years advocating aviation, he built his first airplane, Lawson Military Tractor 1 (MT-1) trainer and founded the Lawson Aircraft Corporation. The company's plant was sited at Green Bay WI. There he secured a contract and built the Lawson MT-2. He also designed the steel fuselage Lawson Armored Battler, that never got beyond the drafting board given doubts within the Army aviation community and the signing of the armistice. 

[[File:Lawson T-2.jpg|left|Lawson C.2 or T-2]]After the war, 1919, Mr. Lawson started a project to build America's first airline. He secured financial backing and in 5 months he had built and demonstrated in flight his biplane airliner, the 18 passenger [[Lawson L-2]]. He demonstrated its capabilities in a 2000-mile multi-city tour from Milwaukee to Chicago-Toledo-Cleveland-Buffalo-Syracuse-New york City-Washington DC-Collinsville-Dayton-Chicago back to Milwaukee, creating a buzz of positive press.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alfred|first=Lawson|title=200 Mile Trip in First Airliner|year=1928|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Bb1BAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA146&ots=LLFq3DGaME&dq=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q=%222000%20mile%20trip%20in%20first%22%20alfred%20lawson&f=false}}</ref>  The publicity allowed him to secure an additional $1 million to build the 26-passenger [[Lawson L-4|Midnight Liner]]. In late 1920, he secured Government contracts for three airmail routes and to deliver 10 war planes, but due to the Fall 1920 recession, he could not secure the necessary $100,000 in cash reserve called for in the contracts and he had to decline the contracts. In 1926 he started his last airliner, the 56 seat, two tier Lawson super airliner.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lawson - Aircraft Industry Builder|year=1930|publisher=Humanity publishing company}}</ref>   The aircraft crashed on takeoff on its maiden flight.

In this phase of his life, he was considered as one of the leading thinkers in the budding commercial American aviation community, but his troubles with getting financial backing for his ideas led him to turn to Economics, Philosophy, and Organization.

==Lawsonomy (1929-1954)==
In the 1920s, he promoted health practices including [[vegetarianism]] and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200.  He also developed his own highly unusual theories of physics, according to which such concepts as "penetrability", "suction and pressure" and "zig-zag-and-swirl" were discoveries on par with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]].<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] | author = Martin Gardner  | pages = 69–79 | isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2 | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1957| accessdate = 2008-01-10 }}</ref>  He published numerous books on these concepts, all set in a distinctive typography.  Lawson repeatedly  predicted the worldwide adoption of Lawsonian principles by the year 2000.

He later propounded his own philosophy—Lawsonomy—and the [[Lawsonian religion]]. He also developed, during the [[Great Depression]], the [[Populism|populist]] economic theory of "[[Direct Credit]]s", according to which banks are the cause of all economic woe, the oppressors of both capital and labour. Lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers. His rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 30s, mainly in the upper Midwest, but by the late 30s the crowds had dwindled.

In 1943, he founded the [[University of Lawsonomy]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to spread his teachings and offer the degree of "Knowledgian," but after various IRS and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954, the year of Lawson's death.  Lawson's financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day, and in later years he seems to have owned little property, moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes. In 1952, he was brought before a [[United States Senate]] investigative committee on allegations that his organization had bought war surplus machines and then sold them for a profit, despite claiming [[non-profit]] status. His attempt to explain Lawsonomy to the Senators ended in mutual frustration and bafflement,.<ref>''Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science'', p. 77</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,816203,00.html | work=Time | title=Education: Zigzag & Swirl | date=March 24, 1952}}</ref>

[[Martin Gardner]] devoted an entire chapter of ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' to Lawsonomy.

A farm near [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], Wisconsin, is the only remaining university facility, although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas.  The large sign, formerly reading "University of Lawsonomy", was a familiar landmark for motorists in the region for many years and was visible from I-94 about 13 miles north of the Illinois state line, on the east side of the highway. Although the sign still exists, the "of" has now been replaced by the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of their website.  As of a storm in spring 2009, the sign is no longer there although the supporting posts are still visible.  Driving north on I-94 a sign on the roof of the building nearest the freeway says "Study Natural Law."

==Personal==
Lawson's brother, George H. Lawson, founded the [[United States Baseball League|United States League]] in 1910. The new professional baseball league had the intent to racially integrate. The league lasted less than a season, but it was revived for one season by George Lawson's associates in 1912.<ref name=George>{{cite news|last=Kuntz|first=Jerry|title=George H.
