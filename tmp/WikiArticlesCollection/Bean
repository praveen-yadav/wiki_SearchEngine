'''Bean''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|n}} is a common name for large plant [[seed]]s used for human food or animal feed of several [[genus|genera]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Fabaceae]] (alternately [[Leguminosae]]).

== Terminology ==
The term ''bean'' originally referred to the seed of the [[Vicia faba|broad]] or [[Vicia faba|fava bean]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but was later expanded to include members of the New World genus ''[[Phaseolus]]'', such as the [[common bean]] and the [[runner bean]], and the related genus ''[[Vigna]]''. The term is now applied generally to many other related plants such as Old World [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s (garbanzos), [[vetch]]es, and [[lupin]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=no reference for addition}}

''Bean'' is sometimes used as a synonym of ''[[Pulse (legume)|pulse]]'',{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} an edible [[legume]], though the term ''pulses'' is usually reserved for leguminous crops harvested for their dry grain. The term ''bean'' usually excludes crops used mainly for [[oil]] extraction (such as soybeans and peanuts), as well as those used exclusively for [[sowing]] purposes (such as [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]]). Leguminous crops harvested green for food, such as [[snap pea]]s, [[snow pea]]s, and so on, are not considered beans, and are classified as vegetable crops. According to United Nation's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] the term ''bean'' should include only species of ''Phaseolus''; however, a strict consensus definition has proven difficult because in the past, several species such as ''Vigna'' (''angularis'' (azuki bean), ''mungo'' (black gram), ''radiata'' (mung bean), ''aconitifolia'' (moth bean)) were classified as ''Phaseolus'' and later reclassified. The use of term ''bean'' to refer to species other than ''Phaseolus'' thus remains. In some countries, the term ''bean'' can mean a host of different species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition And Classification Of Commodities (See Chapter 4)|publisher=FAO, United Nations|year=1994|url=http://www.fao.org/es/faodef/faodefe.htm}}</ref>

In English usage, the word ''bean'' is also sometimes used to refer to the seeds or pods of plants that are not in the family leguminosae, but which bear a superficial resemblance to true beans—for example [[coffee bean]]s, [[castor bean]]s and [[cocoa beans]] (which resemble bean seeds), and [[vanilla bean]]s, which superficially resemble bean pods.

==Cultivation==
[[File:Field beans near Pendomer - geograph.org.uk - 1463701.jpg|thumb|right|Field beans (broad beans, ''[[Vicia faba]]'', ready for harvest]]
Unlike the closely related pea, beans are a summer crop that needs warm temperatures to grow. Maturity is typically 55–60 days from planting to harvest. As the bean pods mature, they turn yellow and dry up, and the beans inside change from green to their [[Phaseolus vulgaris|mature colour]]. As a vine, bean plants need external support, which may be provided in the form of special "bean cages" or poles. Native Americans customarily grew them along with corn and squash (the so-called [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]), with the tall [[plant stem|cornstalks]] acting as support for the beans.

In more recent times, the so-called "bush bean" has been developed which does not require support and has all its pods develop simultaneously (as opposed to pole beans which develop gradually). This makes the bush bean more practical for commercial production.

==History==
[[File:Annibale Carracci The Beaneater.jpg|thumb|''[[The Beaneater]]'' (1580-90) by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
Beans are one of the longest-cultivated plants. [[Broad beans]], also called fava beans, in their wild state the size of a small fingernail, were gathered in [[Afghanistan]] and the Himalayan foothills.<ref>Kaplan, pp. 27 ff</ref> In a form improved from naturally occurring types, they were grown in Thailand since the early seventh millennium BCE, predating ceramics.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17742735|year=1969|last1=Gorman|first1=CF|title=Hoabinhian: A pebble-tool complex with early plant associations in southeast Asia|volume=163|issue=3868|pages=671–3|doi=10.1126/science.163.3868.671|journal=Science}}</ref> They were deposited with the dead in [[ancient Egypt]]. Not until the second millennium BC did cultivated, large-seeded broad beans appear in the Aegean, Iberia and transalpine Europe.<ref>Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf ''Domestication of Plants in the Old World'' Oxford University Press, 2012, ISBN 0199549060, p. 114.</ref> In the ''[[Iliad]]'' (late-8th century) is a passing mention of beans and [[chickpea]]s cast on the threshing floor.<ref>"And as in some great threshing-floor go leaping From a broad pan the black-skinned beans or peas." (''Iliad'' xiii, 589).</ref>

Beans were an important source of [[Protein in nutrition|protein]] throughout Old and New World history, and still are today.

The oldest-known domesticated beans in the Americas were found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], an archaeological site in [[Peru]], and dated to around the second millennium BCE.<ref name=Chazan/>

Most of the kinds commonly eaten fresh or dried, those of the genus ''Phaseolus'', come originally from the Americas, being first seen by a European when [[Christopher Columbus]], during his exploration, of what may have been the [[Bahamas]], found them growing in fields. Five kinds of ''[[Phaseolus]]'' beans were domesticated<ref>Kaplan, p. 30: Domestication, besides involving selection for larger seed size, also involved selection for pods that did not curl and open when ripe, scattering the beans they contained..</ref> by pre-Columbian peoples: common beans (''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'') grown from Chile to the northern part of what is now the United States, and lima and sieva beans (''[[Phaseolus lunatus]]''), as well as the less widely distributed teparies (''[[Phaseolus acutifolius]]''), scarlet runner beans (''[[Phaseolus coccineus]]'') and polyanthus beans (''[[Phaseolus polyanthus]]'')<ref>Kaplan, p. 30</ref> One especially famous use of beans by pre-Columbian people as far north as the Atlantic seaboard is the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]" method of [[companion plant]] cultivation:

:In the New World, many tribes would grow beans together with [[maize]] (corn), and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The corn would not be planted in rows as is done by European agriculture, but in a checkerboard/hex fashion across a field, in separate patches of one to six stalks each.

:Beans would be planted around the base of the developing stalks, and would vine their way up as the stalks grew. All American beans at that time were vine plants, "bush beans" having been bred only more recently. The cornstalks would work as a [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] for the beans, and the beans would provide much-needed [[nitrogen]] for the corn.

:Squash would be planted in the spaces between the patches of corn in the field. They would be provided slight shelter from the sun by the corn, would shade the soil and reduce evaporation, and would deter many animals from attacking the corn and beans because their coarse, hairy vines and broad, stiff leaves are difficult or uncomfortable for animals such as deer and raccoons to walk through, crows to land on, etc.

Dry beans come from both Old World varieties of broad beans (fava beans) and New World varieties (kidney, black, cranberry, pinto, navy/haricot).

Beans are a [[heliotropic]] plant, meaning that the leaves tilt throughout the day to face the sun. At night, they go into a folded "sleep" position.

==Types==
Currently, the world genebanks hold about 40,000 bean varieties, although only a fraction are mass-produced for regular consumption.<ref>Laura McGinnis and Jan Suszkiw, ARS. Breeding Better Beans.

==Toxins==
Some kinds of raw beans, especially red and [[kidney beans]], contain a harmful toxin ([[lectin]] [[phytohaemagglutinin]]) that must be removed by cooking. A recommended method is to boil the beans for at least ten minutes; undercooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans.<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|accessdate=2009-07-11 |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm |title=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook: Phytohaemagglutinin |work= [[Bad Bug Book]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090709183309/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm071092.htm| archivedate= 9 July 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
Cooking beans in a [[slow cooker]], because of the lower temperatures often used, may not destroy toxins even though the beans do not smell or taste 'bad'<ref name=FDA /> (though this should not be a problem if the food reaches boiling temperature and stays there for some time).

[[Fermentation (food)|Fermentation]] is used in some parts of Africa to improve the nutritional value of beans by removing toxins. Inexpensive fermentation improves the nutritional impact of flour from dry beans and improves digestibility, according to research co-authored by Emire Shimelis, from the Food Engineering Program at Addis Ababa University. Beans are a major source of dietary [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.<ref>Summary: [http://www.scidev.net/fr/climate-change-and-energy/tsunami/news/actualit-s-d-afrique-sub-saharienne-en-bref-du-25-.html Fermentation 'improves nutritional value of beans'] (Sub Saharan Africa page, Science and Development Network website). Paper: [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119409208/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 Influence of natural and controlled fermentations on α-galactosides, antinutrients and protein digestibility of beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)]</ref>

==Nutrition==
Beans have significant amounts of fiber and [[soluble fiber]], with one cup of cooked beans providing between nine and 13&nbsp;grams of fiber.<ref name=mayo>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes/NU00410 Mixed Bean Salad] (information and recipe) from [http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/healthy-recipes The Mayo Clinic Healthy Recipes]. Accessed February 2010.</ref> Soluble fiber can help lower blood [[cholesterol]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/fiber/NU00033 Dietary fiber: Essential for a healthy diet]. MayoClinic.com (2012-11-17). Retrieved on 2012-12-18.</ref> Beans are also high in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[Oligosaccharide|complex carbohydrates]], [[folate]], and [[iron]].<ref name=mayo/>

[[File:Bean Nutrition.png|thumb|300px|This figure shows the grams of fiber and protein per 100g serving of each legume. The size of the circle is proportional to its iron content. From this view, lentil and kidney beans are by far the healthiest while soybeans and peas have the least nutrients per serving.]]

==Flatulence==
Many edible beans, including broad beans and soybeans, contain [[oligosaccharide]]s (particularly [[raffinose]] and [[stachyose]]), a type of sugar molecule also found in [[cabbage]]. An anti-oligosaccharide [[enzyme]] is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by [[bacteria]] in the large intestine. This digestion process produces [[flatulence]]-causing gases as a byproduct.<ref>{{cite book | author = Harold McGee | title = Food and Cooking | page = 486 | quote = Many legumes, especially soy, navy and lima beans, cause a sudden increase in bacterial activity and gas production a few hours after they're consumed. This is because they contain large amounts of carbohydrates that human digestive enzymes can't convert into absorbable sugars. These carbohydrates therefore leave the upper intestine unchanged and enter the lower reaches, where our resident bacterial population does the job we are unable to do.|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year= 2003|isbn=0684843285}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Peter Barham | title = The Science of Cooking | page = 14 | quote = we do not possess any enzymes that are capable of breaking down larger sugars, such as raffinose etc. These 3, 4 and 5 ring sugars are made by plants especially as part of the energy storage system in seeds and beans. If we ingest these sugars we can't break them down in the intestines, rather they travel down into the colon where various bacteria digest them – and in the process produce copious amounts of carbon dioxide gas|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-67466-5}}</ref> This aspect of bean digestion is the basis for the children's rhyme "[[Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit]]".

Some species of [[mold]] produce alpha-galactosidase, an anti-oligosaccharide enzyme, which humans can take to facilitate digestion of oligosaccharides in the small intestine. This enzyme, currently sold in the United States under the brand-names [[Beano (dietary supplement)|Beano]] and Gas-X Prevention, can be added to food or consumed separately. In many cuisines beans are cooked along with natural [[carminative]]s such as [[anise]] seeds, [[coriander]] seeds and [[cumin]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

One effective strategy is to soak beans in alkaline ([[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]]) water overnight before rinsing thoroughly {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}. Sometimes [[vinegar]] is added, but only after the beans are cooked as vinegar interferes with the beans' softening.

Fermented beans will usually not produce most of the intestinal problems that unfermented beans will, since yeast can consume the offending sugars.

==Production==

The world leader in production of dry bean is India, followed by Brazil and Myanmar. In Africa, the most important producer is Tanzania.
