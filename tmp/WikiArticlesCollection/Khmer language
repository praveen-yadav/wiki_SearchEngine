It is the second most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]] (after [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]]), with speakers in the tens of millions. Khmer has been considerably influenced by [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli|Pali]], especially in the royal and religious [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], through the vehicles of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. It is also the earliest recorded and earliest written language of the [[Mon–Khmer]] family, predating [[Mon language|Mon]] and by a significant margin Vietnamese.<ref name ="cl">{{cite book|title=Cambodian Linguistics, Literature and History: Collected Articles |author= David A.

Khmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]], [[isolating language]]. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and auxiliary words are used to indicate [[Grammar|grammatical]] relationships. General word order is [[subject–verb–object]]. Many words conform to the typical Mon-Khmer pattern, having a "main" syllable preceded by a [[minor syllable]].

The Khmer language is written with an [[abugida]] known in Khmer as អក្សរខ្មែរ ({{IPA-km|aʔksɑː kʰmaːe|IPA}}). Khmer differs from neighboring languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese in that it is not a [[tonal language]].

==Classification==
{{Main|Austroasiatic languages}}

Khmer is a member of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language family, the most archaic family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India.<ref name=DiffZide>Diffloth, Gerard & Zide, Norman.

==Geographic Distribution and Dialects==
[[File:Approximate Location of Khmer Dialects.png|thumb|280px|Approximate locations where various dialects of Khmer are spoken]]
Khmer is spoken by some 13 million people in Cambodia, where it is the official language. It is also a second language for most of the minority groups and indigenous hill tribes there. Additionally there are a million speakers of Khmer native to southern Vietnam (1999) and 1.4 million in northeast Thailand (2006).<ref name=ethno/><ref name=ethnokxm>{{e17|kxm|Northern Khmer}}</ref>

Khmer [[dialect]]s, although mutually intelligible, are sometimes quite marked. Notable variations are found in speakers from [[Phnom Penh]] (which is the capital city), the rural [[Battambang Province|Battambang]] area, the areas of Northeast Thailand adjacent to Cambodia such as [[Surin province]], the Cardamom Mountains, and in southern Vietnam.<ref name="SIDWELL">[http://people.anu.edu.au/~u9907217/languages/Khmer-Cambodian.html Khmer/Cambodian] Paul Sidwell. Australian National University. Accessed February 23, 2007.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Khmer American: Identity and Moral Education in a Diasporic Community |author= Nancy Joan Smith-Hefner|year=1999|publisher=University of California|isbn=0-520-21349-1}}</ref><ref name="JoP">[http://www2.ku.edu/~kuppl/jongman/Wayland%20%26%20Jongman%2003.pdf Journal of Phonetics 31 (2003). pp&nbsp;181–201]</ref> The dialects form a [[dialect continuum|continuum]] running roughly north to south. Standard Cambodian Khmer is mutually intelligible with the others but a [[Khmer Krom]] speaker from Vietnam, for instance, may have great difficulty communicating with a Khmer native to [[Sisaket Province]] in Thailand.

The following is a classification scheme showing the development of the modern Khmer dialects.<ref name="Sidwell2009">Sidwell, Paul (2009). ''Classifying the Austroasiatic languages: history and state of the art''. LINCOM studies in Asian linguistics, 76. Munich: Lincom Europa.</ref><ref>Ferlus, Michel. 1992.

*Middle Khmer
**Cardamom (Western) Khmer
**Central Khmer
***Surin (Northern) Khmer
***Standard Khmer and related dialects (including Khmer Krom)

'''Standard Khmer''', or '''Central Khmer''', the language as taught in schools and used by the media is based on the Battambang dialect spoken throughout the plains of the northwest and central provinces.<ref name="HUFF"/>

'''[[Northern Khmer dialect|Northern Khmer]]''' (called ''Khmer Surin'' in Khmer) refers to the dialects spoken by many in several border provinces of present-day Northeast Thailand. After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century, the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of [[Lan Xang]]. The conquests of Cambodia by [[Naresuan|Naresuan the Great]] for [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period.<ref name=Bernon>[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bernon1988khmer.pdf de Bernon, Olivier. "Khmer of Surin: Lexical Remarks". 1988.]</ref> This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages, [[Isan language|Lao]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], lexical differences, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants. Additionally, syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer, is still pronounced in Northern Khmer. Some linguists classify Northern Khmer as a separate, but closely related language rather than a dialect.<ref name=Thomas>Thomas, David. 1990. "On the 'language' status of Northern Khmer." ''JLC'' 9.1:98-106</ref><ref name=SUW>[http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/24:1-26.pdf Phonetic variation of final trill and final palatals in Khmer dialects of Thailand] Suwilai, Premsrirat; Mahidol University; Mon-Khmer Studies 24:1-26; pg 1</ref>

'''[[Western Khmer]]''', also called Cardamom Khmer or Chanthaburi Khmer, spoken by a very small, isolated population in the [[Cardamom Mountains|Cardamom mountain]] range extending from western Cambodia into eastern [[Central Thailand]], although little studied, is unique in that it maintains a definite system of [[Register (phonology)|vocal register]] that has all but disappeared in other dialects of modern Khmer.<ref name="DiffZide" />

'''Phnom Penh Khmer''' is spoken in the capital and surrounding areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete [[elision]] of syllables, considered by speakers from other regions to be a "relaxed" pronunciation. For instance, "Phnom Penh" will sometimes be shortened to "m'Penh". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an "r" either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a [[consonant cluster]] (as in the English word "bread"). The "r", [[Alveolar trill|trilled]] or [[Alveolar tap|flapped]] in other dialects, is either pronounced as an [[uvular trill]] or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique result is that the syllable is spoken with a low-rising or "dipping" [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] much like the "hỏi" tone in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. For example, some people pronounce {{IPA|/trəj/}} (meaning "fish") as {{IPA|/təj/}}, the "r" is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, effectively doubling its length. Another example is the word {{IPA|/riən/}} ("study, learn"). It is pronounced {{IPA|/ʀiən/}}, with the "uvular r" and the same intonation described above.<ref>{{cite book|title=Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand |author= William Allen A. Smalley|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago|isbn=0-226-76288-2}}</ref>

'''[[Khmer Krom]]''' or '''Southern Khmer''' is spoken by the indigenous Khmer population of the Mekong Delta, formerly controlled by the Khmer Empire but part of Vietnam since 1698. Khmers are persecuted by the Vietnamese government for using their native language and, since the 1950s, have been forced to take Vietnamese names.<ref name=UNPC>Unrepresented Peoples and Nations Organization [http://www.unpo.org/members/7887 Khmer Krom Profile] Retrieved 19 June 2012</ref> Consequently very little research has been published regarding this dialect. It generally has been influenced by Vietnamese for three centuries and accordingly displays a pronounced accent, tendency toward monosyllablic words and lexical differences from the standard.<ref>Thach, Ngoc Minh.

==Historical periods==
[[File:AncientKhmerScript.jpg|thumb|320px|A stone carved in Middle Khmer]]
[[Linguistics|Linguistic]] study of the Khmer language divides its history into four periods one of which, the Old Khmer period, is subdivided into pre-Angkorian and Angkorian.<ref name="Sak">Sak-Humphry, Channy. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/sak-humphry1993syntax.pdf ''The Syntax of Nouns and Noun Phrases in Dated Pre-Angkorian Inscriptions'']. Mon Khmer Studies 22: 1-26.</ref> Pre-Angkorian Khmer, the language after its divergence from Proto-Mon–Khmer until the ninth century, is only known from words and phrases in Sanskrit texts of the era. Old Khmer (or Angkorian Khmer) is the language as it was spoken in the [[Khmer Empire]] from the 9th century until the weakening of the empire sometime in the 13th century. Old Khmer is attested by many primary sources and has been studied in depth by a few scholars, most notably Saveros Pou, Phillip Jenner and Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Following the end of the Khmer Empire the language lost the standardizing influence of being the language of government and accordingly underwent a turbulent period of change in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonology]] and [[lexicon]]. The language of this transition period, from about the 14th to 18th centuries, is referred to as Middle Khmer and saw borrowing from Thai, Lao and, to a lesser extent, Vietnamese. The changes during this period are so profound that the rules of Modern Khmer can not be applied to correctly understand Old Khmer. The language became recognizable as Modern Khmer, spoken from the 19th century till today.<ref name="Sak" />

The following table shows the conventionally accepted historical stages of Khmer.<ref name="Sidwell2009"/>

Just as modern Khmer was emerging from the transitional period represented by Middle Khmer, Cambodia fell under the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|influence]] of [[France|French]] [[French colonial empire|colonialism]].<ref name=CBHP>{{cite book
 | last = Harris | first = Ian | title = Cambodian Buddhism: History and Practice | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | edition = | year = 2008 | location = Hawaii | pages =  | doi = | isbn = 0824832981}}</ref>  In 1887 Cambodia was fully integrated into [[French Indochina]] which brought in a [[French language|French]]-speaking aristocracy. This led to French becoming the language of higher education and the intellectual class.  Many native scholars in the early 20th century, led by a monk named [[Chuon Nath]], resisted the French influence on their language and championed Khmerization, using Khmer roots (and Pali and Sanskrit) to coin new words for modern ideas, instead of French.<ref name=CBHP/> Nath cultivated modern Khmer-language identity and culture, overseeing the translation of the entire Pali Buddhist canon into Khmer and creating the modern Khmer language dictionary that is still in use today, thereby ensuring that Khmer would survive, and indeed flourish, during the French colonial period.<ref name=CBHP/>

Khmer is frequently described as having [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated stops]]. However, these may be analyzed as [[consonant cluster]]s, {{IPA|/ph, th, ch, kh/}}, as [[infix]]es can occur between the stop and the aspiration ''(phem, p{{angle bracket|an}}hem),'' or as non-distinctive phonetic detail in other consonant clusters, such as the ''khm'' in ''Khmer.''<ref name=ELL>{{cite book|last=Minegishi|first=M|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|editor=Keith Brown|publisher=Elsevier|year=2006|edition=2|pages=4981–4984|chapter=Khmer}}</ref><ref name=SOAS/> {{IPA|[b]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} are occasional [[allophones]] of the implosives.

In addition, the consonants {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/z/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} may occasionally occur in recent [[loan word]]s in the speech of Cambodians familiar with French and other languages. These non-native sounds are not represented in the Khmer script, although combinations of letters otherwise unpronounceable are used to represent them when necessary. In the speech of those who are not bilingual, these sounds are approximated with natively occurring [[phoneme]]s:

===Vowel nuclei===
Various researchers have proposed slightly different analyses of the vowels. This may be in part because political centralization has not yet been achieved, so standard Khmer does not prevail throughout Cambodia.  Additionally, the [[Cambodian Civil War]] resulted in massive internal population upheaval.  As such, many speakers of even the same community may have different phonological inventories.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/21736/1/jaas031010.pdf| title= On Takeo Dialects of Khmer: Phonology and World List| first=Makoto| last=Minegishi| year=1986| accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> Two proposals follow. The first is Huffman's analysis of Standard Khmer, and the second is Wayland's analysis of Battambang Khmer, the dialect upon which the [[Standard language|standard]] is based.

===Syllable structure===
Khmer words are predominantly either monosyllabic or [[Minor syllable|sesquisyllabic]], with stress falling on the final syllable.<ref name="Schiller">{{cite web| url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/schiller1994khmer.pdf | title= Khmer Nominalizing and Causitivizing Infixes| year=1994 | first=Eric| last= Schiller | publisher=University of Chicago| accessdate =2008-12-04}}</ref> There are two possible clusters of three consonants at the beginning of syllables, {{IPA|/str skr/}},<ref name=ppak>[http://www.panl10n.net/english/Outputs%20Phase%202/CCs/Cambodia/ITC/Papers/2007/0701/phonetic-and-phonological-analysis.pdf Phonetic and Phonological Analysis of Khmer]</ref> and 85 possible two-consonant clusters:

Syllables begin with one of these consonants or consonant clusters, followed by one of the vowel nuclei. The aspiration in some clusters is allophonic.<ref name=SOAS>{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=JM|title=Classical Civilizations of South-East Asia: Key Papers from SOAS|editor=VI Braginskiĭ|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|chapter=The Structure of the Word in Old Khmer}}</ref> When the vowel nucleus is short, there has to be a final consonant. {{IPA|/p, t, c, k, ʔ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, l, h, j, ʋ/}} can exist in a [[syllable coda]], while {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/ʋ/}} approach {{IPA|[ç]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively.  The stops {{IPA|/p, t, c, k/}} have [[no audible release]] when occurring as syllable finals.

The most common word structure in Khmer is a full syllable as described above, which may be preceded by an unstressed, "minor" syllable that has a consonant-vowel structure of CV-, CrV-, CVN- or CrVN- (N is any nasal in the Khmer inventory). The vowel in these preceding syllables is usually reduced in conversation to {{IPA|[ə]}}, however in careful or formal speech and in television and radio, they are always clearly articulated.

Words with three or more syllables exist, particularly those pertaining to science, the arts, and religion. However, these words are loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French.

===Suprasegmental features===

====Phonation and tone====
Khmer once had a [[phonation]] distinction in its vowels, which was indicated in writing by choosing between two sets of letters for the preceding consonant according to the historical source of the phonation. However, phonation has been lost in all but the most archaic dialect of Khmer (Western Khmer).<ref name=DiffZide/> For example, Old Khmer distinguished voiced and unvoiced pairs as in {{IPA|*kaa}} vs {{IPA|*ɡaa}}. The vowels after voiced consonants became [[breathy voice]]d and diphthongized: {{IPA|*kaa, *ɡe̤a}}. When consonant voicing was lost, the distinction was maintained by the vowel: {{IPA|*kaa, *ke̤a}}, and later the phonation disappeared as well: {{IPA|[kaː], [kiə]}}.<ref name=ELL/>

Although most Cambodian dialects are not tonal, colloquial Phnom Penh dialect has developed a tonal contrast (level versus peaking tone) to compensate for the [[elision]] of {{IPA|/r/}}.<ref name=ELL/>

====Prosody====

=====Stress=====
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] in Khmer is non-phonemic (does not distinguish different meanings) and thus is considered to depend entirely on syllable structure.  Owing in part to the sesquisyllabic nature of Khmer, syllabic stress is also highly predictable.  In native disyllabic words, the first syllable is always a [[minor syllable]] and the second syllable is stressed. Loan words and [[reduplication]]s also tend to follow this pattern:
:{|
|{{lang|km|សំពត់}} ||{{IPA|/sɑm ˈpoə̯̆t/}} ||"type of sarong"
|-
|{{lang|km|អំបោះ}} ||{{IPA|/ɑm ˈbɑːh/}} ||"thread"
|-
|{{lang|km|ទូលាយ}} ||{{IPA|/tuː ˈliə̯j/}} ||"spacious"
|}

In words of more than two syllables, primary stress is always on the final syllable with secondary stress on every second syllable. Thus, in a three-syllable word, the first syllable exhibits secondary stress, while primary stress is on the third syllable:
:{|
|{{lang|km|រតនា}} ||{{IPA|/ˌreə̯̆ʔ taʔ ˈnaː/}} ||"gem, jewel, precious stone"
|-
|{{lang|km|រដ្ធបាល}} ||{{IPA|/ˌroə̯̆t tʰaʔ ˈbaːl/}} ||"caretaker of the government"
|-
|{{lang|km|កម្ពុជា}} ||{{IPA|/ˌkam puʔ ˈciə̯/}} ||"Kampuchea"
|}

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]] words of three syllables, however, follow the stress of the constituent words:
:{|
|{{lang|km|អំបិលម្ទេស}} ||{{IPA|/ɑm ˌbɨl ˈmteːh/}} ||"a dry dipping powder of peppers and salt"
|-
|{{lang|km|អន្ទាក់រូត}} ||{{IPA|/ɑn ˌteə̯̆ʔ ˈruːt/}} ||"a snare"
|-
|{{lang|km|សំបុកចាប}} ||{{IPA|/sɑm ˌbok ˈcaːp/}} ||"a kind of cookie" (lit. "bird's nest")
|}
In a four-syllable word, the second syllable carries secondary stress and primary stress is on the fourth syllable:<ref name="ppak"/>
:{|
|{{lang|km|សីមារេខា}} ||{{IPA|/səj ˌmaː reə̯̆ʔ ˈkʰaː/}} ||"boundary line"
|-
|{{lang|km|សកម្មភាព}} ||{{IPA|/saʔ ˌkam meə̯̆ʔ ˈpʰiə̯p/}} ||"physical activity"
|-
|{{lang|km|រណូងរណាង}} ||{{IPA|/rɔ ˌnoːŋ rɔ ˈnaːŋ/}} ||"hasty, hastily, angrily" (an example of reduplication)
|}
Words of five or more syllables are exceedingly rare in everyday conversation but do occur in academic, governmental, and religious contexts.  These words are all derived from Sanskrit or Pali roots but follow Khmer pronunciation and stress patterns:<ref name=ppak /><ref name=KhDict>Headly, Robert K.; Chhor, Kylin; Lim, Lam Kheng; Kheang, Lim Hak; Chun, Chen. 1977. ''Cambodian-English Dictionary''. Bureau of Special Research in Modern Languages. The Catholic University of America Press. Washington, D.C. ISBN 0-8132-0509-3</ref>
:{|
|{{lang|km|មេឃវាហន}} ||{{IPA|/meː ˌkʰeə̯̆ʔ viə̯ ˌhaʔ ˈnaʔ/}} ||"A name of [[Indra]]" (lit. from Sanskrit "having clouds for a vehicle")
|}

=====Intonation=====
As Khmer is primarily an [[analytic language|analytic]] [[pro-drop language]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] (non-phonemic pitch variation throughout clauses) often conveys [[semantic]] context. The intonation pattern of a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an abrupt drop on the last syllable.<ref name=ppak /> 
:{|
|{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនចង់បានទេ}} || {{IPA|/↗kʰɲom mɨn caŋ baːn <nowiki>|</nowiki> ↘teː/}} || "I don't want it."
|}
Other intonation contours signify a different type of phrase such as the "full doubt" interrogative, similar to "yes-no" questions in English or the exclamatory phrase.  Full doubt interrogatives remain fairly even in tone throughout but rise sharply towards the end.
:{|
|{{lang|km|អ្នកចង់ទៅលេងសៀមរាបទេ}} || {{IPA|/↗nea? caŋ <nowiki>|</nowiki> ↗tɨw leːŋ siəm riəp <nowiki>|</nowiki> ꜛteː/}} || "Do you want to go to Siem Reap?"
|}
Exclamatory phrases follow the typical steadily rising pattern, but rise sharply on the last syllable instead of falling.<ref name=ppak />
:{|
|{{lang|km|សៀវភៅនេះថ្លៃណាស់}} || {{IPA|/↗siəw pʰɨw nih<nowiki>|</nowiki> ↗tʰlaj <nowiki>|</nowiki> ꜛnahs/}} || "This book is expensive!"
|}

==Grammar==
{{Main|Khmer grammar}}

Khmer is generally a [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) language with [[prepositions]].<ref>Huffman, Franklin. 1967. ''An outline of Cambodian Grammar''. PhD thesis, Cornell University.</ref> Although primarily an [[analytic language]], lexical [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] by means of [[prefixes]] and [[infixes]] occurs but is not always productive in the modern language.<ref name = "cc">{{cite book|title=Colloquial Cambodian: A Complete Language Course |author= David Smyth|year=1995|publisher=Routledge (UK)|isbn=0-415-10006-2}}</ref>

===Adjectives and Adverbs===
Adjectives, demonstratives and numerals follow the noun they modify.  Adverbs likewise follow the verb.  Morphologically, adjectives and adverbs are not distinguished with many words often serving either function. Similar to other languages of the region, intensity can be expressed by [[reduplication]].<ref name=msc>Huffman, F. E., Promchan, C., & Lambert, C.-R. T. (1970). ''Modern spoken Cambodian''. New Haven: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-01315-9</ref>

{{lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតនោះ}} {{IPA|/srəj sʔaːt nuh/}} (girl pretty that) = that pretty girl<br>
{{lang|km|ស្រីស្អាតស្អាត}} {{IPA|/srəj sʔaːt sʔaːt/}} (girl pretty pretty) = a very pretty girl

As Khmer sentences rarely use a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], adjectives are also employed as verbs.  Comparatives are formed by the use of ''ciəng'': "A X ''ciəng'' B" (A is more X than B).  The most common way to express the idea of superlatives is the construction "A X ''ciəng kee''" (A is X-est of all).<ref name=msc/>

===Nouns===
The noun has no grammatical gender or singular/plural distinction and is uninflected. Technically there are no [[Article (grammar)|articles]], but indefiniteness is often expressed by the word for "one" following the noun.  Plurality can be marked by [[postnominal]] particles, numerals, or reduplicating the adjective, which, although similar to intensification, is usually not ambiguous due to context.<ref name=msc/>

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom/}} (dog large) = large dog

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំធំ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom tʰom/}} (dog large large) = a very large dog or large dogs

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែធំណាស់}} {{IPA|/cʰkae tʰom nah/}} (dog large very) = very large dog

{{lang|km|ឆ្កែពីរ}} {{IPA|/cʰkae piː/}} (dog two) = two dogs

[[Classifier (linguistics)|Classifying particles]] for use between numerals and nouns exist although are not always obligatory as in, for example, Thai.  Pronouns are subject to a complicated system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see [[Khmer language#Social registers|Social registers]] below). Kinship terms, nicknames and proper names are often used as pronouns (including for the first person) among intimates. Frequently, subject pronouns are dropped in colloquial conversation.<ref name=msc/>

===Verbs===
As is typical of most East Asian languages,<ref>[http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-927311-1.pdf East and Southeast Asian Languages: A First Look] at Oxford University Press Online</ref> the verb does not inflect at all; tense and aspect can be shown by particles and adverbs or understood by context. Most commonly, time words such as "yesterday", "earlier", "tomorrow", indicate tense when not inferrable from context. There is no [[participle]] form. The [[gerund]] is formed by using {{IPA|/kəmpɔːŋ/}}: "A {{IPA|/kəmpɔːŋ/}} V" (A is in the process of V). [[Serial verb construction]] is quite common. Negation is achieved by putting {{IPA|/min/}} before them and {{IPA|/teː/}} at the end of the sentence or clause. In normal speech verbs can also be negated without the need for an ending particle by putting {{IPA|/ʔɑt/}} before them.<ref name=msc/>

{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំជឿ}} {{IPA|/kʰɲom cɨə/}} – I believe

{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំមិនជឿទេ}} {{IPA|/kʰɲom min cɨə teː/}} – I don't believe

{{lang|km|ខ្ញុំឥតជឿ}} {{IPA|/kʰɲom ʔɑt cɨə/}} – I don't believe

==Social registers==
Khmer employs a system of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] in which the speaker must always be conscious of the social status of the person spoken to. The different registers, which include those used for common speech, polite speech, speaking to or about royals and speaking to or about monks, employ alternate verbs, names of body parts and pronouns. This results in what appears to foreigners as separate languages and, in fact, isolated villagers often are unsure how to speak with royals and royals raised completely within the court do not feel comfortable speaking the common register. As an example, the word for "to eat" used between intimates or in reference to animals is {{IPA|/siː/}}. Used in polite reference to commoners, it's {{IPA|/ɲam/}}. When used of those of higher social status, it's {{IPA|/pisa/}} or {{IPA|/tɔtuəl tiən/}}. For monks the word is {{IPA|/cʰan/}} and for royals, {{IPA|/saoj/}}.<ref name ="cl"/> Another result is that the pronominal system is complex and full of honorific variations, just a few of which are shown in the table below.<ref name=KhDict/>

Khmer is written with the Khmer script, an [[abugida]] developed from the [[Pallava script]] of India before the 7th century when the first known inscription appeared.<ref name="OMNI">[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/khmer.htm Khmer Alphabet at Omniglot.com]</ref> Written left-to-right with vowel signs that can be placed after, before, above or below the consonant they follow, the Khmer script is similar in appearance and usage to [[Thai script|Thai]] and [[Lao script|Lao]], both of which were based on the Khmer system. The Khmer script is also distantly related to the [[Mon script]], the ancestor of the modern [[Burmese script]].<ref name="OMNI"/> [[Khmer numerals]], which were inherited from Indian numerals, are used more widely than [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]]. Within Cambodia, literacy in the Khmer alphabet is estimated at 77.6%.<ref name=UNCel>[http://www.un.org.kh/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=469:celebration-of-international-literacy-day-2011-supporting-cambodias-development-efforts&catid=43:latest-press-releases&Itemid=76 United Nations in Cambodia "Celebration of International Literacy Day, 2011"]</ref>

Consonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups, or series. The first series carries the inherent vowel {{IPA|/ɑː/}} while the second series carries the inherent vowel {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. The Khmer names of the series, {{IPA|/aʔkʰosaʔ/}} ("voiceless") and {{IPA|/kʰosaʔ/}} ("voiced"), respectively, indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer.  As the voicing of stops was lost, however, the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels which, in turn, evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality, often by [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]].<ref name=ELL/>  This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings, depending on the series of the initial consonant:<ref name="HUFF"/>
