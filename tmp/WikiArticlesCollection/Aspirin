'''Aspirin''' ([[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), also known as '''acetylsalicylic acid''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]] ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|s|ɛ|t|əl|ˌ|s|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ɨ|k}} {{respell|ə|SET|əl|SAL|i|SIL|ik}}) '''ASA'''), is a [[salicylate]] [[medication|drug]], often used as an [[analgesic]] to relieve minor aches and pains, as an [[antipyretic]] to reduce fever, and as an [[anti-inflammatory]] medication. The active ingredient of Aspirin was first discovered from the bark of the willow tree by [[Edward Stone (clergyman)|Edward Stone]] of [[Wadham College]], [[Oxford University]]. He had discovered [[salicylic acid]], the active ingredient in aspirin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stone E |title=An Account of the Success of the Bark of the Willow in the Cure of Agues.

[[Salicylic acid]], the main metabolite of aspirin, is an integral part of human and animal [[metabolism]]. While in humans much of it is attributable to diet, a substantial part is synthesized [[Endogeny#Biology|endogenously]].<ref name=Paterson_2008>{{cite pmid|19053387|noedit}}</ref>

Aspirin also has an [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] effect by inhibiting the production of [[thromboxane]], which under normal circumstances binds [[platelet]] molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, and [[thrombus|blood clot]] formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots.<ref>{{Cite pmid |6135989}}</ref> It has also been established that low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack or of the death of cardiac tissue.<ref name="anticoag">{{Cite journal|last = Julian|first = D G|coauthors = D A Chamberlain, S J Pocock|title = A comparison of aspirin and anticoagulation following thrombolysis for myocardial infarction (the AFTER study): a multicentre unblinded randomised clinical trial|journal = BMJ| volume = 313|issue = 7070|pages = 1429–1431|publisher = British Medical Journal|date = 24 September 1996|pmid = 8973228|pmc = 2353012|doi = 10.1136/bmj.313.7070.1429}}</ref><ref>{{Cite pmid |7586250}}</ref>

Aspirin is part of a group of medications called [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs#Mechanism of action|mechanism of action]]. Though it, and others with similar structure called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme [[cyclooxygenase]], aspirin (but not the other salicylates) does so in an [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] manner and, unlike others, affects more the COX-1 variant than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme.<ref name="Goodman and Gilman's">{{Cite book| last = Burke| first = Anne|last2=Smyth|first2=Emer|last3=FitzGerald|first3=Garret A. | chapter=26: Analgesic Antipyretic and Antiinflammatory Agents |title=Goodman and Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics| publisher = McGraw-Hill| year = 2006 |edition=11 |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |location = New York| pages = 671–716|url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=942410&searchStr=aspirin }}</ref>

===Headache===
Aspirin, either by itself or in combined formulation, effectively treats some [[Headache#Classification|types of headache]], but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the [[International Classification of Headache Disorders]] distinguishes between [[tension headache]] (the most common), [[migraine]], and [[cluster headache]]. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loder|first=E|coauthors=Rizzoli, P|title=Tension-type headache|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=12 January 2008 | volume=336 | issue=7635 | pages=88–92 | pmid=18187725 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39412.705868.AD|pmc=2190284}}</ref>
Aspirin, especially as a component of an acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine formulation, ''e.g.'', [[Excedrin]] Migraine, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of [[sumatriptan]]. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=B|coauthors=Michael, M|title=Treatment of acute migraine headache|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=271–80|pmid=21302868}}</ref>
There is little data that suggest the aspirin is an effective treatment for cluster headache.

===Fever===
Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control [[fever]] is due to its action on the [[prostaglandin]] system through its irreversible inhibition of [[COX]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bartfai|first=T|coauthors=Conti, B|title=Fever|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=16 March 2010|volume=10|pages=490–503|doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.50|pmid=20305990|pmc=2850202}}</ref> Although aspirin's use as an [[antipyretic]] in adults is well-established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies (including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pugliese|first=A|coauthors=Beltramo, T; Torre, D|title=Reye's and Reye's-like syndromes|journal=Cell biochemistry and function|date=October 2008|volume=26|issue=7|pages=741–6|pmid=18711704|doi=10.1002/cbf.1465}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beutler|first=AI|coauthors=Chesnut, GT; Mattingly, JC; Jamieson, B|title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries.

===Heart attacks and strokes===

The first studies of the effect of Aspirin on cardiac function and stroke prevention was carried out by Professor Peter Sleight <ref> http://www.theheart.org/fr/documents/satellite_programs/prevention/791993/biography/sleight.html </ref>, Emeritus Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Oxford University in the early 1970s. <ref> http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-confirms-and-points-to-future-aspirin-uses-for-disease-prevention-75958547.html </ref> Prof Sleight and his research team at Oxford led the way and formed the foundation for the research into the use of aspirin in the prevention of other medical conditions.

For a subset of the population, aspirin may help [[Preventive medicine|prevent]] heart attacks and strokes. In lower doses, aspirin has been known to prevent the progression of existing cardiovascular disease, and reduce the frequency of these events for those with a history of them.<ref name=pmid20112887>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=SL|coauthors=Lorenc, T|title=Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2010|volume=81|issue=3|pages=289–96|pmid=20112887}}</ref><ref name="pmid19482214">{{Cite journal|author=Baigent C |title=Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9678 |pages=1849–60 |year=2009 |pmid=19482214 |pmc=2715005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60503-1|author-separator=,|author2=Blackwell L|author3=Collins R|last4=Collins|first4=R|last5=Emberson|first5=J|last6=Godwin|first6=J|last7=Peto|first7=R|last8=Buring|first8=J|last9=Hennekens|first9=C }}</ref> (This is known as ''secondary prevention''.)

Aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with pre-existing disease. (This is called ''primary prevention.'')

===Post-surgery===
After [[Percutaneous coronary intervention|percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs)]], such as the placement of a [[coronary artery]] [[stent]], a U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web|last=National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)|title=2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guideline for percutaneous coronary artery intervention. A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.|url=http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=34980|publisher=United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> Frequently, aspirin is combined with an [[ADP receptor inhibitor]], such as [[clopidogrel]], [[prasugrel]] or [[ticagrelor]] to prevent [[thrombosis|blood clots]]. This is called ''dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT)''. United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued post-surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after drug eluting stent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Musumeci|first=G|coauthors=Di Lorenzo, E; Valgimigli, M|title=Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: what are the drivers?|journal=Current Opinion in Cardiology|date=December 2011|volume=26 Suppl 1|pages=S4–14|pmid=22129582|doi=10.1097/01.hco.0000409959.11246.ba}}</ref>  However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.

===Cancer prevention===
Aspirin's effect on cancer has been widely studied, particularly its effect on [[colorectal cancer]] (CRC). Multiple [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] and reviews have concluded that regular use of aspirin reduces the long-term risk of CRC [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] and mortality.<ref name="Algra 518–27"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Manzano|first=A|coauthors=Pérez-Segura, P|title=Colorectal cancer chemoprevention: is this the future of colorectal cancer prevention?|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|year=2012|volume=2012|page=327341|doi=10.1100/2012/327341|pmid=22649288|pmc=3353298}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=AT|coauthors=Arber, N; Burn, J; Chia, WK; Elwood, P; Hull, MA; Logan, RF; Rothwell, PM; Schrör, K; Baron, JA|title=Aspirin in the chemoprevention of colorectal neoplasia: an overview|journal=Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)|date=February 2012|volume=5|issue=2|pages=164–78|pmid=22084361|doi=10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-11-0391|pmc=3273592}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Thun|first=MJ|coauthors=Jacobs, EJ; Patrono, C|title=The role of aspirin in cancer prevention|journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology|date=3 April 2012|volume=9|issue=5|pages=259–67|pmid=22473097|doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2011.199}}</ref> However, the relationships of aspirin dose and duration of use to the various types of CRC risk, including mortality, progression, and incidence, are not well-defined.

===Other uses===
Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint pain symptoms of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]]. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.<ref name=NHFA>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080726052030/http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf|title=Diagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia.

===Resistance===
For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity.

===Dosage===
[[File:Regular strength enteric coated aspirin tablets.jpg|thumb|Coated 325 mg aspirin tablets]]
Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300&nbsp;mg in Britain and 325&nbsp;mg in the United States.  Smaller doses are based on these standards, ''e.g.'', 75&nbsp;mg and 81&nbsp;mg tablets. The 81&nbsp;mg tablets are called "baby-strength", even though they are not intended to be administered to infants and children. There is no medical significance in the slight difference in dosage between the 75&nbsp;mg and the 81&nbsp;mg tablets.  Of historic interest, in the United States, a 325&nbsp;mg dose is equivalent to the historic 5 [[Grain (unit)|grain]] aspirin tablet in use prior to the metric system.

In general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis,<ref name=BNF>{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary]]|edition=45|year=2003|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]]}}</ref> with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&drugid=3881&drugname=Aspirin+EC+Oral&monotype=monograph |title=Aspirin monograph: dosages, etc |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref> For the prevention of [[myocardial infarction]] in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.<ref name=BNF />

Recommendations from the USPSTF<ref>(USPSTF, March 2009)</ref> on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in [[myocardial infarction]] (MI) for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.<ref name=medscape>{{cite web|url=http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/589895?src=cmemp |title=Aspirin: More Evidence That Low Dose Is All That Is Needed (from Medscape) |publisher=Cme.medscape.com |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref> The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81&nbsp;mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause.<ref name=medscape /> Low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81&nbsp;mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.<ref name=medscape />

In children with [[Kawasaki disease]], aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary for Children]]|year=2006|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]}}</ref>

It appears that blockade of COX-1 by aspirin results in the upregulation of COX-2 as part of a gastric defense<ref>{{cite pmid|18923189}}</ref> and that taking COX-2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion.<ref>{{cite pmid|12960371}}</ref> Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any "natural" supplements with COX-2 inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, genistein, quercetin, resorcinol, and others.

In addition to enteric coating, "buffering" is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses MgO. Other preparations use CaCO<sub>3</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |title=General Chemistry Online: FAQ: Acids and bases: What is the buffer system in buffered aspirin? |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>

Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute [[encephalopathy]] and [[fatty liver]], can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in under-18 patients were reported to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a [[Respiratory tract infection (disambiguation)|respiratory infection]], [[chickenpox]], or [[diarrhea]].

===Hives and swelling===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].

===Other adverse effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema]] (swelling of skin tissues) in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Berges-Gimeno MP & Stevenson DD |year=2004 |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced reactions and desensitization |journal=J Asthma |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=375–84 |pmid=15281324 |doi=10.1081/JAS-120037650}}</ref>

Aspirin is known to [[Drug interaction|interact]] with other drugs. For example, [[acetazolamide]] and [[ammonium chloride]] are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicyclates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs.<ref name='drugs.com'>{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/aspirin.html |title=Aspirin information from Drugs.com |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=Drugs.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080509163105/http://www.drugs.com/aspirin.html| archivedate= 9 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name='personalmd'>{{cite web|url=http://www.personalmd.com/drgdb/3.htm |title=Oral Aspirin information |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=First DataBank| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080609015511/http://www.personalmd.com/drgdb/3.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the [[antidiabetic drug]]s [[tolbutamide]] and [[chlorpropamide]], the [[immunosuppressant]] [[methotrexate]], [[phenytoin]], [[probenecid]], [[valproic acid]] (as well as interfering with [[beta oxidation]], an important part of valproate metabolism) and any NSAID.

==Chemical properties==
Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or of the [[acetate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[citrate]]s or [[hydroxide]]s of the [[alkali metals]]. ASA is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic [[acid]]s. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor=EF Reynolds|encyclopedia=Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia|edition=28th|year=1982|pages=234–82|title=Aspirin and similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents}}</ref>

==Physical properties==
Aspirin, an [[acetyl]] derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance, with a [[melting point]] of {{convert|136|C|0|abbr=on}}, and a boiling point of  {{convert|140|C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Myers2007">{{cite book|author=Richard Leroy Myers|title=The 100 Most Important Chemical Compounds: A Reference Guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MwpQWcIKMzAC&pg=PA10|accessdate=18 November 2012|date=30 August 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33758-1|page=10}}</ref>

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a [[chemical reaction]] that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[ester]] group (R-OH → R-OCOCH<sub>3</sub>). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Experimental Organic Chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R. |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-28250-2 |page=494}}</ref>

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,<ref>{{Cite pmid|16316223}}</ref> and fine structural details were given by Bond ''et al.''<ref>{{Cite journal|author= Bond, Andrew D.; Boese, Roland; and Desiraju, Gautam R. |title = On the Polymorphism of Aspirin: Crystalline Aspirin as Intergrowths of Two "Polymorphic" Domains|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]|year = 2007|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 618–622|doi = 10.1002/anie.200603373|pmid= 17139692}}</ref> A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and [[levetiracetam]] from hot [[acetonitrile]]. The form II is only stable at 100 [[Kelvin|K]] and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] through the [[acetyl]] groups with the (acidic) [[methyl]] proton to [[carbonyl]] [[hydrogen bond]]s, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the [[carboxylic acid]] groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.

==Mechanism of action==

===Discovery of the mechanism===
In 1971, British [[pharmacologist]] [[John Robert Vane]], then employed by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[thromboxane]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis as a mechanism of action for aspirin-like drugs|author = Vane, John Robert | journal = Nature – New Biology| year = 1971| volume = 231| issue = 25| pages = 232–5| pmid= 5284360}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |author=Vane JR, Botting RM |year=2003 |title=The mechanism of action of aspirin |journal=Thromb Res |volume=110 |issue=5–6 |pages=255–8 |pmid=14592543 |doi=10.1016/S0049-3848(03)00379-7 |url=http://www.eao.chups.jussieu.fr/polys/certifopt/saule_coxib/theme/1vane2003.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], jointly with [[Sune K. Bergström]] and [[Bengt I. Samuelsson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1982/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1982 |publisher=Nobelprize.or}}</ref> In 1984 he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]].

===Suppression of prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an [[acetyl]] group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.

Low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>]] in [[platelet]]s, producing an inhibitory effect on [[platelet|platelet aggregation]]. This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in Heart Attack and Stroke Prevention |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archivedate=31 March 2008}}</ref> 40&nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Tohgi| first = H| coauthors = S Konno, K Tamura, B Kimura and K Kawano|year = 1992|title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin|journal = Stroke| volume = 23|pages = 1400–1403 |pmid=1412574|issue = 10| doi=10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400}}</ref>

Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute [[myocardial infarction]]. An unwanted side effect of the effective anticlotting action of aspirin is that it may cause excessive bleeding.

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
There are at least two different types of cyclooxygenase: COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.<ref>{{cite journal|

However, several of the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn recently, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Curr Pharm Des |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=22 |pages=2215–27 |title=Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of COX-inhibition: benefits and risks |author=Martínez-González J, Badimon L |pmid=17691994 |doi=10.2174/138161207781368774 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Cardiovasc Pharmacol |title=COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk |author=Funk CD, FitzGerald GA |date=November 2007 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=470–9 |pmid=18030055 |doi=10.1097/FJC.0b013e318157f72d}}</ref> Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.<ref name="SomasundaramS">{{Cite journal|author1=Somasundaram|first2=G|first3=RJ|first4=J|first5=M|first6=IA|first7=S|first8=A|first9=R|issue=5|last2=Sigthorsson|last3=Simpson|last4=Watts|last5=Jacob|last6=Tavares|last7=Rafi|last8=Roseth|last9=Foster|year=2000|title=Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|volume=14|pages=639–650|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x|pmid=10792129}}</ref> In short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses of aspirin are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Mark J. |last=Paul-Clark |first2=Thong van |last2=Cao |first3=Niloufar |last3=Moradi-Bidhendi |first4=Dianne |last4=Cooper |first5=Derek W. |last5=Gilroy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=15-epi-lipoxin A4–mediated Induction of Nitric Oxide Explains How Aspirin Inhibits Acute Inflammation |journal=J.

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to [[salicylic acid]], which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], and this has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1215327}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Raffensperger, Lisa |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21718-clues-to-aspirins-anticancer-effects-revealed.html |title=Clues to aspirin's anti-cancer effects revealed|journal=New Scientist|date=19 April 2012|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(12)61073-2|volume=214|issue=2862|page=16}}</ref> The [[acetyl]] portion of the aspirin molecule is not without its own targets.

===Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity===

Effects on [[growth hormone]], [[prolactin]],<ref>{{cite pmid|6642786|noedit}}</ref> and [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] (with relevant effect on [[Triiodothyronine|T3]] and [[Thyroxine|T4]]) were observed directly.<ref>{{cite pmid|820703|noedit}}</ref>

==Pharmacokinetics==
[[Salicylic acid]] is a weak acid, and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is poorly soluble in the [[pH|acidic]] conditions of the stomach, which can delay absorption of high doses for eight to 24 hours. The increased pH and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed rapidly there, which in turn allows more of the salicylate to dissolve. Owing to the issue of solubility, however, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.<ref name="'RK Ferguson'">{{Cite journal|title=Death following self-poisoning with aspirin|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=17 August 1970|first=RK|last=Ferguson|coauthors=Boutros, AR|volume=213|issue=7|pages=1186–8|pmid=5468267|doi=10.1001/jama.213.7.1186}}</ref><ref name="'FL Kaufman'">{{Cite journal|title=Darvon poisoning with delayed salicylism: a case report|journal=Pediatrics|date=1970-04|first=FL|last=Kaufman|coauthors=Dubansky, AS|volume=49|issue=4|pages=610–1|pmid=5013423}}</ref><ref name="G Levy">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM197208312870903|title=Salicylate accumulation kinetics in man|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=31 September 1972|first=G|last=Levy|coauthors=Tsuchiya, T|volume=287|issue=9|pages=430–2|pmid=5044917 }}</ref>

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to albumin [[protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 l/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.<ref name="G Levy"/>

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. Conjugation with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] it forms salicyl acyl and phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first order to zero order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidney|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.<ref name="G Levy"/>

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the [[kidney]]s as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), [[gentisic acid]] (< 1%), and [[2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid|2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid]].<ref>2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid is a product of human aspirin metabolism.

[[File:Aspirine-1923.jpg|thumb|left|1923 advertisement]]
Plant extracts, including [[willow]] [[bark]] and [[spiraea]], of which salicylic acid was the active ingredient, had been known to help alleviate headaches, pains, and fevers since antiquity. The father of modern medicine, [[Hippocrates]], who lived some time between 460 BC and 377 BC, left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blaspirin.htm |title=History of aspirin |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>

A French chemist, [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]], was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853. In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various [[acid anhydride]]s, he mixed [[acetyl chloride]] with a [[sodium]] salt of salicylic acid ([[sodium salicylate]]). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified.<ref name=gerhardt>{{de icon}} {{Cite journal|author=Gerhardt C|title=Untersuchungen über die wasserfreien organischen Säuren |journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=87|pages=149–179|year=1853 |doi=10.1002/jlac.18530870107}}</ref> Since no [[structural theory]] existed at that time, Gerhardt called the compound he obtained "salicylic-acetic anhydride" (''wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure''). This preparation of aspirin ("salicylic-acetic anhydride") was one of the many reactions Gerhardt conducted for his paper on anhydrides and he did not pursue it further.

Six years later, in 1859, von Gilm obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called ''acetylierte Salicylsäure'', acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride.<ref name=gilm>{{de icon}} {{Cite journal|author=von Gilm H|title=Acetylderivate der Phloretin- und Salicylsäure|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=112|issue=2|pages=180–185|year=1859|doi=10.1002/jlac.18591120207}}</ref> In 1869, Schröder, Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.<ref>{{de icon}}{{Cite journal|author= Schröder, Prinzhorn, Kraut K|title=Uber Salicylverbindungen|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1869|doi=10.1002/jlac.18691500102}}</ref>

In 1897, chemists working at [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] produced a synthetically altered version of [[salicin]], derived from the species ''[[Filipendula ulmaria]]'' (meadowsweet), which caused less digestive upset than pure [[salicylic acid]]. The identity of the lead chemist on this project is a matter of controversy. Bayer states the work was done by [[Felix Hoffmann]], but the Jewish chemist [[Arthur Eichengrün]] later claimed he was the lead investigator and records of his contribution were expunged under the [[Nazi]] regime.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mahdi|first=JG|coauthors=Mahdi, AJ, Mahdi, AJ, Bowen, ID|title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential|journal=Cell proliferation|date=April 2006|volume=39|issue=2|pages=147–55|pmid=16542349|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |date=23–30 December 2000 |volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1591–4 |title=The discovery of aspirin: a reappraisal |author=Sneader W|pmid=11124191 |doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1591 |pmc=1119266}}</ref> The new drug, formally acetylsalicylic acid, was named Aspirin by [[Bayer|Bayer AG]] after the old [[botany|botanical]] name for meadowsweet, ''Spiraea ulmaria''.

However, recent research suggests the high death toll of the [[1918_flu_pandemic#Aspirin_poisoning|1918 flu was partly due to aspirin]], as the doses used at times can lead to toxicity, fluid in the lungs, and, in some cases, contribute to secondary bacterial infections and mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starko|first1=Karen M.|title = Salicylates and Pandemic Influenza Mortality, 1918–1919 Pharmacology, Pathology, and Historic Evidence |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=49|page=1405|year=2009|doi=10.1086/606060|issue=9|pmid=19788357}}</ref> Aspirin's profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of aspirin brands and products, especially after the American patent held by Bayer expired in 1917.

==Veterinary use==
Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used, instead. Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of [[laminitis]] in horses. <ref>{{cite web|last = Crosby|first = Janet Tobiassen|title = Veterinary Questions and Answers|publisher = About.com|year = 2006|url = http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/altvetmedgeneral/a/dogcataspirin.htm|accessdate =5 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070908151020/http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/altvetmedgeneral/a/dogcataspirin.htm| archivedate= 8 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="CambridgeH">{{Cite journal|author=Cambridge H, Lees P, Hooke RE, Russell CS|title=Antithrombotic actions of aspirin in the horse |journal=Equine Vet J |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1904347|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1991.tb02736.x}}</ref> It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment.
