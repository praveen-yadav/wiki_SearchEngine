'''''{{lang|de|Deutsches Institut f&uuml;r Normung e.V.}}''''' ('''DIN'''; in [[English language|English]], the '''German Institute for Standardization''') is the [[Germany|German]] national organization for [[standardization]] and is that country's [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] member body. DIN is a Registered German Association (''e.V.'') headquartered in [[Berlin]]. There are currently around thirty thousand DIN [[Technical standard|Standard]]s, covering nearly every field of technology.

Founded in 1917 as the ''{{lang|de|Normenausschu&szlig; der deutschen Industrie}}''<!-- szlig is old German spelling --> (NADI, "Standardisation Committee of German Industry"), the NADI was renamed ''{{lang|de|Deutscher Normenausschu&szlig;}}''<!-- szlig is old German spelling --> (DNA, "German Standardisation Committee") in 1926 to reflect that the organization now dealt with standardization issues in many fields; viz., not just for industrial products. In 1975 it was renamed again to ''{{lang|de|Deutsches Institut f&uuml;r Normung}}'', or 'DIN' and is recognized by the German government as the official national-standards body, representing German interests at the international and [[Europe]]an levels.

The [[acronym]], 'DIN,' is often incorrectly expanded as ''{{lang|de|Deutsche Industrienorm}}'' ("German Industry Standard"). This is largely due to the historic origin of the DIN as "NADI". The NADI indeed published their standards as ''{{lang|de|DI-Norm}}'' (''{{lang|de|Deutsche Industrienorm}}''). For example, the first published standard was '{{lang|de|DI-Norm 1}}' (about [[tapered pin]]s) in 1918. Many people still mistakenly associate DIN with the old ''{{lang|de|DI-Norm}}'' naming convention.

One of the earliest, and probably the most well-known, is [[DIN 476]] &mdash; the standard that introduced the [[ISO 216|A-series]] [[paper size]]s in 1922 &mdash; adopted in 1975 as International Standard [[ISO 216]]. Common examples in modern technology include [[DIN connector|DIN]] and [[mini-DIN]] connectors.

==DIN standard designation==
The designation of a DIN [[Technical standard|standard]] shows its origin (# denotes a number):
* ''DIN #'' is used for German standards with primarily domestic significance or designed as a first step toward international status. ''E DIN #'' is a draft standard and ''DIN V #'' is a preliminary standard.
*''DIN EN #'' is used for the German edition of European standards.
*''DIN ISO #'' is used for the German edition of ISO standards.
*''DIN EN ISO #'' is used if the standard has also been adopted as a European standard.
