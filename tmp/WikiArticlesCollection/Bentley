'''Bentley Motors Limited''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|n|t|l|i}} engineers, manufactures and distributes luxury automobiles and automobile parts worldwide. Based in Crewe, England, United Kingdom, Bentley Motors Limited has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the German [[Volkswagen AG]] since 1998. W.&nbsp;O. Bentley founded his namesake company on 18 January 1919. [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] purchased Bentley in 1931.

Bentley Motors Limited is the direct successor of [[Rolls-Royce Motors]], which Volkswagen AG purchased in 1998. The purchase included the vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks, but not the rights to the use of the Rolls-Royce name or logo, which are owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc and were later licensed to [[BMW|BMW AG]].

Before [[World War&nbsp;I]], Walter Owen Bentley had been in partnership with his brother Horace Millner Bentley selling French [[Doriot, Flandrin & Parant|DFP]] cars, but he had always wanted to design and build his own range of cars bearing his name.

Rolls-Royce stopped the racing programme.<!-- After it purchased Bentley? -->

It was on a visit to the DFP factory in 1913 that W.O. noticed an aluminium paperweight, and had the inspired idea of using the lightweight metal instead of cast iron to make engine pistons. The first Bentley aluminium pistons went into service in aero engines for the Sopwith Camel during [[World War&nbsp;I]].

===Barnato becomes chairman===
[[Woolf Barnato]] acquired his first Bentley (a 3-litre) in 1925, just 12 months before he also acquired the business itself. With this car he won numerous [[Brooklands]] races. He was a member of a social set of wealthy British motorists known as the "[[Bentley Boys]]" who favoured the cars of W.&nbsp;O. Bentley. Many were independently wealthy, often with a background in military service. Barnato was [[List of motorsports people by nickname#B|nicknamed]] "Babe", in ironic deference to his [[heavyweight boxer]]'s stature.

The Bentley enterprise was always underfunded, but inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by [[John Duff]] and [[Frank Clement (racing driver)|Frank Clement]], Barnato agreed to finance Bentley's business. Barnato had incorporated ''Baromans Ltd'' in 1922, which existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested in excess of £100,000, saving the business and its workforce. A financial reorganisation of the original Bentley company was carried out and all existing creditors paid off for £75,000. Existing shares were devalued from £1 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares giving him control of the company and he became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: £35,000 secured by [[debenture]] in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929. With renewed financial input, W. O. Bentley was able to design another generation of cars.

===The Bentley Boys===
[[File:1929 Bentley front 34 right.jpg|thumb|1929 4½ litre [[Bentley Blower|"Blower" Bentley]]<br/>developed in Welwyn Garden City by "Tim" Birkin and pushed over W.O. to market before it was reliable]]
A group of wealthy British motorists known as the "[[Bentley Boys]]"—[[Woolf Barnato]], [[Henry Birkin|Sir Henry "Tim" Birkin]], [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechaser]] [[George Duller]], [[aviator]] [[Glen Kidston]], automotive journalist [[S.C.H. "Sammy" Davis]], and [[Dudley Benjafield|Dr Dudley Benjafield]] among them—kept the marque's reputation for high performance alive. Bentley, located at [[Cricklewood]], north London, was noted for its four consecutive victories at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] from 1927 to 1930.

In 1929, Birkin had developed the lightweight [[Blower Bentley]], including five racing specials that started with the Brooklands racing designed [[Bentley Blower No.1]].

In March 1930, during the [[Blue Train Races]], Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on [[Rover Company|Rover]] and its [[Rover Light Six]], having raced and beat ''[[Le Train Bleu]]'' for the first time, to better that record with his 6½-litre [[Bentley Speed Six]] on a bet of £100. He drove against the train from [[Cannes]] to [[Calais]], then by ferry to [[Dover]], and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won; the [[H.J. Mulliner & Co.|H.J. Mulliner]]–bodied [[sedan (automobile)|formal saloon]] he drove during the race as well as a streamlined fastback "Sportsman Coupé" by [[J Gurney Nutting & Co Limited|Gurney Nutting]]—he took delivery of on 21 May 1930—became known as the "[[Blue Train Bentley]]s"; the latter is regularly mistaken for (or erroneously referred to) as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1698/Bentley-Speed-Six--Blue-Train-Special-.html |title=Bentley Speed Six 'Blue Train Special' |last=Melissen |first=Wouter |date=12 January 2004 |publisher=UltimateCarPage |accessdate=4 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html |title=The Slippery Shape of Power |last=Burgess-Wise |first=David |date=1 January 2006 |work=Auto Aficionado |accessdate=4 November 2008}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Car models, Cricklewood===
[[File:Bentley Berline 8 liter pic2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bentley 8 Litre]] 4-door sports saloon]]
*1921–29 [[Bentley 3 Litre|3-litre]]
*1926–30 [[Bentley 4½ Litre|4½-litre & "Blower Bentley"]]
*1926–30 [[Bentley Speed Six|6½-litre]]
*1928–30 [[Bentley Speed Six|6½-litre Speed Six]]
*1930–31 [[Bentley 8 Litre|8-litre]]
*1931 [[Bentley 4 Litre|4-litre]]

The original model was the 3-litre, but as customers put heavier bodies on the chassis, a larger 4½-litre model followed. Perhaps the most iconic model of the period is the 4½-litre "Blower Bentley", with its distinctive [[supercharger]] projecting forward from the bottom of the grille. Uncharacteristically fragile for a Bentley, it was not the racing workhorse the 6½-litre was. It became famous in popular media as the vehicle of choice of [[James Bond]] in the original [[Ian Fleming|novels]], but this has been seen only briefly in the [[James Bond film series|films]]. [[John Steed]] in the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' drove a Bentley.

The new 8-litre was such a success that when Barnato's money seemed to run out in 1931 and Napier was planning to buy Bentley's business, Rolls-Royce purchased Bentley Motors to prevent competition for the market of their most expensive model, Phantom&nbsp;II.

===Receivership, Sale to Rolls-Royce===
The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] affected the Bentley business greatly, with the [[Great Depression]] reducing demand for its expensive products. In July 1931, two mortgage payments on the firm that were guaranteed by Barnato fell due, and he advised the lenders that he was "unable to meet these debts". On 10 July, on the application of the mortgagee, the court appointed a [[receivership|Receiver]] to Bentley Motors Limited.<ref>"Receiver Appointed Of Bentley Motors Limited Re Bentley Motors Limited; London Life Association Limited v. Bentley Motors Limited, And Woolf Barnato". ''The Times'', Saturday, 11 Jul 1931; pg. 4; Issue 45872</ref>

{{Quotation|The Press Association understands that Messrs Napier and Son, aero-engine builders, have reached an agreement to take over Bentley Motors Limited which is in voluntary liquidation. It is expected that the matter will come before the Court within the next few days.|[[Press Association]]|"Napier To Absorb Bentley Motors"|[[The Times]], Saturday, Oct 24, 1931; pg. 18; Issue 45962}}

[[Napier & Son]] negotiated with Bentley's receiver to buy the company, with the takeover expected to be made final in November 1931. Instead, a competitor named British Central Equitable Trust offered a counter-proposal at that time and outbid Napier in a sealed bid auction. British Central Equitable Trust later proved to be a [[Front organization|front]] for [[Rolls-Royce Limited]].<ref><blockquote>It was officially announced yesterday that the assets of the Bentley Motor Company have been taken over from the British Equitable Central Trust by Rolls-Royce who have under consideration the formation of a subsidiary company to deal with the matter.

Barnato received around £42,000 in return for his shares in Bentley Motors, having bought a sizeable stake in Rolls-Royce not long before Bentley Motors was liquidated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} By 1934 he was appointed to the board of the new Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd.<ref><blockquote>Captain Woolf Barnato has joined the board of Bentley Motors (1931) Limited.

This attempted total obliteration of Bentley Motors [[W O Bentley#Lock-out|and its founder]] was one outcome of a highly personal "[[feud|vendetta]]" between the two engineers, [[Ernest Walter Hives, 1st Baron Hives|Hives]] and [[W O Bentley|Bentley]], two men of quite different natures, begun in 1914 when Bentley was made [[W O Bentley#Aero engines|official liaison]] between Government and aero engine manufacturers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Bentley's abiding weaknesses were in sometimes poor personal relationships combined with his apparent inability to curb spending on development. The 8-Litre was acknowledged{{By whom|date=March 2012}} to be the better if more expensive car. Bentley may have been the better engineer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He accepted the position of patron of the Bentley Drivers' Club just before the end of Woolf Barnato's term as its president.

Unhappy with his role at Rolls-Royce, when his contract expired at the end of April 1935 W.&nbsp;O. Bentley left to join [[Lagonda]].

When the new [[Bentley 3.5 Litre|Bentley 3½ litre]] appeared in 1933, it was a sporting variant of the [[Rolls-Royce 20/25]], which disappointed some traditional customers yet was well received by many others.

==Crewe==
[[File:Bentley-plant in Crewe.JPG|thumb|Bentley plant in Crewe]]
After World War&nbsp;II, Rolls-Royce chose to focus its aero-engine production on Derby. Production of motorcars was moved to the ex-wartime [[shadow factory]] in [[Bentley Crewe|Crewe]], [[Cheshire]].

===Post-war standard-steel saloons===
[[File:Bentley MK VI DE-14-32 pic3.JPG|right|thumb|[[Bentley Mark VI]] standard steel saloon, the first Bentley supplied by Rolls-Royce with a standard body.]]
Until some time after [[World War&nbsp;II]], most high-end motorcar manufacturers like Bentley and Rolls-Royce did not supply complete cars. They sold [[rolling chassis]], near-complete from the instrument panel forward. Each chassis was delivered to the coachbuilder of the buyer's choice. The biggest specialist car dealerships had coachbuilders build standard designs for them which were held in stock awaiting potential buyers.

[[File:Bentley MK VI project 4951122539.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The assembled pressings from Pressed Steel]]
To meet post-war demand, particularly UK Government pressure to export and earn overseas currency, Rolls-Royce developed an all steel body using pressings made by [[Pressed Steel Company|Pressed Steel]] to create a "standard" ready-to-drive complete saloon car. Some years later, initially only for export, the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn]] was introduced, a standard steel Bentley but with a Rolls-Royce radiator grille for a small extra charge, and this convention continued.

Chassis remained available to coachbuilders until the end of production of the [[Bentley S3]], which was replaced by the chassis-less [[monocoque]] construction [[Bentley T-series|T series]].
{{-}}

===Bentley Continental===
[[File:Bentley SI Continental Fastback Coupe Mulliner.jpg|right|thumb|Bentley Continental, fastback coupé body by H J Mulliner]]
The Continental fastback coupé was produced principally for the domestic home market, the majority of cars produced (165, including a [[prototype]]) being right-hand drive. The chassis was produced at the Crewe factory and shared many components with the standard R type. Other than the R-Type standard steel saloon, R-Type Continentals were delivered as rolling chassis to the [[coachbuilder]] of choice. Coachwork for most of these cars was completed by [[H.&nbsp;J. Mulliner & Co.]] who mainly built them in fastback coupe form. Other coachwork came from [[Park Ward]] (London) who built six, later including a drophead coupe version. Franay (Paris) built five, Graber (Wichtrach, Switzerland) built three, one of them later altered by Köng (Basel, Switzerland), and [[Pininfarina]] made one. [[James Young (coachbuilder)|James Young]] (London) built in 1954 a Sports Saloon for the owner of James Young's, James Barclay.

The early R&nbsp;Type Continental has essentially the same engine as the standard R&nbsp;Type, but with modified carburation, induction and exhaust manifolds along with higher gear ratios.<ref name=Autocar1969>{{cite journal |title = Used Car test: Bentley Continental| journal=Autocar| volume = 130 |issue=3824 | pages = 47–48| date = 29 May 1969}}</ref> After July 1954 the car was fitted with an engine, having now a larger bore of 94.62&nbsp;mm (3.7&nbsp;in) with a total displacement of {{convert|4887|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}}. The compression ratio was raised to 7.25:1.

==Vickers==
The problems of Bentley's owner with Rolls-Royce aero engine development, the [[RB211]], brought about the financial collapse of its business in 1970.

The motorcar division was made a separate business, Rolls-Royce Motors Limited, which remained independent until bought by [[Vickers plc]] in August 1980. By the 1970s and early 1980s Bentley sales had fallen badly; at one point less than 5% of combined production carried the Bentley badge.<ref name=Beaulieu/> Under Vickers, Bentley set about regaining its high-performance heritage, typified by the 1980 [[Bentley Mulsanne (1980–1992)|Mulsanne]]. Bentley's restored sporting image created a renewed interest in the name and Bentley sales as a proportion of output began to rise. By 1986 the Bentley:Rolls-Royce ratio had reached 40:60; by 1991 it achieved parity.<ref name=Beaulieu/>

===Volkswagen AG vs. BMW AG===
In October 1997, Vickers announced that it had decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. [[BMW|BMW AG]] seemed to be a logical purchaser because BMWh already supplied engines and other components for Bentley and Rolls-Royce branded cars and because of BMW and Vickers joint efforts in building aircraft engines. BMW made a final offer of £340m, but was outbid by [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen AG]], which offered £430m. Volkswagen AG acquired the vehicle designs, model nameplates, production and administrative facilities, the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grill shape trademarks, but not the rights to the use of the Rolls-Royce name or logo, which are owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. In 1998, BMW started supplying components for the new range of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars—notably [[V8 engine]]s for the [[Bentley Arnage]] and [[V12 engine]]s for the [[Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph]], however, the supply contract allowed BMW to terminate its supply deal with Rolls-Royce with 12 months' notice, which would not be enough time for Volkswagen to re-engineer the cars.

[[File:bentleyazure.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bentley Azure]] Mulliner 2003 Final Series]]
BMW paid [[Rolls-Royce plc]] £40m to license the Rolls-Royce name and logo. After negotiations, BMW and Volkswagen AG agreed that, from 1998 to 2002, BMW would continue to supply engines and components and would allow Volkswagen temporary use of the Rolls-Royce name and logo. All BMW engine supply ended in 2003 with the end of Silver Seraph production.

From 1 January 2003 forward, Volkswagen AG would be the sole provider of cars with the "Bentley" marque. BMW established a new legal entity, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited, and constructed a newly built administrative headquarters and production facility for Rolls-Royce branded vehicles in Goodwood, West Sussex, England.

After acquiring the business, Volkswagen spent [[Pound sterling|GBP]]500&nbsp;million (about [[United States dollar|USD]]845 million) to modernise the Crewe factory and increase production capacity.<ref name=BW062410>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-24/volkswagen-said-to-shuffle-porsche-bentley-managers.html |title=Volkswagen Said to Shuffle Porsche, Bentley Managers |date=24 June 2010 |first=Andreas |last=Cremer |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref>
As of early 2010, there are about 3,500 working at Crewe, compared with about 1,500 in 1998 before being taken over by Volkswagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/going-back-in-time-at-the-bentley-factory/|title=Going Back in Time at the Bentley Factory |date=10 May 2010 |first=Mark |last=Gillies |publisher=Car and Driver blog |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}</ref>
It was reported that Volkswagen invested a total of nearly [[United States dollar|USD]]2&nbsp;billion in Bentley and its revival.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_49/b3911105.htm |title=VW Steals A Lead In Luxury |date=6 December 2004 |first=Gail |last=Edmondson |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}</ref>
As a result of upgrading facilities at Crewe the bodywork now arrives fully painted at the Crewe facility for final assembly, with the parts coming from Germany—similarly Rolls-Royce body shells are painted and shipped to the UK for assembly only.

In 2002, Bentley presented [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] with an official [[Bentley State Limousine|State Limousine]] to celebrate her [[Golden Jubilee]]. In 2003, Bentley's two-door convertible, the [[Bentley Azure]], ceased production, and Bentley introduced a second line, [[Bentley Continental GT]], a large luxury coupé powered by a [[W12 engine]] built in Crewe.

Demand had been so great that the factory at Crewe was unable to meet orders despite an installed capacity of approximately 9,500 vehicles per year; there was a waiting list of over a year for new cars to be delivered. Consequently, part of the production of the new [[Bentley Continental Flying Spur (2005)|Flying Spur]], a four-door version of the Continental GT, was assigned to the [[Transparent Factory]] (Germany), where the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury car is also assembled. This arrangement ceased at the end of 2006 after around 1,000 cars, with all car production reverting to the Crewe plant.

In April 2005, Bentley confirmed plans to produce a four-seat convertible model—the [[Bentley Azure|Azure]], derived from the [[Bentley Arnage|Arnage Drophead Coupé]] prototype—at Crewe beginning in 2006. By the autumn of 2005, the convertible version of the successful Continental GT, the [[Bentley Continental|Continental GTC]], was also presented. These two models were successfully launched in late 2006.

A limited run of a [[Zagato]] modified GT was also announced in March 2008, dubbed "GTZ".

A new version of the Bentley Continental was introduced at the 2009 [[Geneva Auto Show]]: The [[Bentley Continental Supersports|Continental Supersports]]. This new Bentley is a supercar combining extreme power with environmentally friendly FlexFuel technology, capable of using petrol (gasoline) and biofuel (E85 ethanol).

Bentley sales continued to increase, and in 2005 8,627 were sold worldwide, 3,654 in the United States. In 2007, the 10,000 cars-per-year threshold was broken for the first time with sales of 10,014. For 2007, a record profit of [[Euro|€]]155&nbsp;million was also announced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bentley reports record profit|last=Garlick|url=http://www.pistonheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=17750|accessdate=18 March 2008}}</ref>
Bentley reported a sale of about 7,600 units in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ajtqDKRS4Rno |title=Daimler Maybach Fails to Dent Rolls, Bentley Super-Luxury Lead |date=15 December 2009 |first=Chris |last=Reiter |first2=Mike |last2=Ramsey |publisher=Bloomberg }}</ref>
However, its global sales plunged 50 percent to 4,616 vehicles in 2009 (with the U.S. deliveries dropped 49% to 1,433 vehicles) and it suffered an operating loss of [[Euro|€]]194&nbsp;million, compared with an [[operating profit]] of [[Euro|€]]10&nbsp;million in 2008.<ref name=BW062410/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-14/volkswagen-s-bentley-targets-u-s-growth-with-mulsanne-sedan.html |title=Volkswagen’s Bentley Targets U.S. Growth With Mulsanne Sedan |date=14 January 2010 |first=Andreas |last=Cremer |work=BusinessWeek |accessdate=25 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> As a result of the slump in sales, production at Crewe was shut down during March and April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1126830/Bentley-announces-seven-week-production-shutdown-Jaguar-chief-calls-Government-aid.html |title=Bentley announces seven-week production shutdown while Jaguar chief calls for Government aid |first=Ray |last=Massey |date=23 January 2009 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London}}</ref> Though vehicle sales increased by 11% to 5,117 in 2010, operating loss grew by 26% to [[Euro|€]]245&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annualreport2010.volkswagenag.com/divisions/bentley.html |title=Volkswagen AG 2010 Annual Report |publisher=Annualreport2010.volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=24 March 2012}}</ref>
In Autumn 2010, workers at Crewe staged a series of protests over proposal of compulsory work on Fridays and mandatory overtime during the week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/crewe-news/crewe-business-news/2010/11/24/bentley-protests-continue-in-crewe-over-changes-to-working-hours-96135-27702030/ |title=Bentley protests continue in Crewe over changes to working hours |date=24 October 2010 |first=Rhiannon |last=Cooke |newspaper=Crewe Chronicle }}</ref>

Vehicle sales in 2011 rose 37% to 7,003 vehicles, with the new Continental GT accounting for over one-third of total sales. The current workforce is about 4,000 people.

The business earned a profit in 2011 after two years of losses as a result of the following sales results:<ref>{{cite news|last=Rauwald|first=Christopher|title=Bentley Mulls Its Own SV|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=4 January 2012|page=B3}}</ref>
