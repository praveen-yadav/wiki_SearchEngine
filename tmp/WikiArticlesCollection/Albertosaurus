'''''Albertosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˌ|b|ɜr|t|ɵ|ˈ|s|ɔr|ə|s}}; meaning "Alberta lizard") is a [[genus]] of [[tyrannosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in western [[North America]] during the Late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], about 70&nbsp;[[million years ago]]. The [[type species]], ''A. sarcophagus'', was apparently restricted in [[range (biology)|range]] to the modern-day [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Alberta]], after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing ''[[Gorgosaurus libratus]]'' as a second species.

As a tyrannosaurid, ''Albertosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[predator]] with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the [[food chain]] in its local [[ecosystem]]. Although relatively large for a theropod, ''Albertosaurus'' was much smaller than its more famous relative ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', probably weighing less than 2&nbsp;[[metric ton]]s.

Since the first discovery in 1884, [[fossil]]s of more than thirty individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of ''Albertosaurus'' anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of [[pack hunter|pack]] behaviour and allows studies of [[ontogeny]] and [[population biology]] which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.

All tyrannosaurids, including ''Albertosaurus'', shared a similar body appearance. Typically for a theropod, ''Albertosaurus'' was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and [[torso]] with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot. The first digit, called the [[hallux]], was short and only the other three contacted the ground, with the third (middle) digit longer than the rest.<ref name=holtz2004/> ''Albertosaurus'' may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14−21&nbsp;kilometres per hour (8−13&nbsp;miles per hour).<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Thulborn  |first1= Richard A. |year=1982 |title= Speeds and gaits of dinosaurs |journal= Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=38 |issue= 3-4  |pages=227−256 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(82)90005-0 }}</ref> At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.<ref name=currie1998/>

Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, ''Gorgosaurus'' at least sixty-two. Unlike most theropods, ''Albertosaurus'' and other tyrannosaurids were [[heterodont]], with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The [[premaxilla]]ry teeth at the tip of the upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and ''D''-shaped in [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]].<ref name=holtz2004/> Like with ''Tyrannosaurus'', the maxillary (cheek) teeth of ''Albertosaurus'' were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey.

[[William Abler]] observed in 2001 that ''Albertosaurus'' [[tooth serrations]] are so thin as to functionally be a [[Fracture|crack]] in the tooth.<ref name="abler-2001">Abler, W.L. 2001.

Indiana University Press.</ref> However, at the base of this crack is a round void called an ampulla which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger [[surface area]], hindering the ability of the "crack" formed by the serration to propagate through the tooth.<ref name="abler-2001" /> An examination of other ancient predators, a [[phytosaur]] and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' found similarly crack-like serrations, but no [[adaptation]]s for preventing crack propagation.<ref name="abler-2001" /> [[Tyrannosaurid]] teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling [[meat]] off a body, rather than [[knife]]-like cutting functions.<ref name="abler-2001" /> Tooth wear patterns hint that complex head shaking behaviours may have been involved in tyrannosaur feeding.<ref name="abler-2001" /> When a tyrannosaur would have pulled back on a piece of meat, the force would tend to push the tip of tooth toward the front of the mouth and the anchored [[Tooth root|root]] would experience tension on the posterior side and compression from the front.<ref name="abler-2001" /> This would typically incline the tooth to crack formation on the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] side of the tooth, but the ampullae at the base of the already crack-like serrations would tend to diffuse potential crack-forming forces.<ref name="abler-2001" /> This form resembles techniques used by [[guitar]] makers to "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity to a stick of wood."<ref name="abler-2001" /> The use of a [[drill]] to create an "ampulla" of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through an important material is also used to protect [[airplane]] surfaces.<ref name="abler-2001" /> Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with kerfs and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions.<ref name="abler-2001" />

==Classification and systematics==
''Albertosaurus'' is a member of the theropod [[family (biology)|family]] Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. Its closest relative is the slightly older ''Gorgosaurus libratus'' (sometimes called ''Albertosaurus libratus''; see below).<ref name=currieetal2003>{{cite_journal |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |coauthors=Hurum, Jørn H; & Sabath, Karol |authorlink=Philip J.

The other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, including ''[[Daspletosaurus]]'', ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' and ''Tyrannosaurus''. Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg ([[tibia]]) and feet ([[metatarsal]]s and [[phalanges]]).<ref name=currie2003a/><ref name=currieetal2003/>

==Discovery and naming==

===Naming===
[[File:Tyrrell - Crane Albertosaure.jpg|thumb|Type specimen]]
''Albertosaurus'' was named by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of ''Tyrannosaurus rex''.<ref name=osborn1905>{{cite_journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry F. |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |year=1905 |title=Tyrannosaurus and other Cretaceous carnivorous dinosaurs |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=21 |pages=259–265 |id={{hdl|2246/1464}} |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5965.2007.00735_17.x}}</ref>{{rp|265}} The name honours [[Alberta]], the [[Canadian province]] established the same year, in which the first remains were found. The generic name also incorporates the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''σαυρος''/''sauros'' ("lizard"), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The [[type species]] is ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus''; the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is derived from Ancient Greek σαρκοφάγος (''sarkophagos'') meaning "flesh-eating" and having the same [[etymology]] as the [[sarcophagus|funeral container]] with which it shares its name: a combination of the Greek words σαρξ/''sarx'' ("flesh") and φαγειν/''phagein'' ("to eat").<ref name=osborn1905/> More than thirty specimens of all ages are known to science.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=currie2003b/>

===Early discoveries===
The [[type specimen]] is a partial skull, collected in the summer of 1884 from an [[outcrop]] of the [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] alongside the [[Red Deer River]], in Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], led by the famous [[geologist]] [[Joseph Tyrrell|Joseph Burr Tyrrell]]. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrell's colleague [[Thomas Chesmer Weston]] found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby.<ref name=TankeCurrie2010>Darren H. Tanke & Philip J. Currie, 2010, "A history of ''Albertosaurus'' discoveries in Alberta, Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1197-1211</ref> The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species ''Laelaps incrassatus'' by [[Edward Drinker Cope]] in 1892,<ref name=cope1892>{{cite_journal |last=Cope |first=Edward D. |authorlink=Edward Drinker Cope |year=1892 |title=On the skull of the dinosaurian ''Laelaps incrassatus'' Cope |journal=American Philosophical Society, Proceedings |volume=30 |pages=240–245}}</ref> although the name ''Laelaps'' was [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|preoccupied]] by a genus of [[mite]] and had been changed to ''[[Dryptosaurus]]'' in 1877 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh, however, [[Lawrence Lambe]] instead of ''Laelaps incrassatus'' used the name ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904,<ref>Lambe, L.M., 1903, "On the lower jaw of ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' (Cope)", ''Ottawa Naturalist'' '''17''': 134</ref><ref name=lambe1904>{{cite_journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1904 |title=On ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'' (Cope) from the Edmonton Series of the Northwest Territory |journal=Contributions to Canadian Palaeontology |volume=3 |pages=1–27|url=http://www.archive.org/details/LambeL.M.1904.OnDryptosaurusIncrassatuscopeFromTheEdmonton |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> a combination first coined by [[Oliver Perry Hay]] in 1902.<ref>Hay, Oliver Perry, 1902, ''Bibliography and Catalogue of the Fossil Vertebrata of North America''. Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey, N° 117, Government Printing Office. pp 868</ref> Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that ''D. incrassatus'' was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of ''D. aquilunguis'', type species of ''Dryptosaurus'', so Osborn created the new name ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before.<ref name=osborn1905/> Both specimens (the [[holotype]] CMN 5600 and the [[paratype]] CMN 5601) are stored in the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] in [[Ottawa]]. By the early twenty-first century some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, ''Albertosaurus'' might be a ''[[nomen dubium]]'', a "dubious name" that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in 2010 [[Thomas Carr (paleontologist)|Thomas Carr]] established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or [[autapomorphy]]: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the [[palatine bone]], proving that ''Albertosaurus'' was a valid [[taxon]].<ref>Thomas D. Carr, 2010, "A taxonomic assessment of the type series of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' and the identity of Tyrannosauridae (Dinosauria, Coelurosauria) in the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Campanian–Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1213-1226</ref>

===Dry Island bonebed===
[[Image:red deer river.jpg|thumb|The [[Red Deer River]] near [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]]. Almost three-quarters of all ''Albertosaurus'' remains have been discovered alongside the river, in outcrops like the ones on either side of this picture.]]
On August 11, 1910, American paleontologist [[Barnum Brown]] discovered the remains of a large group of ''Albertosaurus'' at another [[quarry]] alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals they could identify in the [[bonebed]]. Among the bones deposited in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] collections in [[New York City]] are seven sets of right [[metatarsal]]s, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. The [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]] rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside [[Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park]].<ref name=currie1998>{{cite_journal |last=Currie |first=Philip J. |authorlink=Philip J.

None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by remains in both museums.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=ericksonetal2004/> Excavations continued until 2008, when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at twelve, on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton, and at twenty-six if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to [[ontogeny]]. A total of 1128 ''Albertosaurus'' bones had been secured, the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.<ref>David A. Eberth, & Philip J. Currie, 2010, "Stratigraphy, sedimentology, and taphonomy of the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed (upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation; Maastrichtian), southern Alberta, Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1119-1143</ref>

===''Gorgosaurus libratus''===
In 1913, [[paleontologist]] [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]] recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur ''[[Gorgosaurus]] libratus'' in 1914.<ref name=lambe1914>{{cite_journal |last=Lambe |first=Lawrence M. |authorlink=Lawrence Lambe |year=1914 |title=On a new genus and species of carnivorous dinosaur from the Belly River Formation of Alberta, with a description of the skull of ''Stephanosaurus marginatus'' from the same horizon |journal=Ottawa Naturalist |volume=28 |pages=13–20}}</ref> Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of [[Montana]]. Finding, largely due to a lack of good ''Albertosaurus'' skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, [[Dale Russell]] declared the name ''Gorgosaurus'' a [[junior synonym]] of ''Albertosaurus'', which had been named first, and ''G. libratus'' was renamed ''Albertosaurus libratus'' in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus ''Albertosaurus'' backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.<ref name=russell1970/>

In 2003, [[Philip J. Currie]], benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are [[sister taxa]], more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that ''Albertosaurus'' and ''Gorgosaurus'' be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than ''Daspletosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'', which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from [[Alaska]] and [[New Mexico]], and Currie suggested that the ''Albertosaurus''-''Gorgosaurus'' situation may be clarified once these are described fully.<ref name=currie2003b/> Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation,<ref name=holtz2004/><ref name=ericksonetal2004/><ref name=ricklefs2007>{{cite_journal |last=Ricklefs |first=Robert E. |year=2007 |title=Tyrannosaur ageing |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=214–217 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0597 |pmid=17284406 |pmc=2375931}}</ref> but some have not.<ref name=carretal2005/>

Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986);  RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. Due to vandalism and accidents however, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds.<ref name=TankeCurrie2010/> Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and [[Wyoming]], but these probably do not represent ''A. sarcophagus'' and may not even belong to the genus ''Albertosaurus''.<ref name=holtz2004/><ref name=currie2003b/>

===Other species===
Apart from ''A. sarcophagus'', ''A. arctunguis'' and ''A. libratus'', several other species of ''Albertosaurus'' have been named. All of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as ''nomina dubia'', and are not assigned to ''Albertosaurus''.

In 1930, [[Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin]] named ''Albertosaurus pericolosus'' based on a tooth from China, probably belonging to ''[[Tarbosaurus]]''.<ref>Riabinin, A.N., 1930. [In Russian] "On the age and fauna of the dinosaur beds on the Amur River", ''Memoirs of the Russian Mineralogical Society'', '''59'''(2): 41-51</ref> [[Friedrich von Huene]] renamed ''Dryptosaurus incrassatus'', not considered a ''nomen dubium'' by him, to ''Albertosaurus incrassatus'' in 1932.<ref>von Huene, F., 1932, ''Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia: ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte''. Monographie für Geologie und Palaeontologie, Parts I and II, ser. I, 4: 1-361</ref> Because he had identified ''Gorgosaurus'' with ''Albertosaurus'', Russell in 1970 also renamed ''Gorgosaurus sternbergi'' Matthew & Brown 1922 into a ''Albertosaurus sternbergi'' and ''Gorgosaurus lancensis'' Gilmore 1946 into a ''Albertosaurus lancensis''.<ref name=russell1970/> The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of ''Gorgosaurus libratus'', the latter as either identical to ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' or representing a separate genus ''[[Nanotyrannus]]''. ''Albertosaurus megagracilis'' was in 1988 based by [[Gregory S. Paul]] on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of Montana.<ref name=paul1988>{{cite_book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S. Paul |year=1988 |title=Predatory Dinosaurs of the World |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-61946-6}}</ref> It was renamed ''[[Dinotyrannus]]'' in 1995,<ref name=olshevsky1995>{{cite_journal |last=Olshevsky |first=George. |authorlink=George Olshevsky |year=1995 |title=(The origin and evolution of the tyrannosaurids.) |journal=Kyoryugaku Saizensen (Dino Frontline) |volume=9 |pages=92–119 |language=Japanese}}</ref> but is now thought to represent a juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus rex''.<ref name=currie2003a/> Also in 1988, Paul renamed ''[[Alectrosaurus]] olseni'' Gilmore 1933 into a ''Albertosaurus olseni'';<ref name=paul1988/> this has found no general acceptance. In 1989, ''Gorgosaurus novojilovi'' Maleev 1955 was by [[Bryn Mader]] and [[Robert Bradley]]{{disambiguation needed|date=June 2012}} renamed into a ''Albertosaurus novojilovi'';<ref>Mader B. and Bradley, R., 1989, "A redescription and revised diagnosis of the syntypes of the Mongolian tyrannosaur ''Alectrosaurus olseni''", ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology'' '''9'''(1): 41–55</ref> today this is seen as a synonym of ''Tarbosaurus''.

On two occasions species based on valid ''Albertosaurus'' material were reassigned to a different genus: in 1922 [[William Diller Matthew]] renamed ''A. sarcophagus'' into ''[[Deinodon]] sarcophagus''<ref>W.D. Matthew and B. Brown, 1922, "The family Deinodontidae, with notice of a new genus from the Cretaceous of Alberta", ''Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History'' '''46'''(6): 367-385</ref> and in 1939 German paleontologist [[Oskar Kuhn]] renamed ''A. arctunguis'' into ''Deinodon arctunguis''.<ref>Kuhn, O., 1939, ''Saurischia — Fossilium catalogus I, Animalia, Pars 87''.

===Growth pattern===
[[Image:Tyrantgraph.png|thumb|300px|A graph showing the hypothesized growth curves (body mass versus age) of four tyrannosaurids, with ''Albertosaurus'' drawn in <span style="color:red">red</span><ref name=ericksonetal2004/>]]
Most age categories of ''Albertosaurus'' are represented in the [[fossil record]]. Using bone [[histology]], the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known ''Albertosaurus'' is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50&nbsp;kilograms (110&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]) and measured slightly more than 2&nbsp;metres (7&nbsp;ft) in length. The 10&nbsp;metre (33&nbsp;ft) specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an ''S''-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was 122&nbsp;kilograms (268&nbsp;lb) per year, based on an adult 1.3&nbsp;[[tonne]]s (1.4&nbsp;[[short ton]]s). Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern. Tyrannosaurids similar in size to ''Albertosaurus'' had similar growth rates, although the much larger ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' grew almost five times faster (601&nbsp;kilograms [1325&nbsp;lb] per year) at its peak.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/> The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of [[sexual maturity]] in ''Albertosaurus'', although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=ericksonetal2004/> Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small<ref name=ericksonetal2007>{{cite_journal |last=Erickson |first=Gregory M. |coauthors= Curry Rogers, Kristi; Varricchio, David J.; Norell, Mark.; & Xu, Xing |year=2007 |title=Growth patterns in brooding dinosaurs reveals the timing of sexual maturity in non-avian dinosaurs and genesis of the avian condition |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |pages=558–561 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0254 |pmid=17638674 |issue=5 |pmc=2396186}}</ref> and large<ref name=lee_werning2008>{{cite_journal |last=Lee |first=Andrew H. |coauthors= Werning, Sarah |year=2008 |title=Sexual maturity in growing dinosaurs does not fit reptilian growth models |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |pages=582–587 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0708903105 |pmid=18195356 |issue=2 |pmc=2206579}}</ref> dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and [[elephant]]s.<ref name=lee_werning2008/>  This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.<ref name=ricklefs2007/><ref name=lee_werning2008/>

During growth, through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that, had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon, the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species.<ref>Lisa G. Buckley, Derek W. Larson, Miriam Reichel, Tanya Samman, 2010, "Quantifying tooth variation within a single population of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' (Theropoda: Tyrannosauridae) and implications for identifying isolated teeth of tyrannosaurids", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1227-1251</ref>

===Life history===
Most known ''Albertosaurus'' individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly [[preservation bias]], where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field.<ref name=roachbrinkman2007>{{cite_journal |last=Roach |first= Brian T. |coauthors=& Brinkman, Daniel T. |year=2007 |title=A reevaluation of cooperative pack hunting and gregariousness in ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'' and other nonavian theropod dinosaurs |journal=Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=103–138 |doi=10.3374/0079-032X(2007)48[103:AROCPH]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> Young ''Albertosaurus'' are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of [[Biological life cycle|life history]], rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile ''Albertosaurus'' are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/>

A hypothesis of ''Albertosaurus'' life history postulates that [[hatchling]]s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult ''Albertosaurus'', and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of [[senescence]]. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, [[African buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all ''Albertosaurus'' specimens are known from one locality.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=ricklefs2007/><ref>Gregory M. Erickson, Philip J. Currie, Brian D. Inouye, Alice A. Winn, 2010, "A revised life table and survivorship curve for ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' based on the Dry Island mass death assemblage", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1269-1275</ref>

===Pack behaviour===
The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 ''Albertosaurus'', the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' assemblage at the [[Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry]] in [[Utah]]. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/>

Tanke, 2011, "A History of ''Albertosaurus''-related Popular Culture Events and Activities in Canada", ''Alberta Palæontological Society Bulletin'' '''26'''(2): 12-30</ref>]]
The near-absence of [[herbivore]] remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the ''Albertosaurus'' bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[California]], and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour.<ref name="currie1998"/> Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.<ref name=ericksonetal2006/><ref name=roachbrinkman2007/><ref name=eberthmccrea2001>{{cite_journal |last=Eberth |first=David A. |coauthors=& McCrea, Richard T. |year=2001 |title=Were large theropods gregarious? |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=21 |issue=Supplement to 3 - Abstracts of Papers, 61st Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |page=46A}}(published abstract only)</ref>

Currie also offers speculation on the pack-hunting habits of ''Albertosaurus''. The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of [[ornithomimid]]s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger ''Albertosaurus'' were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower.<ref name=currie1998/> Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator [[Ecological niche|niche]]s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than adult ''Albertosaurus'' in mass.<ref name=holtz2004/> A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small [[insectivore]]s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands.<ref name=auffenberg1981>{{cite_book |last=Auffenberg |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Auffenberg|year=2000 |title=The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville |isbn=978-0-8130-0621-5}}</ref> However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood.<ref>Philip J. Currie, David A. Eberth, 2010, "On gregarious behavior in ''Albertosaurus''", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1277-1289</ref>

===Paleopathology===
In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of [[tyrannosaurid]] dinosaurs such as ''Albertosaurus'' were caused by a parasite similar to ''[[Trichomonas]] gallinae'' which infects birds.<ref name=Wolff2009>{{cite journal| year = 2009| author = Wolff, Ewan D. S.; Salisbury, Steven W.; Horner, John R.; & Varricchio, David J.| editor1-last = Hansen| editor1-first = Dennis Marinus| title = Common avian infection plagued the tyrant dinosaurs| journal = PLoS ONE| pmid = 19789646| volume = 4 | issue = 9| pmc = 2748709| pages = e7288| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0007288}}</ref>  They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.<ref name=Wolff2009/>

In 2001, [[Bruce Rothschild]] and others published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] and [[tendon avulsions]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. They found that only one of the 319 ''Albertosaurus'' foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did. The scientists found that stress fractures were "significantly" less common in ''Albertosaurus'' than in the [[carnosaur]] ''[[Allosaurus]]''.<ref name="rothschild-dino">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.</ref> ROM 807, the holotype of ''A. arctunguis'' (now referred to ''A. sarcophagus''), had a 2.5 by 3.5&nbsp;cm deep hole in the [[iliac blade]], although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological. The specimen also contains some [[exostosis]] on the fourth left metatarsal. Two of the five ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' specimens with humeri in 1970 were reported by Dale Russel as having pathological damage to them.<ref name="molnar-pathology">Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University  Press, p. 337-363.</ref>

In 2010, the health of the Dry Island ''Albertosaurus'' assembly was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called [[enthesophyte]]s, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a ''[[Majungasaurus]]'' population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.<ref>Phil R. Bell, 2010, "Palaeopathological changes in a population of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' from the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences'', '''47''': 1263-1268</ref>

==Paleoecology==
[[Image:Horseshoe Canyon.jpg|thumb|The [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] is exposed in its [[Type locality (geology)|type section]] at [[Horseshoe Canyon (Alberta)|Horseshoe Canyon]], [[Alberta]]]]
All identifiable fossils of ''Albertosaurus sarcophagus'' are known from the upper [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]] in Alberta. These younger units of this [[geologic formation]] date to the early [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Late Cretaceous]] Period, 70 to 68 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the [[Bearpaw Shale]], a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] formation representing a section of the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon times before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like [[lagoon]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and [[tidal flat]]s. Numerous [[coal]] seams represent ancient [[peat]] [[swamp]]s. Like most of the other [[vertebrate]] fossils from the formation, ''Albertosaurus'' remains are found in deposits laid down in the [[river delta|deltas]] and [[floodplain]]s of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.<ref name=eberth1997>{{cite_book |last=Eberth |first=David A. |year=1997 |chapter=Edmonton Group |editor=[[Philip J. Currie|Currie, Philip J.]] & Padian, Kevin (eds.) |title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs |publisher= Academic Press |location=San Diego |pages=199–204 |isbn=0-12-226810-5}}</ref>

The [[fauna]] of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. [[Shark]]s, [[Batoidea|rays]], [[sturgeon]]s, [[bowfin]]s, [[gar]]s and the gar-like ''[[Aspidorhynchus]]'' made up the fish fauna. Mammals included [[multituberculate]]s and the [[marsupial]] ''[[Didelphodon]]''. The saltwater [[plesiosaur]] ''[[Leurospondylus]]'' has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by [[turtle]]s, ''[[Champsosaurus]]'', and [[crocodilia]]ns like ''[[Leidyosuchus]]'' and ''[[Stangerochampsa]]''. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', ''[[Saurolophus]]'' and ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]''. Ceratopsians and [[ornithomimid]]s were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer [[ankylosauria]]ns and [[pachycephalosaur]]s, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including [[troodontid]]s, [[dromaeosaurid]]s, and [[caenagnathid]]s.<ref name=eberth1997/><ref>Derek W.
