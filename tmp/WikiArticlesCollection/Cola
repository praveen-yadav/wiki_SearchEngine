'''Cola''' is a [[Soft drink|carbonated beverage]] that originally contained [[caffeine]] from the [[kola nut]] and [[cocaine]] from [[coca]] leaves, and was flavored with [[vanilla]] and other ingredients. Most colas now use other flavoring (and caffeinating) ingredients with a similar taste and no longer contain cocaine. It became popular worldwide after [[pharmacist]] [[John Pemberton]] invented [[Coca-Cola]] in 1886.<ref name="cocaine">{{cite web|url=http://www.cocaine.org/cocawine.htm |title=Coca Wine |publisher=Cocaine.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the [[Coca wine]] of [[pharmacist]] [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]], created in 1863; it still contained [[cocaine]].<ref name="cocaine" /> Coca-Cola is a major international brand. It usually contains [[caramel color]], [[caffeine]] and sweeteners such as sugar or [[high fructose corn syrup]].

==Etymology==
The word '''cola''' may have been introduced into mainstream culture by the major producer Coca-Cola,{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} as it saw its trademark slipping into common use, like other [[genericized trademark]]s. It has tried to maintain the exclusive right to sell products using the "Coca-Cola" name and its diminutive form "Coke", by suggesting the alternative of "cola drink" as a generic name for similar types of carbonated soft drinks.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The word cola as part of the Coca-Cola trademark may have originated from the [[kola nut]]s that were originally used as the source of caffeine.

==Flavorings==
Despite the name, the primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are sugar, citrus oils (from oranges, limes, or lemon fruit peel), [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]], and an acidic flavorant.<ref>{{cite web|author=DeNeefe, Janet |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/13/the-exotic-romance-tamarind.html |title=The Exotic Romance of Tamarind |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sparror.cubecinema.com/cube/cola/chemistry/cola2.htm |title=Cola 2 |publisher=Sparror.cubecinema.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace ingredients to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include [[nutmeg]] and a wide variety of ingredients, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola's recipe]] and several others{{which|date=August 2013}} are maintained as corporate trade secrets.

A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] is predominantly used in the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]] due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In [[Europe]], however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.<ref>{{cite book |editor=M. Ataman Aksoy, John C. Beghin |title=Global Agricultural Trade and Developing Countries |year=2005 |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=0-8213-5863-4 |page=329 |chapter=Sugar Policies: An Opportunity for Change}}</ref> In addition, [[stevia]] or an [[artificial sweetener]] may be used; "sugar-free" or "diet" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.

Consumers may prefer the taste of soda manufactured with sugar; as in the United States, with imported [[Mexican Coke|Mexican Coca-Cola]].<ref>

These are marketed under the name ''Throwback'' and became "permanent" products on the lineup.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=Pepsi, Frito-Lay capitalize on fond thoughts of the good ol' days|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2011-03-11-1Athrowback11_ST_N.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=29 September 2011|date=2011-03-11}}</ref>

A 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The [[phosphoric acid]] used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tina M. Saldana, Olga Basso, Rebecca Darden, and Dale P.
