CJD is caused by an infectious agent called [[prion]]s. Prions are misfolded proteins which replicate by converting their properly folded counterparts, in their host, to the same misfolded structure they possess. The disease leads to rapid neurodegeneration, causing the brain tissue to develop holes and take a more sponge-like texture.

==Classification==
Types of CJD include:
*variant (vCJD):<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ironside|first=JW|coauthors=Sutherland, K; Bell, JE; McCardle, L; Barrie, C; Estebeiro, K; Zeidler, M; Will, RG|title=A new variant of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease: neuropathological and clinical features.|journal=Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology|year=1996|volume=61|pages=523–30|pmid=9246478|doi=10.1101/SQB.1996.061.01.052}}</ref>
This is thought to be caused by the consumption of food contaminated with [[prions]], which also cause [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]].

* sporadic (sCJD):<ref name="pmid18410280">{{cite journal |author=Niimi Y, Iwasaki Y, Umemura T |title=MM2-cortical-type sporadic   Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease with early stage cerebral cortical pathology presenting with a rapidly progressive clinical course |journal=Neuropathology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=645–51 |year=2008 |month=December |pmid=18410280 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1789.2008.00904.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0919-6544&date=2008&volume=28&issue=6&spage=645}}</ref> 
This accounts for 85% of cases of CJD.

* familial (fCJD):<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lugaresi|first=E|coauthors=Medori, R; Montagna, P; Baruzzi, A; Cortelli, P; Lugaresi, A; Tinuper, P; Zucconi, M; Gambetti, P|title=Fatal familial insomnia and dysautonomia with selective degeneration of thalamic nuclei|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=1986 Oct 16|volume=315|issue=16|pages=997–1003|pmid=3762620|doi=10.1056/NEJM198610163151605}}</ref> 
This accounts for the majority of the other 15% cases of CJD. Its cause is associated by mutations in genes.

* iatrogenic: 
This form of CJD arises from contamination with tissue from an infected person, usually as the result of a medical procedure. Medical procedures that are associated with the spread of this form of CJD include the use of human-derived pituitary growth hormones, corneal and/or meningeal transplants.<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs180/en/</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
<!--
[[Image:http://pathology.mc.duke.edu/neuropath/CNSlecture2/cjd.jpg]] The spongiform look of the cortex cross-section is characteristic of CJD. -->
The first symptom of CJD is rapidly progressive [[dementia]], leading to [[memory]] loss, [[Personality psychology|personality]] changes and [[hallucinations]]. Other frequently occurring features include [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[paranoia]], [[obsessive-compulsive]] symptoms, and [[psychosis]].<ref>Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH. (2012) Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice. In: Neurology in Clinical Practice, 6th Edition. Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J (eds.) Butterworth Heinemann. April 12, 2012. ISBN 1437704344 | ISBN 978-1437704341</ref> This is accompanied by physical problems such as [[Speech communication|speech]] impairment, jerky movements ([[myoclonus]]), balance and coordination dysfunction ([[ataxia]]), changes in [[gait (human)|gait]], rigid [[Human position|posture]], and [[seizures]]. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In some people, the symptoms can continue for years. In most patients, these symptoms are followed by [[Dyskinesia|involuntary movements]] and the appearance of an atypical diagnostic [[electroencephalogram]] tracing. Most victims die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of patients survive two or more years.<ref name="Gambetti">{{cite web|last=Gambetti|first=Pierluigi|title=Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (CJD)|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch090/ch090b.html|publisher=The Merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|accessdate=4/6/11}}</ref> Some patients have been known to live 4–5 years with mostly psychological symptoms until the disease progresses causing more physical symptoms leading to a diagnosis and inevitable death usually within the first year of diagnosis.

The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive [[cell death|death]] of the brain's [[neuron|nerve cells]], which is associated with the build-up of abnormal prion proteins forming [[amyloids]]. When brain tissue from a CJD patient is examined under a [[microscope]], many tiny holes can be seen where whole areas of nerve cells have died. The word "spongiform" in "[[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]]" refers to the sponge-like appearance of the brain tissue.

==Cause==
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases are caused by prions. The diseases are thus sometimes called ''prion diseases''. Other prion diseases include [[Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome]] (GSS), [[fatal familial insomnia]] (FFI) and [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] in humans, as well as [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease) in cattle, [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) in elk and deer, and [[scrapie]] in sheep. [[Alpers' syndrome]] in infants is also thought to be a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by a prion.<ref>{{cite journal

The prion that is believed to cause Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob exhibits at least two stable [[chemical conformation|conformations]]. One, the native state, is water-soluble and present in healthy cells. {{As of|2007}}, its biological function is presumably in transmembrane transport or signaling. The other conformational state is relatively water-insoluble and readily forms protein aggregates.

People can also acquire CJD genetically through a mutation of the gene that codes for the prion protein (PRNP). This occurs in only 5–10% of all CJD cases.

The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes [[Protein folding|refolding]] of native proteins into the diseased state.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=AR|coauthors=Jackson, GS; Collinge, J|title=The molecular biology of prion propagation|journal=Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences|date=2001 Feb 28|volume=356|issue=1406|pages=185–95|pmid=11260799|doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0764|pmc=1088424}}</ref>  The number of misfolded protein molecules will increase [[exponential growth|exponentially]] and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble protein in affected [[cell (biology)|cells]]. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the ability of the protein to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and are produced in a self-sustaining [[feedback loop]].

[[Stanley B. Prusiner]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF) was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine]] in 1997 "for his discovery of Prions - a new biological principle of infection".<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web | url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1997: Stanley B.

===Transmission===
The defective protein can be transmitted by contaminated harvested human brain products,<ref>In July 2012, Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina released a public warning after warning 11 other patients that a brain surgery patient was later diagnosed with CJD, and though workers sterilized instruments, the hospital stated the CJD patient's diagnosis wasn't known at the time of the surgery and it wanted to warn other patients out of an abundance of caution, noting the CDC recommendation for additional instrument cleaning when CJD is suspected.

In the hereditary form, a [[mutation]] occurs in the [[gene]] for PrP, [[PRNP]]. Ten to 15 percent of CJD cases are inherited. (CDC)

The disease has also been shown to result from use of [[human growth hormone]] obtained from the [[pituitary gland]]s of persons who died from Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob Disease,<ref name="titleHGH Linked to Brain Eater">{{cite journal

[[Cannibalism]] has also been implicated as a transmission mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], once found primarily among women and children of the [[Fore people]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. While the men of the tribe ate the body of the deceased and rarely contracted the disease, the women and children, who ate the less desirable body parts, including the brain, were 8 times more likely than men to contract kuru from infected tissue.

Prions, the [[infectious agent]] of CJD, may not be inactivated by means of routine [[surgical instrument]] [[Autoclave|sterilization]] procedures. The [[World Health Organization]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, it is recommended that heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976.<ref>{{cite web|title =Questions and Answers: Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Infection-Control Practices|work =Infection Control Practices/CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease, Classic)|publisher =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date =January 4, 2007|url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/cjd/qa_cjd_infection_control.htm#sterilization|accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =WHO Infection Control Guidelines for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies|publisher =World Health Organization: Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control|date =26 March 1999|url =http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/bse/WHO_CDS_CSR_APH_2000_3/en/|accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

On May 28, 2002, the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] instituted a policy that excludes from donation anyone who spent at least six months in certain European countries (or three months in the United Kingdom) from 1980 to 1996. Given the large number of U.S. military personnel and their dependents residing in Europe, it was expected that over 7% of donors would be deferred due to the policy. Later changes to this policy have relaxed the restriction to a cumulative total of five years or more of civilian travel in European countries (six months or more if military). The three-month restriction on travel to the UK, however, has not been changed.<ref name="titleIn-Depth Discussion of Variant Creutzfeld–Jacob Disease and Blood Donation">{{cite web

The [[American Red Cross]]' policy is as follows: during the period January 1, 1980, to December 31, 1996, spending a total time of three months or more in the [[Channel Islands]], [[England]], the [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]] precludes individuals from donating. Moreover, spending a total time of five years or more after January 1, 1980 (to present), in the above-mentioned countries and/or any country in Europe (except the former USSR), also precludes donation. People with a biologic relative who has been diagnosed with CJD or vCJD are unable to donate. Biologic relative in this setting means mother, father, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or child.

A similar policy applies to potential donors to the [[Australian Red Cross]]' [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service|Blood Service]], precluding people who have spent a cumulative time of six months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

The [[Singapore Red Cross]] precludes potential donors who have spent a cumulative time of three months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996.

In New Zealand, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) in 2000 introduced measures to preclude permanently donors who had resided in the United Kingdom (including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) for a total of six months or more between January 1980 and December 1996. The measure resulted in ten percent of New Zealand's active blood donors at the time to become ineligible to donate blood. In 2003, the NZBS further extended restrictions to preclude permanently donors who had received a blood transfusion in the United Kingdom since January 1980, and in April 2006, restrictions were further extended to include the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[France]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/620/3988/file/CJD%20Information%20Leaflet%20111I077.pdf |title= CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease) – Information for blood donors |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 20 July 2012}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of CJD is suspected when there are typical clinical symptoms and signs such as rapidly progressing dementia with myoclonus. Further investigation can then be performed to support the diagnosis including
* [[Electroencephalography]]&mdash;often has characteristic triphasic spikes
* [[Cerebrospinal fluid]] analysis for [[14-3-3 protein]]
* [[MRI]] of the brain&mdash;often shows high signal intensity in the caudate nucleus and putamen bilaterally on T2-weighted images.
* Research in 2010 and 2011 identified a possible blood test for CJD. The test attempts to identify the prion responsible for the disease. However, it has not yet been demonstrated if it is able to detect the prions in those in early stages of the disease.<ref name="MSNBC Rettner">{{cite news |title = Blood test may screen for human form of mad cow |author=By Rachael Rettner |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41406612/ns/health-infectious_diseases/ |publisher = [[MSNBC]] |date = 2011-02-03 |accessdate = 2011-02-09}}</ref>

Clinical testing for CJD has always been an issue. Diagnosis has mostly been based on clinical and physical examination of symptoms. In recent years, studies have shown that the tumour marker [[Neuron-specific enolase]] (NSE) is often elevated in CJD cases, however its diagnostic utility is primarily seen when combined with a test for the [[14-3-3 protein]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000230159.67128.00 |title=CSF tests in the differential diagnosis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease |author=Sanchez–Juan, P., Green, A., Ladogana, A., et al. |year=2006 |journal=Neurology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=637–643 |pmid=16924018}}</ref> {{As of|2010}}, screening tests to identify infected asymptomatic individuals, such as blood donors, are not yet available, though methods have been proposed and evaluated.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02731.x|title=A highly sensitive immunoassay for the detection of prion-infected material in whole human blood without the use of proteinase K|author=Tattum, M.

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in one hundred billion (10<sup>−11</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[surround optical fiber immunoassay]] (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so that it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be detected in the blood of animals long before the symptoms appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of 
great value in surveillance as a blood or urine-based screening test for CJD.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today |pages=195 |year=2010 |month=August |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |accessdate=2011-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf |title=SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in Brain and Blood |publisher= [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center]] |authorlink=Rubenstein, R., et al. |accessdate=2011-08-19}}</ref>

[[Image:SpongiformChangeCJD.jpg|thumbnail|right|Spongiform change in CJD]]
The classic [[histologic]] appearance is spongiform change in the gray matter: the presence of many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometres in the [[neuropil]], in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer. These vacuoles appear glassy or eosinophilic and may coalesce. Neuronal loss and gliosis are also seen.<ref>{{cite web|title=CNS Degenerative Diseases|url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/CNS/CNSDG.html}}</ref> Plaques of amyloid-like material can be seen in the neocortex in new-variant CJD.

Unfortunately, [[vacuolization]] can be seen in other disease states. Diffuse cortical vacuolization occurs in [[Alzheimer's]], and superficial cortical vacuolization occurs in [[ischemia]] and [[frontotemporal dementia]]. These vacuoles appear clear and punched-out. Larger vacuoles encircling neurons, vessels, and [[glia]] are a possible processing artifact.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Both [[amphotericin B]] and [[doxorubicin]] have been investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as yet there is no strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, drugs to reduce suffering do exist, and include Valproate, an anticonvulsant agent, and Clonazepam an benzodiazepine, to reduce muscle jerks.<ref name="Gambetti"/>

Scientists from the [[University of California, San Francisco]] are currently running a [http://memory.ucsf.edu/cjd/research/current/quinacrine treatment trial for sporadic CJD] using [[quinacrine]], a medicine originally created for [[malaria]]. Pilot studies showed quinacrine permanently cleared abnormal prion proteins from cell cultures, but results have not yet been published on their clinical study. The efficacy of quinacrine was also assessed in a rigorous clinical trial in the UK and the results were published in Lancet Neurology,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Collinge|first=J|coauthors=Gorham, M; Hudson, F; Kennedy, A; Keogh, G; Pal, S; Rossor, M; Rudge, P; Siddique, D; Spyer, M; Thomas, D; Walker, S; Webb, T; Wroe, S; Darbyshire, J|title=Safety and efficacy of quinacrine in human prion disease (PRION-1 study): a patient-preference trial|journal=Lancet neurology|date=2009 Apr|volume=8|issue=4|pages=334–44|pmid=19278902|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70049-3|pmc=2660392}}</ref> 
and concluded that quinacrine had no measurable effect on the clinical course of CJD.

In a 2013 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists from The [[Scripps Research Institute]] reported that [[Astemizole]], a medication approved for human use, has been found to have anti-prion activity and may lead to a treatment for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.<ref name="Karapetyan2013">{{cite journal|last= Karapetyan |first= Yervand Eduard |coauthors=  Gian Franco Sferrazza, Minghai Zhou, Gregory Ottenberg, Timothy Spicer, Peter Chase, Mohammad Fallahi, Peter Hodder, Charles Weissmann, and Corinne Ida Lasmézas |title= Unique drug screening approach for prion diseases identifies tacrolimus and astemizole as antiprion agents |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year= 2013 |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/29/1303510110.abstract |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1303510110 | laysummary = http://www.scripps.edu/news/press/2013/20130403lasmezas.html |laysource= Scripps Research Institute News Release |laydate = April 3, 2013|volume= 110|issue= 17|pages= 7044}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Global mad cow cases map.PNG|thumb|450px|Dark green areas are countries that have confirmed human cases of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and light green are countries that have bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases.]]
Although CJD is the most common human [[prion disease]], it is still rare, occurring in about one out of every one million people every year. It usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65. The exception to this is the more recently recognised 'variant' CJD (vCJD), which occurs in younger people.

[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] monitors the occurrence of CJD in the United States through periodic reviews of national mortality data. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]:
* CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1 case per million population per year.
* On the basis of mortality surveillance from 1979 to 1994, the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of CJD remained stable at approximately 1 case per [[million]] persons in the United States.
* In the United States, CJD deaths among persons younger than 30 years of age are extremely rare (fewer than five deaths per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] per year<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="VCJD1">{{cite web

</ref>).
* The disease is found most frequently in patients 55–65 years of age, but cases can occur in people older than 90 years and younger than 55 years of age.
* In more than 85% of cases, the duration of CJD is less than 1 year (median: four months) after onset of symptoms.<ref name="CDC1"/><ref name="VCJD1" />

===New concerns===
In ''[[The Lancet]]'' (June 2006), a University College London team suggested that it may take more than 50 years for vCJD to develop, from their studies of [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], a similar disease in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name="titleForbes.com"/> The reasoning behind the claim is that kuru was possibly transmitted through [[cannibalism]] in Papua New Guinea when family members would eat the body of a dead relative as a sign of [[mourning]]. In the 1950s, cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=Diamond>{{cite journal

}}
</ref>

In the late 20th century, however, kuru reached epidemic proportions in certain Papua New Guinean communities, therefore suggesting that vCJD may also have a similar [[incubation period]] of 20 to 50 years. A critique to this theory is that while mortuary cannibalism was banned in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, that does not necessarily mean that the practice ended. 15 years later [[Jared Diamond]] was informed by [[Papuans]] that the practice continued.<ref name=Diamond/> Kuru may have passed to the [[Fore people]] through the preparation of the dead body for burial.

These researchers noticed a genetic variation in some kuru patients that has been known to promote long [[incubation period]]s. They have also proposed that individuals who contracted CJD in the early 1990s represent a distinct genetic subpopulation, with unusually short incubation periods for [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE). This means that there may be many more vCJD patients who have longer incubation periods, which may surface many years later.<ref name="titleForbes.com">{{cite journal

==History==
The disease was first described by German [[neurologist]] [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] in 1920 and shortly afterwards by [[Alfons Maria Jakob]], giving it the name Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob. Some of the clinical findings described in their first papers do not match current criteria for Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob disease, and it has been speculated that at least two of the patients in initial studies were suffering from a different ailment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} An early description of familial CJD stems from the German psychiatrist and neurologist [[Friedrich Meggendorfer]] (1880–1953).<ref>Meggendorfer F.

The patient had undergone brain surgery at [[Catholic Medical Center]] three months before his death, and a surgical probe used in the procedure was subsequently reused in other operations. Public health officials identified thirteen patients at three hospitals who may have been exposed to the disease through the contaminated probe, but said the risk of anyone contracting CJD was "extremely low."<ref>{{cite web|title=Autopsy confirms rare brain disease in NH patient|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/23489308/2013/09/20/autopsy-confirms-rare-brain-disease-in-nh-patient|publisher=MyFoxBoston|accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NH PATIENT LIKELY DIED OF RARE BRAIN DISEASE|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/surgical-gear-quarantined-over-rare-brain-disease|publisher=AP|accessdate=5 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=globe>{{cite web|last=Kowalczyk|first=Liz|title=5 patients at Cape hospital at risk for rare brain disease|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/05/cape-cod-hospital-patients-possibly-exposed-brain-disease/CwGauqzFxf6Om8agTvUoAJ/story.html|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref>

There have been ten cases of health care acquired CJD in Australia. They consist of five deaths following treatment with pituitary extract hormone for either infertility or short stature, with no further cases since 1991.
