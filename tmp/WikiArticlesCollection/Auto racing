'''Auto racing''' (also known as '''car racing''', '''motor racing'''<ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/motor-racing Macmillan Dictionary] </ref> or '''automobile racing''') is a sport involving the [[racing]] of [[automobiles]] for competition. There are numerous different categories of auto racing. 

==History==

===The beginning of competition===

Motoring events began soon after the construction of the first successful [[gasoline]]-fueled automobiles. The first organized contest was on April 28, 1887, by the chief editor of Paris publication Le Vélocipède, Monsieur Fossier.<ref name="8W"/> It ran {{convert|2|km}} from Neuilly Bridge to the Bois de Boulogne. It was won by [[Georges Bouton]] of the [[De Dion-Bouton]] Company, in a car he had constructed with [[Jules-Albert de Dion|Albert, the Comte de Dion]], but as he was the only competitor to show up it is rather difficult to call it a race.<ref name="8W"/>

Another solo event occurred in 1891 when [[Auguste Doriot]] and Louis Rigoulot of [[Peugeot]] drove their gasoline-fueled [[Peugeot Type 3|Type 3]] ''Quadricycle'' in the bicycle race from [[Paris–Brest–Paris]]. By the time they reached [[Brest, France|Brest]], the winning cyclist [[Charles Terront]] was already back in Paris.  In order to publicly prove the reliability and performance of the 'Quadricycle'  [[Armand Peugeot]] had persuaded the organiser, [[Pierre Giffard]] of ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'', to use his network of monitors and marshalls to vouchsafe and report the vehicle's performance. The intended distance of 1200&nbsp;km had never been achieved by a motorised vehicle, it being about three times further than the record set by [[Leon Serpollet]] from Paris to Lyon.<ref name="PeugeotFan">[http://peugeot.mainspot.net/hist03.shtml Peugeot Fan Club.

[[File:1894 paris-rouen - georges lemaître (peugeot 3hp) 1st.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Albert Lemaître]] classified first in his Peugeot 3hp in the [[1894 Paris–Rouen]].<!-- Note discrepancy that text below states that Peugot (the car manufacturer) was the winner. -->]]
====Paris–Rouen: the world's first motoring contest====

On July 23, 1894, the Parisian magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal]]'' organized what is considered to be the world's first motoring competition from [[Paris–Rouen (motor race)|Paris to Rouen]].<ref name="8W"/> Sporting events were a tried and tested form of publicity stunt and circulation booster. [[Pierre Giffard]], the paper's editor, promoted it as a ''Competition for Horseless Carriages'' (Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux) that were ''not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey''. Thus it blurred the distinctions between a reliability trial, a general event, and a race.  One hundred and two competitors paid 10 francs entrance fee.<ref name="8W"/>

Sixty-nine cars started the {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} selection event that would show which entrants would be allowed to start the main event, the {{convert|127|km|0|abbr=on}} race from Paris to Rouen. The entrants ranged from serious manufacturers like [[Peugeot]], [[Panhard]], or [[De Dion-Bouton|De Dion]] to amateur owners; only 25 were selected for the main race.<ref name="8W"/>

The race started from [[Porte Maillot (Paris Métro)|Porte Maillot]] and went through the [[Bois de Boulogne]]. Count [[Jules-Albert de Dion]] was first into Rouen after 6 hours and 48&nbsp;minutes at an average speed of 19&nbsp;km/h. He finished 3'30" ahead of [[Albert Lemaître]]  ([[Peugeot]]), followed by [[Doriot]] (Peugeot) at 16'30", [[René Panhard]] ([[Panhard]]) at 33'30" and [[Émile Levassor]] (Panhard) at 55'30". The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics. De Dion's steam car needed a stoker which was forbidden.<ref name="8W"/>

===Early races===

The [[Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race]] of June 1895 has sometimes been described as the "first motor race", despite the 1894 event being decided by speed and finishing order of the eligible racers.{{Dubious|date=June 2013}}<ref name="harding">

The first to arrive was [[Émile Levassor]] in his [[Panhard-Levassor]] 1205cc model. He completed the course (1,178&nbsp;km or 732&nbsp;miles) in 48 hours and 47&nbsp;minutes, finishing nearly six hours before the runner-up. The official winner was [[Paul Koechlin]] in a Peugeot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ces merveilleux fous roulants sur leurs drôles de machines|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/reportage/20070709.FIG000000143_ces_merveilleux_fous_roulants_sur_leurs_droles_de_machines.html|accessdate=September 30, 2011|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=July 9, 2007|language=French}}</ref>  Nine of twenty-two starters finished the course.<ref name=harding/>

The first regular auto racing venue was Nice, France, run in late March 1897, as a "Speed Week."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} To fill out the schedule, most types of racing events were invented here, including the first hill climb (Nice&nbsp;– La Turbie) and a sprint that was, in spirit, the first drag race.

An international competition, between nations rather than individuals, began with the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing]].

The Parisian artist [[Ernest Montaut]], and his wife Marguerite, faithfully documented the rapidly changing face of motorised transportation in Europe. They produced large numbers of posters and prints published by ''Mabileau et Cie'', covering racing events involving motorcars, aircraft, dirigibles and speedboats. These images formed a valuable contribution to the history of transport, and particularly to its racing aspect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.donaldheald.com/search/search_01.php?Author=GAMY-MONTAUT |title=Donald Heald |publisher=Donald Heald |accessdate=2011-08-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110710143632/http://www.donaldheald.com/search/search_01.php?Author=GAMY-MONTAUT| archivedate= July 10, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===City-to-city racing===
[[File:Fernand Gabriel Mors Paris-Madrid 1903.jpg||thumb|Fernand Gabriel driving a [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]] in [[Paris–Madrid race|Paris-Madrid]] 1903]]

With auto construction and racing dominated by France, the French automobile club ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city, in France or elsewhere in Europe.

The very successful early European rally races ended in 1903 when [[Marcel Renault]] was involved in a fatal accident near [[Angoulême]] in the Paris-Madrid race. Nine fatalities caused the French government to stop the race in [[Bordeaux]] and ban open-road racing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In 1907 the [[Peking to Paris]] race covered 9,317 miles over some of the roughest terrain on Earth. Five cars took part in the race, which was won by the Italian [[Prince Scipione Borghese]] in a 7,433 cc (453.6 cu in) 35/45&nbsp;hp model [[Itala]].

The longest automobile race in history, with Paris as the finish line was the [[1908 New York to Paris Race]].  Six teams from France, Italy, Germany, and the United States competed with three teams actually reaching Paris.  The American [[Thomas Flyer]] driven by [[George Schuster (driver)|George Schuster]] was declared the winner of the epic 22,000 mile race in 169 days.
<!--Rallying continues: the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] is still run-->

===The first purpose-built racing circuits===

The [[Milwaukee Mile]] is the 2nd oldest motor racing track in the world, with racing being held there since 1903. It was not purposely built for motor racing, it started as a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) horse racing track in the 19th century.

Knoxville Raceway in [[Knoxville, Iowa]] is the oldest racing venue, and one of the most prestigious, in the United States. It was built in the late 1800s at the Marion County Fairgrounds in Iowa. It was built for a horse racing track, such as the Milwaukee Mile. Although sanctioned races weren't held until 1914, one automobile race was held in 1901. The race was not good because of the wind. But starting in 1961 the first Knoxville Nationals was won by Roy Robbins. Now the Nationals are sanctioned by the World of Outlaws.

From 1903 to 1914, a one-mile dirt oval track was run on Brunots Island, just south of Pittsburgh on the Ohio River. Louis Chevrolet won the AAA Champion car in 1905. On September 10, 1907, Rex Reinersten was fatally injured in a crash here. In 1916, Chevrolet won the first Universal Films Trophy at the mile and an eighth [http://www.uniontownspeedway.com Uniontown Speedway board track,.] south of Pittsburgh in [[Hopwood, Pennsylvania]].

[[File:Brooklands Members' Banking from bridge.jpg||thumb|A remaining section of the [[Brooklands]] track today.]]
[[Brooklands]] in Surrey, England, was the first purpose built motor racing venue, opening in June 1907.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume=127 (nbr 3731) | author=Sammy Davis | authorlink=S. C. H. "Sammy" Davis | title=How Brooklands started | page=p. 43 | date=August 17, 1967}}</ref> It featured a {{convert|4.43|km|2|abbr=on}} concrete track with high-speed banked corners. Brooklands was also a centre of the aviation industry, with [[Vickers]] setting up a factory and aerodrome there during [[World War I]]. The racing circuit was closed in 1939 as war-time aircraft production took over. Damage done to the track during [[World War II]] meant the track never reopened for racing.

Competition gradually spread to other parts of the British Empire. The first competition in India was held in 1905 by the Motor Union of Western India. It ran from Delhi to Mumbai, (Delhi-Bombay trials 1905) a distance of {{convert|810|mi|km}} in an attempt to expose India to the automobile and test its suitability for Indian conditions. Lord Curzon, the Viceroy, gave his consent to the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmsci.in/main/history.html |title=:: The Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India :: |publisher=Fmsci.in |accessdate=2011-08-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110721160148/http://www.fmsci.in/main/history.html| archivedate= July 21, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title = The Motor| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WnrVAAAAMAAJ| accessdate = 2011-08-08| date = May 13, 2009| publisher = Temple Press Limited }}</ref>

===1910–1950===

{{Further|Grand Prix motor racing}}

The 1930s saw the transformation from high-priced road cars into pure racers, with [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Auto Union]], [[Bugatti]], [[Delage]], [[Delahaye]], and [[Mercedes-Benz]] constructing streamlined vehicles with engines producing up to {{Convert|450|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}, aided by multiple-stage [[supercharger|supercharging]]. From 1928 to 1930 and again in 1934–1936, the maximum weight permitted was {{Convert|750|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, a rule diametrically opposed to current racing regulations. Extensive use of aluminum alloys was required to achieve light weight, and in the case of the Mercedes, the paint was removed to satisfy the weight limitation, producing the famous [[Silver Arrows]]. NASCAR was founded by William France, Sr., on February 21, 1948, with the help of several other drivers of the time. The first NASCAR "Strictly Stock" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. The Strictly Stock division was put on hold as American automobile manufacturers were unable to produce family sedans quickly enough to keep up with post-World War II demand.<ref name="Fleischman6">{{cite book |last=Fleischman |first=Bill |coauthors=Al Pearce |title=The Unauthorized NASCAR Fan Guide (1998–99) |publisher=Visible Ink Press |year=1999 |page=6}}</ref>

===1950–present===

After the [[Second World War]], sports car racing emerged as a distinct form of racing with its own classic races, and, from 1953, its own [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] sanctioned World Championship. [[NASCAR]]'s Strictly Stock Division was renamed the "Grand National" division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose-built race cars with a stock-appearing body. 

From 1962 sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.<ref>Denis Jenkinson, Automobile Year Book Of Sports Car Racing, 1982</ref> Through the 1960s, as [[superspeedway]]s were built and old dirt tracks were paved, the number of dirt races was reduced.<ref name="Fielden_SI_Sep04">Fielden, Greg, "NASCAR Cleans Up", ''Speedway Illustrated'', September 2004.</ref>

A breed of powerful hybrids appeared in the 1950s and 1960s and raced on both sides of the Atlantic, featuring European chassis and large American engines – from the early [[Allard]] cars via hybrids such as [[Lotus 19]]s fitted with large engines through to the [[AC Cobra]]. The combination of mostly British chassis and American V8 engines gave rise to the [[Can-Am]] series in the 1960s and 1970s. This series, based in the United States and Canada, featured lightweight prototype sports cars fitted with large, powerful production-based engines that produced speeds in excess of 200&nbsp;mph. [[Clubmans]] provided much entertainment at club-racing level from the 1960s into the 1990s and John Webb revived interest in big sports prototypes with [[Thundersports]] in the 1980s. [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4 Grand Touring Cars]] and [[Group 5 (racing)|Group 5 Special Production Cars]] became the premier form of [[Sports car racing]] from 1976, with prototypes going into a general decline apart from [[Porsche 936]] domination at Le Mans and a lower-key series of races for smaller two-litre  [[Group 6 (racing)|Group 6]] prototypes. The last NASCAR race on a dirt track was held on September 30, 1970 at the half-mile [[State Fairgrounds Speedway]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. From 1972 through 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] cigarette brand [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 48 to 31 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's "modern era".

In Europe, the FIA adopted the ACO GTP rules virtually unchanged and sanctioned the [[Group C]] [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]] (or [[World Sportscar Championship]]), featuring high-tech closed-cockpit prototypes. In the USA, the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|Camel GTP]] series boasted close competition between huge fields of manufacturer-backed teams and privateer squads – the cars were technically similar to Group Cs but used a sliding scale of weights and engine capacities to try to limit performance. The FIA attempted to make Group C into a virtual "two seater Grand Prix" format in the early 1990s, with engine rules in common with F1, short race distances, and a schedule dovetailing with that of the F1 rounds. The IMSA GT Championship had been prototype-based since 1983, with less emphasis on production cars. [[Australian Production Car Championship]] was first contested in 1987, with the inaugural champion determined from the results of two races held at the [[Winton Motor Raceway]] in Victoria on September 27. The first World Touring Car Championship, which was open to [[Group A]] Touring Cars, was held in [[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987]] concurrent to the long-running [[European Touring Car Championship]] (ETCC). Additional rounds were held outside Europe at [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] in Australia, [[Calder Park Raceway]] in Australia (using both the road course and the then newly constructed Thunderdome), [[Nissan Mobil 500|Wellington]] in New Zealand and [[Fuji Speedway|Mount Fuji]] in Japan. The Drivers Championship was won by [[Roberto Ravaglia]] in a [[BMW M3]] and the Entrants Championship was won by the Eggenberger Texaco Ford No 7 entry, which was a Ford Sierra. Winston Cup Series underwent a large boom in popularity in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.autoracing1.com/GoodBoys/2001/0726Part3.htm Autoracing1.com] "NASCAR's Greatest Moments&nbsp;—Part 3". Retrieved March 12, 2009.</ref> This coincided with a decline of popularity in [[American Championship Car Racing]]. The FISA decided to separate the rally cars into three classes: Group N (production cars), Group A (modified production cars), and Group B (modified sport cars). Group B was introduced by the FIA in 1982 as replacement for both Group 4 (modified grand touring) and Group 5 (touring prototypes) cars.

The IMSA GT Series evolved into the [[American Le Mans Series]]; which ran its first season in 1999,<ref>{{cite news | last =Perez | first =A.J. | title =Le Mans series showcases prototype race cars |work=USA Today | date =August 30, 2007 | url =http://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/2007-08-29-lemans-motor_N.htm?csp=34 | accessdate =2008-08-20 }}</ref> the European races eventually became the closely related [[Le Mans Series]], both of which mix prototypes and GTs. The [[SCCA World Challenge]] consists of a one hour race for each round, combining three classes: GT ([[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Aston Martin DB9]], etc.), "GTS" ([[Acura TSX]], [[BMW 3-series]], etc.; replaced the former touring car class), and Touring Car (a "showroom stock" class similar to Grand Am's Continental Challenge). NASCAR was becoming increasingly dominant and the IndyCar Series' split from CART in 1996 put more emphasis on ovals regarding domestic open-wheel racing.

===Formula racing===

[[File:F1 2013 Barcelona test 2 - Caterham.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Pic]] testing the [[Caterham CT03]] at [[Circuit de Catalunya]]]]

The best-known variety of single-seater racing, [[Formula One]], involves an annual World Championship for drivers and constructors.

In single-seater ([[open-wheel]]) the wheels are not covered, and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce [[downforce]] and enhance adhesion to the track.  In Europe and Asia, open wheeled racing is commonly referred to as "Formula", with appropriate hierarchical suffixes.  In North America, the "Formula" terminology is not followed (with the exception of F1).  The sport is usually arranged to follow an "international" format (such as F1), a "regional" format (such as the Formula 3 Euro Series), and/or a "domestic", or country-specific format (such as the German Formula 3 championship, or the British Formula Ford).

[[File:Will Power Indy 500.jpg|thumb|left|[[Will Power]] during [[2008 Indy 500]] Practice]]

In North America, the cars used in the [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]] (currently the [[IndyCar Series]], and previously [[Champ Car|CART]]) have traditionally been similar though less sophisticated than [[F1 cars]], with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs. The series' most famous race is the [[Indianapolis 500]].

[[File:Formel3 racing car amk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Formula Three]] car racing at the [[Hockenheimring]], 2008]]

The other major international single-seater racing series is [[GP2 Series|GP2]] (formerly known as [[Formula 3000]] and [[Formula Two]]).  Regional series include [[Formula Nippon]] and [[Formula V6 Asia]] (specifically in Asia), [[Formula Renault 3.5]] (also known as the World Series by Renault, succession series of [[World Series by Nissan]]), [[Formula Three]], [[Formula Palmer Audi]] and [[Formula Atlantic]].  In 2009, the [[FIA Formula Two Championship]] brought about the revival of the F2 series. Domestic, or country-specific series include Formula Three, Formula Renault, [[Formula Ford]] with the leading introductory series being [[Formula BMW]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Single seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers. There is a large amateur 'club racing' scene catering for those who want to race single seaters against similar people all over the world. In the UK the major club series are the [[Monoposto Racing Club]], BRSCC F3 (Formerly ClubF3, formerly ARP F3), Formula Vee and Club Formula Ford.  Each series caters for a section of the 'market', with some primarily providing low cost racing while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series (BRSCC F3).

There are other categories of single-seater racing, including [[kart racing]], which employs a small, low-cost machine on small tracks. Many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts.  [[Formula Ford]] once represented a popular first open-wheel category for up-and-coming drivers stepping up from karts and now the [[Formula BMW]] series is the preferred option as it has introduced an aero package and slicks, allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer F1. The [[Star Mazda Series]] is another entry level series.

[[File:URE05e.jpg|thumb|left| The full electric [[Formula Student]]/[[Formula SAE]] car of the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]]]]

Students at colleges and universities can also take part in single seater racing through the [[Formula SAE]] competition, which involves designing and building a single seater car in a multidisciplinary team, and racing it at the competition. This also develops other soft skills such as teamwork while promoting motorsport and engineering.

In 2006, producer [[Todd Baker]] was responsible for creating the world's first all-female Formula racing team. The group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines, and formed for an MTV reality pilot which was shot at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]].

[[File:In Car Micheal Fitzgerald Cork Racing.jpg|thumb|Racing Drivers View.]]
In December 2005 the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] gave approval to [[Superleague Formula]] racing which debuted in 2008 whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as [[AC Milan]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]].

After 25 years away from the sport, former [[Formula 2]] champion, [[Jonathan Palmer]], reopened the F2 category again, most drivers have graduated from the [[Formula Palmer Audi]] series. The category is officially registered as the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] Formula Two championship. Most rounds have two races and are support races to the [[FIA World Touring Car Championship]].

===Touring car racing===

{{Main|Touring car racing}}

[[File:2012 WTCC Race of Japan (Race 1) opening lap.jpg|thumb|Opening lap of [[2012 WTCC season|2012 WTCC]] Race of Japan]]
Touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production derived race cars. It often features full-contact racing due to the small speed differentials and large grids.

The major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the [[V8 Supercars]] (Australia), [[British Touring Car Championship]], [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters]] (DTM), and the [[World Touring Car Championship]]. The [[European Touring Car Cup]] is a one-day event open to [[Super 2000]] specification touring cars from Europe's many national championships.

The [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[SPEED World Challenge]] Touring Car and GT championships are dominant in North America. America's historic [[Trans-Am Series]] is undergoing a period of transition, but is still the longest-running road racing series in the U.S. The [[National Auto Sport Association]] also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home-built factory derived vehicles on various local circuits.

===Sports-car racing===

{{Main|Sports car racing}}

[[File:2011 FIA GT1 Silverstone 2.jpg|thumb|[[FIA GT1 World Championship|FIA GT1]] at [[Silverstone]] in [[2011 FIA GT1 World Championship season|2011]]]]

In [[sports car racing]], production derived versions of [[sports cars]] also known as grand tourers (GTs), and purpose built [[sports prototype]] cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits. The main global championship series for GT car racing is the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]]. There is also the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] as well as the less powerful [[GT4 European Cup]]. Previously, an intermediate [[FIA GT2 European Championship]] existed, but the FIA dropped it to cut costs. Other major GT championships include the Japanese [[Super GT]] championship and the [[International GT Open]] for GT2 and GT3 cars. There are also national GT championships using mainly GT3 and GT4 cars featuring professional and amateur drivers alike.

[[File:Audi R18 e-tron quattro no1 top view 2012 WEC Fuji.jpg|thumb|The [[Audi R18]]: one of the best (Le Mans) prototypes ever made.]]
Sports prototypes, unlike GT cars, do not rely on road legal cars as a base. They are closed wheel and often closed cockpit purpose built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing. They have much lower weight and more down force compared to GT cars making them much faster. They are raced in the 24 hours of Le Mans and in the (European) [[Le Mans series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]] and the [[American Le Mans Series]]. These cars are referred to as [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] (Le Mans prototype) cars with LMP1 being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful LMP2 cars run by privateer teams. All three Le Mans Series run GT cars in addition to Le Mans Prototypes; these cars have different restrictions than the FIA GT cars.

These races are often conducted over long distances, at least {{convert|1000|km|0|abbr=on}}, and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers, switching every few hours. Due to the performance difference between production-based sports cars and purpose-built sports prototypes, one race usually involves several racing classes each fighting for their own championship. Another prototype and GT racing championship exists in the United States, which began in 2000, the [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand-Am]], sanctions its own endurance series the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] which consists of slower and lower cost race cars compared to LMP and FIA GT cars.

Famous sports car races include the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the [[Rolex 24 at Daytona]], [[Spa 24 Hours|24 Hours of Spa]]-Franchorchamps, the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and the {{convert|1000|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Petit Le Mans]] at [[Road Atlanta]]. There is also the [[24 Hours Nürburgring|24 Hours of the Nürburgring]] on the infamous Nordschleife track and the [[Dubai 24 Hour]] which is aimed at GT3 and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro-am drivers.

===Production-car racing===

{{Main|Production car racing}}

Production-car racing, otherwise known as "showroom stock" in the US, is an economical and rules-restricted version of touring-car racing, mainly used to restrict costs. Numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars.

Most series follow the [[Group N]] regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that are run all over the world, most notably, Japan's Super Taikyu and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]]'s Firehawk Series which ran between the 1980s to 1990s all over the United States.

===One-make racing===

{{See also|One-Design|Spec racing}}

One-make, or single marque, championships often employ production-based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturer's range. There are numerous notable one-make formulae from various countries and regions, some of which&nbsp;– such as the [[Porsche Supercup]] and, previously, [[International Race of Champions|IROC]]&nbsp;– have fostered many distinct national championships. Single marque series are often found at club level, to which the production-based cars, limited modifications, and close parity in performance are very well suited. Some of the better-known single-make series are the [http://www.mini7.co.uk Mini 7 Championship] (Europe's longest running one make championship), the [[Radical European Masters]], [http://www.minichallenge.co.uk John Cooper Mini Challenge], [[Renault Clio Cup|Clio Cup]], [[Ginetta Cars|Ginettas]], [[Caterham Racing|Caterhams]], [[Kumho BMW Championship|BMWs]], and [[MaX5 Racing Championship|MX5s]]. There are also single-chassis [[Open wheel car|single seater]] formulae, such as [[Formula Renault]] and [[Formula BMW]], usually as "feeder" series for "senior" race formula (in the fashion of [[farm team]]s).

===Stock car racing===
[[File:2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series FedEx 400 at Dover International Speedway.jpg|thumb|The [[2012 FedEx 400]] NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series]] race at [[Dover International Speedway]]]]
{{Main|Stock car racing}}

In North America, [[stock car racing]] is the most popular form of auto racing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=2&id=3099978&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines | title=Addition of IndyCar champ Hornish will give Penske third Cup team | date=November 8, 2007 | work=ESPN Racing | accessdate=February 8, 2009}}</ref> Primarily raced on [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], stock cars vaguely resemble production cars, but are in fact purpose-built racing machines which are built to tight specifications also called [[Silhouette racing car]]s.

The largest stock car racing governing body is [[NASCAR]] (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing).  NASCAR's premier series is the [[Sprint Cup Series]], its most famous races being the [[Daytona 500]], the [[Bojangles Southern 500|Southern 500]], the [[Coca-Cola 600]], and the [[Brickyard 400]]. NASCAR also runs several feeder series, including the [[Nationwide Series]], and [[Camping World Truck Series]] (a [[pickup truck]] racing series). The series  conduct races across the entire [[continental United States]].  The [[NASCAR Canadian Tire Series]] conducts races across Canada and the [[NASCAR Corona Series]] conducts races across Mexico.

NASCAR also governs several smaller regional series, such as the [[Whelen Modified Tour]]. Modified cars are best described as open-wheel cars. Modified cars have no parts related to the "stock" vehicle for which they are named after. A number of Modified cars display a "manufacturers" logo and "vehicle name", yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer.
[[File:BrettSontag2010LateModelRockfordSpeedway.jpg|left|thumb|An [[ASA Late Model Series]] stock car on an asphalt track.]]
There are also other stock car governing bodies, such as [[Automobile Racing Club of America]] and [[United Speed Alliance Racing]].

In the UK, [[British Stock car racing]] is also referred to as "Short Circuit Racing". This takes place on shale or tarmac tracks&nbsp;– usually around 1/4&nbsp;mile long. The governing bodies for the sport are the Oval Racing Council (ORC) and BriSCA. Both bodies are made up of individual stadium promoters. There are around 35 tracks in the UK and upwards of 7000 active drivers. The sport is split into three basic "divisions"&nbsp;– distinguished by the rules regarding car-contact during racing. The most famous championship is the [[BriSCA F1 Stock Cars]]. Full contact formulas include Bangers, Bombers and Rookie Bangers&nbsp;– and racing features Demolitions Derbies, Figure of Eight racing and Oval Racing

Semi Contact Formulas include BriSCA F1, F2 and Superstox&nbsp;– where bumpers are used tactically.

Non-contact formulas include National Hot Rods, Stock Rods and Lightning Rods.

UK Stock car racing started in the 1950s and grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s.

===Rallying===

{{Main|Rallying}}

[[File:Andreas Mikkelsen - WRC Portugal 2013 (8647047945).jpg|thumb|[[Andreas Mikkelsen]] driving a [[Volkswagen Polo R WRC|VW Polo R WRC]] during the [[2013 Rally de Portugal]]]]

[[Rallying]] at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] road legal production based car; [[Group N]] Production cars and more modified [[Group A]] cars. Cars compete on closed public roads or off-road areas run on a point-to-point format where participants and their co-drivers "rally" to a set of points, leaving in regular intervals from start points. A rally is typically conducted over a number of "special stages" on any terrain, which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go. These detailed descriptions are known as "pace notes." During the actual rally, the co-driver reads the pace notes aloud (using an in-helmet intercom system) to the driver, enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible. Competition is based on lowest total elapsed time over the course of an event's special stages, including penalties.

The top series is the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC), but there also regional championships and many countries have their own national championships. Some famous rallies include the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], [[Rally Argentina]], [[Rally Finland]] and [[Rally GB]]. Another famous event (actually best described as a "[[rally raid]]") is the [[Paris-Dakar Rally]]. There are also many smaller, club level, [[categories of rallies]] which are popular with amateurs, making up the "grass roots" of motor sports.  Cars at this level may not comply fully with the requirements of [[group A]] or [[group N]] [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]].
As well as the [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] other major rally events include the [[British Rally Championship]], [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]], [[African Rally Championship]], [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship]] and endurance rally events like the [[Dakar Rally]].

[[File:Longford extreme slide 2.jpg|thumb|"Der Panzerwagen" at the 2010 [[Targa Tasmania]]]]
The  [[Targa Tasmania]], held on the Australian island state of Tasmania and run annually since 1992, takes its name from the [[Targa Florio]], a former motoring event held on the island of [[Sicily]]. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the [[Mille Miglia]], the [[Coupe des Alpes]] and the [[Tour de Corse]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Similarly named events around the world include the [[Targa Newfoundland]] based in Canada, [[Targa West]] based in Western Australia, [[Targa New Zealand]] and other smaller events.

===Drag racing===

{{Main|Drag racing}}

[[File:Tarlton-Drag racing-004.jpg|thumb|Jet-propulsed [[drag racing|dragster]] in [[Tarlton, Gauteng|Tarlton]], [[South Africa]]]]

In drag racing, the objective is to complete a given straight-line distance, from a standing start, ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane. This distance is traditionally ¼ mile (400&nbsp;m), though ⅛ mile (200&nbsp;m) has become popular since the 1990s. The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built [[drag racing|dragster]]. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the ¼ mile in 12 to 16&nbsp;seconds, whereas a [[top fuel dragster]] takes 4.5&nbsp;seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to {{convert|530|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Drag racing was organized as a sport by [[Wally Parks]] in the early 1950s through the [[NHRA]] (National Hot Rod Association). The NHRA was formed to discourage [[street racing]].

When launching, a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 3.4 [[g-force|g]] (33&nbsp;m/s²), and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is 4&nbsp;g (39&nbsp;m/s²), more than the [[Space Shuttle]] experiences. A top fuel car can be heard over {{convert|8|mi|km}} away and can generate a reading from 1.5 to 3.9 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://topfuel.nhra.com/blog/nhra-notebook/2007/07/26/22660/ | title=Herbert's engine thunders to 3.9 on Richter scale | date=July 26, 2007 | work=NHRA.com | accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>

Drag racing is two cars head-to-head, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]]) using an index (a lowest e.t. allowed), and cars running under (quicker than) their index "break out" and lose. The slowest cars, bracket racers, are also handicapped, but rather than an index, they use a [[Drag_racing#Dial-in|dial-in]].

===Off-road racing===

{{Main|Off-road racing}}

[[File:Stockmini.jpg|thumb|[[Rod Hall (racer)|Rod Hall]] in a [[Hummer H3]] during a [[Best in the Desert]] race]]

In [[off-road racing]], various classes  of specially modified vehicles, including cars, compete in races through off-road environments. In North America these races often take place in the desert, such as the famous [[Baja 1000]].
In Europe, "offroad" refers to events such as autocross or rallycross, while desert races and rally-raids such as the [[Paris-Dakar Rally|Paris-Dakar]], Master Rallye or European "bajas" are called "cross-country rallies."

===Kart racing===

[[File:Monterey Historic.jpg|thumb|[[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]], [[Monterey]], 2008]]

{{Main|Kart racing}}
The modern kart was invented by Art Ingels, a fabricator at the legendary Indianapolis-car manufacturer Kurtis-Kraft, in Southern California in 1956. Ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube-frame chassis weighing less than 100&nbsp;lb. Ingels, and everyone else who drove the kart, were startled at its performance capabilities. The sport soon blossomed in Southern California, and quickly spread around the world. Although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport, [[kart racing]], or karting, can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right. A large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts, often from a very young age, such as [[Michael Schumacher]] and [[Fernando Alonso]]. Several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport, notably [[Wayne Rainey]], who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand-controlled kart. As one of the cheapest ways to race, karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide.

Despite their diminutive size, karting's most powerful class, [[superkart]], can have a power-to-weight ratio of 440&nbsp;hp/tonne.

===Historical racing===
{{Main|Historic motorsport}}
As modern motor racing is centered on modern technology with a lots of corporate sponsors and politics involved, [[historical racing]] tends to be the opposite. Because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented, reducing corporate sponsorship and politics. Events are regulated to only allow cars of a certain era to participate. The only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing. A historical event can be of a number of different motorsport disciplines.
Notably some of the most famous events of them all are the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] and [[Goodwood Revival]] in Britain and [[Monterey Historic]] in the United States. Championships range from "grass root" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]] racing to the [[FIA Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship]] for classic [[Formula One]] chassis.

While there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing, this branch of [[auto sport]] tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and less competitive in its approach.

==Use of flags==

{{Main|Racing flags}}

In many types of auto races, particularly those held on closed courses, flags are displayed to indicate the general status of the track and to communicate instructions to competitors. While individual series have different rules, and the flags have changed from the first years (e.g., red used to start a race), these are generally accepted.

==Accidents==

For the worst accident in racing history see [[1955 Le Mans disaster]]. (''See also [[Deaths in motorsports]]'')

==Racing-car setup==

{{Main|Racing setup}}

In auto racing, the [[racing setup]] or car setup is the set of adjustments made to the vehicle to optimize its behaviour (performance, [[Car handling|handling]], reliability, etc.). Adjustments can occur in [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspensions]], brakes, [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]], engines, tires, and many others.

==Racing driver==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
Racing drivers at the highest levels are usually paid by the team, or by sponsors, and can command very substantial salaries.

Contrary to what may be popularly assumed, racing drivers as a group do not have unusually good reflexes. During countless physiological (and psychological) evaluations of professional racing drivers, the two characteristics that stand out are racers' near-obsessive need to control their surroundings (the psychological aspect), and an unusual ability to process fast-moving information (physiological). In this, researchers have noted a strong correlation between racers' psychological profiles and those of fighter pilots. In tests comparing racers to members of the general public, the greater the complexity of the information processing matrix, the greater the speed gap between racers and the public. Due partly to the performance capabilities of modern racing cars, racing drivers require a high level of fitness, focus and the ability to concentrate at high levels for long periods in an inherently difficult environment.

In particular, racing cars such as [[formula racing|formula cars]] and [[sports prototype]]s that generate a substantial amount of [[downforce]] are able to corner at speeds that impose extremely large [[g-force]]s on drivers.<ref name="LATimes1985">
