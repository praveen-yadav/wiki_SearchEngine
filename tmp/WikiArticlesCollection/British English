'''British English''' ('''BE''', '''en-UK''' or '''en-GB''')<ref><code>en-GB</code> is the [[language code]] for ''British English'', as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).</ref> is the broad term used to distinguish the forms of the [[English language]] used in the [[United Kingdom]] from forms used elsewhere.<ref>Peters, p. 79.</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' applies the term to English "as spoken or written in the [[British Isles]]; esp[ecially] the forms of English usual in [[Great Britain]]", reserving "[[Hiberno-English]]" for the "English language as spoken and written in [[Ireland]]".<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=British English; Hiberno-English}}</ref> Nevertheless, Hiberno-English forms part of the broad British English continuum.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Others, such as the ''Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary'', define it as the "[[English language in England|English language as it is spoken and written in England]]."<ref>http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/british-english?q=british+english|Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary</ref> The [[European Union]] basically uses 'British English' as its standard variety of English (including also [[Irish English]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=English Style Guide|url=http://ec.europa.eu/translation/english/guidelines/documents/styleguide_english_dgt_en.pdf|work=A handbook for authors and translators in the European Commission|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=11 December 2012|date=2012 October}}</ref>

There are slight regional variations in formal written English in the United Kingdom. For example, although the words ''[[wiktionary:wee|wee]]'' and ''little'' are interchangeable in some contexts, ''wee'' (as an adjective) is almost exclusively written by some people from some parts of northern Great Britain (and especially [[Scotland]]) or from [[Northern Ireland]], whereas in [[Southern England]] and [[Wales]], ''little'' is used predominantly. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in ''written'' English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term ''British English''. The forms of ''spoken'' English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken,<ref>{{cite news

|at=section G2, p.&nbsp;12}}</ref> so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the ''Oxford Guide to World English'', "For many people . . . especially in England [''British English''] is [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautologous]]," and it shares "all the ambiguities and tensions in the word ''British'', and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity."<ref>McArthur (2002), p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The term "British English" is sometimes used as a synonym for "[[Commonwealth English]]"; that is, English as spoken and written in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of the English language}}
[[English language|English]] is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought to Britain by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic settlers]] from various parts of what is now northwest [[Germany]] and the northern [[Netherlands]]. The resident population at this time was generally speaking [[Common Brittonic]]—the insular variety of [[continental Celtic]] which was influenced by the [[Roman army|Roman]] occupation. This group of languages ([[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Cumbric]]) cohabited alongside [[English language|English]] into the modern period, but due to their remoteness from the [[Germanic languages]], influence on English was [[Lists of English words of Celtic origin|notably limited]]. However, the degree of influence remains debated, and it has recently been argued that its grammatical influence accounts for the substantial innovations noted between English and the other West Germanic languages.<ref>[[English and Welsh]], 1955 J R R Tolkien, also see references in [[Brittonicisms in English]]</ref> Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] Kingdoms of England. One of these dialects, [[Late West Saxon]], eventually came to dominate. The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two waves of invasion: the first was by speakers of the Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who conquered and colonised parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second was the [[Normans]] in the 11th century, who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed an English variety of this called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. These two invasions caused English to become "mixed" to some degree (though it was never a truly [[mixed language]] in the strictest sense of the word; mixed languages arise from the cohabitation of speakers of different languages, who develop a hybrid tongue for basic communication).

Cohabitation with the Scandinavians resulted in a significant grammatical simplification and lexical enrichment of the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] core of English; the later Norman occupation led to the grafting onto that Germanic core of a more elaborate layer of words from the Romance branch of the European languages. This Norman influence entered English largely through the courts and government. Thus, English developed into a [[loanword|"borrowing" language]] of great flexibility and with a huge [[vocabulary]].

[[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|Dialects]] and [[Regional accents of English speakers|accents]] vary amongst the four [[countries of the United Kingdom]], as well as within the countries themselves.

The major divisions are normally classified as [[English language in England|English English]] (or English as spoken in England, which comprises [[Southern English English|Southern English]] dialects, [[West Country English|West Country]] dialects, [[East Midlands English|East]] and [[West Midlands English|West]] Midlands English dialects and [[Northern English]] dialects), [[Welsh English]] (not to be confused with the [[Welsh language]]), [[Irish English]] and [[Scottish English]] (not to be confused with the [[Scots language]]). The various British dialects also differ in the words that they have borrowed from other languages.

Following its last major [[survey of English Dialects]] (1949–1950), the [[University of Leeds]] has started work on a new project. In May 2007 the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] awarded a grant to a team led by Sally Johnson, Professor of Linguistics and Phonetics at Leeds University, to study British regional dialects.<ref>[http://www.personal.leeds.ac.uk/~smlsaj/ Professor Sally Johnson] biography on the [[Leeds University]] website</ref><ref name=MEO>[http://reporter.leeds.ac.uk/press_releases/current/voices.htm Mapping the English language—from cockney to Orkney], [[Leeds University]] website, 25 May 2007.</ref>

Johnson's team are{{efn|name=note}} sifting through a large collection of examples of regional slang words and phrases turned up by the "Voices project" run by the [[BBC]], in which they invited the public to send in examples of English still spoken throughout the country. The BBC Voices project also collected hundreds of news articles about how the British speak English from swearing through to items on language schools. This information will also be collated and analysed by Johnson's team both for content and for where it was reported. "Perhaps the most remarkable finding in the Voices study is that the English language is as diverse as ever, despite our increased mobility and constant exposure to other accents and dialects through TV and radio."<ref name=MEO/> Work by the team on this project is not expected to end before 2010.

=== Regional ===
The form of English most commonly associated with the [[upper class]] in the southern counties of England is called [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP).<ref name=fowler>{{cite news |last=Fowler |first=H.W. |editor=R.W. Birchfield |title=Fowler's Modern English Usage |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1996 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> It derives from a mixture of the Midland and Southern dialects which were spoken in London in the early modern period<ref name=fowler/> and is frequently used as a model for teaching English to foreign learners.<ref name=fowler/> Although speakers from elsewhere in England may not speak with an RP accent, it is now a class dialect more than a local dialect. It may also be referred to as "the Queen's (or King's) English", "[[Independent School (UK)|Public School]] English", "Posh" or "[[BBC]] English" as this was originally the form of English used on radio and television, although a wider variety of accents can be heard these days. About 2% of Britons speak RP,<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/ Learning: Language & Literature: Sounds Familiar?: Case studies: Received Pronunciation] [[British Library]]</ref> and it has evolved quite markedly over the last 40 years.

In the South East there are significantly different accents: the [[Cockney]] accent spoken by some Londoners is strikingly different from RP. The Cockney [[rhyming slang]] can be (and was initially intended to be) difficult for outsiders to understand,<ref name="Franklyn1975">{{cite book|last=Franklyn|first=Julian|title=A dictionary of rhyming slang|year=1975|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=0-415-04602-5|page=9}}</ref> although the extent of its use is often somewhat exaggerated.

[[Estuary English]] has been gaining prominence in recent decades: it has some features of RP and some of Cockney. In London itself, the broad local accent is still changing, partly influenced by Caribbean speech. Immigrants to the UK in recent decades have brought many more languages to the country. Surveys started in 1979 by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] discovered over 100 languages being spoken domestically by the families of the inner city's schoolchildren. As a result, [[London]]ers speak with a mixture of accents, depending on ethnicity, neighbourhood, class, age, upbringing, and sundry other factors.

Since the mass internal [[immigration]] to [[Northamptonshire]] in the 1940s and its position between several major accent regions, it has become a source of various accent developments. In Northampton the older accent has been influenced by overspill Londoners. There is an accent known locally as the [[Kettering]] accent, which is a transitional accent between the [[East Midlands]] and [[East Anglia]]n. It is the last southern midland accent to use the broad "a" in words like ''bath''/''grass'' (i.e. barth/grarss). Conversely ''crass''/''plastic'' use a slender "a". A few miles northwest in Leicestershire the slender "a" becomes more widespread generally. In the town of [[Corby]], five miles (8&nbsp;km) north, one can find Corbyite, which unlike the Kettering accent, is largely influenced by the West Scottish accent.

In addition, most British people can to some degree temporarily "swing" their accent towards a more neutral form of English at will, to reduce difficulty where very different accents are involved, or when speaking to foreigners.

=== Glottal stop ===
In a number of forms of spoken British English, it is common for the sound /t/, except at the beginning of words, to be replaced by a [[glottal stop]] in a process called [[T-glottalisation]]. Once regarded as a Cockney feature, it has become much more widespread. It is still stigmatised when used in words like ''later'', but becoming very widespread at the end of words such as ''not'' (as in no/ʔ/ interested).<ref name="Trudghill56">{{cite book|last=Trudgill|first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Trudgill|title=Language in the British Isles|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-28409-0|pages=56–57}}</ref> Other consonants subject to this usage in Cockney English are ''p'', as in pa/ʔ/er, ''k'' as in ba/ʔ/er and "t" as in bu/ʔ/er.<ref name="Trudghill56" />

== Standardisation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
As with English around the world, the English language as used in the [[United Kingdom]] is governed by convention rather than formal code: there is no body equivalent to the [[Académie française]] or the [[Real Academia Española]], and the authoritative dictionaries (for example, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''[[LDOCE|Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English]]'', ''[[Chambers Dictionary]]'', ''[[Collins Dictionary]]'') record usage rather than attempting to prescribe it. In addition, vocabulary and usage change with time: words are freely borrowed from other languages and other strains of English, and [[neologism]]s are frequent.

For historical reasons dating back to the rise of [[London]] in the 9th century, the form of language spoken in London and the [[East Midlands]] became standard English within the Court, and ultimately became the basis for generally accepted use in the law, government, literature and education in Britain. To a considerable extent, modern British spelling was standardised in [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), although previous writers had also played a significant role in this and much has changed since 1755. Scotland, which underwent [[Acts of Union 1707|parliamentary union]] with England only in 1707, still has a few independent standards, especially within its separate legal system.

Since the early 20th century, numerous books by British authors intended as guides to English grammar and usage have been published, a few of which have achieved sufficient acclaim to have remained in print for long periods and to have been reissued in new editions after some decades. These include, most notably of all, Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|Modern English Usage]]'' and [[The Complete Plain Words]] by [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]]. Detailed guidance on many aspects of writing British English for publication is included in style guides issued by various publishers including ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[Cambridge University Press]]. The Oxford University Press guidelines were originally drafted as a single broadsheet page by [[Horace Hart|Horace Henry Hart]], and were at the time (1893) the first guide of their type in English; they were gradually expanded and eventually published, first as ''[[Hart's Rules]]'', and in 2002 as part of ''The Oxford Manual of Style''. Comparable in authority and stature to ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' for published [[American English]], the Oxford Manual is a fairly exhaustive standard for published British English, to which writers can turn in the absence of any specific guidance issued by their publishing house.

| In British English [[collective noun]]s may be treated as either singular or plural, according to context. An example provided by [[Eric Partridge|Partridge]] is: " 'The committee of public safety is to consider the matter', but 'the committee of public safety quarrel regarding their next chairman' ...Thus...singular when...a unit is intended; plural when the idea of plurality is predominant." [[BBC News|BBC television news]] and [http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/c ''The Guardian''] style guide follow Partridge but other sources, such as [[BBC Online]] and ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/tools_and_services/specials/style_guide/article986720.ece The Times]'' style guides, recommend a strict noun-verb agreement with the collective noun always governing the verb [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] in the singular.
