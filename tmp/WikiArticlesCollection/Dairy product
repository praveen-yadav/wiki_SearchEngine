A '''dairy product '''is food produced from the [[milk]] of [[mammals]].<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/understandfoodlabellingterms.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> Dairy products are usually high energy-yielding food products. A production plant for the processing of milk is called a [[dairy]] or a dairy factory. Apart from breastfed infants, the human consumption of dairy products is sourced primarily from the milk of cows,  yet [[dairy goat|goats]], [[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[yak]]s, [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s, and other mammals are other sources of dairy products consumed by humans. Dairy products are commonly found in [[European cuisine|European]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]], and [[Indian cuisine]], whereas aside from [[Mongolian cuisine]] they are little-known in traditional [[East Asian]] cuisine.

==Concerns==
'''Health'''

Dairy products can cause health issues for individuals who have [[lactose intolerance]] or a [[milk allergy]]. Some dairy products such as [[blue cheese]] may become contaminated with the fungus ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' during ripening, which can trigger [[asthma]] and other respiratory problems in susceptible individuals. Dairy products if consumed after the [[expiry date]] can cause serious [[heart]] problems.<ref name=ssia>{{cite web

'''Avoidance of Dairy Products'''

Some groups avoid dairy products for non-health related reasons:

*Religious - Some religions restrict or do not allow for the consumption of dairy products. For example, some scholars of [[Jain vegetarianism|Jainism]] advocate not consuming any dairy products because dairy is perceived to involve violence against cows. Strict [[Kosher|Judaism]] requires that meat and dairy products are not served at the same meal, served or cooked in the same utensils, or stored together as prescribed in {{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|14:21}}.

*Ethical - [[Veganism]] is the avoidance of all animal products, including dairy products, most often due to the ethics regarding how dairy products are produced. The [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical reasons for avoiding dairy]] include how dairy is produced, how the animals are handled, and the environmental effect of dairy production.
