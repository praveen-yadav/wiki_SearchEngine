'''Ayahuasca''' (usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|aɪ|j|ə|ˈ|w|æ|s|k|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|j|ə|ˈ|w|aː|s|k|ə}}), also  commonly called '''yagé''' ({{IPAc-en|j|aː|h|eɪ}}), is a [[hallucinogen]]ic brew of various plant infusions prepared with the ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' vine. It  is either mixed with the leaves of [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT)-containing species of shrubs from the genus ''[[Psychotria]]'' or with the leaves of the ''[[Justicia pectoralis]]'' plant which doesn't contain DMT. The brew, first described academically in the early 1950s by [[Harvard]] ethnobotanist [[Richard Evans Schultes]], who found it employed for divinatory and healing purposes by the native peoples of [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian]] [[Peru]], is known by a number of different names (see [[#Nomenclature|below]]).<ref name="discovery">{{cite web |url=http://www.ayahuasca.com/ayahuasca-overviews/on-the-origins-of-ayahuasca/ |title=Overviews Shamanism – On The Origin of Ayahuasca |publisher=Ayahuasca.com |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref>

It has been reported that some effects can be felt from consuming the caapi vine alone, but that DMT-containing plants (such as ''Psychotria'') remain inactive when drunk as a brew without a source of [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]] (MAOI) such as ''B. caapi''. How [[indigenous peoples]] discovered the synergistic properties of the plants used in the ayahuasca brew remains unclear. Many indigenous Amazonian people say they received the instructions directly from plants and plant spirits.

== Effects ==
[[File:Ayahuasca and chacruna cocinando.jpg|thumb|right|Ayahuasca cooking]]

People who have consumed ayahuasca report having [[Spirituality|spiritual]] revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the [[universe]] as well as deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gorman |first=Peter |title=Ayahuasca in My Blood: 25 Years of Medicine Dreaming |year=2010 |isbn=1452882908}}</ref> This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what's often described as a [[rebirth]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011 |pages=67–70}}</ref>  In addition it is often reported that individuals can gain access to higher spiritual [[dimensions]] and make contact with various spiritual or extra dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Metzer |first=Ralph |title=Ayahuasca: Human Consciousness and the Spirits of Nature |year=1999 |pages=46–55}}</ref>  

It's nearly always said that people experience profound positive changes in their life subsequent to consuming ayahuasca<ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011 |pages=25–28}}</ref> and it is often viewed as one of the most effective tools of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Metzer |first=Ralph |title=Ayahuasca: Human Consciousness and the Spirits of Nature |year=1999 |pages=22–23}}</ref> Vomiting can follow ayahuasca ingestion; this purging is considered by many [[shamans]] and experienced users of ayahuasca to be an essential part of the experience as it represents the release of negative energy and emotions built up over the course of one's life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011 |pages=81–85}}</ref> Other such reports of this purging has come in the form of [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], and hot/cold flashes. 

Further, the ingestion of ayahuasca can cause significant, but temporary emotional and psychological distress. There are many reports of miraculous physical as well as emotional and spiritual healing resulting from the use of ayahuasca.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}</ref> Long-term negative effects are not known.<ref>{{cite video |last=Schultz |first=Mitch |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule |date=2010}}</ref>

==Warnings==

For various reasons some [[shamans]] and experienced users of ayahuasca advise against consuming ayahuasca when not in the presence of one or several well-trained shamans. <ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}</ref> It is believed that one of the core functions of a [[shaman]] is to provide a kind of spiritual protection that keeps negative [[entities]] away. This includes not only [[spirits]] but other shamans referred to as brujos who practice a form of shamanic [[witchcraft]] and can enter the space and attempt to harm people having consumed ayahuasca. <ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}</ref>

Additionally, these brujos often masquerade as real shamans enticing tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Real shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal ones energy and or power, which they believe every person has a stockpile of. <ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}</ref> It is believed to be very important for individuals seeking an ayahuasca experience to find a reputable shaman before hastily drinking with anyone who claims to be a shaman or offers one ayahuasca.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}</ref>

Finally, there are a number of substances that when taken in conjunction with ayahuasca can cause symptoms that range from intense sickness to even death, in very rare cases, due to the [[MAOI]] that is present in the ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine. Certain pharmaceutical drugs, particularly [[SSRI]]s, can cause dangerous reactions when consumed with ayahuasca. Any [[anti-anxiety]] or [[antidepressant]] medication should strictly be avoided for at least one week before and after an ayahuasca ceremony. It is recommended that if you are taking any medications that you consult your doctor well in advance.

== Nomenclature ==
[[File:Ayahuasca prep.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]
Ayahuasca is known by many names throughout [[Northern South America]] and [[Brazil]].

''Ayahuasca'' is the [[Hispanicized]] spelling of a word in the [[Quechua languages]], which are spoken in the [[Andean states]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]]. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the [[Aymara language]] may prefer the spelling ''ayawaska''. This word refers both to the liana ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', and to the healing brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, ''aya'' means "spirit", and ''waska'' means "liana". The word ''ayahuasca'' has been variously translated as "liana of the soul", "liana of the dead", and "spirit liana".<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-psychotropes-2002-1-page-79.htm  Ayahuasca : une synthèse interdisciplinaire]. Por Frédérick Bois-Mariage. ''Psychotropes'' 1/2002 (Vol. 8), p. 79-113. DOI : 10.3917/psyt.081.0079.</ref>

In Brazil, the brew and the liana are informally called either '''''caapi''''' or '''''cipó'''''; the latter is the Portuguese word for [[liana]] (or woody climbing vine). In the [[União do Vegetal]] of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink ayahuasca, the brew is prepared exclusively from ''B. caapi'' and ''P. viridis''. Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew '''''hoasca''''' or '''''vegetal'''''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In the [[Tucanoan languages]] it is called  '''''yagé''''' or '''''yajé''''' (both pronounced {{IPA-xx|jaˈhe|}}).<ref>This term was popularized in English in the 1960s by the [[beat generation]] writers [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] in ''[[The Yage Letters]]''.  The letters were originally written in the 1950s.</ref> The [[Achuar people]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Descola |first=Philippe |year=1996 |title=In the Society of Nature: A Native Ecology in Amazonia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57467-9 |pages=99–100, 163}}</ref> and [[Shuar people]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Incayawar |first=Mario |coauthors=Lise Bouchard, Ronald Wintrob, Goffredo Bartocci |year=2009 |title=Psychiatrists and Traditional Healers: Unwitting Partners in Global Mental Health |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-51683-6 |page=69}}</ref> of Ecuador and Peru call it '''''natem''''', whereas the [[Sharanahua peoples]] of Peru call it '''''shori'''''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Siskind |first=Janet |year=1973|title=To Hunt in the Morning |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-501891-5 |page=130}}</ref>

== Chemistry ==
[[Harmala alkaloid]]s are MAO-inhibiting [[beta-Carboline|''beta''-carboline]]s. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the ''B. caapi'' vine are [[harmine]], [[harmaline]] and [[tetrahydroharmine]]. Harmine and harmaline are [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Selectivity|selective]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Reversibility|reversible]] inhibitors of [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI).<ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/> 

This inhibition of MAO-A allows [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMA]]s or the MAOI of MAO-A, DMT would be oxidised (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.<ref name="RIBA, J 2003">RIBA, J.

== Preparation ==
Sections of ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine are [[liquid-liquid extraction|macerated]] and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (''chacruna'') or ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (also known as ''chaliponga'').  The resulting brew contains the powerful [[psychedelic drug]] [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibiting]] [[harmala alkaloid]]s, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active.

Brews can also be made with no DMT-containing plants; ''Psychotria viridis'' being substituted by plants such as ''Justicia pectoralis'', ''[[Brugmansia]]'', or sacred tobacco, also known as ''Mapacho'' ([[Nicotiana rustica]]), or sometimes left out with no replacement. The potency of this brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony.  Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of [[harmala]] alkaloids.<ref name="Callaway2005b">{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=J.

*'''Huacapurana''': Giant tree of the Amazon with very hard bark. Its head spirits come in the form of Amazonian giants and provide a strong grounding presence in the ceremony.

== Usage ==
[[File:Ayahuasca preparation.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]

Ayahuasca is used largely as a religious [[sacrament]].  Users of ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca [[shamanism]], as practiced among [[indigenous people]]s like the [[Urarina]] of [[Peru]]vian [[Amazonia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1= Bartholomew |year=2009 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5 |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 }}</ref>  While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption, and peaking after two hours. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing both heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience.  It is for this reason that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tafur |first=Joseph |title=Ayahuasca |url=http://www.nihuerao.com/eng/ayawaska.htm}}</ref>

The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as ''la purga'' or "the purge"). The intense [[vomiting]] and occasional [[diarrhea]] it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical [[parasite]]s,<ref name="Andritzky1989">{{cite journal |last=Andritzky |first=Walter |title=Sociopsychotherapeutic Functions of Ayahuasca Healing in Amazonia |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |location=San Francisco |publisher=Haight-Ashbury Pub. in assoc. w.

Dietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca.<ref name="Jonathan Ott, 1994">{{cite book |last1=Ott |first1= J. |title=Ayahuasca Analogues: Pangaean Entheogens |location=Kennewick, WA |publisher=Natural Books |year=1994  |isbn=978-0-9614234-4-5}}</ref> In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily-seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in [[list of foods containing tyramine|foods containing tyramine]] has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of [[tyramine]] and MAOIs could lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]. However, evidence indicates that [[harmala alkaloids]] act only on [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]], in a reversible way similar to [[moclobemide]] (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church [[União do Vegetal]], suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived, and probably non-existent.<ref name="Jonathan Ott, 1994"/>

In some areas{{Specify|date=July 2009}}, it is even said that the ''chakruna'' or chaliponga admixtures are added only to make the brew taste sweeter.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} This is a strong indicator of the often wildly divergent intentions and cultural differences between the native ayahuasca-using cultures and psychedelics enthusiasts in other countries.

A visitor who wishes to become a "dietero" or "dietera", that is, a male or female apprentice-shaman learning the way of the teacher plants, undergoes a rigorous initiation. This can involve spending up to a year or more in the jungle. This initiation challenges and trains the initiate through extreme circumstances involving a special diet and numerous different plant medicines to complement the ayahuasca, the lack of western food and conveniences, the harsh environmental conditions of heavy rains, storms, intense heat, insects, and venomous animals. The initiate is also tested for their unwavering commitment to ayahuasca and the shaman who oversees the training.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Non-traditional usage ===
Around the end of the 1990s, ayahuasca use spread to [[Europe]]. The first ayahuasca 'Churches', affiliated with the [[Brazil]]ian [[Santo Daime]], were established in the [[Netherlands]]. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, [[Hans Bogers]] (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and [[Geraldine Fijneman]] (the head of the [[Amsterdam]] Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a [[controlled substance]] (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order that it warranted denying their rights to [[religious freedom]] under [[ECHR#Article 9 - conscience and religion|ECHR Article 9]]. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different 'styles' have been developed, such as the non-religious approach developed by Daniel Waterman in 2001,<ref>[http://www.a-keys.nl/ayahuasca/who_we_are.html Who We Are] at a-keys.nl</ref> popularly termed Ayahuasca Open Style (AOS).<ref>[http://www.a-keys.nl/ayahuasca/introduction.html Introduction to Ayahuasca] at a-keys.nl</ref>

In modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogues are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the [[Syrian rue]] plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''chakruna''. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.

The name 'ayahuasca' specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains ''Banisteriopsis caapi''. A synthetic version, known as [[pharmahuasca]] is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. Thus, ayahuasqueros and most others working with the brew maintain that the ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|B. caapi]]'' vine is the defining ingredient, and that this beverage is not ayahuasca unless ''B. caapi'' is in the brew. The vine is considered to be the "spirit" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper and guide to the otherworldly realms.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Acacia maidenii]]'' (Maiden's Wattle) *not all plants are 'active strains'; meaning some plants will have very little DMT and others larger amounts, ''[[Acacia phlebophylla]]'', and other [[Acacia]]s, most commonly employed in [[Australia]] – bark
* ''[[Acacia obtusifolia]]'' Has a similar range to Acacia Maidenii – bark
* ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'', ''A. colubrina, A. excelsa, A. macrocarpa''
* ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' (Jurema) – root bark – not traditionally employed with ayahuasca by any existing cultures, though likely it was in the past. Popular in Europe and North America.

MAOI:
* [[Harmal]] (''Peganum harmala'', Syrian rue) – seeds
* [[Passion flower]]
* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#List of MAOIs|synthetic MAOIs]]

== History ==
In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first encountered indigenous peoples using ayahuasca in South America; their earliest reports described it as the work of the devil.<ref>Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975, p. 48 as cited in Soibelman 1995, p. 14.</ref>  In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of ''B. caapi'' was named ''[[telepathine]]'', but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from ''Peganum harmala'' and was given the name [[harmaline]].  Beat writer William Burroughs read a paper by [[Richard Evans Schultes]] on the subject and sought out ''yagé'' in the early 1950s while traveling through South America in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] (see ''[[The Yage Letters]]''). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in ''True Hallucinations''.  [[Dennis McKenna]] later studied the pharmacology, [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which became the subject of his master's thesis.

In [[Brazil]], a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being [[Santo Daime]] and the [[União do Vegetal]] (or UDV), usually in an [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with [[Christianity]]. Both Santo Daime and [[União do Vegetal]] now have members and churches throughout the world.

== Legal status ==
Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |title=DMT – UN report |publisher=MAPS |date=1971-02-21 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>
<blockquote>
The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principles, [[mescaline]], DMT and [[psilocin]].
</blockquote>

A [[fax]] from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that "Consequently, preparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention."<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law10.shtml |title=Ayahuasca Vault : Law : UNDCP's Ayahuasca Fax |publisher=Erowid.org |date=2001-01-17 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

The legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat questionable. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug.  That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the [[Native American Church]]. A court case allowing the [[União do Vegetal]] to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea.  In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.<ref>{{citation |url=http://csp.org/society/docs/SantoDaimeAshland20090318.pdf |title=Ruling by District Court Judge Panner in Santo Daime case in Oregon |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref>

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.<ref>More on the legal status of ayahuasca can be found in the [[Erowid]] vault on the [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law.shtml legality of ayahuasca].</ref>

In France, [[Santo Daime]] won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.<ref>''Cour d'appel de Paris, 10ème chambre, section B,  dossier n° 04/01888.  Arrêt du 13 janvier 2005'' [Court of Appeal of Paris, 10th Chamber, Section B, File No. 04/01888. Judgement of 13 January 2005]. PDF of this document may be obtained from [http://www.santodaime.it/Library/LAW/0_LAW.htm#fra Ayahuasca – Santo Daime Library]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}.</ref>  Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.<ref>''JO'', 2005-05-03.

<!-- NPR reported in August 2010 that it was legal, is that wrong?
In Peru, the government is undergoing the legislation process of legalizing and regulating ayahuasca usage and monitoring ayahuasca centers. Currently (April 2010) the use of ayahuasca is not technically legal but since it is an accepted practice of its indigenous cultures the Peruvian government is going through of the process maintaining the continuity of its culture whilst avoiding international issues.
-->

=== Other legal issues ===

Ayahuasca has also stirred debate regarding intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge. In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the granting of a patent on the ayahuasca vine B. Caapi. It allowed this patent based on the assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) and the Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition) objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen "ownership" of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ciel.org/Bio/Biodiversity_Accomplishments.html |title=CIEL Biodiversity Program Accomplishments |publisher=Ciel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> 

Later that year the PTO issued a decision rejecting the patent, on the basis that the petitioners' arguments that the plant was not "distinctive or novel" were valid. However, the decision did not acknowledge the argument that the plant's religious or cultural values prohibited a patent. In 2001, after an appeal by the patent holder, the US Patent Office reinstated the patent. The law at the time did not allow a third party such as COICA to participate in that part of the reexamination process. The patent, held by US entrepreneur Loren Miller, expired in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Ayahuasca Patent Case |url=http://www.ciel.org/Bio/ayahuascapatentcase.html |work=Our Programs: Biodiversity |publisher=The Centre for International Environmental Law |accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref>
