In a [[Culture|cultural]] sense, it refers to the [[cultural community|worldwide community]] of [[Christian]]s, adherents of [[Christianity]]. In its  historical  sense, the term usually refers to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Early Modern period|early modern]] period, during which the Christian world represented a [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] power juxtaposed with both [[paganism]] and especially the [[Muslim conquests|military threat]] of the [[Ummah|Muslim world]].

In a contemporary sense, it may simply refer  collectively to [[Christian majority countries]] or countries in which Christianity dominates<ref name="MWChristendom">See [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Christendom Merriam-Webster.com : dictionary, "Christendom"]</ref> or nations in which Christianity is the established religion.

==Terminology and usage==

{{refimprove|section|date=February 2013}}
The term ''cristendom'' existed in [[Old English]], but it had the sense now taken by ''[[Christianity]]'' (as is still the case with the cognate Dutch ''christendom'' and German ''Christentum''). 
The current sense of the word of "lands where Christianity is the dominant religion" emerges in [[Late Middle English]] (by c. 1400). This semantic development happened independently in the languages of late medieval Europe, which leads to the [[false friend|confusing semantics]] of English ''Christendom'' equalling German ''Christenheit'', French ''chrétienté'' vs. English ''Christianity'' equalling German ''Christentum'', French ''christianisme''. The reason is the increasing fragmentation of Western Christianity at that time both in theological and in political respect. 
"Christendom" as a geopolitical term is thus meaningful in the context of the [[Middle Ages]], and arguably during the [[European wars of religion]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]. 

The ''Christian world'' is also known collectively as the '''''Corpus Christianum''''', a  translated as ''the Christian body'', meaning the community of all Christians. The Christian polity, embodying a less secular meaning, can be compatible with the idea of both a religious and a temporal body: ''Corpus Christianum''. The ''Corpus Christianum'' can be seen as a Christian equivalent of the Muslim ''[[Ummah]]''. 
<!--The ''[[Kingdom of God]]'' is also frequently used, denoting that the Christian world is within (or among) people.<ref>Kingdom is within: "The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, ‘See here!’ or ‘See there!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is within [or among] you." {{bibleverse||Luke|17:20-21|NIV}}</ref>
-->

The word "Christendom" is also used with its other meaning to [[Framing (social sciences)|frame-true Christianity]].{{clarify|date=February 2013}} A more secular meaning can denote that the term ''Christendom'' refers to Christians considered as a group, the "'''Political Christian World'''", as an informal{{clarify|date=February 2013}} [[cultural hegemony]] that Christianity has traditionally enjoyed in the [[Western world|West]]. 
In its most broad term, it refers to the world's Christian majority countries, which, share little in common aside from the predominance of the faith. Unlike the Muslim world, which has a geo-political and cultural definition that provides a primary identifier for a large swath of the world, Christendom is more complex.{{dubious|date=February 2013}}
It may be a cultural notion, but has very little weight in international discourse; very few political observers really discuss Christendom, while the Muslim World tends to comprise a civilization in itself.
For example, the Americas and Europe are considered part of Christendom, but this region is further subdivided into the West (representing the North Atlantic) and [[Latin America]].  It is also less geographically cohesive than the Muslim world, which stretches almost continuously from [[North Africa]] to [[South Asia]].

More detailed versions place [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] at the center of the world.]]

In the beginning of Christendom, early Christianity was a religion spread in the Greek/Roman world and beyond as a 1st-century [[Judaism|Jewish]] sect,<ref>{{bibleref|Acts|3:1}}; {{bibleref|Acts|5:27–42}}; {{bibleref|Acts|21:18–26}}; {{bibleref|Acts|24:5}}; {{bibleref|Acts|24:14}}; {{bibleref|Acts|28:22}}; {{bibleref|Romans|1:16}}; Tacitus, ''Annales'' xv 44; Josephus ''Antiquities'' xviii 3; Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience Volume II'' chapter 5; ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'' page 158.</ref> which historians refer to as [[Jewish Christianity]]. It may be divided into two distinct phases: the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]], when the first apostles were alive and organising the Church, and the [[post-apostolic period]], when an early [[Historical episcopate|episcopal structure]] developed, whereby bishoprics were governed by [[bishops]] (overseers).

The post-apostolic period concerns the time roughly after the death of the apostles when bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations. The earliest recorded use of the terms ''[[Christianity]]'' (Greek {{lang|grc|Χριστιανισμός}}) and ''[[Catholic]]'' (Greek {{lang|grc|καθολικός}}), dates to this period, the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], attributed to [[Ignatius of Antioch]] ''c.'' 107.<ref>Walter Bauer, ''Greek-English Lexicon''; [[Ignatius of Antioch]] [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-magnesians-roberts.html Letter to the Magnesians] 10, Letter to the Romans ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01–19.htm#P1838_311890 Roberts-Donaldson tr.], [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-romans-lightfoot.html Lightfoot tr.], [http://www.ccel.org/l/lake/fathers/ignatius-romans.htm Greek text]). However, an [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-romans-roberts.html edition] presented on some websites, one that otherwise corresponds exactly with the Roberts-Donaldson translation, renders this passage to the interpolated inauthentic longer recension of Ignatius's letters, which does not contain the word "Christianity."</ref> Early Christendom would close at the end of [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|imperial persecution of Christians]] after the ascension of [[Constantine the Great]] and the [[Edict of Milan]] in AD&nbsp;313 and the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325.

"Christendom" has referred to the [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] notion of the ''Christian world'' as a [[sociopolitical]] [[polity]]. In essence, the earliest vision of Christendom was a vision of a Christian [[theocracy]], a [[government]] founded upon and upholding [[Christian values]], whose institutions are spread through and over with [[Christian doctrine]]. In this period, members of the Christian [[clergy]] wield [[political authority]]. The specific relationship between the [[political leader]]s and the clergy varied but, in theory, the national and political divisions were at times subsumed under the leadership of the [[Christian Church|church as an institution]]. This [[Church and state in medieval Europe|model of church-state relations]] was accepted by various [[Church hierarchy|Church leader]]s and political leaders in European history.<ref>{{cite book| last = Chisholm| first = Hugh| title = The Encyclopedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information| url = http://books.google.com/?id=xTcNxHKO59MC&pg=PA700| year = 1911| publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica Company| page = 700 }}</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}}

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] [[Decline of the Roman Empire|disintegrated]] into [[feudalism|feudal kingdom]]s and [[principalities]], the concept of Christendom changed as the [[Western Christianity#History of Western Christianity|western church became one of five patriarchal of the Pentarchy]] and the Christians of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] developed.

After the [[collapse of Charlemagne's empire]], the southern remnants of the Holy Roman Empire became a collection of [[papal states|states loosely connected]] to the [[Holy See|Holy See of Rome]]. Tensions between [[Pope Innocent III]] and secular rulers ran high, as the pontiff exerted control over their temporal counterparts in the west and vice versa. The pontificate of Innocent III is considered the height of temporal power of the papacy. The ''Corpus Christianum'' described the then current notion of the [[community]] of all [[Christian]]s united under the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The community was to be guided by Christian values in its politics, economics and social life.<ref>Shaping a global theological mind By Darren C. Marks. Page 45</ref> Its legal basis was the ''[[Canon Law|corpus iuris canonica]]'' (body of canon law).<ref>Somerville, R. (1998).

In the East, Christendom became more defined as the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s gradual loss of territory to an [[Muslim conquests|expanding Islam]] and the [[muslim conquest of Persia]]. This caused Christianity to become important to the Byzantine identity. After the [[East-West Schism]] which divided the Church religiously, there had been the notion of a ''universal Christendom'' that included the East and the West. The Byzantines divided themselves in the [[Byzantine rite]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|eastern rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The political reunion with the west, after the East-West schism, was put asunder by the [[Fourth Crusade]] when [[Crusades|Crusaders]] [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|conquered the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] and hastened the [[decline of the Byzantine Empire]] on the [[Byzantine–Ottoman Wars|path to its destruction]].<ref>Mango, C.

The [[Catholic Church]]'s peak of authority over all European Christians and their common endeavours of the Christian community — for example, the [[Crusades]], the fight against the [[Moors]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and against the [[Ottomans]] in the [[Balkans]] — helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of Europe's deep political divisions. But this authority was also sometimes abused, and fostered the [[Inquisition]] and [[Anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]], to root out divergent elements and create a religiously uniform community.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Ultimately, the Inquisition was done away with by order of the Pope [[Innocent III]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Inquisition}}</ref>

[[File:Grand schisme 1378-1417.svg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Western Schism]]: red is support for Avignon, blue for Rome]]
Christendom ultimately was led into specific crisis in the [[late Middle Ages]], when the [[monarch|kings]] of France managed to establish a French national church during the 14th century and the papacy became ever more aligned with the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]]. Known as the [[Western Schism]], western Christendom was a split between three men, who were driven by politics rather than any real theological disagreement for simultaneously claiming to be the true pope. The [[Avignon Papacy]] developed a reputation of corruption that estranged major parts of Western Christendom. The Avignon schism was ended by the [[Council of Constance]].<ref>Stump, P. H. (1994). The reforms of the Council of Constance, 1414-1418. Leiden: E.J. Brill</ref>

Before the modern period, Christendom was in a general crisis at the time of the [[Renaissance Papacy|Renaissance Popes]] because of the moral laxity of these pontiffs and their willingness to seek and rely on temporal power as secular rulers did. Many in the Catholic Church's hierarchy in the Renaissance became increasingly entangled with insatiable greed for material wealth and temporal power, which led to many reform movements, some merely wanting a moral reformation of the Church's clergy, while others repudiated the Church and separated from it in order to form new sects. The [[Italian Renaissance]] produced ideas or institutions by which men living in society could be held together in harmony. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] (The [[Book of the Courtier]]) laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady, while [[Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "la verita effetuale delle cose" — the actual truth of things — in [[The Prince]], composed, humanist style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Some Protestant movements grew up along lines of [[mysticism]] or [[renaissance humanism]] ([[cf.]] [[Erasmus]]). The Catholic Church fell into general neglect under the Renaissance Popes, whose inability to govern the Church properly set the climate for what would ultimately become the Protestant Reformation.<ref>The Cambridge Modern History.

Developments in western philosophy and European events brought change to the notion of the ''Corpus Christianum''. The [[Hundred Years' War]] accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralized state. The rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|strong, centralized monarchies]]<ref>This was presaging the modern [[nation-state]]</ref> denoted the European transition from [[feudalism]] to [[capitalism]]. By the end of the Hundred Years' War, both France and England were able to raise enough money through taxation to create independent standing armies. In the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] took the crown of [[England]]. His heir, the [[Absolutism (European history)|absolute]] king [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] establishing the [[Church of England|English church]].<ref>[http://anglican.org/church/ChurchHistory.html The Anglican Domain: Church History]</ref>

In [[modern history]], [[the Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed a change in the ''Corpus Christianum''. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555 officially ended the idea among secular leaders that all Christians must be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' ("whose the region is, his religion") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established  with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian hegemony in the territories of the Holy Roman Empire, despite the Catholic Church's doctrine that it alone is the one true Church founded by Christ.
Subsequently, each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established one were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.

The [[European wars of religion]] are usually taken to have ended with the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), or arguably, including the [[Nine Years' War]] and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in this period, with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713.
In the 18th century, the focus shifts away from religious conflicts, either between Christian factions or against the external threat of Islam. 
The [[European Miracle]], the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the formation of the great [[Colonial empire]] together with the beginning [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] mark the end of the geopolitical "history of Christendom". Instead the focus of western history shifts to the development of the [[nation-state]], accompanied by increasing [[History of atheism|atheism]] and [[secularism]], culminating with the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the 19th century.

===Art and literature===

====Writings and poetry====
{{Main|Christian literature|Christian poetry}}
[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any [[poetry]] that contains [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the [[Bible]], while others provide [[allegory]].

====Supplemental arts====
{{Main|Christian art}}
[[Christian art]] is art produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of Christianity. Virtually all Christian groupings use or have used art to some extent. The prominence of art and the media, style, and representations change; however, the unifying theme is ultimately the representation of the life and times of [[Jesus]] and in some cases the [[Old Testament]]. Depictions of saints are also common, especially in [[Anglicanism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

====Illumination====
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|Picture of [[Christ in Majesty]] contained in an illuminated manuscript.]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in [[Ireland]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Italy]]. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

====Iconography====
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}
[[Image:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], [[Bulgaria]]).]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] or one of the [[Eastern Catholic Church|Eastern Rites of the Catholic Church]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}</ref> In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. [[Christianity]] has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]]. They were particularly

{{See also|Saint symbology|Iconography}}

====Architecture====
{{Main|Christian architecture}}

[[Image:Gotic3d2.jpg|thumb|The structure of a typical Gothic cathedral.]]
[[Christian architecture]] encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Christianity to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures in Christian culture.

Buildings were at first adapted from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as concrete, as well as simpler styles has had its effect upon the design of churches and arguably the flow of influence has been reversed. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant period of transformation for Christian architecture in the west was the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedral]]. In the east, [[Byzantine architecture]] was a continuation of [[Roman architecture]].

=== Philosophy ===
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}

[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of [[philosophy]] with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means "that [which] belongs to the school", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval [[university|universities]] c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the [[philosophy]] of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

==Christian civilization==

=== Medieval conditions ===
{{Main|Medieval science|Medieval technology|List of Christian thinkers in science}}
The [[Byzantine Empire]], which was the most sophisticated culture during antiquity, suffered under [[muslim conquests]] limiting its scientific prowess during the Medieval period. Christian [[Western Europe]] had suffered a catastrophic loss of knowledge following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. But thanks to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] scholars such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Buridan]], the West carried on at least the spirit of scientific inquiry which would later lead to Europe's taking the lead in science during the [[Scientific Revolution]] using [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translations of medieval works]].

[[Medieval technology]] refers to the technology used in medieval Europe under Christian rule. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.<ref>Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality : Quantification in Western Europe, 1250–1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.</ref> The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]] and the [[astrolabe]], the invention of [[spectacles]], and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques, [[agriculture]] in general, [[clock]]s, and [[ship]]s. The latter advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Exploration]]. The development of water mills was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone, probably derived from [[Roman technology]]. By the time of the [[Domesday Book]], most large villages in [[Great Britain|Britain]] had mills. They also were widely used in [[mining]], as described by [[Georg Agricola]] in [[De Re Metallica]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

Significant in this respect were advances within the fields of [[navigation]]. The [[compass]] and [[astrolabe]] along with advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the [[Ocean|World Oceans]] and thus domination of the worlds economic trade. [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s [[printing press]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience.

===Renaissance innovations===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance technology}}
During the [[Renaissance]], great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, math, manufacturing, and engineering. The rediscovery of ancient scientific texts was accelerated after the Fall of Constantinople, and the invention of [[printing]] which would democratize learning and allow a faster propagation of new ideas. ''[[Renaissance technology]]'' is the set of artifacts and customs, spanning roughly the 14th through the 16th century. The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspectivity]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Draw-books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.

[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement. The ''Scientific Renaissance'' was the early phase of the Scientific Revolution. In the two-phase model of [[early modern]] science: a ''Scientific Renaissance'' of the 15th and 16th centuries, focused on the restoration of the natural knowledge of the ancients; and a ''Scientific Revolution'' of the 17th century, when scientists shifted from recovery to innovation.

===Number of adherents===
{{Main|Christianity by country}}
The estimated number of [[Christian]]s in the world ranges from 1.5 billion<ref name="Adherents.com Christians">{{wayback|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_173.html Adherents.com|title=Adherents.com Christians: Number of Christians in the world|date=20080404200800}}</ref> to 2.2 billion people.<ref name="Adherents.com Christians"/><ref name="Global Christianity">[http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Global-Christianity-exec.aspx Global Christianity]</ref> Composed of around 34,000 different [[Christian denominations|denominations]],{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Christianity]] is the world's largest [[religion]].<ref name="Adherents - Religion Sizes">{{cite web|url = http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html| title = Major Religions Ranked by Size|publisher = Adherents|accessdate = 2007-12-31}}</ref> Christians have composed about 33 percent of the world's [[population]] for around 100 years.

===Notable Christian organizations===
A [[religious order]] is a lineage of communities and organizations of people who live in some way set apart from society in accordance with their specific religious devotion, usually characterized by the principles of its founder's religious practice. In contrast, the term [[Holy Orders]] is used by many Christian churches to refer to ordination or to a group of individuals who are set apart for a special role or ministry. Historically, the word "order" designated an established civil body or corporation with a hierarchy, and ordinatio meant legal incorporation into an ordo. The word "holy" refers to the Church. In context, therefore, a holy order is set apart for ministry in the Church. Religious orders are composed of initiates (laity) and, in some traditions, ordained clergies.

Various organizations include:
* In the Roman Catholic Church, [[religious institute]]s and [[secular institute]]s are the major forms of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]], similar to which are [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]]. They are organisations of laity and/or clergy who live a common life under the guidance of a fixed rule and the leadership of a superior. (ed., see [[:Category:Roman Catholic orders and societies]] for a particular listing.)
* [[Anglican religious order]]s are communities of laity and/or clergy in the Anglican churches who live under a common rule of life. (ed., see [[:Category:Anglican organizations]] for a particular listing)

==Christianity law and ethics==

===Church and state framing===
{{Main|Canon law|Christian ethics}}
Within the framework of Christianity, there are at least three possible definitions for Church law. One is the Torah/Mosaic Law (from what Christians consider to be the [[Old Testament]]) also called [[Divine Law]] or [[Biblical law]]. Another is the instructions of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] in the [[Gospel]] (sometimes referred to as [[the Law of Christ]] or the [[New Commandment]] or the [[New Covenant]]). A third is [[canon law]] which is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]] of churches.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Canon law}}</ref> The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[ecumenical council|council]] (From [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / κανών, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

[[Christian ethics]] in general has tended to stress the need for [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of human weakness and developed while [[Early Christians]] were subjects of the [[Roman Empire]]. From the time Nero blamed Christians for setting Rome ablaze (64 AD) until Galarius (311 AD), persecutions against Christians erupted periodically. Consequently, Early Christian ethics included discussions of how believers should relate to Roman authority and to the empire.

Under the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] (312-337), Christianity became a legal religion. While some scholars debate whether Constantine's conversion to Christianity was authentic or simply matter of political expediency, [[Edict of Milan|Constantine's decree]] made the empire safe for Christian practice and belief. Consequently, issues of Christian doctrine, ethics and church practice were debated openly, see for example the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]]. By the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395), Christianity had become the [[state religion]] of the empire. With Christianity in power, ethical concerns broaden and included discussions of the proper role of the state.

[[Render unto Caesar…]] is the beginning of a phrase attributed to Jesus in the [[synoptic gospel]]s which reads in full, "''Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s''". This phrase has become a widely quoted summary of the relationship between Christianity and secular authority. The gospels say that when Jesus gave his response, his interrogators "marvelled, and left him, and went their way." Time has not resolved an ambiguity in this phrase, and people continue to interpret this passage to support various positions that are poles apart. The traditional division, carefully determined, in Christian thought is the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[Christian Church|church]] have separate [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].

[[Thomas Aquinas]] thoroughly discussed that ''human law'' is [[positive law]] which means that it is [[natural law]] applied by governments to societies. All human laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law was in a sense no law at all. At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what the law said in the first place. This could result in some tension.<ref>Burns, "Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law."</ref> Late ecclesiastical writers followed in his footsteps.

====Democratic ideology====
{{Main|Christian democracy}}
[[Christian democracy]] is a political ideology that seeks to apply Christian principles to public policy. It emerged in 19th-century Europe, largely under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]]. In a number of countries, the democracy's Christian ethos has been diluted by [[secularisation]]. In practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[social conservatism|conservative]] on cultural, social and moral issues and [[progressivism|progressive]] on fiscal and economic issues. In places, where their opponents have traditionally been secularist [[socialism|socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], Christian democratic parties are moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], whereas in other cultural and political environments they can lean to the left.

===Women roles===
{{Main|Women in Christianity}}
Attitudes and beliefs about the roles and responsibilities of [[women in Christianity]] vary considerably today as they have throughout the last two millennia — evolving along with or counter to the societies in which Christians have lived. The Bible and Christianity historically have been interpreted as excluding women from church leadership and placing them in submissive roles in marriage. Male leadership has been assumed in the church and within marriage, society and government.<ref name="Blevins">Blevins, Carolyn DeArmond, ''Women in Christian History: A Bibliography.'' Macon, Georgia: Mercer Univ Press, 1995. ISBN 0-86554-493-X</ref>

Some contemporary writers describe the role of women in the life of the church as having been downplayed, overlooked, or denied throughout much of Christian history. [[Paradigm shift]]s in gender roles in society and also many churches has inspired reevaluation by many Christians of some long-held attitudes to the contrary. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarians]] have increasingly argued for equal roles for men and women in [[Christian views of marriage|marriage]], as well as for the [[ordination of women]] to the [[clergy]]. Contemporary conservatives meanwhile have reasserted what has been termed a "[[Complementarianism|complementarian]]" position, promoting the traditional belief that the [[Bible]] ordains different roles and responsibilities for women and men in the Church and family.

==Major Christian denominations==

The different width of the lines (thickest for "Protestantism" and thinnest for "Oriental Orthodox" and "Nestorians") is without objective significance.

A [[Christian denomination]] is an identifiable religious body under a common name, structure, and doctrine within Christianity. Worldwide, Christians are divided, often along ethnic and linguistic lines, into separate churches and traditions. Various denominations<!--Which other denominations? Only seeing JW sources here-->, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, make particular distinctions in their literature.<ref>{{anchor|JW}}While the generally-accepted definition of "Christendom" is sometimes intended, ''[[The Watchtower]]'' and other [[List of Watch Tower Society publications|publications of Jehovah's Witnesses]] more often intend the term to indicate merely ''professed Christianity'' as distinct from ''true Christianity''. Although they self-identify as Christian, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] claim to be no part of "Christendom". They explain their use of the term:<blockquote>"What is the definition of “Christendom” as used in Watch Tower publications?<br>Most often the term “Christendom” is used in the Society’s publications in the more restricted way in which the word is first defined in the dictionary: “Christianity”; actually, professed Christianity, in contrast to the true Christianity of the Bible. This focuses primarily on the religious aspects. However, the word is sometimes used in our publications in its enlarged second meaning: “the portion of the world in which Christianity prevails.” ("Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1981, page 31)
</blockquote> For details, see "True Christianity Is Flourishing", The Watchtower, March 1, 2004, page 7 [http://www.watchtower.org/e/20040301/article_02.htm As retrieved 2009-04-09], "While Christendom's theologians, missionaries, and churchgoers continue to grapple with the gathering storm of controversy in their churches, true Christianity is flourishing worldwide. Indeed, true Christians [...] invite you to join Jehovah's Witnesses in united Christian worship of the only true God, Jehovah."; and Watchtower, April 1, 2001, page 18, "Equally striking is the contrast between Jehovah’s Witnesses and Christendom today. [...] The very features that Christendom lacks abound among Jehovah’s Witnesses!"; Also The Watchtower, April 15, 1962, page 229, "It is out of date to define Christendom as meaning Christianity. True Christians today do not confuse Christendom with Christianity or make them identical."
</ref> Technically, divisions between one group and another are defined by [[Ecclesiology|church doctrine]] and [[church authority]]. Centering on language of ''professed Christianity'' and ''true Christianity'', issues that separate one group of followers of [[Jesus]] from another include:
* [[Apostolic succession]],
* [[Biblical authority]],
* [[Biblical criticism]],
* [[Biblical inerrancy]],
* [[Biblical infallibility]],
* [[Biblical inspiration]],
* [[Biblical interpretation]],
* [[Papal primacy]], and
* [[christian views of Jesus|Views of Jesus]] ([[Christology]]).

Christianity is composed of, but not limited to, five major branches of Churches: [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and [[Old Catholicism]]. Some listings include Anglicans among Protestants while others list the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox separately. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (Nestorians) and the Old Catholic churches are also distinct Christian bodies of historic importance, but much smaller in adherents and geographic scope. Each of these five branches has important subdivisions. Because the Protestant subdivisions do not maintain a common theology or earthly leadership, they are far more distinct than the subdivisions of the other four groupings. ''Denomination'' typically refers to one of the many Christian groupings including each of the multitude of Protestant subdivisions.

In Christendom, the largest denominations are:
# [[Roman Catholicism]]&nbsp;– 1.2 billion
# [[Protestantism]]&nbsp;– 540 million
# [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]&nbsp;– 300 million
# [[Anglicanism]]&nbsp;– 115 million
# [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]&nbsp;– 75 million
# [[Nontrinitarianism]]&nbsp;– 26 million
# [[Nestorianism]]&nbsp;– 1 million
# [[Old Catholicism]]&nbsp;- 0.4 million

==Christendom and other beliefs==
{{main|Christianity and other religions}}
In the interaction between Christendom and other belief systems,<ref>These belief systems include various non-Christian [[life stance]]s, [[world view]]s, [[ideology|ideologies]], [[philosophy|philosophies]], and religions.</ref> men and women when not at war with their neighbors have always made an effort to understand [[Other|the Other]] (not least because understanding is a strategy for defense, but also because for as long as there is dialogue wars are delayed). Such interactions have led to various [[interfaith dialogue]] events. History records many examples of interfaith initiatives and dialogue throughout the ages. In the field of [[comparative religion]], the interactions connects fundamental ideas in Christianity with similar ones in other religions. [[Christianity and other religions]] appear to share some elements. Regarding Christianity's relationship with other world beliefs, Christianity and other beliefs have differences and similarities in connection with each other.

===Judaic world===
{{Main|Christianity and Judaism}}
[[File:Jewry.PNG|thumb|222px|Global distribution of Jewish in 2006; percentage of the top nation (Israel - 5,313,800).]]
Although [[Christianity and Judaism]] share historical roots, these two religions diverge in fundamental ways. Though [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition emphasizes continuities and convergences between the two religions, there are many other areas in which the faiths diverge.

===Muslim world===

[[File:World Muslim Population Pew Forum.png|thumb|222px|Percentage adherents of Islam]]
[[Christianity and Islam]] share their origins in the [[Abrahamic tradition]], as well as Judaism. [[Islam]] accepts Jesus and his miracles and other aspects of Christianity as part of its [[faith]] - with some differences in interpretation, and rejects other aspects.

===Hindu world===
{{Main|Hinduism and other religions}}
[[Image:Hindu distribution.png|right|222px|thumb|Hinduism - Percentage by country]]
The declaration [[Nostra Aetate]] officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus. It has promoted common values between religions. There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population and is the largest Christian Church within India.

===Secular world===
{{Main|Secular world|Humanism}}
[[File:Irreligion map.png|thumb|222px|[[Atheists]], [[agnostics]] and [[nonreligious]], by the Dentsu Institute (2006) and Zuckerman (2005)]]
[[Irreligion]] is an absence, indifference or hostility to religion. [[Secularism]], in one sense, may assert the right to be free to choose religious beliefs and non-beliefs. In its most prominent form, secularism is critical of religious orthodoxy and asserts that real [[reason]] and [[scientific method]] are better ways to understand reality than religious beliefs. [[Humanism]] refers to a philosophy centered on humankind. Much of Humanism's life stance upholds human reason, ethics, and justice, and rejects [[supernaturalism]] ([[Christian mythology]]).
