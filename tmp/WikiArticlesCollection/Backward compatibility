In [[telecommunications]] and [[computing]], a product or technology is '''backward''' or '''downward compatible''' if it can work with [[Input/output|input]] generated by an ''older'' product or technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/computer/backward-compatible|title=backward compatible - Computer definition|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=2009-10-18|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kcaFJC8g|archivedate=2009-10-18}}</ref> If products designed for the new standard can receive, read, view or play older standards or formats, then the product is said to be backward-compatible; examples of such a standard include data formats and [[Communications protocol|communication protocols]]. Modifications to a system that do not allow backward compatibility are sometimes called "[[wikt:breaking change|breaking changes]]."

The reverse is [[forward compatibility]], which implies that old devices allow (or expected to allow) data formats generated by ''new'' (or future) devices, perhaps without supporting all new features. A standard supports forward compatibility if older product versions can receive, read, view, or play the new standard.

For example, the introduction of FM stereo transmission allowed backward compatibility since new FM radio receivers could receive [[monaural]] signals generated by old transmitters. It also allowed forward compatibility, since old monaural FM radio receivers could still receive a signal from a new transmitter.

In programming languages, backward compatibility refers to the ability of a compiler for version ''N'' of the language to accept programs or data that worked under version ''N'' - 1.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Vzy8ap4YYW8C&pg=PA123&dq=forward+compatibility&lr=&hl=sv Michael Kay, ''XSLT 2.0 Programmer's Reference'', Wiley Default, 2004 ISBN 0-7645-6909-0, ISBN 978-0-7645-6909-8]</ref>  By this definition, if previous versions (''N'' - 1, ''N'' - 2, etc.) were also backward compatible, which is often the case, then, by induction, version ''N'' will also accept input that worked under any prior version after, and including, the latest one that was not backward compatible. However, in practice, features are often [[Deprecation|deprecated]] and support is dropped in a later release, which is yet thought of as backward compatible.

In other contexts, a product or a technology is said to be backward compatible when it is able to fully take the place of an older product, by inter-operating with products that were designed for the older product.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCPWYFoWaMIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=compatibility&hl=sv#PPA33,M1 {{cite book|title=Designing with Web Standards|author=Jeffrey Zeldman|year=2006|publisher=Peachpit Press|isbn=0-321-38555-1}}]</ref> {{Request quotation|date=December 2008}}

A data format is also said to be backward compatible with its predecessor if every message or file that is valid under the old format is also valid, and retains its meaning, under the new.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/DesignGuide/compatibility.html|title=Backwards Compatibility|author=Bert Bos}}</ref>

==Description==
Backward compatibility is a relationship between two components, rather than being an attribute of just one of them. More generally, a new component is said to be backward compatible if it provides all of the functionality of the old component.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

''Backward'' compatibility is the special case of compatibility in which the new component has a direct historical ancestral relationship with the old component. If this special relationship does not exist then it not usually spoken of as "backward" compatibility but is instead just "compatible"&mdash;a consistent interface allowing [[interoperability]] between components and products that were each developed separately.

In the case of a program that creates document files, a new version of that program ("v2") is said to be backward compatible with the old version of the program ("v1") when it can both read and write documents that work with v1. Everything that v1 could do must also be possible with v2, including saving documents that can be read by v1 (which is something that v1 could do.)

If a newer software version cannot save files that can be read by the older version, it is not backward compatible with the older version, although it may provide an irreversible [[upgrade]] capability for the old files. This situation has often been used strategically by software vendors to force customers to purchase upgrades since, over time, the number of data files usable by an old version diminishes at a rate proportional to the number of other customers that have upgraded (assuming that all customers generate files at the same the average rate.)

Levels of compatibility vary. In software, ''[[Binary code compatibility|binary compatibility]]'' and ''[[Source code compatibility|source compatibility]]'' are distinguishable. Binary compatibility means that programs can work correctly with the new version of this library without requiring [[compiler|recompilation]]. Source compatibility requires recompilation but no changes to the source code.

Many platforms rely on [[Emulator|emulation]], the simulation of an older platform in software, to achieve backward compatibility.

==Bugwards compatible==
If a newer system is attempting to achieve integration with an older system which has known flaws (or "[[Software bug|bugs]]"), then the new system may be referred to as [[bug compatibility|bug-compatible]] or "bugwards-compatible".<ref>{{citation|url=http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#bugwards-compatible|title=Jargon Scout|author=Keith Dawson}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/svg-developers/message/7176|title=bugwards compatibility, XHTML, embed|author=Tobias Reif}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/autoconf/Autoconf-2_002e13.html|title=Autoconf 2.13}}</ref>

==Examples==
* The [[NTSC]] color broadcast system was engineered by [[RCA]] to be backward compatible with [[black-and-white]] NTSC television sets.
* Most [[DVD|DVD drives]] are able to play standard [[CD]]s.
* Most [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players can also play standard DVDs and CDs (although this feature is not compulsory in the Blu-ray standard).
* Numerous video game consoles are backward compatible and are able to play the games created for predecessor consoles:
** The [[Atari 7800]] is backward compatible with almost all [[Atari 2600]] games.
** Original versions of the [[Nintendo Wii]] is fully backwards compatible with all [[Nintendo Gamecube]] games and accessories but the Wii Family Edition eliminated backwards-compatibility to the Gamecube.
** The [[Game Boy Color]] is backward compatible with all [[Game Boy]] cartridges.
** The [[Game Boy Advance]] line, except for the [[Game Boy Micro]], is backward compatible with all [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] games.
** The [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] are backward compatible with all Game Boy Advance games.
** The [[Nintendo 3DS]], the [[Nintendo 3DS XL]] and the [[Nintendo 2DS]] are backward compatible with most of the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo DSi]] software. However, the 3DS and its predecessor the DSi lack the Game Boy Advance slot found on the DS and DS Lite, causing certain titles to lose functionality when played on the systems. The ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' series is incompatible with the DSi and 3DS because of this.
** The [[Wii U]] is backward compatible with all Wii games and peripherals.
** The [[PlayStation 2]] is backward compatible with most of the original [[PlayStation]] library.
** The [[Nintendo Gamecube]] is backwards compatible with [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], and [[Gameboy Advanced]] games (if you bought a [[GameBoy player]].)
** Initially, some [[PlayStation 3]] (20GB, 1st-gen 60 and 80GB) launch models are backward compatible with most PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games. This is provided by the inclusion of the original [[Emotion Engine]] chip that is built inside the PS2. However, subsequent models removed this and the "Graphics Synthesizer" GPU due to skyrocketing costs, thus removing support for disc versions of PS2 titles. All subsequent Playstation 3 models, such as the [[Playstation 3]] Super Slim model, support disc versions of PS1 titles but not PS2 titles. All versions of the [[Playstation 3]] support download versions of PS1 and PS2 titles. 
** The [[PS Vita]] is backward compatible with [[PSP]] games, Minis, PlayStation and Neo Geo games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.
** The [[Xbox 360]] is backward compatible with some [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] games via software emulation.
** The [[Xbox One]] is backward compatibie With Some [[Xbox]] & [[Xbox 360]] games
** The [[PlayStation 4]] is rumored to provide backwards compatibility through use of the online streaming service [[Gaikai]] for games from all previous PlayStation consoles. Details of this service have not yet been revealed.
** Both the [[Atari 5200]] and [[Sega Genesis]] have cartridge adapters to provide compatibility with [[Atari 2600]] ([[Atari CX-55 Cartridge Adapter]]) and [[Sega Master System]] ([[Power Base Converter]]) games respectively.
* [[Microsoft Windows]] contains application compatibility [[shim (computing)|shims]] to make the platform compatible with most software from earlier 32-bit and 16-bit versions (e.g. ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' (circa 1991, designed for [[Windows 3.0]]) running on Windows Vista).
* The [[Apple-Intel architecture|Intel]] versions of [[Mac OS X]] from versions 10.4 ([[Mac OS X Tiger|Tiger]]) to 10.6 ([[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]]) have [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], a [[binary translation]] program that allows applications meant for use on PowerPC Macs to run on Apple systems that use Intel processors. (Newer OS X versions, do not contain Rosetta and thus cannot run PowerPC applications.)
* [[Microsoft Word]] 2000 was backward compatible with Word 97 because it could read and write files in Word 97 format, with the understanding that features unique to Word 2000 would not appear in Word 97. At the same time, Microsoft [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Access|Access]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]], both 2007 and 2010, are also backward compatible with their 97-2003 file formats and features in the same manner.
* Several computer [[operating system]]s have various methods of running software originally designed for older versions or other OSs:
** [[Windows NT]] and successors have various subsystems to run legacy applications. [[MS-DOS]] and [[Win16]] subsystems (only on i386) can run some applications for those platforms, and it has an [[OS/2]] subsystem for running CLI OS/2 applications.
** With the introduction of Windows 7 (Business, Ultimate, or Enterprise editions), Windows XP Mode enables full compatibility with older programs supported under Windows XP via Windows Virtual PC.
* The modern [[Nikon F-mount]] SLR camera lenses from the late 1970s - present (its design dates back to 1959) can function on the newer Nikon DSLR cameras with some limitations.
* Lenses for the [[Canon EF-mount]], introduced with the company's [[Canon EOS|EOS]] family of film SLRs in 1987 and used to this day on Canon [[Full-frame digital SLR|full-frame]] and [[APS-C#Multiplier factors|APS-H]] EOS DSLRs, can function fully on the company's [[APS-C]] DSLRs that use the [[Canon EF-S-mount]] (although their angle of view [[Crop factor|will be different]] on the smaller APS-C sensor).
* [[PCI Express]] 2.0 is backward compatible with PCI Express 1.1.
* [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) ports support devices intended for earlier versions of USB. For example, [[USB 3.0]] ports support USB 2.0 and USB 1.1 devices.
* The [[IBM 7080]] [[transistor]]ized computer was backward compatible with all models of the [[IBM 705]] [[vacuum tube]] computer.
* When [[Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling|Touch Tone]] dialing was introduced into the telephone system, the network continued to work with the existing [[Rotary_dial|rotary]] telephones, a situation that continues today.
* Telephones that used [[Pulse dialing]] were compatible with parts of the telephone network that did not yet work with tone dialing by mimicking the pulses generated by a rotary phone.  Often such phones had a switch that would change them to use touch tone.
