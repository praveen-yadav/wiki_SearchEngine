'''Alexandria''' is a city in and the [[parish seat]] of [[Rapides Parish, Louisiana]], United States.{{GR|6}} It lies on the south bank of the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] in almost the exact geographic center of the state. It is the principal city of the [[Alexandria, Louisiana metropolitan area|Alexandria metropolitan area]] (population 153,922) which encompasses all of Rapides and [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant]] parishes. Its neighboring city is [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. In 2010, the population was 47,723, an increase of 3 percent from the 2000 census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/22/2250885.html|title=2010 Census|publisher=quickfacts.census.gov|accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref>

== History ==
Located along the Red River, the city of Alexandria was originally home to a community which supported activities of the adjacent Spanish outpost of Post du Rapides. The area developed as an assemblage of traders and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north and providing a link from the south to the [[Old San Antonio Road|El Camino Real]] and then larger settlement of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], the oldest permanent settlement in the [[Louisiana Purchase]].

[[Alexander Fulton (Louisiana)|Alexander Fulton]], a [[business]]man from [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]], near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], received a land grant from Spain in 1785, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the 1790s. In 1805, Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in Fulton's honor. That same year Fulton was appointed [[coroner]] in Rapides Parish by [[Louisiana Territory|territorial]] [[governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[William C.C. Claiborne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site23.php|title=Fulton, Alexander|publisher=lahistory.org ([[Louisiana Historical Association]])|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> Alexandria was incorporated as a town in 1819 and received a [[city charter]] in 1832.<ref name="citysite">[http://cityofalexandriala.com/community/coahistory/government.htm Community]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===The Civil War in Alexandria===

In the spring of 1863, Alexandria was occupied by Union forces under the command of [[Admiral]] [[David Dixon Porter]] and General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]. Porter arrived with his gunboats on May 7. Later in the day Banks reached Alexandria with his [[cavalry]], whose members had marched 25 miles to reach the city. According to the [[historian]] [[John D. Winters]] of Louisiana Tech University, Porter disliked Banks but nevertheless turned over Alexandria to Banks and then departed to rejoin [[U.S. Grant]] at the ongoing siege of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Banks posted guards and declared [[martial law]]. Porter left behind the gunboat ''[[USS Lafayette (1848)|USS Lafayette]]'' in Alexandria and posted the ''[[USS Pittsburgh (1861)|USS Pittsburg]]'' on the [[Black River (Louisiana)|Black River]] to the northeast.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, ISBN 0-8071-0834-0, p. 235</ref>

In 1864, Admiral Porter, back in the area, and General Banks quarreled over possession of Louisiana [[cotton]]. Porter seized three hundred bales of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it "U.S.N. prize", referring to the [[United States Navy]]. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for unginned cotton. After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be ginned and baled. The sailors also seized [[molasses]] and [[wool]]. Winters writes that Porter "took all cotton wherever he found it, cotton belonging to the Confederate government, cotton belonging to the 'rebels,' and cotton belonging to 'loyal' citizens."<ref>Winters, p. 331</ref>

Winters continues: "Banks was furious with Porter when he learned that the admiral was scouring the interior for cotton. Since he had no authority to stop Porter's speculative activities, Banks could only try to beat him to the remaining cotton. Army wagons were sent out in large numbers to collect the cotton. Thousands of bales were brought in by the troops and stored for future shipment. Jealous of the abundant transportation facilities of the army, unprincipled navy men stole army wagons and teams at night, repainted the wagons, and branded the mules with navy initials, and dove deep in the country in search of cotton. . . . "<ref>Winters, pp. 331-332</ref>

The federal army made itself as comfortable as possible during its long stay in Alexandria. Winters writes that "lumber and tools were foraged, and the men busied themselves by building wooden tent floors, benches, and furniture. . . . Alexandria [was enclosed] with a zigzag line of fortifications."<ref>Winters, pp. 366-367</ref> While Banks remained in Alexandria in the spring of 1864, Porter was temporarily trapped north of the city because of the low level of the Red River, four feet instead of the needed seven feet to accommodate gunboats.<ref>Winters, pp. 367-369</ref>

Confederate citizens as a whole were most fearful of the Union. According to Winters, "most [Confederates] had never before seen a Yankee soldier [and] expected the worse from the invader. . . . 'Some cried, some cursed, some whined; and some overcome with fear, hid themselves in the woods, leaving everything to the tender mercies of the army.' Negroes were responsible for much of the plunder and pillage. Negro camp followers and officers' servants roamed the plantations and small farms without hindrance, bringing in their booty to camps each afternoon. . . . "<ref>Winters, p. 236</ref>

On May 13, 1864, when the Union decided to abandon Alexandria, the city was set afire despite General Banks' order to the contrary. Winters reports that "burning and plundering" by two Union corps, who set fire to a store on Front Street. Then "a strong wind spread the flames rapidly from one building to the next."<ref>Winters, pp. 373-374</ref> Banks later claimed that the fire "broke out in the attic of one of the buildings on the [[levee]] inhabited by either soldiers or refugees."<ref name="Winters, p. 374">Winters, p. 374</ref> Winters reports that "pandemonium reigned; frightened cows bellowed and charged through the flaming streets; squawking chickens with scorched wings tried to fly out of danger. Hundreds of women, children, and old people ran through the streets, trying to carry a few of their belongings to safety. When the heat became unbearable, they dropped their loads and fled to the levee. Thieves ran from house to house and even along the levee taking whatever they wanted from the shocked people. By noon the most congested parts of town were destroyed. An attempt to blow up a church in the path of the fire only succeeded in helping to spread the flames. . . . "<ref name="Winters, p. 374"/>

Alexandria faced the overwhelming task of rebuilding with a year of the war remaining. Prices became exorbitant; butter cost $10 a pound, bacon $5 a pound, flour $3 a pound, and a bushel of meal $10. Many of the helpless lived in the forest without food, shelter, or clothing, subsisting on [[blackberry|blackberries]]. All clothing was homespun, and shoes were mostly made of cloth.<ref>Winters, pp. 386-387</ref> While Admiral Porter expressed sympathy for the suffering Alexandria residents, he declared the "burning of Alexandria a fit termination of the unfortunate Red River expedition."<ref name="Winters, p. 374"/>

== Geography and climate ==
Alexandria is located at {{Coord|31|17|34|N|92|27|33|W|}}{{GR|1}} and has an elevation of {{convert|75|ft|1}}{{GR|3}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|27.0|sqmi|km2|1}}. 26.4 square miles (68.4&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.6 square miles (1.5&nbsp;km²) of it (2.15%) is water.

[[Image:AlexandriaRitaDamage.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexandria gas station awning damaged by [[Hurricane Rita]]]]

Alexandria is on a level plain in the center of the Louisiana [[Longleaf Pine]] [[forest]]s, in which pine is interspersed with various [[hardwood]]s. A number of small [[bayou]]s, such as Bayou Rapides, Bayou Roberts, and Hynson Bayou, meander throughout the city. In the immediate vicinity of the city, [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[alfalfa]], and garden vegetables are cultivated. 

The climate is [[humid subtropical]] with some continental influence in the winter. Summers are consistently hot and humid, whereas winters are mild, with occasional cold snaps. On average, the first freeze occurs in early to mid November and the last freeze occurs in early to mid March. The area receives plentiful rainfall year-round, with thunderstorms possible throughout the year. Some storms can be severe, especially during the spring months. Snowfall is rare, with measurable snow having occurred 25 times since 1895. The heaviest snowfall event took place February 12-13 1960 when 9.1" of snow fell. <ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/?n=climate</ref> <ref>http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lch/?n=snowclimo</ref>

Tropical storms and hurricanes do impact Alexandria from time to time, but rarely cause severe damage, unlike areas closer to the coast. In September 2005 [[Hurricane Rita]] affected Alexandria and surrounding areas, causing widespread power outages and damaging the roofs of some structures. The most recent hurricane, [[Hurricane Gustav|Gustav]], caused widespread flooding, knocked over trees and power lines leading to power outages, and damaged structures. Some low-lying Alexandria neighborhoods experienced substantial flooding from Gustav with several feet of water in houses.

Large congregations include [[Emmanuel Baptist Church (Alexandria, Louisiana)|Emmanuel Baptist Church]] downtown on Jackson Street and Calvary Baptist off Jackson Street Extension. Alexandria is headquarters too of the [[Louisiana Baptist Convention]]. A significant [[Roman Catholic]] population is also  present,<ref>[http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/Metro/0220_2000.asp The Association of Religion Data Archives | Maps & Reports]</ref> a result of the large Catholic [[Cajun|Acadian]] French population which resides in and around Alexandria, many from neighboring [[Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana|Avoyelles Parish]].

==Annual cultural events and festivals==

===Mardi Gras===
As Alexandria is at the cusp of [[Cajun]] culture's extension to the north, the city recognizes [[Mardi Gras]] as an official holiday. The annual Mardi Gras Krewes Parade – occurring on the Sunday before Mardi Gras – on Texas Avenue is a major cultural festivity in the area. Boasted as a true family oriented event, parade goers can enjoy over 20 New Orleans style floats, high school and college marching bands, as well as appearances by local celebrities. In addition to the main Sunday parade, the College Cheerleaders & Classic Cars Parade, which recently was established in 2008, takes place downtown on the Friday before Mardi Gras, the Children's Parade as well takes place downtown on the Saturday before Mardi Gras, and the Krewe of Provine Parade which occurs on [[Fat Tuesday]] itself down Coliseum Boulevard.

Cenlabration ends with a large fireworks display.

===RiverFest===
In 2002, representatives of local government, businesses, organizations, and community formed the nonprofit organization River Cities Cultural Alliance, Inc. to promote tourism and the arts through a celebration of Central Louisiana’s diverse cultural heritage.

The Bentley's heyday was during the 1940s and 1950s, when senior military officials, including [[General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], stayed for extended periods. The Bentley, which was closed on December 12, 2004, was once one of only two four-star hotels in Louisiana. The hotel was set to reopen in August 2007, in time for the 100th anniversary of its construction, but was prevented by funding issues.

== Government and politics ==

=== Local government ===

==== History ====

Following the Civil War, all public records in Alexandria had been destroyed. On September 29, 1868, the city was granted a new charter with a government consisting of a Mayor, Treasurer, and Justice of the Peace. Nine aldermen represented the four wards of the city – two from each ward and one elected at-large.

In 1912, the [[Lawrason Act]] established Alexandria municipal government in a strong mayor format, where the mayor was also the Commissioner of Public Health and Safety (Police, Fire, Sanitation). There were separate Commissioners of Streets and Parks and Finance and Utilities, elected citywide. The last to hold those positions, which ended in 1977, were Mayor [[John K. Snyder]] (1922–1993), Malcolm P. Hebert, Sr. (1926–2006), and [[Arnold Jack Rosenthal]] (1923–2010), respectively.

==== Today ====
Alexandria has a mayoral-council system of government.  The Mayor serves as the executive branch of the local government. The current Mayor – [[Jacques Roy (mayor)|Jacques Roy]] – was elected to office in November 2006, succeeding long-time mayor [[Ned Randolph|Edward Gordon "Ned" Randolph, Jr.]] Randolph had succeeded John K. Snyder.<ref>[http://www.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcpr&rqsdta=11070640 Louisiana Secretary of State Official Parish Election Results for Election Date: 11/07/06]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

The City Council serves as the legislative branch. The five districts of the city are represented on the Council; in addition there are two council members elected to serve as at-large representatives of the city.

The Alexandria  Court has a limited jurisdiction, consisting of the citizens of Wards 1, 2 and 8 in [[Rapides Parish]]. Within those boundaries the court has the power to hear and decide both criminal and civil cases, rule in civil cases and hand down judgment for punishment in criminal cases.

=== Area politics ===

Overall, the people of the Alexandria area tend to be [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]]. Even though the majority typically elects Republicans in national elections, they vote for Democrats in local elections, many of which are not contested by the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

=== United States Congressional district ===
From 1913 to 1993, Alexandria served as the seat of [[Louisiana's 8th congressional district|Louisiana's Eighth Congressional district]].  A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] seat, it was held by the [[Huey P. Long|Long family]] for nearly half of its existence, from 1953 to 1987, broken only by the two terms of [[Harold B. McSween]] and three terms of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Clyde Holloway]] of [[Forest Hill, Louisiana|Forest Hill]]. The seat was removed after the 1990 census indicated Louisiana no longer had the population to support it. The district was split among the [[Louisiana's 4th congressional district|Fourth]], [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district|Fifth]] and [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district|Sixth Congressional districts]]. Alexandria is now in the Fifth district and has been represented since 2003 by [[Rodney Alexander]], a Democrat-turned-Republican.

==Education==

===Colleges and universities===

[[Image:Louisiana College entrance gate IMG 1093.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Entrance to [[Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville]]

Situated south of the city, [[Louisiana State University at Alexandria]] (or LSUA) is a regional campus of the state's flagship university system, [[Louisiana State University]].  From its establishment in 1959, the campus offered only two-year degrees; students seeking baccalaureate degrees had to commute or move to the main campus in [[Baton Rouge]] in order to gain a four-year degree.  After 1976, students could either commute or telecommute in order to attend upper level courses, including graduate classes.  In 2002, following approval by the Louisiana State University Board of Supervisors and the [[Louisiana]] [[Board of Regents]] the Louisiana Legislature passed legislation allowing LSUA to offer baccalaureate degrees.

A four-year degree is also attainable through [[Southern Baptist]]-affiliated [[Louisiana College]] in Pineville, founded in 1906.

Alexandria also has one of the Region 6 Louisiana Technical College campuses.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===

[[Image:Menard High School, Alexandria, LA IMG 1158.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Holy Savior Menard Central High School]] on [[Louisiana Highway 28]] West]]
[[Rapides Parish School Board]] operates public schools.

Alexandria has three public high schools: [[Bolton High School (Louisiana)|Bolton High School]], [[Alexandria Senior High School]], and [[Peabody Magnet High School]]. In addition, there are two private high schools: the Roman Catholic [[Holy Savior Menard Central High School]], and Grace Christian.

The [[Renaissance Home for Youth]] west of Alexandria is a haven for youthful offenders who live in a group-home setting as an alternative to [[reform school]] or adult jail. Since the facility opened in 1973, nearly 12 thousand young people have lived at the home in search of rehabilitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://renaissancehome.org/history/|title=Renaissance: Our History|publisher=renaissancehome.org|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

Adhering to Biblical principles in every facet of learning allows the student the opportunity to see Christ in His rightful position as ruler and redeemer.

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===
Alexandria serves as the crossroads of [[Louisiana]]. To reach either [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] or [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]] from the southern portion of the state, the easiest method of travel takes the driver through Alexandria.  Likewise, if a visitor is to head from the northern portion of the state to the [[Cajun]] portions of the state ([[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]), or the greater metropolitan areas of either [[Baton Rouge]] or [[New Orleans]], the easiest method of travel involves driving down [[Interstate 49]] through Alexandria.

In addition to [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|I-49]], travelers can follow Louisiana 1 up to Alexandria from Baton Rouge and points south.  Also, Highway 167 could be taken from Opelousas north to Monroe, crossing through Alexandria at one of the few bridges over the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] in central Louisiana.  Highways 165 and 71 also link Alexandria and points south with the northern portion of the state via the OK Allen bridge.

There are possible plans for a 50-mile, 4 lane beltway to encircle Alexandria and Pineville. As of now, it is only in the planning stages of development.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kalb.com/story/14493914/beltway-to-loop-cenla-could-be-on-its-way | title = Beltway to Loop Cenla Could Be On Its way | publisher = KALB-TV News Channel 5 | date = May 5, 2011 | accessdate = October 25, 2012}}</ref>

=== Bridges ===
Three road bridges cross the Red River in the Alexandria area.  They are:

*The '''Purple Heart Memorial Bridge'''. Part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway (also referred to as the Cottingham Expressway), it connects [[Interstate 49]] to Highway 167 by crossing the Red River from downtown Alexandria to [[Pineville, Louisiana|Pineville]]. It replaced the Fulton Street Bridge and has six lanes of traffic.  Designed by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD), the bridge cost $15.9 million in federal and state funds. The northbound portion was completed in 1995, the southbound in 1998.

[[Image:Jackson St. bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|Jackson Street Bridge]]

*The '''U.S. 165 Business Bridge''' (alternatively, the '''Gillis Long Bridge''', the '''Red River Bridge''' or the '''Jackson Street Bridge''') connecting downtown Pineville with the business district in Alexandria. It is a two-lane vertical-lift bridge with a sidewalk/bikepath on either side. The bridge is named after U.S. Representative Gillis Long, who represented Louisiana's Eighth Congressional District. It was built in 1985 to replace the '''Murray Street Bridge'''.
*The '''Oscar K. Allen Bridge''' connecting Highway 165/71 on both sides of the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]]. It is a two-lane K-truss type bridge, named after Governor [[Oscar K. Allen]]. It was built in 1936 to connect Alexandria to the (former) Fort Buhlow. A new four-lane (two lanes in each direction) bridge is being built beside the aging OK Allen Bridge (appropriately named the Fort Buhlow Bridge) and should be open in mid-2013.  At that time [[US 165]] will be completely four-laned for most of its traverse of Louisiana.

Former bridges include:
*The '''Murray Street Bridge'''.  One of the first bridges in Alexandria.  A two-lane steel truss swing bridge, it decayed over time, finally being demolished in 1983.  The approach on the Alexandria side was turned into a river overlook as part of the Alexandria Levee Park.
*The '''Fulton Street Bridge'''.  Named after Fulton Street which it connected with Highway 167. Technically part of the Alexandria-Pineville Expressway, it was a four-lane steel vertical-lift bridge.  It was demolished in 1994 to make way for the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.

There are two railroad bridges over the Red River in Alexandria. One is located near the Buhlow area north of the OK Allen bridge. The other is south of the Purple Heart Memorial Bridge.

=== Mass transit ===
Regional mass transit is handled by '''ATRANS''' (Alexandria Transportation Authority).

For those leaving or arriving at the city by bus, [[Greyhound Lines]] has a terminal downtown.

=== Airports ===
Alexandria is served by the [[Alexandria International Airport (Louisiana)|Alexandria International Airport]] and the [[Esler Regional Airport]] in Pineville.

=== Rail ===
Alexandria does not have [[Amtrak]] service, nor a commuter rail system. The [[Kansas City Southern Railway|Kansas City Southern]] and the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad|Missouri Pacific]] (since absorbed by [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]]) operated train stations in the area in the early part of the 20th century but these have since closed.
