'''Saint Catherine of Siena''', [[Third Order of St. Dominic|T.O.S.D.]] (25 March 1347 in Siena – 29 April 1380 in Rome), was a [[Third order|tertiary]] of the [[Dominican Order]], and a [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] [[philosopher]] and [[theologian]]. She also worked to bring the papacy of [[Gregory XI]] back to [[Rome]] from [[Avignon Papacy|its displacement in France]], and to establish peace among the Italian city-states. Since 18 June 1866 she is one of the two [[patron saint]]s of [[Italy]], together with St. [[Francis of Assisi]].<ref name=Vatican>{{it icon}} [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/briefs/documents/hf_p-xii_brief_19390618_patroni-italia_it.html].</ref> On 3 October 1970 she was proclaimed a [[Doctor of the Church]] by [[Pope Paul VI]],<ref name=Vatican1>{{it icon}} [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19700927_it.html]</ref> and on 1 October 1999 [[Pope John Paul II]] named her as a one of the six [[patron saint]]s of [[Europe]], together with [[Benedict of Nursia]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], [[Bridget of Sweden]] and [[Edith Stein]].<ref name=Vatican2>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_01101999_co-patronesses-europe_en.html ''Proclamation of the Co-Patronesses of Europe'', Apostolic Letter, 1 October 1999].</ref><ref name=Vatican3>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:C6LwYidIAYgJ:www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_13111999_st-bridget_en.html+%22Saint+Bridget,+whom+I+recently+chose+to+proclaim+a+Co-Patroness+of+Europe,+together+with+Saint+Catherine+of+Siena+and+Saint+Teresa+Benedicta+of+the+Cross%22&hl=en ''Liturgical Feast of St. Bridget'', Homily, 13 November 1999].</ref>

== Life ==
[[File:House Catherine Siena Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The house of Saint Catherine in [[Siena]]]]

Caterina di Giacomo di Benincasa was born on 25 March 1347 in [[black death]]-ravaged [[Siena]], Italy, to Giacomo di Benincasa, a cloth dyer who ran his enterprise with the help of his sons, and Lapa Piagenti, possibly the daughter of a local poet.<ref name=gardner>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03447a.htm |title=St. Catherine of Siena |publisher=newadvent.org |accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> The house where Catherine grew up is still in existence. Lapa was about forty years old when she prematurely gave birth to twin daughters, Catherine and Giovanna. She had already borne 22 children, but half of them had died. Giovanna was handed over to a wet-nurse, and presently died, whereas Catherine was nursed by her mother, and developed into a healthy child. She was two years old when Lapa had her 25th child, another daughter named Giovanna.{{sfn| Skårderud, p.411}} As a child Catherine was so merry that the family gave her the pet name of "Euphrosyne", which is Greek for Joy and also the name of an early Christian saint.<ref name=crawley>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CATSIENA.HTM ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>

Catherine is said by her confessor and biographer [[Raymond of Capua]] [[Dominican Order|O.P.]],’s ''Life'' to have had her first vision of Christ when she was age five or six. With her brother she was on the way home from a visit to a married sister, and is said to have experienced a vision of Christ seated in glory with the Apostles Peter, Paul, and John. Raymond continues that at age seven, Catherine vowed to give her whole life to God.<ref name=crawley/><ref>Raymond of Capua, ''Legenda Major'' I, iii.</ref>

Her older sister Bonaventura died in [[childbirth]]. While tormented with sorrow, sixteen-year-old Catherine was now faced with her parents' wish that she marry Bonaventura's widower. Absolutely opposed to this, she started a massive fast, something she had learnt from Bonaventura, whose husband had not been considerate in the least. Bonaventura had changed his attitude by refusing to eat until he showed better manners. This had taught Catherine the power of fasting. She disappointed her mother by cutting off her long hair as a protest against being overly encouraged to improve her appearance in order to attract a husband.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1368 Foley O.F.M., Leonard.

Catherine would later advise Raymond of Capua to do during times of trouble what she did now as a teenager: "Build a cell inside your mind, from which you can never flee." In this inner cell she made her father into a representation of Christ, her mother Lapa into the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], and her brothers into the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]]s. Serving them humbly became an opportunity for spiritual growth. Catherine resisted the accepted course of marriage and motherhood, on the one hand, or a [[nun]]'s veil, on the other. She chose to live an active and prayerful life outside a convent’s walls following the model of the Dominicans.<ref name=bellitto>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Nov1999/feature2.asp#F5 Bellitto, Christopher M. "10 Great Catholics of the Second Millennium", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']</ref> Eventually her father gave up and permitted her to live as she pleased.

A vision of [[St. Dominic]] gave strength to Catherine, but her wish to join his Order was no comfort to Lapa, who took her daughter with her to the baths in [[Bagno Vignoni]] to improve her health. Catherine fell seriously ill with a violent rash, fever and pain, which conveniently made her mother accept her wish to join the "Mantellate", the local association of Dominican [[Third order|tertiaries]].<ref name="Siena. Available Means 2001">Catherine of Siena. Available Means. Ed. Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh, Pa.: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001. Print.</ref> Lapa went to the Sisters of the Order and persuaded them to take in her daughter. Within days, Catherine seemed entirely restored, rose from bed and donned the black and white habit of the [[Third Order of St. Dominic]]. Catherine received the habit of a Dominican [[Third Order of St. Dominic|tertiary]] from the [[friar]]s of the Order, however, only after vigorous protests from the Tertiaries themselves, who up to that point had been only widows. As a tertiary, she lived outside the convent, at home with her family like before. The Mantellate taught Catherine how to read, and she lived in almost total silence and solitude in the family home.<ref name="Siena. Available Means 2001"/>

Her custom of giving away food and clothing without asking anyone's permission cost her family significantly but she demanded nothing for herself. By staying in their midst, she could live out her rejection of them more strongly. She did not want their food, referring to the table laid for her in Heaven with her real family.{{sfn| Skårderud, pp. 412-413}} 
[[File:Giovanni di Paolo The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena,.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giovanni di Paolo]], ''The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena'']] 

In about 1368, aged twenty-one, Catherine experienced what she described in her letters as a "[[Bridal theology|Mystical Marriage]]" with [[Jesus]],{{sfn|Raymond of Capua, Life, pp. 99-101}} later a popular subject in art as the ''[[Mystic marriage of Saint Catherine]]''. "Underlining the extent to which the marriage was a fusion with Christ's physicality [...] Catherine received, not the ring of gold and jewels that her biographer reports in his bowdlerized version, but the ring of [[Holy Prepuce|Christ's foreskin]]."<ref>{{cite book | title=Holy Feast and Holy Fast.

Her early pious activities in Siena attracted a group of followers, both women and men, who gathered around her.<ref name=gardner/>

As social and political tensions mounted in Siena, Catherine found herself drawn to intervene in wider politics. She made her first journey to [[Florence]] in 1374, probably to be interviewed by the Dominican authorities at the General Chapter held in Florence in May 1374, though this is controverted (if she was interviewed, then the absence of later evidence suggests she was deemed sufficiently orthodox).<ref name=foley/>  It seems that at this time she acquired Raymond of Capua as her confessor and spiritual director.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}

After this visit, she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through "the total love for God."{{sfn|Hollister, p. 342}} In Pisa, in 1375, she used what influence she had to sway that city and [[Lucca]] away from alliance with the anti-papal league whose force was gaining momentum and strength. She also lent her enthusiasm towards promoting the launch of a new crusade. It was in Pisa in 1375 that, according to Raymond of Capua's biography, she received the stigmata (visible, at Catherine's request, only to herself.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}
{{Christian mysticism}}
Physical travel was not the only way in which Catherine made her views known. From 1375{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} onwards, she began dictating letters to various scribes.<ref name="Siena. Available Means 2001"/> These letters were intended to reach men and women of her circle, increasingly widening her audience to include figures in authority as she begged for peace between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the [[Papacy]] from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] to [[Rome]]. She carried on a long correspondence with [[Pope Gregory XI]], asking him to reform the [[clergy]] and the administration of the [[Papal States]].

Towards the end of 1375, she returned to Siena, to assist a young political prisoner, Niccolò di Tuldo, at his execution.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}<ref>Letter T273, written by Catherine to Raymond, probably in June 1375, describes the event.</ref> In June 1376 Catherine went to [[Avignon]] herself as ambassador of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] to make peace with the [[Papal States]] (on 31 March 1376 Gregory XI had placed Florence under interdict). On this issue she was unsuccessful, and was in fact disowned by the Florentine leaders, who sent ambassadors to negotiate on their own terms as soon as Catherine's work had paved the way for them.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} Catherine sent an appropriately scorching letter back to Florence in response.<ref>Letter 234 in Tommaseo's numbering.</ref> While in Avignon, Catherine also tried to convince [[Pope Gregory XI]] to return to Rome.{{sfn|Hollister, p. 343}} Gregory did indeed return his administration to Rome in January 1377; to what extent this was due to Catherine’s influence is a topic of much modern debate.<ref>See Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (Herder & Herder, 2012), p561.</ref>

Catherine returned to Siena, and spent the early months of 1377 founding a women's monastery of strict observance outside the city in the old fortress of Belcaro.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}} She spent the rest of 1377 at Rocca d'Orcia, about twenty miles from Siena, on a local mission of peace-making and preaching. During this period, in autumn 1377, she both had the experience which led to the writing of her ''Dialogue'', and learned to write herself, although she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence.<ref name=gardner/><ref>This experience is recorded in Letter 272, written to Raymond in October 1377.</ref>

Late in 1377 or early in 1378 Catherine again travelled to Florence, at the order of Gregory XI, to seek peace between Florence and Rome. Following Gregory's death in March 1378 riots, the [[revolts of the ciompi|Ciompi]], broke out in Florence on 18 June, and in the ensuing violence she was nearly assassinated. Eventually, in July 1378, peace was agreed between Florence and Rome; Catherine returned quietly to Florence.

In late November 1378, with the outbreak of the [[Western Schism]], the new Pope, [[Urban VI]], summoned her to Rome. She stayed at [[Pope Urban VI]]'s court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy, both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}}

Over the years Catherine had eaten less and less, claiming that she found no nourishment in earthly food. Instead she received the Holy Communion virtually on a daily basis. This extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood, and her confessor, Blessed Raymond, ordered her to eat properly. But Catherine claimed that she was unable to, describing her inability to eat as an ''infermità'' (illness). She would disgorge what she swallowed, and suffered severe stomach pains, which she bore with patience as another penance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} From the beginning of 1380, Catherine could neither eat nor swallow water. On February 26 she lost the use of her legs.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}} St Catherine died in Rome, on 29 April 1380, at the age of thirty-three, having suffered a stroke eight days earlier.<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book |last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ.

==Sources of her life==
There is some internal evidence of Catherine's personality, teaching and work in her nearly four hundred letters, her ''Dialogue'', and her prayers.

Much detail about her life has also, however, been drawn from the various sources written shortly after her death in order to promote her cult and canonisation. Though much of this material is heavily hagiographic, it has been an important source for historians seeking to reconstruct Catherine's life. Various sources are particularly important, especially the works of Raymond of Capua, who was Catherine's spiritual director and close friend from 1374 until her death, and himself became [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the Order in 1380. Raymond began writing what is known as the ''Legenda Major'', his ''Life'' of Catherine, in 1384, and completed it in 1395.

Another important work written after Catherine's death was ''Libellus de Supplemento'' (''Little Supplement Book''), written between 1412 and 1418 by Tommaso d'Antonio Nacci da Seine (commonly called Thomas of Siena, or Caffarini): the work is an expansion of Raymond's ''Legenda Major'' making heavy use of the notes of Catherine's first confessor, Tommaso della Fonte (notes that do not survive anywhere else). Caffarini later published a more compact account of Catherine's life, entitled the ''Legenda Minor''.

From 1411 onwards, Caffarini also co-ordinated the compiling of the ''Processus'' of Venice, the set of documents submitted as part of the process of canonisation of Catherine, which provides testimony from nearly all of Catherine's disciples. There is also an anonymous piece entitled "Miracoli della Beata Caterina" (''Miracle of Blessed Catherine''), written by an anonymous Florentine. A few other relevant pieces survive.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 2}}

==Works==
Three genres of work by Catherine survive. Many of her letters were dictated, although she herself learned to write in 1377.

Her major treatise is ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''. This was probably begun in October 1377, and was certainly finished by November 1378.Contemporaries of Catherine are united in asserting that much of the book was dictated while Catherine was in ecstasy, though it also seems possible that Catherine herself may then have re-edited many passages in the book.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 13}} It is a dialogue between a soul who "rises up" to God and God himself.

Catherine's letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature. More than 300 have survived. In her letters to the Pope, she often referred to him affectionately simply as ''Papa'' ("Pope"), instead of the formal form of address as "Holiness". Other correspondents include her various confessors, among them [[Raymond of Capua]], the kings of France and Hungary, the infamous mercenary [[John Hawkwood]], the Queen of Naples, members of the Visconti family of Milan, and numerous religious figures. Approximately one third of her letters are to women.

26 prayers of Catherine of Siena also survive, mostly composed in the last eighteen months of her life.

==Veneration==
[[File:Caterina sopra Minerva.jpg|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] of St. Catherine beneath the [[High Altar]] of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Rome]]
She was buried in the cemetery of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] which lies near the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. After miracles were reported to take place at her grave, Raymond moved her inside the [[Basilica]] of Santa Maria sopra Minerva,<ref name=grave>{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Catherine+of+Siena&GSbyrel=in&GSdyrel=in&GSob=n&GRid=19919& |title=Catherine of Siena |publisher=findagrave.com |accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> where she lies to this day.
[[File:San Domenico Siena Apr 2008 (13).JPG|thumb|left|The Chapel of Saint Catherine, Basilica of San Domenico in Siena]]
Her head however, was parted from her body and inserted in a gilt bust of [[bronze]]. This bust was later taken to Siena, and carried through that city in a procession to the Dominican church. Behind the bust walked Lapa, Catherine's mother, who lived until she was 89 years old. By then she had seen the end of the wealth and the happiness of her family, and followed most of her children and several of her grandchildren to the grave. She helped Raymond of Capua write his biography of her daughter, and said, "I think God has laid my soul athwart in my body, so that it can't get out."<ref>{{no icon}} {{cite journal |first=Finn |last=Skårderud |title=Hellig anoreksi Sult og selvskade som religiøse praksiser.

[[Pope Pius II]], himself from Siena, [[canonized]] St Catherine on 29 June 1461.<ref name=beckwith>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Apr2006/Feature1.asp Beckwith, Barbara. "St. Catherine of Siena: A Feisty Role for Sister Nancy Murray", ''St. Anthony Messenger'']</ref>

On 3 October 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]] gave Catherine the title of [[Doctor of the Church]];<ref name=Vatican1/> this title was almost simultaneously given to [[Saint Teresa of Ávila]] (27 September 1970), making them the first women to receive this honour.<ref name=beckwith/>

Initially, however, her [[feast day]] was not included in the [[Roman Calendar]]. When it was added in 1597, it was put on the day of her death, April 29; however, because this conflicted with the feast of Saint [[Peter of Verona]] (also on 29 April), Catherine's feast day was moved in 1628 to the new date of April 30.<ref>''"Calendarium Romanum"'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 91.</ref> In the 1969 revision of the [[Roman Catholic calendar of saints]], it was decided to leave the celebration of the feast of St Peter of Verona to local calendars, because he was not as well known worldwide, and Saint Catherine's feast was restored to its traditional date of April 29.<ref>{{cite book |title=Calendarium Romanum |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |year=1969 |page= 121}}</ref> Some continued to use one or other of the calendars in force in the 1628–1969 period.

===Patronage===
In his decree of 13 April 1866, Pope [[Pius IX]] declared Catherine of Siena to be a co-patroness of Rome. On 18 June 1939 [[Pope Pius XII]] named her a joint [[Patron Saint]] of [[Italy]] along with [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].<ref name=Vatican/>

On 1 October 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]] made her one of Europe's [[patron saint]]s, along with [[Edith Stein]] and [[Bridget of Sweden]].<ref name=Vatican2/><ref name=Vatican3/> She is also the patroness of the historically Catholic American woman's fraternity, [[Theta Phi Alpha]].

===Iconography===
The people of Siena wished to have St. Catherine's body. A story is told of a miracle whereby they were partially successful: Knowing that they could not smuggle her whole body out of Rome, they decided to take only her head which they placed in a bag. When stopped by the Roman guards, they prayed to St Catherine to help them, confident that she would rather have her body (or at least part thereof) in Siena. When they opened the bag to show the guards, it appeared no longer to hold her head but to be full of rose petals. Once they got back to Siena they reopened the bag and her head was visible once more. Due to this story, St Catherine is often seen holding a [[rose]].

==Legacy==
Catherine ranks high among the mystics and spiritual writers of the Church.<ref name=foley/> She remains a greatly respected figure for her spiritual writings, and political boldness to "speak truth to power"&mdash; it being exceptional for a woman, in her time period, to have had such influence in politics and on world history.
