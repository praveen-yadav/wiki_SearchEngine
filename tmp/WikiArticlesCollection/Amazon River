The '''Amazon River''' ({{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|æ|m|ə|z|ɒ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|æ|m|ə|z|ən}}; [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and {{lang-pt|'''Amazonas'''}}) in [[South America]] is generally regarded as the [[List of rivers by length|second longest]] river in the world and is by far the largest by waterflow with an average [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] of about 209,000 cubic meters per second (7,381,000 cu ft/s), greater than [[list of rivers by discharge|the next seven largest rivers combined]] (not including [[Madeira River|Madeira]] and [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]], which are [[tributaries]] of the Amazon). The Amazon, which has the largest [[drainage basin]] in the world, about {{convert|7050000|km2|sqmi}}, accounts for approximately one-fifth of the world's total river flow. The river would have the biggest [[drainage basin]] in the world even just counting Brazil, which it enters with only one-fifth of the volume that will finally be discharged into the Atlantic.<ref name="sterling">Tom Sterling: ''Der Amazonas''. Time-Life Bücher 1979, 7th German Printing, p. 19</ref><ref name=smith>{{Cite book|last= Smith |first= Nigel J.H. |title= Amazon Sweet Sea: Land, Life, and Water at the River's Mouth |year= 2003 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 978-0-292-77770-5 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=SywgnV96puYC&pg=PA1 |pages= 1–2}}</ref>

In its upper stretches, above the confluence of the Rio Negro, the Amazon is called Solimões in [[Brazil]]; however, in [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]], as well as the rest of the [[Spanish-speaking world]], the river is generally called the Amazon [[downstream]] from the [[confluence]] of the [[Marañón River|Marañón]] and [[Ucayali River|Ucayali]] rivers in Peru. The Ucayali-[[Apurímac River|Apurímac]] river system is considered the main source of the Amazon, with its main [[headstream]] being the [[Carhuasanta]] glacial stream flowing off the [[Nevado Mismi]] mountain.

The width of the Amazon is between {{convert|1.6|and|10|km|mi|1}} at low stage but expands during the [[wet season]] to {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} or more. The river enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a broad [[estuary]] about {{convert|240|km|mi}} wide. The mouth of the [[main stem]] is {{convert|80|km|mi}}.<ref name=encarta>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571466/Amazon_(river).html|title= Amazon (river)|publisher=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia|edition=2007|accessdate=12 August 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwDrOAQJ|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> Because of its vast dimensions, it is sometimes called ''The River Sea''. The [[Manaus Iranduba Bridge|first bridge in the Amazon river system]] (over the Rio Negro) opened on 10 October 2010 near [[Manaus]], Brazil.

The total volume of water of the Amazon river in a year is about 6,591 cubic kilometers (to compare, the water volume of [[Lake Baikal]] is 23,615 cubic km).

==Drainage area==
{{Main|Amazon Basin}}
The Amazon Basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of  approximately {{convert|7050000|sqkm|sqmi}}. It drains from west to east, from [[Iquitos]] in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north latitude]] to [[20th parallel south|20 degrees south latitude]]. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-[[Andes|Andean]] plateau, just a short distance from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The locals often refer to it as "El Jefe Negro", referring to an ancient god of fertility. 

The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterized by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year the river rises more than {{convert|9|m|ft}}, flooding the surrounding forests, known as ''[[Freshwater swamp forest|várzea]]'' ("flooded forests"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.<ref name=wwf>{{cite web|title= Amazon River and Flooded Forests |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] |url= http://www.nationalgeographic.com/wildworld/profiles/g200/g147.html |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> In an average [[dry season]], {{convert|110000|km2}} of land are water-covered, while in the [[wet season]], the flooded area of the Amazon Basin rises to {{convert|350000|km2}}.<ref name=guo>{{Cite book|last= Guo |first= Rongxing |title= Territorial Disputes and Resource Management: A Global Handbook |year= 2006 |publisher= Nova |isbn= 978-1-60021-445-5 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=z5Le627xQLgC&pg=PA44 |page= 44}}</ref>

The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to {{convert|300000|m3/s|cuft/s}} in the rainy season, with an average of  {{convert|209000|m3/s|cuft/s}} from 1973 to 1990.<ref>Molinier et al. http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_6/colloques2/42687.pdf</ref> The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's [[freshwater|fresh water]] entering the ocean.<ref name=wwf/> The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about {{convert|400|km|mi}} long and between {{convert|100|and|200|km|mi}} wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the [[salinity]] and altering the color of the ocean surface over an area up to {{convert|1000000|sqmi|km2}} in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.<ref name=smith/>

The Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's [[sediment]]s out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Penn |first= James R. |title= Rivers of the World |year= 2001 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |isbn= 978-1-57607-042-0 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=koacGt0fhUoC&pg=PA8 |page= 8}}</ref>

There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the [[Orinoco]] basins, the so-called [[Casiquiare canal]]. The Casiquiare is a river [[distributary]] of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]].

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon origin at Mismi.jpg|thumb|left|The Amazon originates from the Apacheta cliff in Arequipa at the [[Nevado Mismi]], marked only by a wooden cross.]]
[[File:The Source of the Amazon River.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Source of the Amazon]]

{{j|The Amazon river}} has a series of major river systems in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]], some of which flow into the [[Marañón River|Marañón]] and Ucayali, others directly into the Amazon proper. Among others, these include the following rivers: [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]], [[Caquetá River|Caquetá]], [[Vaupés River|Vaupés]], [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Guainía]], [[Morona]], [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], Nucuray, Urituyacu, [[Chambira River|Chambira]], [[Tigre River|Tigre]], [[Nanay River|Nanay]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]].

The most distant source of the Amazon was established in 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=zrodl_amaz |title=Source of the Amazon River Identificated (Jacek Palkiewicz) |publisher=Palkiewicz.com |date=19 November 1999 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> 2001,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2000/12/1221amazon.html |title=Explorers Pinpoint Source of the Amazon (National Geographic News) |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> 2007,<ref name=bbc-amazon>{{cite news|title= Amazon river 'longer than Nile' |publisher= BBC News |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6759291.stm |accessdate=3 August 2010 | date=16 June 2007}}</ref> and 2008,<ref name=inpe>{{cite web|title= Studies from INPE indicate that the Amazon River is 140&nbsp;km longer than the Nile |publisher= Brazilian National Institute for Space Research |url= http://www.inpe.br/ingles/news/news_dest29.php |accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> as a glacial stream on a snowcapped {{convert|5597|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak called [[Nevado Mismi]] in the Peruvian [[Andes]], roughly {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Lake Titicaca]] and {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Lima]]. The waters from Nevado Mismi flow into the Quebradas [[Carhuasanta]] and Apacheta, which flow into the [[Apurímac River|Río Apurímac]] which is a tributary of the Ucayali which later joins the Marañón to form the Amazon proper. While the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the ''[[Solimões]] das Águas''. Further downriver from that confluence the darkly colored waters of the Rio Negro meet the sandy colored [[Solimões|Rio Solimões]], and for over {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} these waters run side by side without mixing.

After the confluence of Apurímac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by [[floodplain]]. From this point to the Marañón, some {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the forested banks are just out of water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage. The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous [[Amazon Rainforest]].

The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the ''Solimões'' and its tributaries, are called the "Upper Amazon".
The Amazon River proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru. It is part of the border between Colombia and Perú, and it has tributaries reaching into Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia.

==Flooding==
 [[File:Amazon-river-NASA.jpg|thumb|A [[NASA]] satellite image of a flooded portion of the river]] Not all of the Amazon's tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November and may continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon.

The average depth of the Amazon between [[Manacapuru]] and [[Óbidos, Brazil|Óbidos]] has been calculated as between {{convert|20|to|26|m|ft}}. At Manacapuru the Amazon's water level is only about {{convert|24|m|ft}} above [[Sea level|mean sea level]]. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.<ref name=junk>{{Cite book|last= Junk |first= Wolfgang J. |title= The Central Amazon Floodplain: Ecology of a Pulsing System |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-540-59276-1 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=1eMWTwL4rbEC&pg=PA44 |page= 44}}</ref> In its lowermost section the Amazon's depth averages {{convert|20|to|50|m|ft}}, in some places as much as {{convert|100|m|ft}}.<ref name=whitton>{{Cite book|last= Whitton |first= B.A. |title= River Ecology |year= 1975 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-03016-9 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=q5H_1PtdvrAC&pg=PA462 |page= 462}}</ref>

The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to [[Manaus]], {{convert|1500|km|mi}} upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels of 3,000 tons or 9,000 tons<ref name=encarta/> and {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} [[Draft (hull)|draft]] can reach as far as [[Iquitos]], Peru, {{convert|3600|km|mi}} from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach {{convert|780|km|mi}} higher as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the [[Pongo de Manseriche]], just above Achual Point.

Annual flooding is caused by tidal waves called "pororoca." The waves occur in late winter at high tide, when the [[Atlantic Ocean]] overlaps into the river. The resulting waves can be up to 4 meters high and travel 13 kilometers inland.<ref>http://amazingstuff.co.uk/sport/surfing-the-pororoca-2/#.UiXxWDbIVoZ</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Manaus Encontro das aguas 10 2006 103 8x6.jpg|thumb|left|[[Meeting of Waters]] is the [[confluence]] of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] (black) and the Rio Amazonas (sandy) near [[Manaus]], Brazil.]]

At some points the river divides into [[anabranch]]es, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral [[Stream channel|channels]], all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat ''igapó'' lands, which are never more than {{convert|5|m|ft}} above low river, into many islands.

From the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills. At Óbidos, a bluff {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a [[Headlands and bays|gulf]] of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.

Only about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon Basin above Óbidos city is about {{convert|5000000|km2|sqmi}}, and, below, only about {{convert|1000000|km2|sqmi}} (around 20%), exclusive of the {{convert|1400000|km2|sqmi}} of the Tocantins basin. The [[Tocantins River]] enters the Amazon very close to its mouth.

In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about {{convert|240|km|mi}} from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as [[Monte Alegre, Pará|Monte Alegre]]. These hills are cut down to a kind of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] which lies between them and the river.

On the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to [[Santarém, Brazil|Santarém]] in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajós, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajós river valley.

==Mouth==
[[File:Amazon-river-delta-NASA.jpg|thumb|A satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, looking south]]
The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Pará and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called ''furos'' near the town of [[Breves, Brazil|Breves]]; between them lies [[Marajó]], the world's largest combined river/sea island.

If the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon [[estuary]] is some {{convert|325|km|mi}} wide.<ref name=guo/> In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of [[Pracuúba]] in the Brazilian state of [[Amapá]], to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of [[Curuçá]], in the state of [[Pará]].

A more conservative measurement excluding the Pará river estuary, from the mouth of the [[Araguari River (Amapá)|Araguari River]] to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Marajó, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over {{convert|180|km|mi}}. If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about {{convert|15|km|mi}}.

==Fauna==

===Mammals===
Along with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the ''[[boto]]'', also known as the [[Amazon river dolphin]] (''Inia geoffrensis''). It is the largest species of [[river dolphin]], and it can grow to lengths of up to {{convert|2.6|m}}. The color of its skin changes with age. It varies from gray when it is young, to pink and white as it matures. The dolphins use [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon River Dolphin|url=http://rainforest-alliance.org/kids/species-profiles/river-dolphin|publisher=Rainforest Alliance|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>  The ''boto'' is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a [[dolphin]] that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside. 
The [[tucuxi]] (''Sotalia fluviatilis''), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon Basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The [[Amazonian manatee]] (''Trichechus inunguis'') also known as "seacow" is found in the northern Amazon River Basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and an herbivore. Its population is limited to fresh water habitats and unlike other manatees, it does not venture into salt water. It is classified as vulnerable by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. 

The Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the [[giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis''). It is a member of the [[Mustelidae|weasel]] family and is the largest of its kind. Because of habitat destruction and hunting its population has dramatically decreased.

===Reptiles===
The [[anaconda]] is found in shallow waters in the Amazon Basin. One of the world's largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water, with just its nostrils above the surface. In addition to the thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles. The [[caiman]], which is related to alligators and other crocodilians, also inhabits the Amazon.

===Fish===
The Amazonian fish fauna is the center of diversity for [[Neotropical fishes]], of which more than 5,600 species are currently known<ref name="AlbertReis2011">{{cite book|author1=James S. Albert|author2=Roberto E.

The [[arapaima]], known in Brazil as the ''pirarucu'' (''[[Arapaima gigas]]''), is a South American tropical [[freshwater fish]]. It is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, reportedly with a maximum length of {{convert|3|m|ft}} and weight up to {{convert|200|kg}}.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070724-giant-fish.html Megafishes Project to Size Up Real "Loch Ness Monsters"]. ''National Geographic''.</ref> Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the [[arowana]] (or ''aruanã'' in Portuguese), such as the [[silver arowana]] (''[[Osteoglossum bicirrhosum]]''), which is also a predator and very similar to the arapaima but only reaches a length of {{convert|120|cm}}. Also present in large numbers is the notorious [[piranha]], an omnivorous fish which congregates in large schools and may attack livestock and even humans. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. However, only a few of its species are known to attack humans, most notably ''[[Pygocentrus nattereri]]'', the red-bellied piranha. The [[candirú]] are a number of general parasitic,<ref>"[http://animal.discovery.com/fish/river-monsters/candiru-catfish/ River Monsters: Candiru Catfish]". [[Animal Planet]].</ref> fresh water [[catfish]] in the family [[Trichomycteridae]]; all are native to the Amazon River.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> The [[electric eel]] (''Electrophorus electricus'') and more than 100 species of weakly electric fishes [[Gymnotiformes]] also inhabit the Amazon Basin. River stingrays ([[Potamotrygonidae]]) are also known.

===Microbiota===
Freshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, [[metagenomics]] has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river.<ref name="amazonMetagenome">{{cite journal |author=Ghai R, Rodriguez-Valera F, McMahon KD, ''et al.'' |title=Metagenomics of the water column in the pristine upper course of the Amazon river. |journal=PloS ONE |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e23785 |year=2011 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023785 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023785}}</ref> The most important microbes in the Amazon River are [[Actinobacteria]], [[Alphaproteobacteria]], [[Betaproteobacteria]], [[Gammaproteobacteria]] and [[Crenarchaeota]].

==History==

===Exploration===
{{See also|Timeline of Amazon history}}
During what many [[archaeologist]]s call the ''formative period'', Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland [[agriculture|agrarian]] systems, and possibly contributed directly to the social and religious fabric constitutive of the [[Andean]] civilizational orders.

There is ample evidence for complex large-scale, pre-Columbian social formations, including [[chiefdom]]s, in many areas of Amazonia (particularly the inter-fluvial regions) and even large towns and cities.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Mann, C, C., ed. | title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus | publisher=University of Texas | year=2005 | isbn=1-4000-3205-9 |page=296}}</ref> For instance the pre-Columbian culture on the island of [[Marajó]] may have developed [[social stratification]] and supported a population of 100,000 people.<ref name="Mann">{{Cite book| author=Mann, C, C., ed. | title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus | publisher=University of Texas | year=2005 | isbn=1-4000-3205-9 }}</ref> The Native Americans of the Amazon rain forest may have used [[Terra preta]] to make the land suitable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support large populations and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.<ref name="Mann" />

[[Gonzalo Pizarro]], set off in 1541 to explore east of [[Quito]] into the South American interior in search of [[El Dorado]] and the "Country of [[Cinnamon]]".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431769/Francisco-de-Orellana Francisco de Orellana [[Francisco de Orellana]] (Spanish explorer and soldier)]. Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref>  After 170&nbsp;km, the Coca River joined the [[Napo River]] (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the [[Napo River]], then known as ''Río de la Canela'' ("Cinnamon River") and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north. Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's party on December 26, 1541. However, Orellana apparently missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was to look for food. By the time he and his men reached another village many of them were sick from hunger and eating "noxious plants," and near death. Seven men died at that village. His men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join Pizarro's larger party. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the King of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600&nbsp;km down the Napo River they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern [[Iquitos]], and then followed what is now known as the Amazon River for a further 1,200&nbsp;km to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern [[Manaus]]), which they reached on 3 June 1542. Downriver from Manaus Orellana's party had a fierce battle with warriors who, they reported, were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}  Orellana's men began referring to the women as Amazons, a reference to the women of Greek Mythology.  The river was initially known as the Maranon (the name by which part of the river is still known today) or Rio de Orellana. It later became known as the Amazonas, the name by which it is still known in both Spanish and Portuguese. Regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the King that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. In fact, true cinnamon (''Cinnamomum verum'') is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family Lauraceae) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these.  The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon,  on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.

In 1560, another Spanish [[conquistador]], [[Lope de Aguirre]], may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north. 

Between 1637 and 1647, the Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Teixeira]] was the first European to ascend the river from Belém, near the mouth, to Quito, part of the Spanish [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], and then to return the same way. Teixeira's expedition was massive&mdash;some 2,000 people in 37 large canoes. From 1648 to 1652, [[António Raposo Tavares]] lead one of the longest known expeditions from [[São Paulo]] to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of more than {{convert|10000|km|0|abbr=on}}.

In what is currently Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, a number of [[colonization|colonial]] and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for the purpose of trade, slaving and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rain forest, such as the [[Urarina]]. [[Samuel Fritz|Father Fritz]], apostle of the Omaguas, established some forty mission villages. [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] accomplished the first scientific exploration of the Amazon River.

Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. James Stuart Olson wrote: "The [[Munduruku]] expansion dislocated and displaced the Kawahib, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River."<ref>{{Cite book

===Post-colonial exploration and history===
[[File:Naturalist on the River Amazons figure 32.png|thumb|170px|[[Henry Walter Bates]] was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848–1859).]]
The [[Cabanagem]], one of the bloodiest regional wars ever in Brazil, which was chiefly directed against the white ruling class, reduced the population of [[Pará]] from about 100,000 to 60,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm|title=Cabanagem (1835–1840): Uma das mais sangrentas rebeliões do período regencial|work=[[Universo Online]] Liçao de Casa|author=Renato Cancian|accessdate=12 November 2007|language=Portuguese| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071102212940/http://noticias.uol.com.br/licaodecasa/materias/fundamental/historia/brasil/ult1689u20.jhtm| archivedate= 2 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon Basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds comprised by Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Pará (now Belém), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 to 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as [[Tabatinga]], on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.

On 6 September 1850 Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mauá ([[Irineu Evangelista de Sousa]]) the task of putting it into effect. He organized the "Companhia de Navegação e Comércio do Amazonas" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with three small steamers, the ''Monarch'', the ''Marajó'' and ''Rio Negro''.

At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Pará and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Pará and Cametá. This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.

The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purús and Negro; a third established a line between Pará and Manaus; and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.

On 31 July 1867 the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the [[upper Amazon]] basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga – on the Amazon; Cametá – on the Tocantins; Santarém – on the Tapajós; Borba – on the Madeira, and Manaus – on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.

Thanks in part to the [[mercantile]] development associated with [[steamboat]] navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for [[natural rubber]], the Peruvian city of [[Iquitos]] became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce.  Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000.  In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber was being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.<ref>Historia del Peru, Editorial Lexus. p. 93.</ref> During the [[rubber boom]] it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants such as [[typhus]] or [[malaria]] killed 40,000 native Amazonians.<ref>La Republica Oligarquica.  Editorial Lexus 2000 p. 925</ref>

The first direct foreign trade with Manaus was commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company—the Amazon Steam Navigation Company—as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purús and many other tributaries, such as the Marañón to ports as distant as [[Nauta]], Peru.

By the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon Basin were [[Natural rubber|India-rubber]], [[cacao bean]]s, [[Brazil nut]]s and a few other products of minor importance, such as [[Fur|pelts]] and exotic forest produce ([[resin]]s, barks, woven [[hammock]]s, prized bird [[feather]]s, live animals) and extracted goods such as [[lumber]] and gold.

In August 2010 [[Ed Stafford]] became the first man in history to walk the entire length of the Amazon River. His expedition is documented in the book [[Walking the Amazon]].

===20th- and 21st-century concerns===
[[File:Manaus-Amazon-NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Manaus]], the largest city in [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]], as seen from a [[NASA]] satellite image, surrounded by the dark [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] and the muddy Amazon River]]

Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than {{convert|65|km2}}, excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters. This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.

Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was President [[Getúlio Vargas]], with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.

In 1960, the construction of the new capital city of [[Brasília]] in the interior also contributed to the opening up of the Amazon Basin. A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the forests, encouraged by promises of cheap land. Many settlements grew along the road from Brasília to Belém, but rainforest soil proved difficult to cultivate.

Still, long-term development plans continued. Roads were cut through the forests, and in 1970, the work on the [[Trans-Amazonian highway]] (''Transamazônica'') network began. The network's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as [[Brazilian Highway System#BR-319|BR-319]] (Manaus-[[Porto Velho]]), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.  

With a current population of 1.8&nbsp;million people, Manaus is the Amazon's largest city. Manaus alone represents approximately 50% of the population of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, which is the largest state. The racial makeup of the city is 64% [[Pardo]] (Mulatto and mestizo) and 32% [[White Brazilian|White]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.asp?z=cd&o=7&i=P&c=2094|title=Síntese de Indicadores Sociais 2000|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Manaus, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|accessdate=31 January 2009|year=2000|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

==Dispute regarding length==
While debate as to whether the Amazon or the [[Nile]] is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been measured by different geographers as being anywhere between {{convert|6259|and|6800|km|mi}} long. It is often said to be "at least" {{convert|6400|km|mi}} long.<ref name=britannica-amazon>{{cite web|title= Amazon River |publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year= 2010 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18722/Amazon-River |accessdate=3 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100909165132/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18722/Amazon-River| archivedate= 9 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Nile is reported to be anywhere from {{convert|5499|to|6690|km|mi}}. Often it is said to be "about" {{convert|6650|km|mi}} long.<ref name=britannica-nile>{{cite web|title= Nile River |publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year= 2010 |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415347/Nile-River |accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> There are many factors that can affect these measurements.
[[File:Amazon River Taxi.jpg|thumb|River taxi in Peru]]
A study by Brazilian scientists concluded that the Amazon is actually longer than the Nile. Using [[Nevado Mismi]], which in 2001 was labeled by the [[National Geographic Society]] as the Amazon's source, these scientists made new calculations of the Amazon's length. They calculated the Amazon's length as {{convert|6992|km|mi}}. Using the same techniques they calculated the length of the Nile as {{convert|6853|km|mi}}, which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. They made it possible by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of ''Canal do Sul'' and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine Waters of the ''Río Pará'' bay in its entire length.<ref name=inpe/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/070619-amazon-river.html |title=Amazon Longer Than Nile River, Scientists Say |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> [[Guido Gelli]], director of science at the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network [[Rede Globo|Globo]] in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world. However, other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001, and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these Brazilian scientists. The length of both the Amazon and the Nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate.<ref name=britannica-amazon/>

==Underground "river"==
Scientists have discovered the longest underground "river" (actually a salt aquifer) in the world, in Brazil, running for a length of {{convert|6000|km}} at a depth of nearly {{convert|4000|m}} It flows from the Andean foothills to the Atlantic coast in a nearly west-to-east direction like the Amazon River. The discovery was made public in August 2011<ref name="tv.ibtimes.com">[http://tv.ibtimes.com/massive-river-found-flowing-beneath-the-amazon/1753.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> meeting of the Brazilian Geophysical Society in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The "river", named [[Hamza River|Hamza]] after the discoverer, an Indian-born scientist [[Valiya Hamza]] who is working with the National Observatory at Rio, makes it the first and geologically unusual instance of a twin-river system flowing at different levels of the earth's crust in Brazil. If the slowing down of certain seismic waves caused by the damp spot helped uncover the underground ocean, the unusual temperature variation with depth measured in 241 inactive oil wells helped locate the subterranean river. Except for the flow direction, the Amazon and the Hamza have very different characteristics. The most obvious ones are their width and flow speed. While the Amazon is {{convert|1|km}} to {{convert|100|km}} wide, the Hamza is {{convert|200|km}} to {{convert|400|km}} in width. But the flow speed is  {{convert|5|m/s}} in the Amazon and less than {{convert|1|mm/s}} speed in the Hamza.<ref name="tv.ibtimes.com"/>

Several geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies. The underground ocean, discovered in 2007, has been formed when the plate carrying the Pacific Ocean bottom gets dragged and ends up under the continental plate. Water at such depths would normally escape upwards but the unusual conditions that exist along the eastern Pacific Rim allow the moisture to remain intact. In the case of the Hamza, the porous and permeable sedimentary rocks behave as conduits for the water to sink to greater depths. East-west trending faults and the karst topography present along the northern border of the Amazon basin may have some role in supplying water to the "river". If the impermeable rocks stop the vertical flow, the west to east gradient of the topography directs it to flow towards the Atlantic Ocean. Unlike the Hamza, the 153&nbsp;km-long underground river in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula and the 8.2&nbsp;km-long Cabayugan River in the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park in the Philippines have come into being thanks to the karst topography. Water in these places drills its way downward by dissolving the carbonate rock to form an extensive underground river system.

==Major tributaries==
The Amazon has over 1,100 [[Tributary|tributaries]], 17 of which are over {{convert|1500|km}} long.<ref>Tom Sterling: ''Der Amazonas''. Time-Life Bücher 1979, 8th German Printing, p. 20</ref> Some of the more notable ones are:
