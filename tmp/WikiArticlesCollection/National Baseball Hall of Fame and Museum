The '''National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum''' is an American history [[museum]] and [[hall of fame]], located at 25 Main Street in [[Cooperstown, New York]], and operated by private interests. It serves as the central point for the study of the [[history of baseball in the United States]] and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and honors those who have excelled in [[baseball positions|playing]], [[manager (baseball)|managing]], and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is "Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations."

The word '''Cooperstown''' is often used as shorthand (or a [[Metonymy|metonym]]) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

==History==

{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}

The Hall of Fame was founded in 1939 by [[Stephen Carlton Clark]], the owner of a local hotel. Clark sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the [[Great Depression]], which reduced the local tourist trade, and [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], which devastated the local [[hops]] industry. The Hall of Fame was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (Clark's granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.)

The [[Doubleday myth|erroneous claim]] that [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] hero [[Abner Doubleday]] [[Origins of baseball|invented baseball]] in Cooperstown, a claim made by former [[National League]] president [[Abraham G. Mills]] and his 1905 Mills Commission, was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.

An expanded library and research facility opened in 1994.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} [[Dale Petroskey]] became the organization's president in 1999.

In 2002, the Hall launched ''Baseball As America'', a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].

[[Jeff Idelson]] replaced Petroskey as president on April 16, 2008.<ref name="USAToday-IdelsonPresident">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Jeff Idelson named Hall of Fame president|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2008-04-16|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2008-04-16-idelson-president_N.htm|accessdate=2008-11-30 }}</ref> He had been acting as president since March 25, 2008, when Petroskey was forced to resign for having "failed to exercise proper fiduciary responsibility" and making "judgments that were not in the best interest of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum."<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080325&content_id=2458145&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: HOF president Petroskey resigns] from the [[Major League Baseball]] website</ref>

On October 26, 2011, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act, introduced by Rep. [[Richard L. Hanna|Richard Hanna]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2527|title=H.R. 2527: National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act|publisher=[[GovTrack]].us|date=November 1, 2011|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Inductees==
{{see also|List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame}}
Among baseball fans, "Hall of Fame" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, [[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]], executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were [[Ty Cobb]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Christy Mathewson]] and [[Walter Johnson]], chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. {{As of|2013|1}}, 300 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 208 former [[Major League Baseball]] players, 35 [[Negro league baseball]] players and executives, 19 managers, 10 umpires, and 28 pioneers, executives, and organizers; 114 of the 300 have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s. The newest members are executive [[Jacob Ruppert]], umpire [[Hank O'Day]], and player [[Deacon White]], inducted in {{bhofy|2013}}.<ref name="2013 VC results">{{cite press release|title=Hank O'Day, Jacob Ruppert, Deacon White Elected to National Baseball Hall of Fame by Pre-Integration Committee|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/hank-oday-jacob-ruppert-deacon-white-elected-national-baseball-hall-fame-pre|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref> In addition, 12 Hall members who were not honored at any induction ceremony due to [[World War II]] travel restrictions, the most notable of whom were [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Rogers Hornsby]], were officially recognized at the 2013 ceremony.<ref name="induct2013">{{cite web|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/press-releases/2013-hall-fame-vote-shutout|title=2013 Hall of Fame Vote a Shutout|publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame|date=January 9, 2013}}</ref> In addition to honoring Hall of Fame inductees, the National Baseball Hall of Fame has presented 37<!--as of 2013 induction class--> men with the [[Ford C.

===Selection process===
[[Image:Plaque first.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Plaques of the "First Class" of inductees": [[Christy Mathewson]], [[Babe Ruth]], [[Ty Cobb]], [[Honus Wagner]] and [[Walter Johnson]]]]

Players are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] (or BBWAA), or the [[Veterans Committee]],<ref>Following the most recent changes to the voting procedure in 2010, the official name is "Committee to Consider Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players". The term "Veterans Committee" comes from the former official name of "Committee on Baseball Veterans". Although the Hall no longer uses "Veterans Committee", that term is still widely used by baseball media.</ref> which now consists of three subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more. From a final ballot typically including 25–40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.<ref name="Walker">{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-halloffame&prov=ap&type=lgns|title=Vets committee throws another shutout at Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-02-28|last=Walker|first=Ben|date=2007-02-28|work=Associated Press}}</ref>

Under special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. [[Addie Joss]] was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. [[Roberto Clemente]]'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.

{{Quote box|width=15em|border=3px|align=right|bgcolor=#FAF0E6|qalign=center|title=''Lineup for Yesterday''|quote=''Z is for Zenith''<br />''The summit of fame.''<br />''These men are up there.''<br />''These men are the game.''|source= — ''[[Ogden Nash]]'', [[Sport (US magazine)|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)<ref>{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> }}The five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; [[Joe DiMaggio]] received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement. Contrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for [[Lou Gehrig]], other than to hold a special one-man election for him. There was no waiting period at that time and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season, but the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|terminally ill]], making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.

If a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 20 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following the most recent changes to the election process for that body made in 2010, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot—both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). With these changes, each candidate can now be considered once every three years.<ref name="2010 changes">{{cite press release|url=http://baseballhall.org/news/voting-news/hall-fame-board-directors-restructures-procedures-consideration-managers-umpires|title=Hall of Fame Board of Directors Restructures Procedures for Consideration of Managers, Umpires, Executives and Long-Retired Players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|date=2010-07-26|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> A more complete discussion of the new process is available [[#Changes to Veterans Committee process|below]].

From 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:
* One committee voted on managers and umpires for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee voted only twice— [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|in 2007 for induction in 2008]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2010|in 2009 for induction in 2010]].
* One committee voted on executives and builders for induction in every even-numbered year. This committee conducted its only two votes in the same years as the managers/umpires committee.
* The pre–World War II players committee was intended to vote every five years on players whose careers began in 1942 or earlier. It conducted its only vote as part of the election process [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|for induction in 2009]].<ref name="HoF-VC-1942">{{cite web|author=National Baseball Hall of Fame|title=Rules for election of pre–World War II players|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|year=2009|url=http://community.baseballhall.org/Page.aspx?pid=391|accessdate=2009-12-23}}</ref>

Players of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]] have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures will primarily be considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871–1946 era, called the "Pre-Integration Era" by the Hall.

Predictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, [[Bill James]]' book ''[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?]]'' goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.

===Changes to Veterans Committee process===
{{Main|Veterans Committee}}
The actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.<ref name="NYT-2001ChassReform">{{cite news|last=Chass|first=Murray|title=More Vets Eligible For Hall In Baseball|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2001-08-07|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71E3CF934A3575BC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name="TBT-2001Reform">{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Eric|title=Same Old Story|publisher=Baseball Think Factory|date=2001-08-08|url=http://www.baseballthinkfactory.org/files/primate_studies/discussion/eric_enders_2001-08-08_0/|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name="BP-Traven">{{cite web|last=Traven|first=Neal|title=A Brief History of the Veterans Committee|publisher=[[Baseball Prospectus]]|date=2003-01-14|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/20030114traven.shtml|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name="NYT-1988Leo">{{cite news|last=Leo|first=John|title=Housecleaning Plan for the Hall of Fame|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1988-01-24|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE103DF937A15752C0A96E948260&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref><ref name="BP-Miller">{{cite web|last=Jaffe|first=Jay|title=Marvin Miller|work=Prospectus Q&A|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=2008-06-02|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=7608|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>

In 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees.<ref name="hof-changes">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm|title=Changes to Veterans Committee Procedures|accessdate=2007-01-06|work=baseballhalloffame.org|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060929063713/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/veterans/veterans_changes.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2006-09-29}}</ref> The revamped Committee held three elections—in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2003|2003]] and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2007|2007]] for both players and non-players, and in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005|2005]] for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members – most of whom were Hall members – were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer [[Mike Schmidt]] noted, "The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors."<ref name="Walker">{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ap-halloffame&prov=ap&type=lgns|title=Vets committee throws another shutout at Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-02-28|last=Walker|first=Ben|date=2007-02-28|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.

In the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|2008 election process]]. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009 election process]]; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre–World War II players elected [[Joe Gordon]] in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-WWII panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.

Further changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2011 election]].<ref name="2010 changes"/>

All individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration are now considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:
* Pre-Integration Era (1871–1946)
* Golden Era (1947–1972)
* Expansion Era (1973 and later)
The Hall is using the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selects a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee meets and votes at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Pat Gillick]] becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The [[Golden Era Veterans Committee|Golden Era committee]] voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with [[Ron Santo]] becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotate among the three committees in that order.

===Players and managers with multiple teams===
While the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, or, in some cases, wearing a cap without a logo. The Hall selects the logo "based on where that player makes his most indelible mark."<ref name="FAQ-logoSelection">{{cite web|title=Who decides what team logo will be used on Hall of Fame plaques?|work=Hall of Famers: FAQ|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|year=2009|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp#logo|accessdate=2009-07-20|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090213123303/http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/faq.jsp|archivedate=2009-02-13}}</ref>

Although the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of honorees associated with multiple teams are the following:
* '''[[Frank Robinson]]''': Robinson chose to have the [[Baltimore Orioles]] cap displayed on his plaque, although he had played ten seasons with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] and six seasons with Baltimore. Robinson won four pennants and two World Series with the Orioles and one pennant with Cincinnati. His second [[World Series ring]] came in the [[1970 World Series]] against the Reds. Robinson also won an [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award while playing for each team.
* '''[[Catfish Hunter]]''': Hunter chose not to have any logo on his cap when elected to the Hall of Fame in 1987.  Hunter had success for both the teams for which he played &ndash; the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City/Oakland Athletics]] and the [[New York Yankees]]; during and after his career he maintained good relations with both teams and their respective owners ([[Charlie Finley|Charles Finley]] and [[George Steinbrenner]]) and did not wish to slight either team by selecting the other.
* '''[[Nolan Ryan]]''': Born and raised in Texas, Ryan entered the Hall in 1999 wearing a [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] cap on his plaque, although he spent only five seasons with the Rangers, while raised in the Houston area and having longer and more successful tenures with the [[Houston Astros]] (nine seasons, 1980–88 and his record-setting fifth career no-hitter) and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (eight seasons, 1972–79 and the first four of his seven career no-hitters). Ryan's only championship was as a member of the [[New York Mets]] in [[1969 World Series|1969]]. Ryan finished his career with the Rangers, reaching his 5000th strikeout and 300th win, and throwing the last two of his no-hitters. Ryan later took ownership of the Rangers when they were sold to his Rangers Baseball Express group in 2010.
* '''[[Reggie Jackson]]''': Jackson chose to be depicted with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As a member of the Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967–75, '87), winning three World Series ([[1972 World Series|1972]], [[1973 World Series|1973]], [[1974 World Series|1974]]) and the 1973 [[AL MVP|AL MVP Award]]. During his five years in New York (1977–81), Jackson won two World Series ([[1977 World Series|1977]]–[[1978 World Series|78]]), with his crowning achievement occurring during [[1977 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1977 World Series]], when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname "Mr. October".
* '''[[Carlton Fisk]]''': Fisk went into the hall with a [[Boston Red Sox]] cap on his plaque in 2000 despite playing with the [[Chicago White Sox]] longer and posting more significant numbers with the White Sox. Fisk's choice of the Red Sox was likely because of his being a [[New England]] native, as well as his famous "Stay fair!" walk-off home run in [[1975 World Series#Game 6|Game Six of the 1975 World Series]] with which he is most associated.
* '''[[Sparky Anderson]]''': Also in 2000, Anderson entered the Hall with a Cincinnati Reds cap on his plaque despite managing almost twice as many seasons with the [[Detroit Tigers]] (17 in Detroit; nine in Cincinnati). He chose the Reds to honor that team's former general manager [[Bob Howsam]], who gave him his first major-league managing job. Anderson won two World Series with the Reds and one with the Tigers.
* '''[[Dave Winfield]]''': Winfield had spent the most years in his career with the Yankees and had had great success there, but chose to go into the Hall as a member of the [[San Diego Padres]] due to his feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.

In 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though [[Wade Boggs]] denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.)<ref>{{cite news
|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm|title=Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers|accessdate=2008-05-21|work=USA Today|first1=Craig|last1=Muder|date=2005-01-06}}</ref> The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:
* '''[[Gary Carter]]''': Inducted in 2003, Carter was the first player to be affected by the new policy. Carter won his only championship with the [[1986 World Series|1986]] New York Mets, and wanted his induction plaque to depict him wearing a Mets cap, though he had spent twelve years (1974–84, 1992) with the [[Montreal Expos]] and five (1985–89) with the Mets. The Hall of Fame decided that Carter's impact on the Montreal franchise warranted depicting him with an Expos cap.<ref name="MLB-com-Carter">{{cite web|last=Czerwinski|first=Kevin T.|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030116&content_id=191990&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null|title=Kid catches Cooperstown spotlight: Carter 'happy' to go into Hall as an Expo|date=2012-01-16|accessdate=2003-01-16}}</ref>
* '''[[Wade Boggs]]''': Boggs's only championship was as a member of the [[1996 World Series|1996]] New York Yankees, for whom he played from 1993–97, but his best career numbers were posted during his eleven years (1982–92) wearing the Boston Red Sox uniform. Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction.
* '''[[Andre Dawson]]''': Dawson's cap depicts him as a member of the Expos, his team for eleven years, despite his expressed preference to be shown as a member of the [[Chicago Cubs]]. While Dawson played only six years with the Cubs, five of his eight All-Star appearances were as a Cub, and his only MVP award came in his first year with the team in 1987.<ref name="ChicagoTribune-LogoAnnouncement">{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Fred|title=Dawson 'disappointed' he won't wear Cubs cap|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=2010-01-27|url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/01/dawson-disappointed-over-decision-not-to-wear-cubs-cap.html|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref><ref name="AP-LogoAnnouncement">{{cite web|title=Hall denies Dawson's Cubs request, must enter as an Expo|publisher=Associated Press|date=2010-01-27|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Baseball-Hall-of-Fame-denies-Andre-Dawson-Cubs-request-must-enter-as-Expo-012710|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref>

==The museum==
According to the Hall of Fame, approximately 300,000 visitors enter the museum each year,<ref name="visitors"/> and the running total has surpassed 14 million. These visitors see only a fraction of its 38,000 artifacts, 2.6 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 130,000 baseball cards.<ref name="visitors"/>

However, the Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on ''[[ESPN.com]]'' about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about 5 miles (8 km) away in the town of [[Hartwick, New York|Hartwick]]. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/hof13/story/_/id/9508031/life-village-cooperstown |title=Dreams, reality alive in Cooperstown |first=Jim |last=Caple |authorlink=Jim Caple |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=July 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}</ref><blockquote>Prior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the [[Great Recession|recession]] and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.</blockquote>

* The '''Today's Game''' exhibit is built like a baseball clubhouse, with 30 glass-enclosed locker stalls, one for each Major League franchise. In each stall there is a jersey and other items from the designated big league team, along with a brief team history. A center display case holds objects donated to the Hall of Fame from the past year or two. Fans can also look into a room designed to look like a manager's office. Outside is a display case with rotating artifacts. Currently the space is devoted to the [[World Baseball Classic]].

The centerpiece is a computer tour of three former ballparks: [[Atlanta Braves|Boston's]] [[South End Grounds]], [[Chicago White Sox|Chicago's]] [[Comiskey Park]], and [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn's]] [[Ebbets Field]].

==Unauthorized sale of items in collection==
A controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the [[Baseball Commissioner]]'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]], who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.<ref name="James-HoFItemSale">{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=[[Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?|The Politics of Glory]]|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|year=1994|location=New York|pages=295–298|isbn=0-02-510774-7}}</ref>

==Non-induction of banned players==
Following the banning of [[Pete Rose]] from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.

Jackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams—Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the [[1919 World Series]] intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his [[My Prison Without Bars|2004 autobiography]]. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer [[Bill James]], though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to "those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer".<ref>James (1995:358)</ref>
