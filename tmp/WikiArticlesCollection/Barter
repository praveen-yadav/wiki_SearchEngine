{{Economic anthropology}}

'''Barter''' is a system of exchange by which [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] are directly exchanged for other goods or services without using a [[medium of exchange]], such as [[money]].<ref>{{cite book |last= O'Sullivan |first= Arthur |coauthors= Steven M. Sheffrin |title= Economics: Principles in Action |publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |page=243 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}</ref> It is distinguishable from gift economies in that the [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocal exchange]] is immediate and not delayed in time. It is usually [[wiktionary:bilateral|bilateral]], but may be [[multilateralism|multilateral]] (i.e., mediated through barter organizations) and usually exists parallel to monetary systems in most developed countries, though to a very limited extent. Barter usually replaces money as the method of exchange in times of monetary crisis, such as when the [[currency]] may be either unstable (e.g., [[hyperinflation]] or [[Deflation#Deflationary_spiral|deflationary spiral]]) or simply unavailable for conducting commerce.

[[David Graeber]] argues that the inefficiency of barter in archaic society has been used by economists since [[Adam Smith]] to explain the emergence of money, the economy, and hence the discipline of economics itself.<ref name="Graeber-p21-41">{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=21–41}}</ref> "Economists of the contemporary orthodoxy... propose an evolutionary development of economies which places barter, as a 'natural' human characteristic, at the most primitive stage, to be superseded by monetary exchange as soon as people become aware of the latter's greater efficiency."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=49}}</ref> However, extensive investigation by [[anthropologists]] like Graeber has since then  established that "No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available [[ethnography]] suggests that there never has been such a thing. But there are economies today which are nevertheless ''dominated'' by barter."<ref name="Humphrey-p48">{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=48}}</ref>

Since the 1830s, direct barter in western market economies has been aided by exchanges which frequently utilize alternative currencies based on the [[labour theory of value]], and designed to prevent profit taking by intermediators. Examples include the [[Owenite]] socialists, the [[Cincinnati Time Store|Cincinnati Time store]], and more recently [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca HOURS]] ([[Time banking]]) and the [[LETS system]].

==Barter in economic theory==
{{Economic systems sidebar}}

===Adam Smith on the origin of money===
Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, sought to demonstrate that markets (and economies) pre-existed the state, and hence should be free of government regulation. He argued against conventional wisdom that money was not the creation of governments. Markets emerged, in his view, out of the division of labour, by which individuals began to specialize in specific crafts and hence had to depend on others for subsistence goods. These goods were first exchanged by barter. Specialization depended on trade, but was hindered by the "double coincidence of wants" which barter requires, i.e., for the exchange to occur, each participant must want what the other has. To complete this hypothetical history, craftsmen would stockpile one particular good, be it salt or metal, that they thought no one would refuse. This is the origin of money according to Smith. Money, as a universally desired medium of exchange, allows each half of the transaction to be separated.<ref name="Graeber-p21-41" />

Barter is characterized in Adam Smith's "''The Wealth of Nations''" by a disparaging vocabulary: "higgling, haggling, swapping, dickering." It has also been characterized as negative [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], or "selfish profiteering."<ref>{{cite book|title=Barter, Exchange and Value: An Anthropological Approach|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=3|authorlink=Introduction|editor=Humphrey, Carolyn and Stephen Hugh-Jones}}</ref> 

Anthropologists have argued, in contrast, "that when something resembling barter ''does'' occur in stateless societies it is almost always between strangers, people who would otherwise be enemies."<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of our Dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|page=154}}</ref> Barter occurred between strangers, not fellow villagers, and hence cannot be used to naturalisticly explain the origin of money without the state. Since most people engaged in trade knew each other, exchange was fostered through the extension of credit.<ref name="Humphrey-p48" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: the first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=New York|pages=40–41}}</ref> Marcel Mauss, author of '[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]', argued that the first economic contracts were to ''not'' act in one's economic self-interest, and that before money, exchange was fostered through the processes of [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]], not barter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The false coin of our own dreams|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=153–4}}</ref> Everyday exchange relations  in such societies are characterized by generalized reciprocity, or a non-calculative familial "communism" where each takes according to their needs, and gives as they have.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The First 5,000 Years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=94–102}}</ref>

===The limitations of barter===

Barters' limits are usually explained in terms of its inefficiencies in easing exchange in comparison to the functions of money.

*'''Need for presence of double coincidence of wants''': For barter to occur between two people, both would need to have what the other wants.

*'''Absence of common measure of value''': In a monetary economy, money plays the role of a measure of value of all goods, so their values can be measured against each other; this role may be absent in a barter economy.

*'''Indivisibility of certain goods''': If a person wants to buy a certain amount of another's goods, but only has for payment one indivisible unit of another good which is worth more than what the person wants to obtain, a barter transaction cannot occur.

*'''Lack of standards for deferred payments''': This is related to the absence of a common measure of value, although if the debt is denominated in units of the good that will eventually be used in payment, it is not a problem.

*'''Difficulty in storing wealth''': If a society relies exclusively on perishable goods, storing wealth for the future may be impractical.  However, some barter economies rely on durable goods like pigs or cattle for this purpose.<ref>Robert E. Wright and Vincenzo Quadrini. Money and Banking.[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON302-1.3.pdf Chapter 3, Section 1: Of Love, Money, and Transactional Efficiency] Accessed June 29, 2012</ref>

===The advantages of barter===

* Direct barter does not require payment in money (when money is in short supply) hence will be utilized when there is little information about the credit worthiness of trade partners or there is a lack of trust.

* The poor cannot afford to store their small supply of wealth in money, especially in situations where money devalues quickly (hyperinflation).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|pages=66–7}}</ref>

==Barter in history==

===Silent trade===
[[File:Olaus Magnus - On Trade Without Using Money.jpg|thumb|Scandinavian and Russian traders bartering their wares. [[Olaus Magnus]], 1555]]
Other anthropologists have questioned whether barter is typically between "total" strangers, a form of barter known as "[[silent trade]]". Silent trade, also called silent barter, dumb barter ("dumb" here used in its old meaning of "mute"), or depot trade, is a method by which [[Merchant|traders]] who cannot speak each other's [[language]] can trade without talking. However, Benjamin Orlove has shown that while barter occurs through "silent trade" (between strangers), it also occurs in commercial markets as well. "Because barter is a difficult way of conducting trade, it will occur only where there are strong institutional constraints on the use of money or where the barter symbolically denotes a special social relationship and is used in well-defined conditions. To sum up, multipurpose money in markets is like lubrication for machines - necessary for the most efficient function, but not necessary for the existence of the market itself."<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Anthropology|year=1989|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|pages=179|author=Plattner, Stuart|authorlink=Markets and Marketplaces|editor=Plattner, Stuart}}</ref>

In his analysis of barter between coastal and inland villages in the Trobriand Islands, Keith Hart highlighted the difference between highly ceremonial gift exchange between community leaders, and the barter that occurs between individual households. The haggling that takes place between strangers is possible because of the larger temporary political order established by the gift exchanges of leaders. From this he concludes that barter is "an atomized interaction predicated upon the presence of society" (i.e. that social order established by gift exchange), and not typical between complete strangers.<ref>{{cite book|last=M. Bloch|first=J. Parry|title=Money and the Morality of Exchange|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=10}}</ref>

===Barter in times of monetary crisis===

As Orlove noted, barter may occur in commercial economies, usually during periods of monetary crisis. During such a crisis, currency may be in short supply, or highly devalued through hyperinflation. In such cases, money ceases to be the universal [[medium of exchange]] or standard of value. Money may be in such short supply that it becomes an item of barter itself rather than the means of exchange. Barter may also occur when people cannot afford to keep money (as when hyperinflation quickly devalues it).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Humphrey|first=Caroline|title=Barter and Economic Disintegration|journal=Man|year=1985|volume=20|issue=1|page=52}}</ref>

===History of barter exchanges===
[[File:Trade with indians 1820.jpg|thumb|White traders bartering with the Indians c. 1820]]
Economic historian Karl Polanyi has argued that where barter is widespread, and cash supplies limited, barter is aided by the use of credit, brokerage, and money as a unit of account (i.e. used to price items). All of these strategies are found in ancient economies including Ptolemaic Egypt. They are also the basis for more recent barter exchange systems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trade and Market in Early Empires|year=1957|publisher=The Free Press|location=Glencoe, Illinois|page=14|author=Polanyi, Karl|authorlink=Marketless Trading in Hammurabi's Time|editor=Polanyi, Karl et al}}</ref>

While one-to-one bartering is practiced between individuals and businesses on an informal basis, organized barter exchanges have developed to conduct third party bartering which helps overcome some of the limitations of barter. A barter exchange operates as a broker and bank in which each participating member has an account that is debited when purchases are made, and credited when sales are made.

Modern barter and trade has evolved considerably to become an effective method of increasing sales, conserving cash, moving inventory, and making use of excess production capacity for businesses around the world. Businesses in a barter earn trade credits (instead of cash) that are deposited into their account. They then have the ability to purchase goods and services from other members utilizing their trade credits – they are not obligated to purchase from who they sold to, and vice-versa. The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member. Commercial exchanges make money by charging a commission on each transaction either all on the buy side, all on the sell side, or a combination of both. Transaction fees typically run between 8 and 15%.

==== Utopian socialism and barter exchanges====
[[File:LaborNote.JPG|thumb|right|350px|A 19th-century example of barter: A sample labor for labor note for the [[Cincinnati Time Store]]. Scanned from ''Equitable Commerce'' by [[Josiah Warren]] (1846)]]

The [[Owenite]] socialists in Britain and the United States in the 1830s were the first to attempt to organize barter exchanges. Owenism developed a "theory of equitable exchange" as a critique of the exploitative wage relationship between capitalist and labourer, by which all profit accrued to the capitalist. To counteract the uneven playing field between employers and employed, they proposed "schemes of labour notes based on labour time, thus institutionalizing Owen's demand that human labour, not money, be made the standard of value."<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=72}}</ref> This alternate currency eliminated price variability between markets, as well as the role of merchants who bought low and sold high. The system arose in a period where paper currency was an innovation. Paper currency was an I.O.U. circulated by a bank (a promise to pay, not a payment in itself). Both merchants and an unstable paper currency created difficulties for direct producers.

An alternate currency, denominated in labour time, would prevent profit taking by middlemen; all goods exchanged would be priced only in terms of the amount of labour that went into them as expressed in the maxim '[[Cost the limit of price]]'. It became the basis of exchanges in London, and in America, where the idea was implemented at the [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] communal settlement by [[Josiah Warren]] in 1826, and in his [[Cincinnati Time Store|Cincinnati 'Time store]]' in 1827. Warren ideas were adopted by other Owenites and currency reformers, even though the labour exchanges were relatively short lived.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|page=73}}</ref>

In England, about 30 to 40 cooperative societies sent their surplus goods to an "exchange bazaar" for direct barter in London, which later adopted a similar labour note. The British Association for Promoting Cooperative Knowledge established an "equitable labour exchange" in 1830. This was expanded as the National Equitable Labour Exchange in 1832 on Grays Inn Road in London.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Quest for the New Moral World: Robert Owen and the Owenites in Britain and America|year=1969|publisher=Charles Scibners Sons|location=New York|pages=202–4}}</ref> These efforts became the basis of the British cooperative movement of the 1840s. In 1848, the [[socialist]] and first self-designated [[anarchist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] postulated a system of ''time chits''.  In 1875, [[Karl Marx]] wrote of "Labor Certificates" (''Arbeitszertifikaten'') in his [[Critique of the Gotha Program]] of a "certificate from society that [the labourer] has furnished such and such an amount of labour", which can be used to draw "from the social stock of means of consumption as much as costs the same amount of labour."<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/subject/japan/tsushima/labor-certificates.htm Tadayuki Tsushima, Understanding “Labor Certificates” on the Basis of the Theory of Value, 1956]</ref>

====Twentieth century experiments====
{{main|Time banking}}
The first exchange system was the Swiss [[WIR Bank]]. It was founded in 1934 as a result of currency shortages after the stock market crash of 1929. "WIR" is both an abbreviation of Wirtschaftsring and the word for "we" in German, reminding participants that the economic circle is also a community.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In Spain (particularly the [[Catalonia]] region) there is a growing number of exchange markets.<ref>{{Cite video

Swapping among three parties often helps satisfy tastes when trying to get around the rule that money is not allowed.<ref>[http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/barcelonas-barter-markets-an-antidote-to-overconsumption/ Barcelona's barter markets] (from faircompanies.com.

Michael Linton originated the term "local exchange trading system" ([[LETS]]) in 1983 and for a time ran the [[Comox Valley, British Columbia|Comox Valley]] LETSystems in [[Courtenay, British Columbia]].<ref>[http://wiki.ashevillelets.org/wiki/What_is_LETS%3F "What is LETS?". AshevilleLETS. Retrieved December 9, 2008.]</ref> LETS networks use [[interest]]-free [[community-based economics|local]] [[credit (accounting)|credit]] so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other [[local currency|local currencies]], no [[scrip]] is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit]] systems.

====Extent of barter today====
According to the [[International Reciprocal Trade Association]], the industry trade body, more than 450,000 businesses transacted $10 billion globally in 2008 – and officials expect trade volume to grow by 15% in 2009.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1931665,00.html?xid=rss-topstories TIMES], nov. 2009</ref>

It is estimated that over 450,000 businesses in the United States were involved in barter exchange activities in 2010. There are approximately 400 commercial and corporate barter companies serving all parts of the world. There are many opportunities for entrepreneurs to start a barter exchange. Several major cities in the U.S. and Canada do not currently have a local barter exchange. There are two industry groups in the United States, the National Association of Trade Exchanges (NATE) and the [http://www.irta.com International Reciprocal Trade Association] (IRTA). Both offer training and promote high ethical standards among their members. Moreover, each has created its own currency through which its member barter companies can trade. NATE's currency is the known as the BANC and IRTA's currency is called Universal Currency (UC).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  In Canada, the largest barter exchange is Tradebank, founded in 1987.  In the United States, the largest barter exchange and corporate trade group is International Monetary Systems, founded in 1985, now with representation in various countries. In Australia and New Zealand the largest barter exchange is Bartercard, founded in 1991, with offices in the United Kingdom,United States, Cyprus,UAE and Thailand.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Corporation|Corporate]] barter focuses on larger transactions, which is different from a traditional, retail oriented barter exchange.  Corporate barter exchanges typically use media and advertising as leverage for their larger transactions.  It entails the use of a currency unit called a "trade-credit".  The trade-credit must not only be known and guaranteed, but also be valued in an amount the media and advertising could have been purchased for had the "client" bought it themselves (contract to eliminate ambiguity and risk).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Soviet [[bilateral trade]] is occasionally called "barter trade", because although the purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars, the transactions were credited to an international clearing account, avoiding the use of hard cash.

==Tax implications==
In the United States, [[Karl Hess]] used bartering to make it harder for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] to seize his wages and as a form of [[tax resistance]]. Hess explained how he turned to barter in an [[op-ed]] for ''The New York Times'' in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |title=We Won’t Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|pages=437–440}}</ref> However the IRS now requires barter exchanges to be reported as per the [[Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982]]. Barter exchanges are considered taxable revenue by the IRS and must be reported on a 1099-B form. According to the IRS, "The fair market value of goods and services exchanged must be included in the [[income]] of both parties."<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc420.html|title=Tax Topics - Topic 420 Bartering Income|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

Other countries though do not have the reporting requirement that the U.S. does concerning proceeds from barter transactions, but taxation is handled the same way as a cash transaction. If one barters for a [[profit (accounting)|profit]], one pays the appropriate tax; if one generates a loss in the transaction, they have a loss. Bartering for business is also taxed accordingly as business income or business expense.  Many barter exchanges require that one register as a business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
