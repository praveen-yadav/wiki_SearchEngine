An '''ansible''' is a fictional machine capable of [[instantaneous]] or [[superluminal communication]]. Typically it is depicted as a [[lunch-box]]-sized object with some combination of microphone, speaker, keyboard and display. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance whatsoever with no delay.  Ansibles occur as [[plot device]]s in [[science fiction]] literature.

== Origin ==
The word ''ansible'' was [[neologism|coined]] by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] in her 1966 novel ''[[Rocannon's World]]''.<ref>Bernardo, Susan M. & Murphy, Graham J. ''Ursula K. Le Guin: A Critical Companion'' (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006), page 18.</ref> Le Guin states that she derived the name from "answerable," as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over [[interstellar]] distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-ans1.htm|work=World Wide Words|title=Ansible|last=Quinion|first=Michael}}</ref> Her award-winning 1974 [[novel]] ''[[The Dispossessed]]'',<ref name="dispossessed">{{cite book | last = Le Guin | first = Ursula K. | authorlink = Ursula K.

The name of the device has since been borrowed by authors such as [[Orson Scott Card]],<ref name="egame">{{cite book | last = Card | first = Orson Scott | authorlink = Orson Scott Card | title = [[Ender's Game]] | origyear = August 1977 | edition = mass ppb. | year = 1994 | month = July | publisher = [[Tor Books]] | location = New York | isbn = 0-8125-5070-6 | pages = 249 | quote = What matters is we built the ansible.

===Similar devices===

Similar devices are present in the works of numerous others, such as [[Frank Herbert]]<ref name="star">{{cite book | last = Herbert | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Herbert | title = The Whipping Star | origyear = 1970 | date = 1970-April | publisher = ''Worlds of If'' magazine}}</ref> and [[Philip Pullman]], who called his a ''lodestone resonator''.<ref name="amber">{{cite book | last = Pullman | first = Philip | authorlink = Philip Pullman | title = The Amber Spyglass | origyear = 2000 | edition = His Dark Materials, 3. mass pbk. | date =  2001-10-02 | publisher = [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] | location = New York | isbn = 0-345-41337-7 | pages = 156 | quote = 'Well, in our world there is a way of taking a common lodestone and entangling all its particles, and then splitting it in two so that both parts resonate together.'}}</ref>  

[[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Crystal Singer]]'' series posited an instantaneous communication device powered by rare, "Black Crystal" from the planet Ballybran. Black Crystals cut from the same mineral deposit could be "tuned" to sympathetically vibrate with each other instantly, even when separated by interstellar distances, allowing instantaneous telephone-like voice and data communication. Similarly, in [[Gregory Keyes]]' series ''[[The Age of Unreason]]'', "aetherschriebers" use two halves of a single "chime" to communicate, aided by scientific alchemy.  While the speed of communication is important, so is the fact that the messages cannot be overheard except by listeners with a piece of the original crystal.

[[Stephen R. Donaldson]], in his [[The Gap Cycle|Gap cycle]], proposed a similar system, ''Symbiotic Crystalline Resonance Transmission'', clearly ansible-type technology, but was very difficult to produce and limited to text messages.

Some [[hard science fiction]] stories use small (possibly [[Nanotechnology|nano-sized]]) paired wormholes dedicated to communication by means of a laser which traverses the wormhole.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}  In [[Robert L. Forward]]'s novel ''Timemaster'', the wormhole is a living organism resembling a fourth-dimensional sea anemone, "stretched" to cover the distance between a spaceship and a satellite on the home planet. 

[[Charles Stross]]'s books ''[[Singularity Sky]]'' and ''[[Iron Sunrise]]'' make use of "causal channels" which use entangled particles for instantaneous two-way communication. The technique has drawbacks in that the entangled particles are expendable and the use of faster-than-light travel destroys the entanglement, so that one end of the channel must be transported below light speed. This makes them expensive and limits their usefulness somewhat.

In [[Richard Morgan (author)|Richard K. Morgan]]'s [[Takeshi Kovacs]] novels human colonies on distant planets maintain contact with earth and each other via ''hyperspatial needlecast'', a technology which moves information "...so close to instantaneously that scientists are still arguing about the terminology...".  

One ansible-like device which predates Le Guin's is the ''Dirac communicator'' in [[James Blish]]'s 1954 short story "Beep". As the title implies, any active device received the sum of all transmitted messages in universal space-time, in a single pulse, so that demultiplexing yielded information about the past, present, and future.

In the story [[With Folded Hands]] (1947), by [[Jack Williamson]], instant communication and power transfer through interstellar space is possible with something referred to as "rhodomagnetic waves".

[[Isaac Asimov]] solved the same communication problem with the ''hyper-wave relay'' in the [[The Foundation Series|Foundation series]].  [[Larry Niven]] later used the same term for the plot device used within his [[Known Space]] series of novels and short stories, notably in the [[Ringworld]] and associated [[Fleet of Worlds]] series.

In  [[Ivan Yefremov]] novel [[Andromeda (novel)|Andromeda]] from 1957, a device for instant transfer of information and matter is made real by using "bipolar mathematics" to explore use of anti-gravitational shadow vectors through a zero field and the antispace, which enables them to make contact with the planet of Epsilon Tucanae.

Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate "instantaneously",<ref name="dispossessed"/> but other authors have adopted the name for devices only capable of finite-speed communication, although still faster than light. 

The ''[[Subspace (Star Trek)|subspace radio]]'', best known today from [[Star Trek]] and named for the method used in the series for achieving faster-than-light travel, was the most commonly used name for such a faster-than-light communicator in the science fiction of the 1930s to the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

In all the [[Stargate]] television series, characters are able to communicate instantaneously over long distances by transferring their consciousness into another person or being anywhere in the universe using "[[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] communication stones". It is not known how these stones operate, but the technology explained in the show usually revolves around [[wormhole]]s for instant teleportation, faster-than-light, space-warping travel, and sometimes around [[quantum multiverse]]s.

[[Jonathan Rosenberg]], author/artist of the humorous [[science fiction]] [[webcomic]] ''Scenes from a Multiverse'', references an ansible powered by a [[Quantum entanglement|quantum-entangled]] [[ferret]] in one of the comics.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenberg |url=http://amultiverse.com/2012/06/25/the-ansible |date=June 25, 2012 |title=Scenes from a Multiverse: The Ansible}}</ref>

In [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]] continuity superluminal communication via a subtle control over the state of entangled particles is possible but for practical purposes extremely slow and expensive at a rate of three bits of information per hour and costing $7,500 per bit, rendering it a limited use form of communication for only the highest priority messages.<ref>James Cameron's Avatar: An Activist Survival Guide - pg 156-157</ref>

In the [[Doctor Who]] episode [[Nightmare in Silver]] a character references a broken ansible communicator.

=== In Le Guin's work ===

In ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one "must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos." 

In ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the ansible {{quote|doesn't involve [[radio]] waves, or any form of [[energy]]. The principle it works on, the constant of [[simultaneity]], is analogous in some ways to [[gravity]] ... One point has to be fixed, on a planet of certain mass, but the other end is portable.}}

Unlike McCaffrey's black crystal transceivers, Le Guin's ansibles are not mated pairs: it is possible for an ansible's coordinates to be set to any known location of a receiving ansible. Moreover, the ansibles Le Guin uses in her stories apparently have a very limited [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session. Instead of a microphone and speaker, Le Guin's ansibles are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform [[text messaging]].

=== In Card's work ===
[[Orson Scott Card]]'s [[Ender's Game series]] uses the ansible as a plot device. "The official name is Philotic Parallax Instantaneous Communicator," explains [[Hyrum Graff|Colonel Graff]] in ''[[Ender's Game]]'', "but somebody dredged the name ''ansible'' out of an old book somewhere."<ref name="egame"/> 

Card's description of the ansible's functions in ''[[Xenocide]]'' involve a fictional subatomic particle, the [[Concepts in the Ender's Game series#Philote|philote]].  In the "Enderverse", the two [[quark]]s inside a [[pion|pi meson]] can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by "philotic rays". This concept is similar to [[quantum teleportation]] due to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], although even that does not imply a possibility of faster-than-light communication. Also, in the real world, [[quark confinement]] prevents quarks from being separated by more than microscopic distances.

The ansible is also featured in the video game ''[[Advent Rising]]'', for which Card helped write the story.

=== In Elizabeth Moon's Work ===

There is a brief reference to the ansible in ''[[Winning Colors (novel)|Winning Colors]]''.<ref name="WinningColors" />  The ansible itself is a major plot element, nearly a [[MacGuffin]] in Moon's [[Vatta's War]] series.  Much of the story line revolves around various parties attacking or repairing ansibles, and around the internal politics of ISC (InterStellar Communications), which holds a monopoly on the ansible technology.<ref name="vatta1">{{cite book | last = Moon | first = Elizabeth | authorlink = Elizabeth Moon | title = Trading in Danger | edition = mass ppb. | date = 2004-09 | publisher = Del Rey | isbn = 0-345-44761-1 | pages = 111 | quote = Attack on instersystem ansibles is just...just unthinkable}}</ref>

=== In reality ===
{{Main|Superluminal communication}}
There is no currently known way to build an ansible. The theory of [[special relativity]] predicts that any such device would allow communication from the future to the past, which raises problems of [[causality]], unless the device used general relativistic curved spacetimes as an integral part.

[[Quantum nonlocality]] is often proposed as a mechanism for superluminal communication.<ref name="amber"/> A 2008 [[quantum physics]] experiment performed in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] has determined that in any hypothetical [[Hidden_variable_theory#Non-local_hidden-variable_theory|nonlocal hidden-variables theory]] the speed of the ''quantum non-local connection'' would have to be at least 10,000 times the [[speed of light]].<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3316 Testing ''Spooky Action at a Distance'' Preprint:]  [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7206/full/nature07121.html Testing ''Spooky Action at a Distance'' Nature Article]</ref> Practical applications are shown to be impossible by the [[no-cloning theorem]], and the fact that quantum field theories preserve causality, so that quantum correlations cannot be used to transfer information.

See [[time travel]] and [[faster-than-light]] for more discussion of these issues.

A real-world radio set somewhat resembling the ansible in form and function was the WW II [[Paraset]].
