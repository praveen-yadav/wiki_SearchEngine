'''American Airlines Flight 77''' was a [[Airline|passenger flight]] which was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by five [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists on September 11, 2001, as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. They deliberately crashed it into the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] near [[Washington, D.C.]], killing all 64 people on board<ref>http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/attack/flight77.html</ref> including the five hijackers and six crew as well as 125 people in the building. The [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]] aircraft was flying [[American Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning [[transcontinental flight|transcontinental service]] from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], Virginia to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

Less than 35&nbsp;minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to loved ones and relayed information on the hijacking.

The hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]. Dozens of people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. At 10:10AM, a portion of the Pentagon collapsed; firefighters spent days trying to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas on August 15, 2002.

The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the [[Pentagon Memorial]] adjacent to the Pentagon. The {{convert|1.93|acre|m2|sing=on}} park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth, ranging from 1930 (age 71) to 1998 (age 3).

=== Suspected accomplices ===
According to a U.S. State Department cable leaked in the Wikileaks dump in February 2010, the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori. He had associated with three [[Qatari]] citizens who flew from Los Angeles to London (via Washington) and Qatar on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the [[World Trade Center]] and the [[White House]]. U.S. law enforcement officials said that the data about the four men was "just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges".<ref name="MSNBC"/> An official added that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI. [[Eleanor Hill]], the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation. She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways.<ref name="MSNBC"/>

The three Qatari men were booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on September 10, 2001, on the same plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the following day. Instead, they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar, via Washington and London. While the cable said that Mansoori was currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials said that there was no active investigation of him or of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.<ref name="MSNBC">{{cite news|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|publisher=MSNBC|title=WikiLeaks cable revives talk of 9/11 support network|date=February 2, 2011|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/|accessdate=February 18, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110211203506/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/| archivedate= February 11, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Hijacking ===
The [[9/11 Commission]] estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after [[American Airlines Flight 11]] struck the [[World Trade Center]] and not too long after [[United Airlines Flight 175]] had been hijacked.

Former [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University]] basketball coach [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]] had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As he would tell the story many times in the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on [[Jim Rome|Jim Rome's]] [[The Jim Rome Show|radio show]], he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel on the day of the show.

The NTSB employee confirmed that these were the [[flight recorder|flight recorders ("black boxes")]] from American Airlines Flight 77.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3069699/ |title=Washington's Heroes: On the ground at the Pentagon on Sept. 11 |accessdate=November 2, 2009 |last=Rosenberg |first=Debra |date=September 28, 2001 |publisher=MSNBC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040526034459/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3069699/ |archivedate=May 26, 2004 }}</ref> Dick Bridges, deputy manager for Arlington County, Virginia, said the voice recorder was damaged on the outside and the flight data recorder was charred.

=== Continuity of operations ===
At the moment of impact, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was in his office on the other side of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and assisted the injured.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vobejda |first=Barbara |title='Extensive Casualties' in Wake of Pentagon Attack |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/daily/sep01/attack.html |work=The Washington Post |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 20, 2008}}</ref> Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and other officials.<ref>{{cite book |author=Creed, Patrick and Rick Newman |title=Firefight: Inside the Battle to Save the Pentagon on 9/11 |year=2008 |publisher=Presidio Press |isbn=0-89141-905-5 |pages=276–277}}</ref>  On the day of the attacks, DOD officials considered moving their command operations to [[Site R]], a backup facility in [[Pennsylvania]].

A nearby [[Citgo]] service station also had security cameras, but a video released on September 15, 2006 did not show the crash because the camera was pointed away from the crash site.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml |title=CITGO Gas Station Cameras Near Pentagon Evidently Did Not Capture Attack |date=September 15, 2006 |publisher=Judicial Watch |accessdate=June 11, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501110315/http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml| archivedate= May 1, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Videotapes dispel conspiracy; Plane, not missile seen hitting Pentagon on 9/11 |work = The Washington Times |date=May 17, 2006}}</ref>

The [[Doubletree]] Hotel, located nearby in Crystal City, Virginia, also had a security camera video. On December 4, 2006, the FBI released the video in response to a FOIA lawsuit filed by Scott Bingham.  The footage is "grainy and the focus is soft, but a rapidly growing tower of smoke is visible in the distance on the upper edge of the frame as the plane crashes into the building".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/4821121.html |title=FBI Releases New Footage of 9/11 Pentagon Attack |publisher=[[KWTX-TV]] |date=December 4, 2006 |accessdate=June 11, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080624232051/http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/4821121.html| archivedate= June 24, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
