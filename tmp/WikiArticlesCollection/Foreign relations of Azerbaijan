Armenia and Azerbaijan '''do''' have diplomatic relations today.
|See [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], [[Khojaly Massacre]], [[Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan]]

The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations between 1918–1921, when both countries were briefly independent. The two nations have fought two wars in [[Armenian–Azerbaijani War|1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War)]] and in [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War)]], in the past century, with last one ended with provisional [[Bishkek Protocol|cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek]]. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. In 2008, Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] declared, "Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality," and "in 1918, [[Yerevan]] was granted to the [[Armenians]]. It was a great mistake. The [[Erivan khanate|khanate of Iravan]] was the [[Azeris|Azeri]] territory, the Armenians were guests here."<ref>[http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan], ''[[REGNUM News Agency]]'', 17 January 2008</ref>

During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the policies of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]], the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with mutual massacres in Azerbaijan and Armenia resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions, which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire, which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France, and Russia and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan. If a person's passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.<ref>[http://www.ncsj.org/Azerbaijan.shtml Azerbaijan Country Page]. [[NCSJ]]: Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States & Eurasia. Accessed 23 May 2010.</ref>

In 2008, in what became known as the [[2008 Mardakert Skirmishes]], Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.<ref name="regnum.ru">{{cite news| url= http://www.regnum.ru/english/943595.html | title= Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan | agency= [[REGNUM News Agency]] | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>

Azerbaijan formally recognizes the government of the Republic of Cyprus, as the sole representative of the island, but has not yet established diplomatic relations with Cyprus.
|
See [[Azerbaijan–Cyprus relations]]

Azerbaijan, like all other countries except Turkey, formally recognizes the government of the Republic of Cyprus (with whom it has not yet established diplomatic relations), which under UN and EU law represents the entire island, but interestingly enough, the parliament of Azerbaijan's [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]] issued a resolution recognizing the Turkish Cypriot North (The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) as a sovereign state. While this recognition is not regarded by Azerbaijan and internationally as 'official state-to-state', Azerbaijan itself maintained cordial unofficial relations with the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|TRNC]]. In 2004, Azerbaijan threatened to formally recognize the TRNC if the [[Annan Plan for Cyprus|Annan Plan]] was voted down by the Greek Cypriots (who rejected the plan in one of twin referendums held 24 April 2004 in both the Greek and Turkish zones simultaneously), but Azerbaijan backed off the threat when it was pointed out by Cyprus that doing so would be hypocritical, as a portion of its territory just like that of Cyprus itself is under occupation and would probably result in negative impact on its ongoing dispute with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. Recently, in July 2005, Azerbaijan announced its intentions to recognize TRNC passports and to commence direct flights from Baku to Ercan Airport in the TRNC (by-passing both Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus); however, aside from a flight handled by the private company [[Imair]] in August 2005, none have taken place. Azerbaijan has become very cool towards the Turkish Cypriot North, due to tensions arising from the possible normalization of diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia, which Azerbaijan fears will mean the loss of key leverage in the resolution of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].<ref>[http://www.turkishpolicy.com/images/stories/2005-04-neighbors/TPQ2005-4-ismailzade.pdf Turkey and Azerbaijan: The Honeymoon is Over] by Fariz Ismailzade.

Turkey has been a staunch supporter of Azerbaijan in its efforts to consolidate its independence, preserve its territorial integrity and realize its economic potential arising from the rich natural resources of the [[Caspian Sea]]. All this however has recently come under threat due to tensions arising from the possible normalization of diplomatic ties between Turkey and Armenia, which Azerbaijan fears will mean the loss of key leverage in the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

===Nagorno-Karabakh/Armenia===
{{see also|Nagorno-Karabakh conflict}}
The frozen conflict over the largely [[Armenians|Armenian]] autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh within the republic of Azerbaijan began when in 1988  the Armenian majority of Nagorno-Karabakh demanded autonomy with demonstrations following in Armenia. This led to [[Sumgait pogrom|anti-Armenian rioting]] in Azerbaijan, with Azerbaijani militias beginning their effort to expel Armenians from the enclave. In 1992 a war broke out and [[pogrom]]s of Armenians and Azeris forced both groups to flee their homes. In 1994 a Russian-brokered ceasefire ended the war but more than 1 million ethnic Armenians and Azeris are still not able to return home. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved despite negotiations, that are ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], to resolve the conflict peacefully.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/25/world/fighting-intensifies-in-armenian-azerbaijani-war.html Fighting Intensifies in Armenian-Azerbaijani War].

===Caviar diplomacy===
The [[European Stability Initiative]] (ESI) has revealed in a report from 2012 with the title "How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe", that since Azerbaijan's entry into the [[Council of Europe]], each year 30 to 40 deputies are invited to Azerbaijan and generously paid with expensive gifts, including [[caviar]] (worth up to 1.400 euro), silk carpets, gold, silver and large amounts of money.<ref>[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/aserbaidschan-die-kaviar-diplomatie/7280930.html Aserbaidschan: Die Kaviar-Diplomatie] (German). [[Der Tagesspiegel]]. Retrieved August 3, 2013</ref> In return they become [[lobbyists]] for Azerbaijan. Also the non-governmental anti-corruption organization [[Transparency International]] has criticized Azerbaijan for its procedure which is widely referred to as "Caviar diplomacy".<ref>[http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_131.pdf Caviar Diplomacy: How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe].
