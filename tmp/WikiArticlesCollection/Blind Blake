'''"Blind" Blake''' (born '''Arthur Blake'''; 1896, [[Newport News, Virginia]] &ndash; December 1, 1934, [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]])<ref>[http://www.bluesandrhythm.co.uk/documents/BR263-Blind-Blake.pdf Alex van der Tuuk, Bob Eagle, Rob Ford, Eric LeBlanc and Angela Mack: ''In Search of Blind Blake - Arthur Blake's death certificate unearthed''.- Blues & Rhythm 263 (October 2011), pp. 8–10]</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[blues]] and [[ragtime]] singer and guitarist.

==Biography==
Blind Blake recorded about 80 tracks for [[Paramount Records]] from 1926 to 1932.<ref name="russell">{{cite book

He is best known for his distinct guitar sound that was comparable in sound and style to a [[ragtime]] piano.<ref>[http://www.gracyk.com/blake1.shtml ''The King Of Ragtime Guitar: Blind Blake & His Piano-Sounding Guitar'' by Jas Obrecht]</ref>

Little is known about his life. His birthplace was listed as [[Jacksonville, Florida]] by Paramount Records in ''The Paramount Book of the Blues'', a publicity publication, but a recently acquired 1934 death certificate from the Milwaukee, WI area lists Newport News as his 1896 birthplace. On one [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] he slipped into a [[Geechee]] or [[Gullah]] dialect, prompting speculation that he was from the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Sea Island]] region.  According to one source, his real name was Arthur Phelps, although concrete evidence for this claim is lacking.<ref name="Balfour">Balfour, Alan. CD liner notes. ''Blind Blake, Complete Recorded Works In Chronological Order, Volume 4, August 1929 to June 1932''. DOCD–5027. Document Records, 1991.</ref> The "Phelps" name theory was entirely based on a response given by [[Blind Willie McTell]] in an interview conducted in 1955 in Atlanta, who likely met Blake when he passed through McTell's hometown of Statesboro, GA. Recent research has discovered that many of Blind Blake's recordings were copyrighted under the name 'Arthur Blake', and in his two-part recording with [[Papa Charlie Jackson]], "Papa Charlie and Blind Blake Talk About It", the following dialogue is heard:<blockquote>Jackson: What is your right name?</blockquote><blockquote>Blake: My right name is Arthur Blake!<ref name="Balfour" /></blockquote>There is only one surviving photograph of him in existence.

Allegedly, Blind Blake was drinking heavily in his final years. It is likely that this led to his early death at only 38 years old. The exact circumstances of his death are not known; [[Reverend Gary Davis]] said in an interview that he had heard Blake was killed by a [[Tram|streetcar]].<ref>{{cite news

A death certificate for "Arthur Blake" is listed by the Milwaukee County Courthouse (John La Fave, Register of Deeds, 901 N. 9th Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). It indicated the cause of death as pulmonary [[tuberculosis]]. Arthur Blake's grave is in [[Glendale, Wisconsin]], listed as Evergreen Cemetery (now Glen Oaks Cemetery) in a single grave #72, Range #115. The grave remained unmarked until October 2012 when one was donated by a company that creates grave markers.

==His music==

His first recordings were made in 1926 and his [[Gramophone record|records]] sold very well. His first solo record was "Early Morning Blues" with "West Coast Blues" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Both are considered excellent examples of his ragtime-based guitar style and are prototypes for the burgeoning [[Piedmont blues]]. Blake made his last recordings in 1932, the end of his career aided by Paramount's bankruptcy. Stefan Grossman and Gayle Dean Wardlow think its possible that only one side of Blake's last [[gramophone record|record]] is actually by him.<ref>Jas Obrecht 1993</ref> "Champagne Charlie Is My Name" does not actually sound like Blake's playing or singing.
His complex and intricate finger picking has inspired [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], [[Ralph McTell]], [[Leon Redbone]] and many others. French singer-songwriter [[Francis Cabrel]] refers to Blind Blake in the song "Cent Ans de Plus" on the 1999 album ''Hors-Saison.''

==Other people who used the same name==
On a few records where [[white people|white]] [[jazz]] guitarist [[Eddie Lang]] sat in with African American groups, the [[record label|record companies]] listed Lang as "Blind Blake". Most of those recordings, principally with [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], gave Lang the name "Blind Willy Dunn".

There is also a different artist who recorded multiple LPs under the name "Blind Blake". [[Blake Alphonso Higgs|Alphonso "Blind Blake" Higgs]] was one of the most popular singers in [[The Bahamas]] in the 1950s, leading the [[house band]] at the Royal Victoria Hotel. His records were spread all over the U.S. by tourist [[Fan (aficionado)|fan]]s, and several of his songs became [[folk music|folk]] [[Jazz standard|standard]]s.

==In literature==

Blind Blake appears as a central theme in the plot line of [[Lee Child]]'s 1997 Jack Reacher novel, [[Killing Floor (novel)|Killing Floor]]. There are additional, secondary references in Child's 2011 prequel, [[The Affair (novel)]].
