The '''''Boston Herald''''' is a [[daily newspaper]] whose primary market is [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, and its surrounding area. It was started in 1846 and is one of the oldest daily newspapers in the United States. It has been awarded eight [[Pulitzer Prize]]s in its history, including four for editorial writing and three for [[photography]] before it was converted to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format in 1981. The Herald was named one of the [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Archive/10-Newspapers-That-Do-It-Right-2012 10 newspapers that "Do it Right"] in 2012 by Editor & Publisher.

==History==
The ''Herald''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> history can be traced back through two lineages, the ''[[Boston Daily Advertiser|Daily Advertiser]]'' and the old ''Boston Herald'', and two media moguls, [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Rupert Murdoch]].

===The Original ''Boston Herald''===
The original ''Boston Herald'' was founded in 1846 by a group of Boston printers jointly under the name of John A. French & Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, [[William O. Eaton]], just 22 years old, said "The ''Herald'' will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global."

In 1847 the ''Boston Herald'' absorbed the Boston ''American Eagle'' and the Boston ''Daily Times''.<ref>{{Citation | last = King | first = Moses | title =  King's Hand-book of Boston ...: Profusely Illustrated |  pages = 268–269| publisher = ''Moses King'' | location = Cambridge, Ma | year = 1881}}</ref>

===''The Boston Herald and Boston Journal''===
In October 1917, John H. Higgins, the publisher and treasurer of the Boston Herald<ref>''New York Times'' "James H. Higgins, Retired Publisher; Also Was Treasurer of Boston Herald for 10 Years After Merger With Traveler DIES AT CENTRAL VALLEY In 1917 He Bought ''[[The Boston Journal]]'' and Consolidated It With The Herald".

''The New York Times'', page 12, October 6, 1917.</ref>

===''The American Traveler''===
Even earlier than the ''Herald'', the weekly ''American Traveler'' was founded in 1825 as a bulletin for [[stagecoach]] listings.<ref name="Stanwood 1886 104">{{Citation | last = Stanwood | first = Edward | title =  Boston Illustrated: Containing Full Descriptions of the City and Its Immediate Suburbs, Its Public Buildings and Institutions, Business Edifices, Parks and Avenues, Statues, Harbor and Islands, Etc., Etc.

===The ''Boston Evening Traveller''===
{{Main|Boston Evening Traveller}}
The ''Boston Evening Traveler'' was founded in 1845. The '' Boston Evening Traveler'' was the successor to the weekly ''American Traveler'' and the semi-weekly ''Boston Traveler''.<ref name="King 1881 267">{{Citation | last = King | first = Moses | title =  King's Hand-book of Boston ...: Profusely Illustrated |  page = 267| publisher = ''Moses King'' | location = Cambridge, Ma | year = 1881}}</ref> In 1912, the ''Herald'' acquired the ''Traveler'', continuing to publish both under their own names. For many years, the newspaper was controlled by many of the investors in United Shoe Machinery Co. After a newspaper strike in 1967, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon ''Traveler'' and absorbed the evening edition into the Herald to create the ''Boston Herald Traveler.''

===''The Boston Daily Advertiser''===
[[Image:Boston Advertiser Building.png|thumb|right| The old ''Boston Advertiser'' Building]]
The ''Boston Daily Advertiser'' was established in 1813 in Boston by [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]]. The paper grew to prominence throughout the 19th century, taking over other Boston area papers. In 1832 The Advertiser took over control of ''The Boston Patriot'', and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed ''The Boston Gazette''.<ref>{{Citation | title =  The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |  volume = 19|  page = 567| publisher = ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' | location = New York, NY | year = 1911}}</ref> The paper was purchased by [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1917. In 1920 the ''Advertiser'' was merged with ''The Boston Record'', initially the combined newspaper was called the ''Boston Advertiser'' however when the combined newspaper became an illustrated tabloid in 1921 it was renamed ''The Boston American''.<ref>{{Citation | first = Frederic | last = Hudson | title =  American Journalism, 1690-1940 | pages = 661–662| publisher = ''Routledge'' | location = New York, N.Y. | year = 2000 | ISBN=0-415-22894-8 }}</ref>  Hearst Corp. continued using the name ''Advertiser'' for its Sunday paper until the early 1970s.

===''The Boston Record''===
On September 3, 1884 ''The Boston Evening Record'' was started by the ''Boston Advertiser'' as a campaign newspaper. The ''Record'' was so popular that it was made a permanent publication.<ref name="Stanwood 1886 104" />

===''The Boston American''===
In 1904, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called ''The American''. Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the ''Daily Advertiser'' in 1917. By 1938, the ''Daily Advertiser'' had changed to the ''Daily Record'', and ''The American'' had become the ''Sunday Advertiser''. A third paper owned by Hearst, called the ''Afternoon Record'', which had been renamed the ''Evening American'', merged in 1961 with the ''Daily Record'' to form the ''Record American''. The ''Sunday Advertiser'' and ''Record American'' would ultimately be merged in 1972 into ''The Boston Herald Traveler'' a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old ''Boston Herald''.

===''The Boston Herald Traveler''===
In 1946, Herald-Traveler Corporation acquired Boston radio station [[WEEI|WHDH]]. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on November 26, 1957, [[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] made its début as an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to [[CBS]]. Herald-Traveler Corp. operated for years under temporary authority from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] stemming from controversy over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive had with an FCC commissioner during the original licensing process (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' of being covertly behind the proceeding. The ''Herald Traveler'' was Republican in sympathies, and the ''Globe'' then had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates.) The FCC ordered comparative hearings, and in 1969 a competing applicant, [[Boston Broadcasters, Inc.]] was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. Herald-Traveler Corp. fought the decision in court—by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat—but its final appeal ran out in 1972, and on March 19 WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new [[WCVB-TV]].

===''The Boston Herald Traveler and Record American''===
Without a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the ''Herald Traveler'' was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to [[Hearst Corporation]], which published the rival all-day newspaper, the ''Record American''. The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the ''Boston Herald Traveler and Record American'' in the morning and ''Record-American and Boston Herald Traveler'' in the afternoon. The first editions published under the new combined name were those of June 19, 1972. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to ''Boston Herald American'', with the Sunday edition called the ''Sunday Herald Advertiser''. The ''Herald American'' was printed in [[broadsheet]] format, and failed to target a particular readership; where the ''Record American'' had been a typical city [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], the ''Herald Traveler'' was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] paper.

===Murdoch purchases ''The Herald American''===
The ''Herald American'' converted to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format in September 1981, but Hearst faced steep declines in circulation and advertising. The company announced it would close the ''Herald American''—making Boston a one-newspaper town—on December 3, 1982. When the deadline came, Australian media baron [[Rupert Murdoch]] was negotiating to buy the paper and save it. He closed on the deal after 30 hours of talks with Hearst and newspaper unions—and five hours after Hearst had sent out notices to newsroom employees telling them they were terminated. The newspaper announced its own survival the next day with a full-page headline: "You Bet We're Alive!"<ref name="NEPA">"Purcell Toasts 25th Anniversary of Herald's Survival". [http://www.nepa.org/Bulletin%20Archives/NEPA_Bulletin_Dec07.pdf ''NEPA Bulletin''] (Boston, Mass.), December 2007, page 11.</ref>

=== The ''Boston Herald'' once again ===

Murdoch changed the paper's name back to the ''Boston Herald''. The ''Herald'' continued to grow, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until 2001, when nearly all newspapers fell victim to declining circulations and revenue.

===Independent ownership===
In February 1994, Murdoch's [[News Corporation]] was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary [[Fox Television Stations]] could legally consummate its purchase of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WFXT-TV|WFXT]] (Channel 25) because Massachusetts Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] included language in an appropriations barring one company from owning a newspaper and television station in the same market.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Allan R.|title=Kennedy vs. Murdoch: Test of Motives|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/11/us/kennedy-vs-murdoch-test-of-motives.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 11, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Allan R.|title=Kennedy and Paper Battle in Boston|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/07/us/kennedy-and-paper-battle-in-boston.html|accessdate=November 22, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lenzner|first=Robert|title=Rupert Murdoch,The Boston Globe, And Me|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2011/08/06/rupert-murdochthe-boston-globe-and-me/|work=Forbes|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}</ref>  [[Patrick J. Purcell]], who was the publisher of the ''Boston Herald'' and a former [[News Corporation]] executive, purchased the ''Herald'' and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the ''Herald'' a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing [[Community Newspaper Company]] from [[Fidelity Investments]]. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.

After years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the ''Herald'', Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to [[GateHouse Media]]. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring ''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'' and ''[[The Enterprise (Brockton)|The Enterprise]]'' in south suburban [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] and [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the ''Herald''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> debt and reinvest in the Paper.<ref>Bailey, Steve, and Robert Gavin.

==Awards==
The ''Herald'''s four [[Pulitzer Prizes]] for editorial writing, in 1924, 1927, 1949 and 1954, are among the most awarded to a single newspaper in the category. In 1957 [[Harry Trask]] was a young staff photographer at the ''Traveler'' when he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his photo sequence of the sinking of the [[SS Andrea Doria]] in July 1956.  ''Herald'' photographer [[Stanley Forman]] received two Pulitzer Prizes consecutively in 1976 and 1977, the first being a dramatic shot of a young child falling in mid-air from her mother's arms on the upper stories of a burning apartment building to the waiting arms of firefighters below, and the latter (known as "The soiling of Old Glory") being of [[Ted Landsmark]], an [[African American]] city official, being beaten with an [[American flag]] during [[Boston busing crisis|Boston's school busing crisis]]. In 2006 the ''Herald'' won two SABEW awards from the [[Society of American Business Editors and Writers]] for its breaking news coverage of the takeover of local company Gillette Co. and for overall excellence.<ref>Boston Herald staff, "Herald named `best in business'".
