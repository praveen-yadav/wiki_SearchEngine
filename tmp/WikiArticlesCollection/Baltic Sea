The '''Baltic Sea''' is a [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean sea]] located between [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northern Europe]], from [[53rd parallel north|53°N]] to [[66th parallel north|66°N]] [[latitude]] and from [[10th meridian east|10°E]] to [[30th meridian east|30°E]] [[longitude]]. It is bounded by the Swedish part of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], the mainland of [[Europe]], and the [[Denmark|Danish]] islands. It drains into the [[Kattegat]] by way of the [[Øresund]], the [[Great Belt]] and the [[Little Belt]]. The Kattegat continues through [[Skagerrak]] into the [[North Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The Baltic Sea is connected by artificial waterways to the [[White Sea]] via the [[White Sea Canal]], and to the North Sea via the [[Kiel Canal]]. The Baltic Sea might be considered to be bordered on its northern edge by the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], on its northeastern edge by the [[Gulf of Finland]], and on its eastern edge by the [[Gulf of Riga]]. These various gulfs can also be considered part of the Baltic Sea.

== Etymology ==
While [[Tacitus]] called it ''Mare Suebicum''<ref>[[Tacitus]], [[Germania (book)]]: ''Ergo iam dextro Suebici maris litore Aestiorum gentes adluuntur, quibus ritus habitusque Sueborum, lingua Britannicae propior.''[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ger.shtml#45] – ''Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the AEstyan nations reside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their language more resembles that of Britain.''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2995/2995-h/2995-h.htm]</ref> after the Germanic people of the [[Suebi]], the first to name it also as the ''Baltic Sea'' (''[[wikt:Mare Balticum|Mare Balticum]]'') was eleventh-century German chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]]. The origin of the latter name is speculative. It might be connected to the Germanic word ''belt'', a name used for two of the Danish straits, [[the Belts]], while others claim it to be derived from [[Latin]] ''balteus'' (belt).<ref name="Latin-etymology">{{sv icon}} [http://runeberg.org/nfbb/0435.html Balteus] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]''.</ref> However it should be noted that the name of the Belts might be connected to Danish ''bælte'', which also means belt. Furthermore [[Adam of Bremen]] himself compared the Sea with a belt stating that the Sea is named so because it stretches through the land as a belt (''Balticus, eo quod in modum baltei longo tractu per Scithicas regiones tendatur usque in Greciam''). He might also have been influenced by the name of a legendary island mentioned in the [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] of [[Pliny the Elder]]. Pliny mentions an island named [[Baltia]] (or ''Balcia'') with reference to accounts of [[Pytheas]] and [[Xenophon]]. It is possible that Pliny refers to an island named ''Basilia'' ("kingdom" or "royal") in ''On the Ocean'' by Pytheas. ''Baltia'' also might be derived from "belt" and means "near belt of sea (strait)". Meanwhile others have concluded that the name of the island originates from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=/data/ie/piet&text_number=+129&root=config *''bhel''] meaning ''white, fair''. This root and its basic meaning were retained in both Lithuanian (as ''baltas'') and in Latvian (as ''balts''). On this basis, a related hypothesis holds that the name originated from this Indo-European root via a [[Baltic language]] such as Lithuanian.<ref>{{cite book

Another explanation is that the name was related to swamp and originally meant "enclosed sea, bay" as opposed to open sea.<ref name="baltu valodas">{{cite book |last=Dini |first=Pierto Umberto |editor= |others=Translated from Italian by Dace Meiere |title= Baltu valodas |origyear=1997 |year=2000 |publisher=Jānis Roze |location=Riga |language=Latvian |isbn= 9984-623-96-3}}</ref>
Some Swedish historians believe the name derives from the cripple secondary god Balder of Nordic mythology.

In the [[Middle Ages]] the sea was known by variety of names. The name ''Baltic Sea'' became dominant only after 1600. Usage of ''Baltic'' and similar terms to denote the region east from the sea started only in 19th century.

===Name in other languages===
The Baltic Sea was known in ancient sources as ''[[Mare Suebicum]]''  or ''[[Mare Germanicum]]''.<ref>[[Hartmann Schedel]] 1493 map [http://www.nada.kth.se/~ovidiu/maps/images/1493-schedel-europa.jpg]</ref> It is also known by the equivalents of "East Sea", "West Sea", or "Baltic Sea" in different languages:
* '''''Baltic Sea''''' is used in ''[[English language|English]]''; in the ''[[Baltic languages]]'' [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (''Baltijas jūra'') and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (''Baltijos jūra''); in ''[[Latin]]'' (''Mare Balticum'') and the ''[[Romance languages]]'' [[French language|French]] (''Mer Baltique''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''Mar Baltico''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''Mar Báltico''), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (''Marea Baltică'') and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Mar Báltico''); in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''Βαλτική Θάλασσα''); in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (Deti Balltik); in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (''Y Môr Baltig''); in the ''[[Slavic languages]]'' [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Morze Bałtyckie'' or ''Bałtyk''), [[Czech language|Czech]] (''Baltské moře'' or ''Balt''), [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (''Baltičko more''), [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] (''Baltsko morje''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (''Baltijsko More'', ''Балтийско море''), [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] (''Bôłt''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (''Балтичко Море'', ''Baltičko More''), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (''Балтійське море'', "Baltijs'ke More"), [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (''Балтыйскае мора'', "Baltyjskaje Mora"), [[Russian (language)|Russian]] (''Балтийское море'', "Baltiyskoye Morye") and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (''Балтичко море'', ''Baltičko more'').
* In ''[[Germanic languages]]'', except English, '''''East Sea''''' is used: [[Afrikaans]] (''Oossee''), [[Danish language|Danish]] (''Østersøen''), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''Oostzee''), [[German language|German]] (''Ostsee''), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (''Eystrasalt''), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''Østersjøen''), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (''Östersjön''). In [[Old English]] it was known as ''Ostsæ''.
* In addition, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], a [[Baltic-Finnic languages|Baltic-Finnic language]], has [[calque]]d the Swedish term as ''Itämeri'' "East Sea", disregarding the geography (the sea is west of Finland), though understandably since Finland was a part of Sweden from the Middle Ages until 1809.
* In another Baltic-Finnic language, [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is called the '''''West Sea''''' (''Läänemeri''), with the correct geography (the sea is west of Estonia).

== History ==
[[File:Putgarten, Kap Arkona (2011-05-21) 3.JPG|thumb|[[Cape Arkona]] on the island of [[Rügen]] in Germany, was a sacred site for pre-Christian [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Slavs]].]]
At the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the Baltic Sea was known as the ''Mare Suebicum'' or ''Mare Sarmaticum''. [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in his AD&nbsp;98 ''Agricola'' and ''Germania'' described the Mare Suebicum, named for the [[Suebi]] tribe, during the spring months, as a brackish sea where the ice  broke apart and chunks floated about. The Suebi eventually migrated south west to reside for a while in the Rhineland area of modern Germany, where their name survives in the historic region known as [[Swabia]]. [[Jordanes]] called it the ''Germanic Sea'' in his work, the ''[[Getica]]''.

Since the [[Viking age]], the Scandinavians have called it ''Austmarr'' ("Eastern Lake"). "Eastern Sea", appears in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' and ''Eystra salt'' appears in ''[[Sörla þáttr]]''. [[Saxo Grammaticus]] recorded in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' an older name, ''[[Gandvik]]'', ''"-vik"'' being [[Old Norse]] for "bay", which implies that the Vikings correctly regarded it as an inlet of the sea. Another form of the name, "Grandvik", attested in at least one English translation of ''Gesta Danorum'', is likely to be a misspelling.)
[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|left|Main trading routes of the [[Hanseatic League]] (''Hanse'').]]
In addition to fish the sea also provides [[amber]], especially from its southern shores. The bordering countries have traditionally exported lumber, wood tar, [[flax]], [[hemp]] and furs by ship across the Baltic. Sweden had from early medieval times exported [[iron]] and [[silver]] mined there, while [[Poland]] had and still has extensive [[salt]] mines. Thus the Baltic Sea has long been crossed by much merchant shipping.

In the early [[Middle Ages]], Norse (Scandinavian) merchants built a trade empire all around the Baltic. Later, the Norse fought for control of the Baltic against [[Wends|Wendish tribes]] dwelling on the southern shore. The Norse also used the rivers of Russia for trade routes, finding their way eventually to the [[Black Sea]] and southern Russia. This Norse-dominated period is referred to as the [[Viking Age]].

The lands on the Baltic's eastern shore were among the last in Europe to be converted to [[Christianity]]. This finally happened during the [[Northern Crusades]]: [[Finland]] in the twelfth century by Swedes, and what are now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] in the early thirteenth century by Danes and Germans ([[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]). The [[Teutonic Order]] gained control over parts of the southern and eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, where they set up [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|their monastic state]]. [[Lithuania]] was [[Christianization of Lithuania|the last European state to convert to Christianity]].

In the 12th century, there was much [[Baltic Slavic piracy|piracy in the Baltic by Slavs]] from the coasts of [[Pomerania]] and [[Prussia]].

Starting in the 11th century, the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic were settled by migrants mainly from [[Germany]], a movement called the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'' ("east settling"). Other settlers were from the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], and [[Scotland]]. The [[Polabian Slavs]] were gradually assimilated by the Germans.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639735/Wend Wend – West Wend]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 23 June 2011.</ref> [[Denmark]] gradually gained control over most of the Baltic coast, until she lost much of her possessions after being defeated in the 1227 [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]].
[[File:Eerste fase van de Zeeslag in de Sont - First phase of the Battle of the Sound - November 8 1568 (Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraten, 1660).jpg|thumb|right|The naval [[Battle of the Sound]] took place on 8 November 1658 during the [[Dutch-Swedish War]].]]
In the 13th to 17th centuries, the strongest economic force in Northern Europe was the [[Hanseatic League]], a federation of merchant cities around the Baltic Sea and the [[North Sea]]. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]] fought wars for ''Dominium Maris Baltici'' ("Lordship over the Baltic Sea").  Eventually, it was Sweden that [[Swedish Empire|virtually encompassed the Baltic Sea]]. In Sweden the sea was then referred to as ''Mare Nostrum Balticum'' ("Our Baltic Sea").

However, it was the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] who dominated the Baltic trade in the seventeenth century.

In the eighteenth century, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] became the leading powers over the sea. Sweden's defeat in the [[Great Northern War]] brought Russia to the eastern coast. Russia became and remained a dominating power in the Baltic. Russia's [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] saw the strategic importance of the Baltic and decided to found his new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], at the mouth of the [[Neva]] river at the east end of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. There was much trading not just within the Baltic region but also with the North Sea region, especially eastern [[England]] and the [[Netherlands]]: their fleets needed the Baltic timber, tar, flax and hemp.

During the [[Crimean War]], a joint [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] fleet attacked the Russian fortresses in the Baltic. They bombardedng [[Sveaborg]], which guards [[Helsinki]]; and [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]], which guards Saint Petersburg; and they destroyed [[Bomarsund, Åland|Bomarsund]] in the [[Åland Islands]]. After the unification of [[Germany]] in 1871, the whole southern coast became German. [[World War I]] was partly fought in the Baltic Sea. After 1920 [[Poland]] was connected to the Baltic Sea by the [[Polish Corridor]] and enlarged the port of [[Gdynia]] in rivalry with the port of the [[Free City of Danzig]].
[[File:Cap Arcona burning.jpg|thumb|The burning ''[[Cap Arcona]]'' shortly after the attacks, 3 May 1945. Only 350 of the 4,500 prisoners who had been aboard the ''Cap Arcona'' survived.]]
During [[World War II]], Germany reclaimed all of the southern shore and much of the eastern by occupying Poland and the Baltic states. In 1945, the Baltic Sea became a mass grave for retreating soldiers and refugees on torpedoed [[Operation Hannibal|troop transports]]. The sinking of the ''[[Wilhelm Gustloff (ship)|Wilhelm Gustloff]]'' remains the worst maritime disaster, killing (very roughly) 9,000 people. In 2005, a Russian group of scientists found over five thousand airplane wrecks, sunken warships, and other material, mainly from World War II, on the bottom of the sea.

Since the end of World War II, various nations, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, have disposed of [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] in the Baltic Sea, raising concerns of environmental contamination.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3102728,00.html Chemical Weapon Time Bomb Ticks in the Baltic Sea] ''Deutsche Welle'', 1 February 2008.</ref> Even now fishermen accidentally retrieve some of these materials: the most recent available report from the Helsinki Commission notes that four small scale catches of CW munitions representing approximately 105 kilograms (231&nbsp;lbs) of material were reported in 2005. This is a reduction from the 25 incidents representing 1,110 kilograms (2,447&nbsp;lbs) of material in 2003.<ref>[http://www.helcom.fi/stc/files/Publications/Proceedings/bsep112.pdf Activities 2006: Overview] Baltic Sea Environment Proceedings No. 112. [[Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission|Helsinki Commission]].</ref> Until now, the U.S. government refuses to disclose the exact coordinates of the wreck sites. Rotting bottles leak [[Mustard gas|Lost]] and other substances, thus slowly poisoning a substantial part of the Baltic Sea.

After 1945, the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|German population was expelled]] from all areas east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], making room for displaced Poles and Russians. Poland [[Former eastern territories of Germany|gained most of the southern shore]]. The [[Soviet Union]] gained another access to the Baltic with the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. The Baltic states on the eastern shore were annexed by the Soviet Union. The Baltic then separated opposing military blocs: [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Had war broken out, the Polish navy was prepared to invade the Danish isles. This border status restricted trade and travel. It ended only after the collapse of the [[Communist]] regimes in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s.

Since May 2004, with the accession of the Baltic states and Poland, the Baltic Sea has been almost entirely surrounded by countries of the [[European Union]] (EU). The only remaining non-EU shore areas are Russian: the Saint Petersburg area and the [[exclave]] of the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].

Winter storms begin arriving in the region during October. These have caused numerous shipwrecks, and contributed to the extreme difficulties of rescuing passengers of the ferry ''[[M/S Estonia]]'' en route from [[Tallinn]], Estonia, to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in September 1994, which claimed the lives of 852 people. Older, wood-based shipwrecks such as the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' tend to remain well-preserved, as the Baltic's cold and brackish water does not suit the [[shipworm]].

===Storm floods===
[[Storm surge]] floodings are generally taken to occur when the water level is more than one metre above normal. In Warnemünde about 110 floods occurred from 1950 to 2000, an average of just over two per year.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ikzm-d.de/infos/pdfs/129_Bericht_Sturmfluten.pdf |title=Sturmfluten in der südlichen Ostsee (Westlicher und mittlerer Teil) |trans_title= Storm floods in the Southern Baltic (western and central part) |language=German |year=2005 |issue=39 |journal=Berichte des Bundesamtes für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie |page=6 |first=Marzenna |last=Sztobryn |first2=Hans-Joachim |last2=Stigge |first3=Danuta |last3=Wielbińska |first4=Bärbel |last4=Weidig |first5=Ida |last5=Stanisławczyk |first6=Alicja |last6=Kańska |first7=Katarzyna |last7=Krzysztofik |first8=Beata |last8=Kowalska |first9=Beata |last9=Letkiewicz |first10=Monika |last10=Mykita}}</ref>

Historic flood events were the [[All Saints' Flood of 1304]] and other floods in the years 1320, 1449, 1625, 1694, 1784 and 1825.

== Geography ==

=== Geophysical data ===
[[File:BalticSea March2000 NASA-S2000084115409 md.jpg|thumb|Baltic Sea in winter]]
The Baltic Sea is one of the largest [[brackish water|brackish]] inland seas by area. The Baltic Sea occupies a basin (a ''[[zungenbecken]]'') formed by glacial erosion during the last few [[Ice Age|ice ages]].

The Baltic Sea is about 1,600&nbsp;km (1,000&nbsp;mi) long, an average of 193&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;mi) wide, and an average of 55&nbsp;m (180&nbsp;ft, 30 [[fathom]]s) deep. The maximum depth is 459&nbsp;m (1506&nbsp;ft) which is on the Swedish side of the center. The surface area is about 377,000&nbsp;km² (145,522 sq&nbsp;mi) and the volume is about 20,000&nbsp;km³ (5040 cubic&nbsp;miles). The periphery amounts to about 8,000&nbsp;km (5,000&nbsp;mi) of coastline.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060421230004/http://www.envir.ee/baltics/geograph.htm Geography of the Baltic Sea Area] at envir.ee. (archived) (2006-04-21). Retrieved on 23 June 2011.</ref>

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Baltic Sea as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=6 February 2010}}</ref>

:Bordered by the coasts of Germany, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it extends north-eastward of the following limits:
:*''In the [[Little Belt]].'' A line joining [[Nieby|Falshöft]] ({{coord|54|47|N|9|57.5|E|display=inline}}) and Vejsnæs Nakke ([[Ærø]]: {{coord|54|49|N|10|26|E|display=inline}}).
:*''In the [[Great Belt]].'' A line joining Gulstav (South extreme of [[Langeland]] Island) and Kappel Kirke ({{coord|54|46|N|11|01|E|display=inline}}) on Island of [[Lolland]].
:*''In [[Guldborgsund|Guldborg Sound]].'' A line joining Flinthorne-Rev and Skjelby ({{coord|54|38|N|11|53|E|display=inline}}).
:*''In [[Øresund|the Sound]].'' A line joining [[Stevns Peninsula|Stevns]] Lighthouse ({{coord|55|17|N|12|27|E|display=inline}}) and [[Falsterbo|Falsterbo Point]] ({{coord|55|23|N|12|49|E|display=inline}}).

===Subdivisions===
[[File:Map of the Baltic Marine Environment.GIF|thumb|left|300px|Regions and basins of the Baltic Sea]]
The northern part of the Baltic Sea is known as the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], of which the northernmost part is the Bay of Bothnia <!-- redirects to: --> or [[Bothnian Bay]]. The more rounded southern basin of the gulf is called [[Bothnian Sea]] and immediately to the south of it lies the [[Sea of Åland]]. The [[Gulf of Finland]] connects the Baltic Sea with [[Saint Petersburg]]. The [[Gulf of Riga]] lies between the [[Latvia]]n capital city of [[Riga]] and the [[Estonia]]n island of [[Saaremaa]].

The [[Northern Baltic|Northern Baltic Sea]] lies between the [[Stockholm]] area, southwestern Finland and Estonia. The [[Gotland Basin|Western and Eastern Gotland Basins]] form the major parts of the Central Baltic Sea or Baltic proper. The [[Bornholm Basin]] is the area east of [[Bornholm]], and the shallower [[Arkona Basin]] extends from Bornholm to the Danish isles of [[Falster]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].

In the south, the [[Bay of Gdańsk]] lies east of the [[Hel Peninsula]] on the Polish coast and west of the [[Sambia Peninsula]] in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. The [[Bay of Pomerania]] lies north of the islands of [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]], east of [[Rügen]]. Between Falster and the German coast lie the [[Bay of Mecklenburg]] and [[Bay of Lübeck]]. The westernmost part of the Baltic Sea is the [[Bay of Kiel]]. The three [[Danish straits]], the [[Great Belt]], the [[Little Belt]] and [[Öresund|The Sound]] (''Ö/Øresund''), connect the Baltic Sea with the [[Kattegat]] bay and [[Skagerrak]] strait in the [[North Sea]].

===Sea ice===
On the long-term average, the Baltic Sea is ice-covered at the annual maximum for about 45% of its surface area. The ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], the [[Gulf of Finland]], [[Gulf of Riga]], [[Väinamer]]i in the Estonian archipelago, the [[Stockholm archipelago]] and the [[Archipelago Sea]] of Finnish territorial waters. The remainder of the Baltic itself does not freeze during a normal winter, with the exception of sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the [[Curonian Lagoon]]. The ice reaches its maximum extent in February or March; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the [[Bothnian Bay]], the northern basin of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], is about {{convert|70|cm|0|abbr=on}} for landfast sea ice. The thickness decreases farther south.

Freezing begins in the northern extremities of [[Gulf of Bothnia]] typically in middle of November, reaching the open waters of [[Bothnian Bay]] in early January. The [[Bothnian Sea]], the basin south [[Kvarken]], freezes on average in late February. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga freeze typically in late January. In 2011, the Gulf of Finland was completely frozen on 15 February.<ref>[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 16 February 2011, p. A8.</ref>

The ice extent depends on whether the winter is mild, moderate or severe. Severe winters can lead to ice formation around southern [[Sweden]] and even in the [[Danish straits]]. According to the 18th-century natural historian [[William Derham]], during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708 the ice cover permeated as far as the Danish straits, parts of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland, in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the Gulf of Riga .<ref>Derham, ''Physico-Theology: Or, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God from His Works of Creation'' (London, 1713).</ref> This description would actually have meant that the whole of the Baltic Sea had been covered with ice.

It is known that since 1720, the Baltic Sea has frozen over entirely only 20 times. The most recent case was in early 1987, which was the most severe winter in Scandinavia since that date. The ice then covered 400 000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. During the winter of 2010/11, which was quite severe compared to those of the last decades, the maximum ice cover was 315 000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, which was reached on 25 February 2011. The ice then extended from the north down to the northern tip of [[Gotland]], with small ice free areas on its either side, and the east coast of the Baltic Sea was covered by an ice sheet ca. {{convert|25|-|100|km|0|abbr=on}} wide all the way down to [[Gdańsk]]. This was brought about by a stagnant [[high-pressure area]] that lingered over central and northern Scandinavia from ca. 10 to 24 February. After this, strong southern winds pushed the ice further into the north, and much of the waters north of Gotland were again free of ice, which had then packed against the shores of southern Finland.<ref>[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 10 February 2011, p. A4.</ref><ref>[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 25 February 2011, p. A5.</ref><ref>[[Helsingin Sanomat]], 11 June 2011, p. A12.</ref> The effects of the afore-mentioned high-pressure area did not reach the southern parts of the Baltic Sea, and thus the entire sea did not freeze over. However, floating ice was additionally observed near [[Świnoujście]] harbour in January 2010.

In the recent years prior to 2011, [[Bothnian Bay]] and the [[Bothnian Sea]] were frozen with solid ice near the Baltic coast and dense floating ice far from it. In 2007 there was almost no ice formation except for a short period in March.<ref>[http://www.ssec.wisc.edu Sea Ice survey, Space Science and Engineering Centre, University of Wisconsin].</ref>

During winter, [[fast ice]], which is attached to the [[shoreline]], develops first, rendering the ports unusable without the services of [[icebreaker]]s. [[Level ice]], [[ice sludge]], [[pancake ice]] or [[rafter ice]] form in the more open regions. The gleaming expanse of ice is similar to the [[Arctic]], with wind-driven pack ice and ridges up to 15&nbsp;m. Offshore of the landfast ice, the ice remains very dynamic all year, and it is relatively easily moved around by winds and therefore forms [[pack ice]], made up of large piles and ridges pushed against the landfast ice and shores.

In spring, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia normally thaw in late April, with some ice ridges persisting until May in the eastern extremities of the Gulf of Finland. In the northernmost reaches of the Bothnian Bay, ice usually stays until late May; by early June it is practically always gone.

The ice cover is the main habitat for two large mammals, the [[grey seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') and the Baltic [[ringed seal]] (''Pusa hispida botnica''), both of which feed underneath the ice and breed on its surface. Of these two seals, only the Baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not adequate ice in the Baltic Sea, as it feeds its young only on ice. The grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. The sea ice also harbours several species of algae that live in the bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice.

===Hydrography===
{{See also|List of rivers of the Baltic Sea}}
The Baltic Sea flows out through the [[Danish straits]]; however, the flow is complex. A surface layer of brackish water discharges 940&nbsp;km³ per year into the [[North Sea]]. Due to the difference in [[salinity]], by salinity permeation principle, a sub-surface layer of more saline water moving in the opposite direction brings in 475&nbsp;km³ per year. It mixes very slowly with the upper waters, resulting in a salinity gradient from top to bottom, with most of the salt water remaining below 40 to 70&nbsp;m deep. The general circulation is counter-clockwise: northwards along its eastern boundary, and south along the western one .<ref name=Alhonen>Alhonen, p. 88</ref>

The difference between the outflow and the inflow comes entirely from fresh [[water]]. More than 250 streams drain a basin of about 1.6 million km², contributing a volume of 660&nbsp;km³ per year to the Baltic. They include the major rivers of north Europe, such as the [[Oder]], the [[Vistula]], the [[Neman River|Neman]], the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] and the [[Neva]]. Additional fresh water comes from the difference of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] less evaporation, which is positive.

An important source of salty water are infrequent inflows of [[North Sea]] water into the Baltic. Such inflows, important to the Baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the Baltic deeps, used to happen on average every four to five years until the 1980s. In recent decades they have become less frequent. The latest three occurred in 1983, 1993 and 2003 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.

The water level is generally far more dependent on the regional wind situation than on tidal effects. However, tidal currents occur in narrow passages in the western parts of the Baltic Sea.

The [[significant wave height]] is generally much lower than that of the [[North Sea]]. Violent and sudden storms often sweep the surface, due to large transient temperature differences and a long reach of wind. Seasonal winds also cause small changes in sea level, of the order of 0.5&nbsp;m .<ref name=Alhonen/>

===Salinity===
The Baltic Sea's [[salinity]] is much lower than that of ocean water (which averages 35[[parts per thousand|‰]]), as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land, combined with the shallowness of the sea itself; indeed, runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth its total volume per year, as the volume of the basin is about 21,000&nbsp;km³ and yearly runoff is about 500&nbsp;km³. The open surface waters of the central basin have salinity of 6 to 8&nbsp;[[parts per thousand|‰]]. At the semi-enclosed bays with major freshwater inflows, such as head of Finnish Gulf with Neva mouth and head of Bothnian gulf with close mouths of Lule, Tornio and Kemi, the salinity is considerably lower. Below 40 to 70&nbsp;m, the salinity is between 10 and 15&nbsp;[[parts per thousand|‰]] in the open Baltic Sea, and more than this near Danish Straits.

The flow of fresh water into the sea from approximately two-hundred rivers and the introduction of salt from the South builds up a gradient of salinity in the Baltic Sea. Near the [[Danish straits]] the salinity is close to that of the Kattegat, but still not fully oceanic, because the saltiest water that passes the straits is still already mixed with considerable amounts of outflow water. The salinity steadily decreases towards North and East. At the northern part of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] the water is no longer salty and many fresh water species live in the sea. The salinity gradient is paralleled by a temperature gradient. These two factors limit many species of animals and plants to a relatively narrow region of Baltic Sea.

The most saline water is vertically stratified in the water column to the [[North Sea|north]], creating a barrier to the exchange of [[oxygen]] and nutrients, and fostering completely separate maritime environments.<ref>{{PDF|[http://www.ices.dk/projects/balticsea/baltic%20sea-rse%20thulin%20and%20andrusaitis.pdf The Baltic Sea: Its Past, Present and Future]|352&nbsp;KB}}, Jan Thulin and Andris Andrushaitis, Religion, Science and the Environment Symposium V on the Baltic Sea (2003).</ref>

===Coastal countries===
[[File:Image-Lithuania Juodkrante sand dunes.jpg|thumb|Vast coastal [[dunes]] are characteristic for large parts of the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. [[Kuršių Nerija National Park]] in Lithuania ''(pictured)'' is a part of the [[Curonian Spit]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]
Countries that border on the sea:

{{DEN}}, {{EST}}, {{FIN}}, {{DEU}}, {{LAT}}, {{LIT}}, {{POL}}, {{RUS}}, {{SWE}}.

Countries that are in the [[drainage basin]] but do not border on the sea:

{{BLR}}, {{CZE}}, {{NOR}}, {{SVK}}, {{UKR}}.

The Baltic sea drainage basin is roughly four times the surface area of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden and Finland containing the majority of the forest, especially around the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

About 20% of the land is used for agriculture and pasture, mainly in Poland and around the edge of the Baltic Proper, in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

The rest of the land is heavily populated.
About 85 million people live in the Baltic drainage basin, 15 million within {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} of the coast and 29 million within {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} of the coast. Around 22 million live in population centers of over 250,000. 90% of these are concentrated in the {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} band around the coast. Of the nations containing all or part of the basin, Poland includes 45% of the 85 million, Russia 12%, Sweden 10% and the others less than 6% each.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Geology==
{{Double image|right|Baltic History 7500-BC.svg|250|Suomi jaakauden jalkeen.png|175|[[Ancylus Lake]] around 8 700 years BP. The relic of Scandinavian Glacier in white. The river Svea älv (Svea river) formed an outlet to the [[Atlantic]].|Much of modern [[Finland]] is former seabed or archipelago: illustrated are sea levels immediately after the last ice age.}}

The Baltic Sea somewhat resembles a [[river]]bed, with two tributaries, the [[Gulf of Finland]] and [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. [[Geology|Geological]] surveys show that before the [[Pleistocene]] instead of the Baltic Sea, there was a wide plain around a big river paleontologists call the [[Eridanos (geology)|Eridanos]]. Several [[glaciation]] episodes during the [[Pleistocene]] scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. By the time of the last, or [[Eemian Stage]] ([[Marine isotopic stage|MIS]]&nbsp;5e), the Eemian sea was in place. Instead of a true sea, the Baltic can even today also be understood as the common [[estuary]] of all rivers flowing into it.

From that time the waters underwent a geologic history summarized under the names listed below. Many of the stages are named after marine animals (e.g. the [[Littorina]] [[mollusk]]) that are clear markers of changing water temperatures and salinity.

The factors that determined the sea's characteristics were the submergence or emergence of the region due to the weight of ice and subsequent isostatic readjustment, and the connecting channels it found to the [[North Sea]]-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], either through the straits of [[Denmark]] or at what are now the large lakes of [[Sweden]], and the [[White Sea]]-[[Arctic Sea]].
* [[Eemian Sea]], 130,000–115,000 (years ago)
* [[Baltic ice lake]], 12,600–10,300
* [[Yoldia Sea]], 10,300–9500
* [[Ancylus Lake]], 9,500–8,000
* [[Mastogloia Sea]] 8,000–7,500
* [[Littorina Sea]], 7,500–4,000
* Post-littorina Sea 4,000–present

The land is still emerging [[isostasy|isostatically]] from its subsident state, which was caused by the weight of the last glaciation. The phenomenon is known as [[post-glacial rebound]]. Consequently, the surface area and the depth of the sea are diminishing. The uplift is about eight millimetres per year on the Finnish coast of the northernmost Gulf of Bothnia. In the area, the former seabed is only gently sloped, leading to large areas of land being reclaimed in, geologically speaking, relatively short periods (decades and centuries).

== Biology ==
[[File:Phytoplankton bloom in the Baltic Sea (July 3, 2001).jpg|thumb|[[Phytoplankton]] [[algal bloom]] in the Baltic Proper, 3 July 2001.]]
Approximately {{convert|100000|km²|0|abbr=on}} of the Baltic's seafloor (a quarter of its total area) is a variable [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]. The more saline (and therefore denser) water remains on the bottom, isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere. This leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone. It is mainly bacteria that grow in it, digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide. Because of this large anaerobic zone, the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring Atlantic.

Plans to artificially oxygenate areas of the Baltic that have experienced eutrophication have been proposed by the [[University of Gothenburg]] and Inocean AB. The proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxygenation at a Depth of 120 Meters Could Save the Baltic Sea, Researchers Demonstrate|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110418141617.htm|publisher=Science Daily}}</ref>

Since the Baltic Sea is so young there are only a few [[Endemism|endemic]] species, such as the small cockle ''[[Parvicardium hauniense]]'' and the asexually reproducing alga ''[[Fucus radicans]]''. However, several marine species have populations in the Baltic Sea adapted to the low salinity, such as the Baltic Sea [[herring]] which is smaller than the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] herring. The [[benthos|benthic fauna]] consists mainly of ''[[Monoporeia affinis]]'', which is originally a freshwater species. The lack of [[tides]] has affected the marine species as compared with the Atlantic.

The fish fauna of the Baltic sea is a mixture of marine species such as [[cod]], herring, [[hake]], [[plaice]], [[flounder]], [[shorthorn sculpin]] and [[turbot]], and freshwater species such as [[perch]], [[Northern pike|pike]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[Common Roach|roach]].

A peculiar feature of the fauna is that it contains a number of glacial [[relict species]], isolated populations of arctic species which have remained in the Baltic Sea since the last [[glaciation]], such as the large isopod ''[[Saduria entomon]]'', the Baltic subspecies of [[ringed seal]], and the [[fourhorn sculpin]].

There is a decrease in faunal species from the Belts to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The decreasing salinity along this path causes restrictions in both physiology and habitats.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oceanography: An Illustrated Guide |editor-first=C.

Satellite images taken in July 2010 revealed a massive [[algal bloom]] covering {{convert|377000|sqkm|mi2}} in the Baltic Sea. The area of the bloom extends from Germany and Poland to Finland. Researchers of the phenomenon have indicated that algal blooms have occurred every summer for decades. Fertilizer runoff from surrounding agricultural land has exacerbated the problem and led to increased [[eutrophication]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Satellite spies vast algal bloom in Baltic Sea|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10740097|accessdate=27 July 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100726191305/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10740097| archivedate= 26 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Construction of the [[Great Belt Bridge]] in Denmark (completed 1997) and the [[Øresund Bridge]]-Tunnel (completed 1999), linking Denmark with Sweden, provided a highway and railroad connection between Sweden and the Danish mainland (the [[Jutland Peninsula]]). The undersea tunnel of the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships into and out of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned about oil pollution.

Much shipbuilding is carried out in the shipyards around the Baltic Sea. The largest shipyards are at [[Gdańsk]], [[Gdynia]], and [[Szczecin]], Poland; [[Kiel]], Germany; [[Karlskrona]], Sweden; [[Malmö]], Sweden; [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Turku]], and [[Helsinki]], Finland; [[Riga]], [[Ventspils]], and [[Liepāja]] (Latvia); [[Klaipėda]] (Lithuania); and [[St. Petersburg, Russia]].

There are several cargo and passenger ferries that operate on the Baltic Sea, such as [[Scandlines]], [[Silja Line]], [[Polferries]], the [[Viking Line]], [[Tallink]], and [[Superfast Ferries]].

== The Helsinki Convention ==

===1974 Convention===
For the first time ever, all the sources of pollution around an entire sea were made subject to a single convention, signed in 1974 by the then seven Baltic coastal states. The 1974 Convention entered into force on 3 May 1980.

===1992 Convention===
In the light of political changes and developments in international environmental and maritime law, a new convention was signed in 1992 by all the states bordering on the Baltic Sea, and the European Community. After ratification the [[Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area|Convention]] entered into force on 17 January 2000. The Convention covers the whole of the Baltic Sea area, including inland waters and the water of the sea itself, as well as the seabed. Measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the Baltic Sea to reduce land-based pollution. The Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992, entered into force on 17 January 2000.

The governing body of the Convention is the Helsinki Commission,<ref>[http://www.helcom.fi/home/en_GB/welcome/ Helcom : Welcome]. Helcom.fi. Retrieved on 23 June 2011.</ref> also known as HELCOM, or Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. The present contracting parties are Denmark, Estonia, the European Community, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden.

The ratification instruments were deposited by the European Community, Germany, Latvia and Sweden in 1994, by Estonia and Finland in 1995, by Denmark in 1996, by Lithuania in 1997 and by Poland and Russia in November 1999.
