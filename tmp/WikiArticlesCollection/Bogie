A '''bogie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|ɡ|i}} {{Respell|BOH|ghee}})<!-- Sound does not work --> or  '''truck'''  is a [[wheel]]ed wagon or trolley. In [[Machine|mechanics]] terms, a bogie is a [[chassis]] or framework carrying wheels, attached to a vehicle, thus serving as a [[modularity|modular]] subassembly of wheels and axles. Bogies take various forms in various modes of transport. A bogie may remain normally attached (as on a railway carriage/car or locomotive, or on a [[semi-trailer]]) or be quickly detachable (as the [[dolly (trailer)|dolly]] in a [[road train]]); it may contain a [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] within it (as most rail and trucking bogies do), or be solid and in turn be suspended (as most bogies of [[continuous track|tracked]] vehicles are); it may be mounted on a swivel, as on a railway carriage/car or locomotive, or additionally jointed and sprung (as in the [[landing gear]] of an [[airliner]]).

A '''bogie''' in the UK, or a '''railroad truck''', '''wheel truck''', or simply '''truck''' in North America, is a structure underneath a [[train]] to which [[axle]]s (and, hence, [[wheel]]s) are attached through [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s. In [[Indian English]], bogie may also refer to an entire [[railway carriage]].<ref>http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/bogie</ref>

The first British railway to build coaches with bogies, instead of rigidly mounted axles, was the [[Midland Railway]] in 1874.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkinson |first=David |authorlink=David Jenkinson |title=British Railway Carriages of the 20th Century - Volume 1: The end of an era, 1901-22 |year=1988 |publisher=Guild Publishing |location=London |id=CN 8130 |page=10 }}</ref>

Bogies serve a number of purposes:<ref name="how">{{cite journal | author = Isao Okamoto | year = 1998 | month = December | title = How Bogies Work | journal = Japan Railway & Transport Review  | volume =  | issue = 18 | pages = 52–61 | url = http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr18/pdf/f52_technology.pdf }}</ref>

* Support of the rail vehicle body.
* Stability on both straight and curved track.
* Ensuring ride comfort by absorbing vibration and minimizing the impact of centrifugal forces when the train runs on curves at high speed.
* Minimizing generation of track irregularities and rail abrasion

Usually, two bogies are fitted to each [[railroad car|carriage]], wagon or [[locomotive]], one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in [[articulated vehicle]]s, which places the bogies (often [[jacobs bogie]]s) under the connection between the carriages or wagons.

Most bogies have two axles, as this is the simplest design,<ref name="how" /> but some cars designed for extremely heavy loads have been built with up to five axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using [[span bolster]]s to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars.

Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a double decker [[bilevel rail car|train]] to increase interior space while staying within [[Loading gauge|height restrictions]], or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.

Key components of a bogie include:<ref name="how" />
* The bogie frame: This can be of inside frame type where the main frame and bearings are between the wheels, or (more commonly) of outside frame type where the main frame and bearings are outside the wheels.
* [[suspension (vehicle)|Suspension]] to absorb shocks between the bogie frame and the rail vehicle body: Common types are [[coil spring]]s, or rubber airbags.
* At least one [[Wheelset (railroad)|wheelset]], composed of an [[axle]] with a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s and [[wheel]] at each end
* Axle box suspensions absorb shocks between the axle bearings and the bogie frame. The axle box suspension usually consists of a spring between the bogie frame and axle bearings to permit up-and-down movement, and sliders to prevent lateral movement. A more modern design uses solid rubber springs.
* [[Brake (railway)|Brake equipment]]: Two main types are used: [[brake shoe]]s that are pressed against the tread of the wheel, and [[disc brake]]s and pads.
* In powered vehicles, some form of [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], usually electrically powered [[traction motor]]s or a hydraulically powered [[torque converter]]

The connections of the bogie with the rail vehicle allow a certain degree of rotational movement around a vertical axis pivot (bolster), with side bearers preventing excessive movement. More modern, bolsterless bogie designs omit these features, instead taking advantage of the sideways movement of the suspension to permit rotational movement.<ref name="how" />

=== Examples ===

==== BR1 bogie ====

The [[British Railways Mark 1]] coach brought into production in 1950 used the BR1 bogie, which was rated to run at {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The wheels were cast as a one-piece item in a pair with their axle. The simple design involved the bogie resting on four [[leaf spring]]s (one spring per wheel), which in turn were connected to the axles. The leaf springs were designed to absorb any movement or resonance and to have a damping effect to benefit [[ride quality]].

Each spring was connected to the outermost edge of the axle by a roller bearing contained in oil-filled axle box. The oil had to be topped up at regular maintenance times to avoid the bearing running hot and seizing.

There was also a heavy-duty version designated BR2.

==== Commonwealth bogie ====
[[File:Commonwealth bogie.jpg|thumb|Commonwealth bogie as used on BR Mark 1 and CIE Park Royals]]

The Commonwealth bogie, manufactured by the [[English Steel Corporation]] under licence from the Commonwealth Rail Company in America. Fitted with [[SKF]] or [[Timken Company|Timken]] bearings, it was introduced in the late 1950s for all BR Mark 1 vehicles. It was a heavy, cast-steel design weighing about {{convert|6.5|LT|lk=on}},<ref>{{cite book |last=Parkin |first=Keith |title=British Railways Mark 1 Coaches |year=1991 |publisher=Pendragon |location=Penryn |isbn=0-906899-49-4 |page=35 |ref=harv }}</ref> with sealed roller bearings on the axle ends, avoiding the need to maintain [[axle box]] oil levels.

The leaf springs were replaced by coil springs (one per wheel) running vertically rather than horizontally. The advanced design gave a better ride quality than the BR1, being rated for {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0abbr=on}}.

The side frame of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, allowing the axle boxes vertical movements between them.  The axle boxes had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them.  The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs.  The effect was to allow the bar to act as a compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle.  The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.

==== B4 bogie ====
[[File:Bogie BT4.JPG|thumb|B4 bogie as used on BR Mark 2 and Irish Cravens]]

The B4 bogie was introduced in 1963.  It was a fabricated steel design versus cast iron and was lighter than the Commonwealth, weighing in at {{convert|5|LT|2}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Parkin|1991|p=37}}</ref> It also had a speed rating of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0abbr=on}}.

Axle/spring connection was again with fitted roller bearings.  However, now two coil springs rather than one were fitted per wheel.<ref>[http://www.wsr.org.uk/bogies.htm  Unofficial West Somerset Railway website - Bogies]</ref>

Only a very small number of Mark 1 stock was fitted with the B4 bogie from new, it being used on the Mark 1 only to replace worn BR1 bogies.  The [[British Rail Mark 2]] coach, however, carried the B4 bogies from new. A heavier-duty version, the B5, was standard on Southern Region Mk1-based EMUs from the 1960s onwards. Some Mark 1 catering cars had mixed bogies—a B5 under the kitchen end, and a B4 under the seating end. Some of the B4-fitted Mark 2s, as well as many B4-fitted Mark 1 [[Brake Gangwayed|BG]]s were allowed to run at {{convert|110|mph}} with extra maintenance, particularly of the wheel profile, and more frequent exams.

==== BT10 Bogie ====
[[File:Bogie BT10.JPG|thumb|BT10 high-speed bogie as used on MK3]]

The BT10 bogie was introduced on the [[British Rail Mark 3]] coach in the 1970s. Each wheel is separately connected to the bogie by a swing-arm axle.

There is dual suspension:
*primary suspension via a coil spring and damper mounted on each axle
*secondary suspension via two air springs mounted on the pivot plank, this is connected to the bogie by pendulum links.  A constant coach height is maintained by air valves.<ref>[http://www.uctc.net/papers/114.pdf ''Roger Barnett'' - British Rail’s InterCity 125 and 225]</ref>

==== Locomotives ====
;Diesel and electric
{{Main|AAR wheel arrangement}}

Most [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s are carried on bogies (trucks - US). Trucks used in the USA include [[AAR type A switcher truck]], [[Blomberg B]], [[HT-C truck]] and [[Flexicoil]].<ref>http://www.hosam.com/emd/emd6a.html</ref>

;Steam
On a [[steam locomotive]], the [[leading wheel]]s and [[trailing wheel]]s may be mounted on bogies.  [[Articulated locomotive]]s (e.g. the [[Fairlie]]) have '''power bogies''' similar to those on diesel and electric locomotives.

=== Tramway ===

==== Modern ====
[[File:Septa PCC car truck.jpg|thumb|Side view of a [[SEPTA]] K-Car bogie]]

Tram bogies are much simpler in design because of their axle load, and the tighter curves found on tramways mean tram bogies almost never have more than two axles. Furthermore, some tramways have steeper gradients and vertical, as well as horizontal, curves, which means tram bogies often need to pivot on the horizontal axis, as well.

Some [[articulated tram]]s have bogies located under articulations, a setup referred to as a [[Jacobs bogie]]. Often, [[low-floor tram]]s are fitted with nonpivoting bogies and many [[tramway enthusiast]]s see this as a retrograde step, as it leads to more wear of both track and wheels and also significantly reduces the speed at which a tram can round a curve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |title=ČVUT.cz - Čapek, Kolář |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> The only 100% low-floor tram with pivoting bogies - [[Škoda 15 T|Škoda ForCity]] - uses the Jacobs bogie.

==== Historic ====
In the past, many different types of bogie (truck) have been used under tramcars, e.g. "[[J. G. Brill and Company|Brill]]", "Peckham" and "maximum traction".  A maximum traction truck has one driving axle with large wheels and one nondriving axle with smaller wheels.  The bogie pivot is located off-centre, so more than half the weight rests on the driving axle.

=== Hybrid systems ===
[[File:Bogie-metro-Meteor-p1010692.jpg|thumb|[[Mockup]] of the pneumatic bogie system of a [[MP 89]] carriage used on the [[Paris Métro Line 14|''Meteor'' metro]], showing the two [[Wheelset (rail transport)#Special wheelsets|special wheelsets]]]]

The retractable stadium roof on Toronto's [[Roger's Centre]] used modified off-the-shelf train bogies on a circular rail. The system was chosen for its proven reliability. 

[[Rubber-tyred metro]] trains use a specialised version of railway bogies. Special flanged steel wheels are behind the rubber-tired running wheels, with additional horizontal guide wheels in front of and behind the running wheels, as well. The unusually large flanges on the steel wheels guide the bogie through standard [[railroad switch]]es, and in addition keep the train from [[derailment|derailing]] in case the tires deflate.

=== Variable gauge axles ===

To overcome [[break of gauge|breaks of gauge]] some bogies are being fitted with [[variable gauge]] axles (VGA) so that they can operate on two different gauges.  These include the [[SUW 2000]] system from [[ZNTK Poznań]].

===Cleminson system===
The Cleminson system is not a true bogie, but serves a similar purpose. It was based on a patent of 1883 by James Cleminson,<ref>http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/docserver/fulltext/imotp.1897.19461.pdf?expires=1315520526&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=AD521ED02561C3CF38D1772ECF1ACA2B {{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> and was once popular on narrow-gauge rolling stock, e.g. on the [[Isle of Man Railway rolling stock|Isle of Man]] and [[Manx Northern Railway]]s.  The vehicle would have three axles and the outer two could pivot to adapt to curvature of the track.  The pivoting was controlled by levers attached to the third (centre) axle, which could slide sideways.<ref>http://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/Cleminson_Flexible_Six-Wheeled_Waggon</ref>

== Tracked vehicles ==

Some [[tank]]s and other [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles have bogies as external suspension components (see [[suspension (vehicle)#Armoured fighting vehicle suspension|armoured fighting vehicle suspension]]). This type of bogie usually has two or more road wheels and some type of sprung suspension to smooth the ride across rough terrain. Bogie suspensions keep much of their components on the outside of the vehicle, saving internal space. Although vulnerable to [[antitank]] fire, they can often be repaired or replaced in the field.

==Articulated lorries (tractor-trailers)==
In [[Road transport#Trucking and hauling|trucking]], a bogie is the subassembly of axles and wheels that supports a [[semi-trailer]], whether permanently attached to the frame (as on a single trailer) or making up the [[dolly (trailer)|dolly]] that can be hitched and unhitched as needed when hitching up a second or third semi-trailer (as when [[semi-trailer|pulling doubles]] or [[road train|triples]]).
