The '''Choctaw''' (alternatively spelled '''Chahta''', '''Chactas''', '''Tchakta''', '''Chocktaw''', and '''Chactaw''') are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people originally from the [[Southeastern United States]] (modern day [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]]). The [[Choctaw language]] belongs to the [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean linguistic]] group. 
The Choctaw are descendants of the peoples of the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Mississippian culture]]s, who lived throughout the east of the [[Mississippi River]] valley and its tributaries. About 1,700 years ago, the Hopewell people built [[Nanih Waiya]], a great [[earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[mound]], which is still considered sacred by the Choctaw. The early [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish explorers]] of the mid-16th century encountered Mississippian-culture villages and chiefs.<ref name=walter_williams_antecedents>

The Choctaw coalesced as a people in the 17th century, and developed three distinct political and geographical divisions: eastern, western and southern, which sometimes created differing alliances with nearby European powers. These included the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana, the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] of the Southeast, and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the [[American Revolution]], most Choctaw supported the [[Thirteen Colonies]]' bid for independence from the [[British Empire|British Crown]]. They never went to war against the United States prior to Indian Removal. 

In the 19th century, the Choctaw became known as one of the "[[Five Civilized Tribes]]" because they adopted numerous practices of their United States neighbors. The Choctaw and the United States (US) agreed to nine treaties and, by the last three, the US gained vast land cessions and [[Forced migration|deracinated]] most Choctaw west of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Indian Territory]].  They were the first Native Americans forced under the [[Indian Removal Act]]. The Choctaw were exiled because the U.S. wanted to expand territory available for settlement by European Americans,<ref name=Jackson_PBS>

Their early government had three districts, each with its own chief, who together with the town chiefs sat on the National Council.

</ref> (Article 8 in the 1817 treaty with the Cherokee stated Cherokees may wish to become citizen of the United States.) During the [[American Civil War]], the Choctaw in both [[Oklahoma]] and Mississippi mostly sided with the [[Confederate States of America]]. The Confederacy suggested it would support a state under Indian control if it won the war. In a new treaty after the war, the US required them to [[emancipate]] their [[slaves]] and offer them full citizenship; they have become known as [[Choctaw Freedmen]]. After the Civil War, the Mississippi Choctaw fell into obscurity for some time. 

The Choctaw in Oklahoma struggled to build a nation, transferring the Choctaw Academy there and opening one for girls in the 1840s. In the aftermath of the [[Dawes Act]], the US dissolved tribal governments and appointed chiefs. During [[World War I]], Choctaw soldiers served in the U.S. military as the first Native American [[codetalkers]], using the [[Choctaw language]]. After the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, the Choctaw reconstituted their government, and the Choctaw Nation had kept their culture alive despite years of pressure for [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|assimilation]]. The third largest federally recognized tribe, since the mid-twentieth century, they have created new institutions, such as a [[tribal college]], housing authority, and justice system. Today the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] and the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]] are the two federally recognized Choctaw tribes; Mississippi recognizes another band, and smaller Choctaw groups are located in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas.

Direct evidence in the Southeast is meager, but archaeological discoveries in related areas support this hypothesis.<ref name=guy_prentice />

===Woodland culture===
Later cultures became more complex. Moundbuilding cultures included the [[Woodland period]] people who first built [[Nanih Waiya]]. Scholars believe the mound was contemporary with such earthworks as Igomar Mound in Mississippi and [[Pinson Mounds]] in [[Tennessee]].<ref name="nps.gov"/> Based on dating of surface artifacts, the Nanih Waiya mound was likely constructed and first occupied by [[indigenous peoples]] about 0-300 [[Common Era|CE]], in the [[Middle Woodland]] period. 

The original site was bounded on three sides by an [[earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] circular enclosure, about ten feet high and encompassing a square mile. Occupation of Nanih Waiya and several smaller nearby mounds likely continued through 700 CE, the Late [[Woodland Period]]. The smaller mounds may also have been built by later cultures. As they have been lost to cultivation since the late 19th century and the area has not been excavated, theories have been speculation.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/cg/vol1_num1/mother.htm Ken Carleton, "Nanih Waiya: Mother Mound of the Choctaw"], ''The Delta Endangered'', Spring 1996, Vol.1 (1), NPS Archeology Program, accessed 16 November 2009</ref>

===Mississippian culture===

The Mississippian culture was a Native American culture that flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from 800 to 1500 CE. The [[Mississippian culture]] developed in the lower [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi river valley]] and its tributaries, including the Ohio River.

===17th century emergence of Choctaw  ===
The contemporary historian Patricia Galloway argues from fragmentary [[archaeological]] and cartographic evidence that the Choctaw did not exist as a unified people before the 17th century. Only then did various southeastern peoples, remnants of [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]], [[Plaquemine culture|Plaquemine]], and other [[Mississippian culture]]s, coalesce to form a self-consciously Choctaw people.<ref name=GALLOWAY>{{Cite book|authorlink=Patricia Galloway| last=Galloway|first=Patricia|title= Choctaw Genesis, 1500-1700 (Indians of the Southeast)|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|page=|isbn=0-8032-7070-4|year=1995}}</ref> The historical homeland of the Choctaw, or of the peoples from whom the Choctaw nation arose, included the area of ''[[Nanih Waiya]]'', an [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mound]] in present-day [[Winston County, Mississippi]], which they considered [[sacred|sacred ground]]. Their homeland was bounded by the [[Tombigbee River]] to the east, the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] on the north and west, and "the Leaf-Pascagoula system" to the South.

While Nanih Waiya mound continued to be a ceremonial center and object of veneration, scholars believe Native Americans traveled to it during the Mississippian culture period. From the 17th century on, the Choctaw occupied this area and revered this site as the center of their origin stories. These included stories of [[Human migration|migration]] to this site from west of the great river (believed to refer to the Mississippi River.)<ref name="nps.gov">[http://www.nps.gov/history/archeology/cg/vol1_num1/mother.htm Ken Carleton, "Nanih Waiya: Mother Mound of the Choctaw"], ''The Delta Endangered'', Spring 1996, Vol.1 (1), NPS Archeology Program, ''Common Ground'', accessed 16 November 2009</ref>

The [[archaeological]] record for the period between 1567 and 1699 is not complete or well-studied. It appears that some Mississippian settlements were abandoned well before the 17th century. Similarities in pottery coloring and burials suggest the following scenario for the emergence of the distinctive Choctaw society.<ref name=GALLOWAY/>

According to Patricia Galloway, the Choctaw region of Mississippi, generally located between the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] basin to the north and the [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] bluffs to the south, was slowly occupied by Burial Urn people from the [[Bottle Creek Indian Mounds]] area in the [[Mobile, Alabama]] delta, along with remnants of people from the [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] chiefdom (near present-day [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]), which had collapsed some years before. Facing severe depopulation, they fled westward, where they combined with the [[Plaquemines]] and a group of “prairie people” living near the area. When this occurred is not clear. In the space of several generations, they created a new society which became known as Choctaw (albeit with a strong Mississippian background).<ref name=GALLOWAY/>

Other scholars note the Choctaw oral history recounting their long migration from west of the Mississippi River.

As the historian Greg O'Brien has noted, the Choctaw developed three distinct political and geographic regions, which during the colonial period sometimes had differing alliances with trading partners among the French, Spanish and English. They also expressed differences during and after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Their divisions were roughly eastern, western (near present-day [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]) and southern (Six Towns). Each division was headed by a principal [[Tribal chief|chief]], and subordinate chiefs led each of the towns within the area.  All the chiefs would meet on a National Council, but the society was highly decentralized for some time.<ref name="O'Brien1">[http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002388821 "The Conqueror Meets the Unconquered: Negotiating Cultural Boundaries on the Post-Revolutionary Southern Frontier"], ''Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 67, 2001, accessed 15 October 2011</ref>

The French were the main trading partners of the Choctaw before the [[Seven Years' War]], and the British had established some trading. After Great Britain defeated France, it ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River. From 1763 to 1781, Britain was the Choctaw main trading partner. With Spanish forces based in [[New Orleans]] in 1766, when they took over French territory west of the Mississippi, the Choctaw sometimes traded with them to the west.  Spain declared war against Great Britain during the [[American Revolution]] in 1779.<ref name="O'Brien1"/>

As the people had a [[matrilineal]] system of property and hereditary leadership, their children were born into the mother's [[clan]] and gained their status from her people. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, a number of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] traders lived among the Choctaw and married high-status women. Choctaw chiefs saw these as strategic alliances to build stronger relationships with the Americans in a changing environment that influenced ideas of capital and property. The children of such marriages were Choctaw, first and foremost. Some of the sons were educated in Anglo-American schools and became important interpreters and negotiators for Choctaw-US relations.

Early in 1811, the [[Shawnee]] leader ''[[Tecumseh]]'' gathered Indian tribes in an alliance to try to expel U.S. settlers from the Northwest area south of the Great Lakes. Tecumseh met the Choctaws to persuade them to join the alliance. ''[[Pushmataha]]'', considered by historians to be the greatest Choctaw leader, countered Tecumseh's influence. As chief for the Six Towns (southern) district, Pushmataha strongly resisted such a plan, arguing that the Choctaw and their neighbors the [[Chickasaw]] had always lived in peace with European Americans, had learned valuable skills and technologies, and had received honest treatment and fair trade.<ref name=jones>

Pushmataha died in Washington of a respiratory disease described as [[croup]], before the delegation returned to the Choctaw Nation. He was given full U.S. military burial honors at the [[Congressional Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C. 

The deaths of these two strong division leaders was a major loss to the Choctaw Nation, but younger leaders were arising who were educated in European-American schools and led adaptation of the culture. Threatened with European-American encroachment, the Choctaw continued to adapt and take on some technology, housing styles, and accepted [[missionaries]] to the Choctaw Nation, in the hopes of being accepted by the Mississippi and national government. In 1825 the National Council approved the founding of the Choctaw Academy for education of its young men, urged by [[Peter Pitchlynn]], a young leader and future chief.  The school was established in Blue Spring, [[Scott County, Kentucky]]; it was operated there until 1842, when the staff and students were transferred to the Choctaw Nation, [[Indian Territory]]. There they founded the Spencer Academy in 1844.

With the election of [[Andrew Jackson]] as president in 1828, many of the Choctaw realized that removal was inevitable. They continued to adopt useful European practices but faced Jackson's and settlers' unrelenting pressure.

===1830 election and treaty===
In March 1830 the division chiefs resigned, and the National Council elected [[Greenwood LeFlore]], chief of the western division, as Principal Chief of the nation to negotiate with the US government on their behalf, the first time such a position had been authorized. Believing removal was inevitable and hoping to preserve rights for Choctaw in Indian Territory and Mississippi, LeFlore drafted a treaty and sent it to Washington, DC.  There was considerable turmoil in the Choctaw Nation among people who thought he would and could resist removal, but the chiefs had agreed they could not undertake armed resistance.<ref name="Carson1">[http://books.google.com/books?id=jGFmNPevedUC&pg=PR5&dq=Choctaws+in+a+Revolutionary+Age,+1750-1830&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q=Choctaws%20in%20a%20Revolutionary%20Age%2C%201750-1830&f=false James Taylor Carson, "Greenwood LeFlore: Southern Creole, Choctaw Chief"], in ''Pre-Removal Choctaw History: Exploring New Paths'', ed.

He was elected as a [[Mississippi]] representative and [[Mississippi Senate|senator]], was a fixture of Mississippi high society, and a personal friend of [[Jefferson Davis]]. He represented his county in the state house for two terms and served as a state senator for one term. Some of the elite used [[Latin language]], an indulgence used by some politicians. LeFlore, in defense of his heritage, spoke in the [[Choctaw language]] and asked the Senate floor which was better understood, Latin or Choctaw.<ref>Kidwell (1995)</ref>

<blockquote>"It had been just 16 years since the Choctaw people had experienced the Trail of Tears, and they had faced starvation ... It was an amazing gesture. By today's standards, it might be a million dollars" according to Judy Allen, editor of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma's newspaper, ''Bishinik'', based at the Oklahoma Choctaw tribal headquarters in Durant, Oklahoma.</blockquote> To mark the 150th anniversary, eight Irish people retraced the Trail of Tears.<ref name="famine">

Without notice a reconnoitering party of the enemy raided the camp, and captured over two dozen Indians and several non-commissioned white officers and carried them to New Orleans.

===Choctaw Under Reconstruction (1865)===

====Mississippi Choctaw====
[[Image:Portrait of Two Girls 1868.jpg|right|205px|thumb|Choctaw girls in 1868. Smithsonian Institution.]]

From about 1865 to 1918, Mississippi Choctaws were largely ignored by governmental, health, and educational services and fell into obscurity.  In the aftermath of the Civil War, their issues were pushed aside in the struggle between defeated Confederates, [[freedmen]] and Union sympathizers.  Records about the Mississippi Choctaw during this period are non-existent. They had no legal recourse, and were often bullied and intimidated by local whites, who tried to re-establish [[white supremacy]].<ref name=howard_and_Levine>

Following the [[Reconstruction era]] and conservative Democrats' regaining political power in the late 1870s, white state legislators passed laws establishing [[Jim Crow laws]] and legal segregation by race.

At the turn of the 20th century, only 1,253 Choctaw Indians remained in Mississippi. "The beginning of the 20th century found Mississippi Choctaws struggling to overcome poverty, discrimination, and lack of opportunity." <ref>[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/choctaw_hert.html Deborah Boykin, "Choctaw Heritage of Louisiana and Mississippi"], Louisiana Folklife Program, 2000, accessed 25 March 2009</ref>

After a US Congressional investigation discovered their poor living conditions, in 1918 the US [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) established the Choctaw Agency. Under [[Racial segregation|segregation]], few schools were open to Choctaw children, whom the white southerners classified as non-whites. The Choctaw agency was based in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], a center of several Indian communities. It set up elementary schools and worked to address the poor health conditions of the Choctaw, building a hospital in Philadelphia for tribal members.<ref name="mshistory.k12.ms.us">[http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/10/choctaw-indians-in-the-21st-century  Deborah Boykin, "Choctaw Indians in the 21st Century"], Mississippi History Now, accessed 25 March 2009</ref> Dr. Frank McKinley was the first superintendent. Prior to McKinley's arrival, the Choctaw had grouped themselves in six communities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Because the state remained dependent on agriculture, despite the declining price of cotton, most landless men earned a living by becoming [[sharecroppers]]. The women created and sold traditional hand-woven baskets. Choctaw sharecropping declined following World War II as major planters had adopted mechanization, which reduced the need for labor.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

</ref> In post-war treaties, the US government also acquired land in the western part of the territory and access rights for [[railroads]] to be built across Indian Territory.

The improved transportation afforded by the railroads increased the pressure on the Choctaw Nation.  It drew large-scale mining and timber operations, which added to tribal receipts. But, the railroads and industries also attracted European-American settlers, including new immigrants to the United States.<ref name="Kidwell 2007">Kidwell (2007)</ref>

With the goal of assimilating the Native Americans, the [[Curtis Act of 1898]], sponsored by a Native American who believed that was the way for his people to do better, ended tribal governments. In addition, it proposed the end of communal, tribal lands.  Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in [[severalty]] (individually). The US declared land in excess of the registered households needs to be "surplus" to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers.  In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the [[Dawes Commission]] to manage the land allotment policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.<ref name="Kidwell 2007"/>

Beginning in 1894, the Dawes Commission was established to register Choctaw and other families of the Indian Territory, so that the former tribal lands could be properly distributed among them. The final list included 18,981 citizens of the Choctaw Nation, 1,639 Mississippi Choctaw, and 5,994 former slaves, most held by Choctaws in the Indian/Oklahoma Territory. (At the same time, the Dawes Commission registered members of the other Five Civilized Tribes for the same purpose.  The Dawes Rolls have become important records for proving tribal membership.) Following completion of the land allotments, the US proposed to end tribal governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and admit the two territories jointly as a state.<ref name="Kidwell 2007" />

====Territory transition to Oklahoma statehood (1889)====
{{Further|Indian Territory|Oklahoma Territory}}

[[Image:Choctaw Senate.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Choctaw Nation senate in 1898. Oklahoma Historical Society.]]

The establishment of Oklahoma Territory following the Civil War was a required land cession by the Five Civilized Tribes, who had supported the Confederacy. The government used its railroad access to the Oklahoma Territory to stimulate development there. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 included an amendment by Illinois Representative [[William McKendree Springer]], that authorized President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to open the two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km²) of Oklahoma Territory for settlement, resulting in the [[Land Run of 1889]]. The Choctaw Nation was overwhelmed with new settlers and could not regulate their activities. In the late 19th century, Choctaws suffered almost daily from violent crimes, murders, thefts and assaults from whites and from other Choctaws. Intense factionalism divided the traditionalistic "Nationalists" and pro-assimilation "Progressives," who fought for control.<ref>Devon Abbott Mihesuah, ''Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884-1907'' (2009)</ref>

In 1905, delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes met at the [[Sequoyah Convention]] to write a constitution for an Indian-controlled state.  They wanted to have Indian Territory admitted as the [[State of Sequoyah]]. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, eastern states' representatives opposed it, not wanting to have two western states created in the area, as the Republicans feared that both would be Democrat-dominated, as the territories had a southern tradition of settlement.  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a Republican, ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to be jointly admitted as one state, Oklahoma.  To achieve this, tribal governments had to end and all residents accept state government.  Many of the leading Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.<ref name=choctaw_ok_statehood />

In 1906 the U.S. dissolved the governments of the Five Civilized Tribes. This action was part of continuing negotiations by Native Americans and European Americans over the best proposals for the future. The Choctaw Nation continued to protect resources not stipulated in treaty or law.<ref name="Kidwell 2007"/> On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted to the union as the 46th state.

===World War I (1918)===
[[Image:ChoctawCoders.jpg|right|thumb|Choctaws in training in World War I for coded radio & telephone transmissions.]]

In the closing days of [[World War I]], a group of Choctaws serving in the [[U.S. Army]] used their native language as the basis for secret communication among Americans, as Germans could not understand it. They are now called the [[Choctaw Code Talkers]].<ref name="ctalk">

Fourteen Choctaw Indian men in the Army's [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]] trained to use their language for military communications. Their communications, which could not be understood by Germans, helped the [[American Expeditionary Force]] win several key battles in the [[Meuse-Argonne Campaign]] in [[France]], during the last big German offensive of the war. Within 24 hours after the US Army starting using the Choctaw speakers, they turned the tide of battle by controlling their communications. In less than 72 hours, the Germans were retreating and the Allies were on full attack.<ref name=choctaw_code /> The 14 Choctaw Code Talkers were Albert Billy, Mitchell Bobb, Victor Brown, Ben Caterby, James Edwards, Tobias Frazer, Ben Hampton, Solomon Louis, Pete Maytubby, Jeff Nelson, [[Joseph Oklahombi]], Robert Taylor, Calvin Wilson, and Captain Walter Veach.<ref name=choctaw_code>

More than 70 years passed before the contributions of the Choctaw Code talkers were fully recognized. On November 3, 1989, in recognition of the important role the Choctaw Code Talkers played during World War I, the French government presented the ''Chevalier de L'Ordre National du Mérite'' (the Knight of the National Order of Merit) to the Choctaws Code Talkers. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The US Army again used Choctaw speakers for coded language during [[World War II]].

===Reorganization (1934)===

During the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]], officials began numerous initiatives to alleviate some of the social and economic conditions in the South. The 1933 ''Special Narrative Report'' described the dismal state of welfare of Mississippi Choctaws, whose population by 1930 had declined to 1,665 people.<ref name="john_swanton"/> [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], the US Commissioner for Indian Affairs (now BIA), had worked for a decade on Indian affairs and been developing ideas to change federal policy.  He used the report as instrumental support to re-organize the Mississippi Choctaw as the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]]. This enabled them to establish their own tribal government, and gain a beneficial relationship with the federal government.

In 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934|Indian Reorganization Act]]. This law proved critical for survival of the Mississippi Choctaw. Baxter York, Emmett York, and Joe Chitto worked on gaining recognition for the Choctaw.<ref name=brescia_era>

With the tribe's adoption of government, in 1944 the Secretary of the Interior declared that {{convert|18000|acre|km2}} would be held in trust for the Choctaw of Mississippi. Lands in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba]] and surrounding counties were set aside as a federal [[Indian reservation]]. Eight communities were included in the reservation land: [[Bogue Chitto, Mississippi|Bogue Chitto]], Bogue Homa, [[Conehatta, Mississippi|Conehatta]], Crystal Ridge, [[Pearl River, Mississippi|Pearl River]], [[Red Water, Mississippi|Red Water]], [[Tucker, Mississippi|Tucker]], and [[Standing Pine, Mississippi|Standing Pine]].

Under the Indian Reorganization Act, the Mississippi Choctaws re-organized on April 20, 1945 as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. This gave them some independence from the Democrat-dominated state government, which continued with enforcement of racial segregation and discrimination.

===World War II (1941)===
{{Further|Native Americans and World War II}}

[[World War II]] was a significant turning point for Choctaws and Native Americans in general. Although the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] stated Mississippi Choctaws had U.S. citizenship, they had become associated with "colored people" as non-white in a state that had imposed racial segregation under [[Jim Crow laws]]. State services for Native Americans were non-existent. The state was poor and still dependent on agriculture. In its system of segregation, services for minorities were consistently underfunded. The state constitution and voter registration rules dating from the turn of the 20th century kept most Native Americans from voting, making them ineligible to serve on juries or to be candidates for local or state offices.  They were without political representation.<ref name="Stephen Edward Cresswell 2006, p.124"/>

A Mississippi Choctaw veteran stated, "Indians were not supposed to go in the military back then ... the military was mainly for whites. My category was white instead of Indian. I don't know why they did that. Even though Indians weren't citizens of this country, couldn't register to vote, didn't have a draft card or anything, they took us anyway."<ref name=choctaw_world_war_2>

After World War II, pressure in Congress mounted to reduce Washington's authority on Native American lands and liquidate the government's responsibilities to them. In 1953 the House of Representatives passed Resolution 108, proposing an end to federal services for 13 tribes deemed ready to handle their own affairs. The same year, Public Law 280 transferred jurisdiction over tribal lands to state and local governments in five states. Within a decade Congress terminated federal services to more than sixty groups despite intense opposition by Indians. Congress settled on a policy to [[Indian termination policy|terminate]] tribes as quickly as possible. Out of concern for the isolation of many Native Americans in rural areas, the federal government created relocation programs to cities to try to expand their employment opportunities. Indian policy experts hoped to expedite assimilation of Native Americans to the larger American society, which was becoming urban.<ref name="Kidwell 2007"/>  In 1959, the Choctaw Termination Act was passed.<ref name=indian_termination>{{Cite web

The Choctaw people continued to struggle economically due to bigotry, cultural isolation, and lack of jobs. The Choctaw, who for 150 years had been neither white nor black, were "left where they had always been"—in poverty.<ref name=campbell /> [[Will Campbell]], a Baptist minister and Civil Rights activist, witnessed the destitution of the Choctaw. He would later write, "the thing I remember the most ... was the depressing sight of the Choctaws, their shanties along the country roads, grown men lounging on the dirt streets of their villages in demeaning idleness, sometimes drinking from a common bottle, sharing a roll-your-own cigarette, their half-clad children a picture of hurting that would never end."<ref name=campbell /> With reorganization and establishment of tribal government, however, over the next decades they took control of "schools, health care facilities, legal and judicial systems, and social service programs."<ref>[http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/choctaw_hert.html Deborah Boykin, "Choctaw Heritage of Louisiana and Mississippi"], Louisiana Folklife Program, 2000, accessed 26 March 2009</ref>

He was eulogized as a visionary leader, who had lifted his people out of poverty with businesses and casinos built on tribal land.<ref name="nola"/>

Changes after the civil rights era were reflected in sports and other venues. In 1981, the African-American athlete, [[Marcus Dupree]], played his final high school football game at Warriors Stadium of the Choctaw Indian Reservation's [[Choctaw Tribal School System|tribal high school]]. He finished with 5,284 rushing yards on 8.3 yards per carry; there was considerable media coverage to witness the record-breaking event that was praised by many Mississippians.<ref name=W_Morris>

Soon after this, Congress passed the landmark [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975]], completing a 15-year period of federal policy reform with regard to American Indian tribes. The legislation included means by which tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage more of their own education and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' involvement on school boards.<ref name="William C.

Beginning in 1979 the tribal council worked on a variety of economic development initiatives, first geared toward attracting industry to the reservation. They had many people available to work, natural resources and no taxes. Industries have included automotive parts, greeting cards, direct mail and printing, and plastic-molding. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is one of the state's largest employers, running 19 businesses and employing 7,800 people.<ref name="mshistory.k12.ms.us"/>

Starting with New Hampshire in 1963, numerous state governments began to operate lotteries and other gambling to raise money for government services. In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[federally recognized tribes]] could operate gaming facilities on reservation land free from state regulation. In 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA). It set the terms for Native American tribes to operate [[casino]]s.<ref name="William C. Canby pp. 23-33"/>

After years of waiting under the [[Ray Mabus]] administration, Mississippi Governor [[Kirk Fordice]] in 1992 gave permission for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to develop Class III gaming. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) has one of the largest casino resorts in the nation; it is located in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. The Silver Star Casino opened its doors in 1994.

===Jack Abramoff and Indian casino lobbying===

{{Further|Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal}}
[[Image:Abramoff SIAC 20040929 2.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Video capture from video of Senate Indian Affairs Committee Hearing on 'Lobbying Practices Involving Indian Tribes' on September 29, 2004 as found at indian.senate.gov]]

In the second half of the 1990s, Abramoff was employed by Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP, the lobbying arm of [[Preston Gates & Ellis]] LLP law firm based in [[Seattle, Washington]]. In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes with gambling interests, starting with the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]]. 

The Choctaw originally had lobbied the federal government directly, but beginning in 1994, they found that many of the congressional members who had responded to their issues had either retired or were defeated in the "[[Republican Revolution]]" of the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 elections]]. Nell Rogers, the tribe's specialist on legislative affairs, had a friend who was familiar with the work of Abramoff and his father as Republican activists. The tribe contacted Preston Gates, and soon after hired the firm and Abramoff.

Abramoff succeeded in gaining defeat of a Congressional bill to use the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to tax Native American casinos, sponsored by Reps. [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] (R-TX) and [[Ernest Istook]] (R-OK). Since the matter involved taxation, Abramoff enlisted help from his college Republican acquaintance [[Grover Norquist]], and his [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR). The bill was eventually defeated in 1996 in the Senate, due in part to grassroots work by ATR, for which the Choctaw paid $60,000.

According to ''Washington Business Forward'', a lobbying trade magazine, Senator [[Tom DeLay|<nowiki>[Tom DeLay]</nowiki>]] was a major factor in those victories. The fight strengthened Abramoff's alliance with him.<ref>[http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ www.bizforward.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Purporting to represent Native Americans before Congress and state governments in this new field, [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Jack Abramoff]] and [[Michael Scanlon]] used fraudulent means to gain profits of $15 million in total payments from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. Congressional hearings were held on the issue and charges were brought against Abramoff and Scanlon.<ref name=gimme_five>

On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pled guilty to three felony counts — conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion — involving charges stemming principally from his lobbying activities in Washington on behalf of Native American tribes.

===MOWA Choctaw===
{{Further|MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians}}

For generations Choctaw lived in Mobile and Washington counties in southwestern Alabama. These Indians traced their lineage to two groups of Choctaw who settled the area in the early 19th century. The first group had been allies of the [[Red Sticks]] during the Creek War of 1813-14 and hid in the remote swamps after their defeat.The second group arrived in the 1830s, when they hid rather than be removed to the western Indian Territories. These two groups merged and lived in relative isolation from white contact for several decades.<ref name="Matte"/>

Over the years, the MOWA (for Mobile and Washington) faced discrimination, persecution, and debt peonage because of their racial status, which the federal government considered undocumented and ambiguous. Some had intermarried with African Americans or European Americans, and been classified socially by the state as black or white in the binary racial culture of the South, rather than being allowed to preserve their identity as Choctaw. In the 21st century, the MOWA Choctaw were recognized as a Native American tribe by the state of Alabama, but they are still seeking federal recognition.<ref name="Matte">Jacqueline Anderson Matte, "Extinction by Reclassification: the MOWA Choctaws of South Alabama and Their Struggle for Federal Recognition," ''Alabama Review'' 2006 59(3): 163-204,</ref>

===Choctaw in the 2010 Census===
The 2010 Census found Choctaw living in every state of the Union.<ref>2010 US Census table on reported tribes</ref>  The states with the largest Choctaw populations were:
* Oklahoma - 79,006
* Texas - 24,024

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Choctaw}}

[[Image:Tullockchishko.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Tullockchishko'' (Drinks the Juice of the Stones) was the greatest of Choctaw stickball players, 1834.]]

The Choctaw people are believed to have coalesced in the 17th century, perhaps from peoples from Alabama and the Plaquemine culture. Their culture continued to evolve in the Southeast. The Choctaw practiced [[Head flattening]] as a ritual adornment for its people, but the practice eventually fell out of favor. Some of their communities had extensive trade and interaction with Europeans, including people from [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[England]] greatly shaped it as well. After the United States was formed and its settlers began to move into the Southeast, the Choctaw were among the Five Civilized Tribes, who adopted some of their ways. They transitioned to [[yeoman]] farming methods, and accepted [[European American]]s and [[African American]]s into their society.  In mid-summer the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians celebrate their traditional culture during the [[Choctaw Indian Fair]] with ball games, dancing, cooking and entertainment.<ref name=choctawFairSummer>

===Clans===
Within the Choctaws were two distinct [[moiety (kinship)|moieties]]: ''Imoklashas'' (elders) and ''Inhulalatas'' (youth). Each moiety had several clans or ''Iskas''; it is estimated there were about 12 Iskas altogether. The people had a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, with children born into the clan or iska of the mother and taking their social status from it. In this system, their maternal uncles had important roles. Identity was established first by moiety and iska; so a Choctaw identified first as Imoklasha or Inhulata, and second as Choctaw. Children belonged to the Iska of their mother. The following were some major districts:<ref name=choctawClansJen>

</ref> When disputes arose between Choctaw communities, stickball provided a civil way to settle issues. The stickball games would involve as few as twenty or as many as 300 players. The goal posts could be from a few hundred feet apart to a few miles. Goal posts were sometimes located within each opposing team's village. A [[Jesuit]] priest referenced stickball in 1729, and George Catlin painted the subject. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians continue to practice the sport.

===Language===
{{Main|Choctaw language}}

The Choctaw language is a member of the [[Muskogean]] family and was well known among the frontiersmen, such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]], of the early 19th century. The language is closely related to [[Chickasaw]], and some linguists consider the two dialects a single language.

===Religion===

The Choctaw believed in a good spirit and an evil spirit. They may have been sun, or ''Hushtahli'', worshippers. The historian Swanton wrote, 
<blockquote>"[T]he Choctaws anciently regarded the sun as a deity ... the sun was ascribed the power of life and death. He was represented as looking down upon the earth, and as long as he kept his flaming eye fixed on any one, the person was safe ... fire, as the most striking representation of the sun, was considered as possessing intelligence, and as acting in concert with the sun ... [having] constant intercourse with the sun ..."<ref name=john_swanton /></blockquote>

If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting until the sun returned, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars.

===Traditional clothing===
The colorful dresses worn by today's Choctaw are made by hand. They are based on designs of their ancestors, who adapted 19th-century European-American styles to their needs. Today many Choctaw wear such traditional clothing mainly for special events. Choctaw elders, especially the women, dress in their traditional garb every day. Choctaw dresses are trimmed by full diamond, half diamond or circle, and crosses that represent stickball sticks.<ref name=choctaw_dress>

Land was the most valuable asset, which the Native Americans held in collective stewardship.
