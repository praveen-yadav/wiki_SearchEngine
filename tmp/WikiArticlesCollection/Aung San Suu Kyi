Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now named [[Yangon]]).<ref name = "azjarp"/> Her father, [[Aung San]], founded the [[Tatmadaw|modern Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1947; he was [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|assassinated by his rivals]] in the same year. She grew up with her mother, [[Khin Kyi]], and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of the house.<ref name="Nobel.org" /> Her elder brother emigrated to San Diego, California, becoming a [[United States citizen]].<ref name="Nobel.org" /> After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to a house by [[Inya Lake]] where Suu Kyi met people of very different backgrounds, political views and religions.<ref>Stewart (1997), p. 31</ref> She was educated in [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]] (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages.<ref>Stewart (1997), p. 32</ref> She is a [[Theravada]] [[Buddhist]].

Suu Kyi's mother, [[Khin Kyi]], gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to [[India]] and [[Nepal]] in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there. She studied in the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in New Delhi, and graduated from [[Lady Shri Ram College for Women|Lady Shri Ram College]] in New Delhi with a degree in politics in 1964.<ref name = "azjarp">[http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/index.php/burma/about-burma/about-burma/a-biography-of-aung-san-suu-kyi A biography of Aung San Suu Kyi].

In 1988 Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Suu Kyi met, as Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas.<ref name = "azjarp" /> Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997 which was later found to be [[terminal illness|terminal]]. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], the Burmese government would not grant Aris a [[visa (document)|visa]], saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the [[military junta]]'s assurance that she could return.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer].

==Political beginnings==
Coincident with Aung San Suu Kyi's return to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.<ref name="azjarp" /> However in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power.

===1990 general election===

Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue ({{Coord|16|49|32|N|96|9|1|E|region:MM_type:landmark}}) in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] the year after. Her sons [[Alexander Aris|Alexander]] and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf.

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that she was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and U Kyi Maung, was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and U Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 kyats (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken.

===House arrest===
Aung San Suu Kyi has been placed under [[house arrest]] for 15 of the past 21 years, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career,<ref name=sk>Moe, Wait (3 August 2009). [http://www2.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=16470 Suu Kyi Questions Burma’s Judiciary, Constitution]. ''[[The Irrawaddy]]''.</ref> during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, Suu Kyi said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZFpURJGv00&feature=related Aung San Suu Kyi interview (video)].

''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>

The media were also prevented from visiting Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when journalist [[Maurizio Giuliano]], after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=BBAB&d_place=BBAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F98E4ECFAA2A5EF&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Burma expels Italian reporter for "illegal reporting], TV Myanmar, Rangoon, 18 August 1998.</ref> In contrast, Suu Kyi did have visits from government representatives, such as during her autumn 1994 house arrest when she met the leader of Burma, General [[Than Shwe]] and General [[Khin Nyunt]] on 20 September in the first meeting since she had been placed in detention.<ref name="azjarp" /> On several occasions during Suu Kyi's house arrest, she had periods of poor health and as a result was hospitalized.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Wadhams|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901000.html |title=Myanmar's Suu Kyi Hospitalized |agency=Associated Press |work=The Washington Post |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2006 }}</ref>

The Burmese government detained and kept Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone "likely to undermine the community peace and stability" of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial),<ref>[http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5798 Opposition Condemns Extension of Suu Kyi's Detention], The Irrawaddy, 27 May 2006.

===United Nations involvement===
The [[United Nations]] (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[military junta|junta]] and Suu Kyi.<ref name = "azjarp"/> On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed "a new dawn for the country". However on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a [[Depayin massacre|government-sponsored mob attacked]] her caravan in the northern village of [[Tabayin|Depayin]], murdering and wounding many of her supporters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=4 February 2007 |date=30 May 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Burma Caucus }}</ref> Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Ko Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching [[Ye-U]].

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; [[Razali Ismail]], UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions.<ref>{{cite news | url =http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 | title =Annan expresses sadness for the resignation of his envoy for Burma | publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma | date =10 January 2006 | accessdate =4 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172156/http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}</ref> Several years later in 2006, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], UN [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Undersecretary-General]] (USG) of [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department of Political Affairs]], met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004.<ref>{{cite web|date=20 May 2006 |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&Cr=Myanmar&Cr1= |title=After meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, UN envoy leaves Burma|publisher=United Nations  |accessdate=22 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060528170633/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&Cr=Myanmar&Cr1=| archivedate= 28 May 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He also met with Suu Kyi later the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2006/11/11/010-emissaire-suukyi.shtml |title=Rare visite |accessdate=12 January 2007 |date=8 January 2007 |work=Radio-Canada |publisher=Société Radio-Canada|language=French}}</ref> On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing [[Than Shwe]] and other members of the senior leadership in [[Naypyidaw]].<ref>{{cite news |title=UN envoy meets with Burma's top general to discuss 'current situation' |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24129 |publisher=UN News Service |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 }}</ref> [[State television]] broadcast Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice.

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time.<ref name="unWrkGrp">[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/wgad/9-2004.html Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v. Myanmar], U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.1 at 47 (2004).</ref> The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government’s reply, "Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety", and while "it could have instituted legal action against her under the country’s domestic legislation ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests."<ref name="unWrkGrp" />

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside of the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=19 January 2007 |date=18 January 2008 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>

In November 2007, it was reported that Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2007|date=8 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was "disappointed" with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was "deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity."<ref>{{cite web|author=John Heilprin|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta|work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 July 2009}}</ref>

Burma's relaxing stance, such as releasing political prisoners, was influenced {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the wake of successful recent diplomatic visits by the US and other democratic governments, urging or encouraging the Burmese towards democratic reform. U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] personally advocated the release of all political prisoners, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, during the US-[[ASEAN]] Summit of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/SEAsia/Story/STIStory_452398.html |title=Obama to appeal on Suu Kyi |work=Straits Times |location=Singapore  |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>

In a personal letter to Suu Kyi, UK Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] cautioned the Burmese government of the potential consequences of rigging elections as "condemning Burma to more years of diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8434326.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Brown pledges support to Suu Kyi | date=30 December 2009 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

The Burmese government has been granting Suu Kyi varying degrees of freedom throughout late 2009, in response to international pressure{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}. She has met with many heads of state, and opened a dialog with the Minister of Labor Aung Kyi (not to be confused with Aung San Suu Kyi).<ref>Dialogs with government officials and Foreign Diplomats</ref>

Discussions were held between Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands.

==Political belief==
Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the [[Asian countries]] like [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Indonesia]]." She also cited "the [[eastern European]] countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the [[Latin American]] countries, which made the transition from military governments. "And we cannot of course forget [[South Africa]], because although it wasn't a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime." She added: "We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also ... our great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid."<ref name="LA Speech">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g7jcSqNCiDcId7mEJs9DXzmqzGtA?docId=CNG.a49d8e2a5f23889e2d2987feb130e63f.31 Myanmar's Suu Kyi ends US trip, hailing democracy], AFP, 3 October 2012</ref>

Its representation of her ended when she was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.<ref>[http://www.freedom-now.org/campaign/aung-san-suu-kyi/ www.freedom-now.org]. www.freedom-now.org.
