The '''''Annals of Mathematics''''' (abbreviated ''Ann. Math.''<ref>''Ann. Math.'' is the ISO standard abbreviation and is used by [[Zentralblatt MATH]], as shown at "[http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/journals/browse/?ch=A* Zentralblatt Serials and Journals]", accessed August 9, 2011.</ref> or ''Ann. of Math.''<ref>The abbreviation ''Ann. of Math.'' is used by the journal itself as well as by [[Mathematical Reviews]], as shown at "[http://www.ams.org/msnhtml/serials.pdf Abbreviations and Names of Serials]", American Mathematical Society, accessed August 9, 2011</ref>) is a bimonthly [[mathematical journal]] published by [[Princeton University]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. It ranks amongst the most prestigious mathematics journals in the world by criteria such as [[impact factor]].

==History==
The journal began as ''The Analyst'' in 1874<ref>Diana F. Liang, [http://books.google.com/books?id=_F3gAAAAMAAJ&q=mathematical+journals+an+annotated+guide&dq=mathematical+journals+an+annotated+guide&ei=9HxoS7LxO4nSM-GDnLsD&cd=1 Mathematical journals: an annotated guide.] Scarecrow Press, 1992, ISBN 0-8108-2585-6; p. 15</ref> and was established and [[Editor-in-chief|edited]] by [[Joel E. Hendricks]]. It was "intended to afford a medium for the presentation and analysis of any and all questions of interest or importance in pure and applied Mathematics, embracing especially all new and interesting discoveries in theoretical and practical astronomy, mechanical philosophy, and engineering".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Joel E.|year=1874|title=Introductory remarks|journal=The Analyst|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1&ndash;2|doi=10.1039/an8760100001}}</ref> It was published in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], and was the earliest American mathematics journal to be published continuously for more than a year or two.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fiske|first=Thomas S.|authorlink=Thomas S. Fiske|title=Mathematical progress in America|year=1905|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=11|pages=238&ndash;246|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2000-37-01/S0273-0979-99-00799-5/S0273-0979-99-00799-5.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1905-01210-6|issue=5}} Reprinted in ''Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society'' '''37''' (1), 3&ndash;8, 1999.</ref> This incarnation of the journal ceased publication after its tenth year, in 1883, giving as an explanation Hendricks' declining health,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Joel E.|year=1883|title=Announcement|journal=The Analyst|volume=10|issue=5|pages=159&ndash;160}}</ref> but Hendricks made arrangements to have it taken over by new management,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Joel E.|year=1883|title=Announcement|journal=The Analyst|volume=10|issue=6|pages=166}}</ref> and it was continued from March 1884 as the ''Annals of Mathematics''.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Raymond Garver | title = The Analyst, 1874-1883 | journal = [[Scripta Mathematica]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | year = 1932 | pages = 247–51}}</ref> The new incarnation of the journal was edited by [[Ormond Stone]] ([[University of Virginia]]). It moved to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1899 before reaching its current home in Princeton in 1911.

An important period for the journal was 1928–1958 with [[Solomon Lefschetz]] as editor.<ref name="mc">J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson. [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Lefschetz.html Solomon Lefschetz.] MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. Accessed February 2, 2010</ref> During this time, the annals became an increasingly well-known and respected journal. Its rise, in turn, stimulated American mathematics. [[Norman Steenrod]] characterized Lefschetz' impact as editor as follows: ''"The importance to American mathematicians of a first-class journal is that it sets high standards for them to aim at. In this somewhat indirect manner, Lefschetz profoundly affected the development of mathematics in the United States."''<ref name="mc"/>

Princeton University continued to publish the annals on its own until 1933, when the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] took joint editorial control. Since 1998 it has been available in an electronic edition, alongside its regular print edition. The electronic edition was available without charge, as an [[open access journal]], but since 2008 this is no longer the case. Editions before 2003 were transferred to the non-free [[JSTOR]] archive, and articles are not freely available until 5 years after publication.

== Editors ==
The current editors of the ''Annals of Mathematics'' are  [[Jean Bourgain]], [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] (both from the Institute for Advanced Study), [[David Gabai]], [[Nick Katz]], [[Sergiu Klainerman]], and [[Gang Tian]] (all from Princeton University).<ref name="annals.princeton.edu">[http://annals.math.princeton.edu/board Editorial Board.] ''Annals of Mathematics'', [[Princeton University]]</ref>

== Impact ==
According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2009 [[impact factor]] of 4.174, ranking it first among 255 journals in the category "Mathematics".<ref name=WoS>{{cite web |url=http://isiwebofknowledge.com |title=Web of Science |year=2011 |accessdate=May 5}}</ref>
