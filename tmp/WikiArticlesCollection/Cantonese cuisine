==Background==
{{Cuisine of China}}

Guangdong has long been a trading port and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including [[offal]], chicken feet, duck's tongue, snakes, and snails. However, lamb and goat are rarely eaten, unlike in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with [[steaming]] and [[stir frying]] being the most favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. Other techniques include [[shallow frying]], [[double steaming]], [[braising]], and [[deep frying]].

For many traditional Cantonese cooks, the flavours of a finished dish should be well balanced and not greasy. Apart from that, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, and these ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. There is no widespread use of fresh [[herb]]s in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]], [[European cuisine|European]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] or [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]]. [[Garlic chives]] and [[coriander]] leaves are notable exceptions, although the latter are usually used as mere garnish in most dishes.

==Characterisation==

In 1986, [[Prince Philip]] commented on Chinese eating habits at the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] conference: "If it has four legs and is not a chair, if it has two wings and flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it."<ref name="Ward">Ward, Laura. [2003] (2003). Foolish Words: The Most Stupid Words Ever Spoken. Sterling Publishing Company. ISBN 1-85648-698-2</ref> Despite having the quote presented to a notable organisation, it has also appeared in books such as ''"The Most Stupid Words Ever Spoken"'' as it is deemed by some Westerners as a prime example of a lack of understanding of foreign culinary traditions in the Western world.<ref name="Ward" /> 

== Foods ==

=== Sauces and condiments ===

In Cantonese cuisine, a number of ingredients such as [[spring onion]], [[sugar]], [[salt]], [[Soy sauce#Chinese|soy sauce]], [[Huangjiu|rice wine]], [[cornstarch]], [[vinegar]], [[scallion]] oil, and [[sesame oil]], suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. [[Ginger]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[five-spice powder]], powdered [[black pepper]], [[star anise]] and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.

===Dried and preserved ingredients===
Although Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by [[Hakka cuisine]], since the [[Hakka people|Hakkas]] were once a dominant group occupying [[History of Hong Kong under Imperial China|imperial Hong Kong]] and other southern territories.<ref name="Barber">Barber, Nicola. [2004] (2004) Hong Kong. Gareth Stevens Publishing. ISBN 0-8368-5198-6</ref>

Some items gain very intense flavours during the [[Drying (food)|drying]] / [[Food preservation|preservation]] / [[oxidation]] process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to [[Hydrate|rehydrate]] before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served per se and go with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.

===Traditional dishes===
[[Image:Cantonese stir-fried kai-lan.jpg|thumb|right|Cantonese stir-fried vegetables. Often, vegetables are simply stir-fried plain or with minced garlic.]]

A number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong. While many of these are on the menus of typical [[Cantonese restaurant]]s, some simpler ones are more commonly found in Chinese homes. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain [[white rice]].

===Deep fried dishes===
[[Image:Zhaliang.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zhaliang|Zaa Leung]], a common dish in a Cantonese breakfast.]]

There are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, which can often be found as [[street food]]. They have been extensively documented in [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|colonial Hong Kong]] records of the 19th and 20th centuries. A few are synonymous with Cantonese breakfast and lunch,<ref name="Wordie">{{cite book |title= Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island|last= Wordie|first= Jason|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Hong Kong University Press]]|location= Hong Kong|isbn= 962-209-563-1|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> even though these are also part of other cuisines.

=== Slow-cooked soup ===
[[Image:WintermelonSoup.jpg|thumb|right|Winter melon soup]]

Slow-cooked soup, or ''lou fo tong'' ({{zh|s=老火汤|t=老火湯|p=lǎohuǒ tāng|j=lou5 fo2 tong1}}) in the Cantonese dialect (literally meaning ''old fire-cooked soup'') is usually a clear [[broth]] prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients.

Soup chain stores or delivery outlets in Cantonese-dominated cities such as Hong Kong serve this dish due to the long preparation time of slow-cooked soup.

=== Seafood ===
[[Image:CantoneseRestaurantSeafood.jpg|thumb|right|Seafood tanks]]

Due to Guangdong's location on the southern coast of China, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine (many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises). In Cantonese (as in other parts of Asia) cuisine if seafood has a repugnant odour strong spices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of [[soy sauce]], [[ginger]], and [[spring onion]] is added to steamed fish. According to Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually inversely proportionate to the freshness of the ingredients.

=== Noodle dishes ===
[[Image:CantoneseWontonnoodle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wonton noodle]]s]]

Noodles are served either in soup broth or fried. These are available as home-cooked meals, on [[dim sum]] side menus, or as street food at [[dai pai dong]]s, where they can be served with a variety of toppings such as [[fish ball]]s, [[beef ball]]s, or [[fish slice]]s.

''[[Siu mei]]'' ({{zh|s=烧味|t=燒味|p=shāo wèi|j=siu1 mei6}}) is essentially the Chinese [[rotisserie]] style of cooking. Unlike most other Cantonese dishes, siu mei consists of meat only, with no vegetables.

===Little Pot rice===
[[Image:Littlebowlrice.jpg|thumb|right|Little pan rice]]

Little Pot rice ({{zh|s=煲仔饭|t=煲仔飯|p=bāozǎifàn|j=bou1 zai2 faan6}}) are dishes cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pot (as opposed to a round-bottomed [[wok]]). Usually this is a [[saucepan]] or [[braising]] pan (see [[clay pot cooking]]). Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little or no mixing in between. Many standard combinations exist.

===Banquet / dinner dishes===

[[Image:CantoneseTofuwithShrimp.jpg|thumb|right|Fried tofu with shrimp]]

A number of dishes are traditionally served in Cantonese restaurants only at dinner times. [[Dim sum]] restaurants stopped serving [[bamboo]]-basket dishes after the [[yum cha]] period (equivalent to [[afternoon tea]]) and began offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are standard while others are regional. Some are customised for special purposes such as [[Chinese marriage]]s or banquets. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.

===Dessert===

After the evening meal, most Cantonese restaurants offer [[tong sui]] ({{zh|s=糖水|t=糖水|p=táng shuǐ|j=tong4 seoi2|l=sugar water}}), a sweet soup. Many varieties of tong sui are also found in other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are traditional, while others are recent innovations. The more expensive restaurants usually offer their specialty desserts.

===Delicacies===

Many Cantonese delicacies consist of parts taken from rare or endangered animals, which raises serious controversy over [[animal rights]] and environmental issues. This is often due to the supposed health benefits of certain animal products, for example [[shark cartilage]], which is widely believed to prevent cancer, although scientific research has found no evidence to support these claims.<ref>http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/23/8485.long</ref>
