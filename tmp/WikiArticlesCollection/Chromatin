'''Chromatin''' is the combination of [[DNA]] and proteins that make up the contents of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a cell. The primary functions of chromatin are 1) to package DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell, 2) to strengthen the DNA to allow [[mitosis]], 3) to prevent DNA damage, and 4) to control [[gene expression]] and DNA replication. The primary protein components of chromatin are [[histone]]s that compact the DNA. Chromatin is only found in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]: [[prokaryotic]] cells have a very different organization of their DNA which is  referred  to as a [[nucleoid|genophore]] (a chromosome without chromatin).                              

The structure of chromatin depends on several factors. The overall structure depends on the stage of the [[cell cycle]]: during [[interphase]] the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to [[RNA]] and DNA polymerases that transcribe and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the genes present on the DNA: DNA coding genes that are actively transcribed ("turned on") are more loosely packaged and are found associated with RNA polymerases (referred to as [[euchromatin]]) while DNA coding inactive genes ("turned off") are found associated with structural proteins and are more tightly packaged ([[heterochromatin]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chromatin.net/|title=Chromatin Network Home Page.|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref><ref>

</ref> [[Epigenetic]] chemical modification of the structural proteins in chromatin also alter the local chromatin structure, in particular chemical modifications of histone proteins by [[methylation]] and [[acetylation]]. As the cell prepares to divide, i.e. enters  [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]], the chromatin packages more tightly to facilitate segregation of the [[chromosome]]s during [[anaphase]]. During this stage of the cell cycle this makes the individual chromosomes in many cells visible by [[optical microscope]].

In general terms, there are three levels of chromatin organization:
# DNA wraps around histone proteins forming [[nucleosome]]s; the "beads on a string" structure ([[euchromatin]]).
# Multiple histones wrap into a 30 [[nanometer|nm]] fibre consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form ([[heterochromatin]]). (Definitively established to exist in vitro, the 30 [[nanometer|nm]] fibre was not seen in recent X-ray studies of human mitotic chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Jeffrey|title=Human mitotic chromosome structure: what happened to the 30-nm fibre?|journal=The EMBO Journal|year=2012|month=March|volume=31|pages=1621–1623}}</ref>)
# Higher-level DNA packaging of the 30&nbsp;nm fibre into the metaphase chromosome (during [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]]).
There are, however, many cells which do not follow this organisation. For example, [[spermatozoa]] and [[Bird|avian]] [[red blood cells]] have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells, and [[trypanosomatid]] [[protozoa]] do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes for mitosis.

==During interphase==
The structure of chromatin during [[interphase]] is optimized to allow easy access of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA repair]] factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]]. The structure varies depending on the access required to the DNA. [[Genes]] that require regular access by [[RNA polymerase]] require the looser structure provided by euchromatin.

==Change in structure==
Chromatin undergoes various forms of change in its structure. Histone proteins, the foundation blocks of chromatin, are modified by various post-translational modification to alter DNA packing. Acetylation results in the loosening of chromatin and lends itself to replication and transcription. When certain residues are methylated they hold DNA together strongly and restrict access to various enzymes. A recent study showed that there is a [[bivalent chromatin|bivalent]] structure present in the chromatin: methylated lysine residues at location 4 and 27 on histone 3. It is thought that this may be involved in development; there is more methylation of lysine 27 in embryonic cells than in differentiated cells, whereas lysine 4 methylation positively regulates transcription by recruiting nucleosome remodeling enzymes and histone acetylases.<ref>

===DNA structure===
[[File:A-DNA, B-DNA and Z-DNA.png|thumb|right|300px|The structures of A-, B- and Z-DNA.]]
{{main|Mechanical properties of DNA|Z-DNA}}
The vast majority of DNA within the cell is the normal DNA structure. However in nature DNA can form three structures, A-, B- and [[Z-DNA]]. A and B chromosomes are very similar, forming right-handed helices, while Z-DNA is a more unusual left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between B- and Z-DNA.

At the junction of B- and Z-DNA one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from [[RNA polymerase]] or nucleosome binding.
<!---
 Move to [[mechanical properties of DNA]] or [[Z-DNA]]? "===DNA structure===
[[File:B&Z&A DNA formula.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Fig. 2:''' Alternative structural forms of DNA influencing chromatin structure]]

===Chromatin and Watson/Crick base pairing===
Crick and Watson's famous structure of [[DNA]] (called B-DNA) is only one of three possible structural forms (Fig. 2).

For the C-N bond between a base and its sugar there are two different conformations. The anti-conformation occurs in all A- and B-DNAs as well as in Z-DNA where a Cytosine is present.
In case of a Guanine Z-DNA takes the syn-conformation. The periodic change between a purine and pyrimidine along the strand of a Z-DNA accomplishes the alternating syn-anti-conformation characteristic of the zigzag structure of the Z-DNA helix. The yellow circles designated A, B, Z indicate the axes of the three possible types of DNA (Fig. 2).

[[File:B&Z junction DNA.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Fig. 3:''' Structure of DNA with two B-Z DNA junctions: It encompasses 1. breakage of a hydrogen-bond, where a Guanine rotates around its glycosyl-bond and the sugar thereby transforms into its syn-conformation. 2. Rotation of the corresponding second base (Cytosine) involving rotation of the sugar around the sugar-phosphate-bond. 3. At the B-Z junction hydrogen-bonds remain broken and bases are extruded.]]

===Junction between B- and Z-DNA===
Chromatin regions near the transcription start site frequently contain DNA sequence motifs favourable for forming Z-DNA. Likewise, formation of Z-DNA near the promoter region stimulates transcription. Z-DNA is stabilized by binding specific proteins. Formation of Z-DNA from B-DNA is a dynamic process wherein B-DNA is the relaxed state. When a Z-DNA segment is formed two B-Z junctions form (Fig.3). The crystal structure of such junctions is known. At each junction the hydrogen bonds between a Watson/Crick base-pair is broken and the bases are extruded. Extrusion of a base from the helix is a well-known reaction performed by enzymes (i.e., DNA glycosylase) that edit or repair DNA during Base Excision Repair (BER). Crystal structures of extruded bases co-crystallized with Hha1 methyltransferase, human DNA repair protein AGT(O(6)-alkylguanine-DNAalkyltransferase), or bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V are similar to the extruded bases at B-Z junctions. Z-DNA may also provide a sink to absorb torsional strain following an RNA polymerase or a transient nucleosome. Also Z-DNA may represent a signal for the recruitment of RNA-editing enzymes. It is possible that chromatin encompassing Z-DNA segments also affect replication." --->

===The nucleosome and "beads-on-a-string"===
:''Main articles: [[Nucleosome]], [[Chromatosome]] and [[Histone]]''
[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|left|150px|A cartoon representation of the nucleosome structure. From {{PDB|1KX5}}.]]
The basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome, interconnected by sections of [[linker DNA]], a far shorter arrangement than pure DNA in solution.

In addition to the core histones, there is the linker histone, H1, which contacts the exit/entry of the DNA strand on the nucleosome. The nucleosome core particle, together with histone H1, is known as a chromatosome.  Nucleosomes, with about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker DNA, can form, under non-physiological conditions, an approximately 10&nbsp;nm "beads-on-a-string" fibre. (Fig. 1-2). .

The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging.  There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning.  This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, [[adenosine]] and [[thymine]] are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases that will lie in the inner minor groove. (See [[mechanical properties of DNA]].)

===30 nm chromatin fibre===
[[File:30nm Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|right|200px|Two proposed structures of the 30nm chromatin filament. <br />Left: 1 start helix "solenoid" structure. <br />Right: 2 start loose helix structure. <br />Note: the histones are omitted in this diagram - only the DNA is shown.]]
With addition of H1, the "beads-on-a-string" structure in turn coils into a 30&nbsp;nm diameter helical structure known as the 30&nbsp;nm fibre or filament. The precise structure of the chromatin fibre in the cell is not known in detail, and there is still some debate over this {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

This level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of [[euchromatin]], which contains actively transcribed genes. EM studies have demonstrated that the 30&nbsp;nm fibre is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10&nbsp;nm fiber ("beads-on-a-string") structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.

[[File:ChromatinFibers.png|thumb|left|250px|Four proposed structures of the 30&nbsp;nm chromatin filament for DNA repeat length per nucleosomes ranging from 177 to 207 bp.
<br />
Linker DNA in yellow and nucleosomal DNA in pink.]]
The existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.
A stable 30&nbsp;nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to the stability of the fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.
In this view, different length of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber. Recent theoretical work, based on electron-microscopy images<ref>

===Spatial organization of chromatin in the cell nucleus===
<!--- Too speculative for an article: "[[File:Nucleus & Chromatin Territorial Structure.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''Fig. 4:''' Hypothetical Model of the Territorial Organization of Chromatin in the Cell Nucleus. The diagram (Fig. 4) represents a model of a cell (gray oval) with a nucleus (dark gray oval). Two chromosomes are shown as chromatin fibers (yellow and red lines). Proteins are represented as small ovals. Note the association of the chromatin components with the nuclear membrane. Chromosomes are territorially interlinked by chromatin protein complexes (scaffold proteins see above).]]" --->

The layout of the [[genome]] within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the genome have a tendency to be found in certain spaces. Specific regions of the chromatin are enriched at the [[nuclear membrane]], while other regions are bound together by protein complexes. The layout of this is not, however, well characterised apart from the compaction of one of the two X chromosomes in [[mammal]]ian [[female]]s into the [[Barr body]]. This serves the role of permanently deactivating these genes, which prevents females getting a '[[dosage compensation|double dose']] relative to [[male]]s.  The extent to which the inactive X is actually compacted is a matter of some controversy.

==Chromatin and bursts of transcription==
Chromatin and its interaction with enzymes has been researched and a conclusion being made is that it is relevant and an important factor in gene expression. Vincent G. Allfrey, a professor at Rockefeller University, stated that RNA synthesis is related to histone acetylation. The lysine amino acid attached to the end of the histones is positively charged. The acetylation of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral, allowing for DNA access. 

When the chromatins are opened, the DNA is able to enter. Fluctuations between open and closed chromatin may contribute to the discontinuity of transcription, or [[transcriptional bursting]].  Other factors are probably involved, such as the association and dissociation of transcription factor complexes with chromatin.  The phenomenon, as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription, can account for the high variability in gene expression occurring between cells in isogenic populations<ref>*Gatekeepers of chromatin: Small metabolites elicit big changes in gene expression, Kaochar, Salma; Tu, Benjamin P. Trends in biochemical sciences doi:10.1016/j.tibs.2012.07.008 (volume 37 issue 11 pp.477 - 483) 
</ref>

==Metaphase chromatin==
[[File:NHGRI human male karyotype.png|thumbnail|220px|Karyogram of human male using [[Giemsa]] staining, showing the classic [[metaphase]] chromatin structure.]]
The [[metaphase]] structure of chromatin differs vastly to that of [[interphase]]. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in [[karyotype]]s. The structure of the condensed chromosome is thought to be loops of 30&nbsp;nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well characterised.

The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 anologues.

It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into [[cromitosis]]. The lack of compaction of these regions is called [[bookmarking]], which is an [[epigenetic]] mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the "memory" of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This [[bookmarking]] mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during [[mitosis]].

==Chromatin: alternative definitions==
# '''Simple and concise definition:''' Chromatin is DNA plus the proteins (and RNA) that package DNA within the cell nucleus.
# '''A biochemists’ operational definition:''' Chromatin is the DNA/protein/RNA complex extracted from eukaryotic lysed interphase nuclei. Just which of the multitudinous substances present in a nucleus will constitute a part of the extracted material will depend in part on the technique each researcher uses. Furthermore, the composition and properties of chromatin vary from one cell type to the another, during development of a specific cell type, and at different stages in the cell cycle.
# '''The ''DNA + histone = chromatin'' definition:''' The DNA double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called chromatin. The structural entity of chromatin is the nucleosome.

==Alternative chromatin organizations==
During metazoan [[spermiogenesis]], the [[spermatid]]'s chromatin is remodelled into a more spaced-packaged, widened, almost crystal-like structure. This process is associated with the cessation of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and involves [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] protein exchange. The histones are mostly displaced, and replaced by [[protamine]]s (small, [[arginine]]-rich proteins).
