The '''Bromeliales''' is the [[botanical name]] of an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plants]].  Such an order has been recognized by a few [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|systems]] of plant taxonomy, with a various placement.  It appears that it always has had the same [[wiktionary:circumscription|circumscription]]: 
consisting only of the family [[Bromeliaceae]], the bromeliad or [[pineapple]] family.  The order is not recognized in the [[APG II system]], of 2003, which places the plants involved in the order [[Poales]].

The [[Thorne system (1992)]] placed the order in superorder [[Commelinanae]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] [=monocotyledons].

The [[Dahlgren system]] placed the order in superorder [[Bromelianae]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] [=monocotyledons].

The [[Engler system]], in its update of 1964, placed the order in class [[Monocotyledoneae]].
