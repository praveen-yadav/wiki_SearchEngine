He represented the priestly functions of his tribe, becoming the first [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priest]] of the [[Israelites]]. While Moses was receiving his education at the Egyptian royal court, and during his exile among the [[Midianites]], Aaron and his sister Miriam remained with their [[kinship|kinsmen]] in the eastern border-land of Egypt ([[Land of Goshen|Goshen]]). There, Aaron gained a name for eloquent and persuasive speech, so that when the time came for the demand upon [[Pharaoh]] to release Israel from captivity, Aaron became his brother’s "prophet" to Pharaoh. ({{bibleref|Exodus|7:1|9}}) Various dates for his life have been proposed, ranging from approximately 1600 to 1200&nbsp;BC. The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] suggests two possible accounts of Aaron's death.

===Function===
Aaron’s function included the duties of speaker and implied personal dealings with the Egyptian royal court on behalf of Moses. The part played by Aaron in the events that preceded the Exodus was, therefore, ministerial, and not directive. He, along with Moses, performed "signs" before his people which impressed them with a belief in the reality of the divine mission of the brothers ({{Bibleref|Exodus|4:15–16|HE}}).

At the command of [[Moses]] he stretched out his [[Aaron's rod|rod]] in order to bring on the first of three plagues ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|7:19;8:1;8:12|9|Exodus 7:19, 8:1,12}}). In the infliction of the remaining plagues, he appears to have acted merely as the attendant of Moses, whose outstretched rod drew the divine wrath upon the Pharaoh and his subjects ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|9:23;10:13;10:22|9|Exodus 9:23, 10:13,22}}). The display of potency from Aaron's rod had already been demonstrated in the presence of Pharaoh's magicians; when Aaron's rod was thrown down to the ground it had turned into a snake,  so Pharaoh's magicians performed the same act with their own rods.  However, Aaron's snake ate up all the other snakes ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|7:9-12|9|Exodus 7:9–12}}) proving his rod was victorious.

During the journey in the wilderness, Aaron was not always prominent or active; and he sometimes appeared guilty of rebellious or treasonable conduct. At the battle with Amalek, he was chosen with [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] to support the hand of Moses that held the "rod of God" ({{Bibleref|Exodus|17:9|9}}). When the revelation was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied Moses on the way to the summit. [[Joshua]], however, was admitted with his leader to the very presence of the {{LORD}}, while Aaron and Hur remained below to look after the people ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|24:9-14|9|Exodus 24:9–14}}). It was during the prolonged absence of Moses that Aaron yielded to the clamors of the people, and made a [[Golden Calf]] as a visible image of the divinity who had delivered them from Egypt ({{Bibleref2|Exodus|32:1-6|9|Exodus 32:1–6}}). It should be noted that in the account given of the same events, in rabbinic sources (b. Talmud Shabbat 99a; Exodus Rabbah 41) and in the Qur'an, Aaron is not the idol-maker and upon Moses' return begged his pardon as he had felt mortally threatened by the Israelites. ({{Cite quran|7|142|e=152|s=ns}}) At the intercession of Moses, Aaron was saved from the plague which smote the people ({{Bibleref2|Deut.9:20;Exodus.32:35||9|Deuteronomy 9:20, Exodus 32:35}}), although it was against Aaron’s tribe of Levi that the work of punitive vengeance was committed ({{Bibleref|Exodus|32:26|9}}).

===Priesthood===
At the time when the tribe of Levi was set apart for the priestly service, Aaron was anointed and consecrated to the priesthood, arrayed in the robes of his office, and instructed in its manifold duties ({{Bibleref|Exodus|28|HE}}, {{Bibleref|Exodus|29|HE}}).

On the very day of his consecration, his sons, Nadab and Abihu, were consumed by fire from the {{LORD}} for having offered incense in an unlawful manner ({{Bibleref|Leviticus|10:1–10|HE}}).

Scholarly consensus is that in Aaron's high priesthood the sacred writer intended to describe a model, the prototype, so to say, of the Jewish high priest. God, on [[Mount Sinai]] instituting a worship, also instituted an order of priests. According to the patriarchal customs, the [[Primogeniture|firstborn]] son in every family used to perform the functions connected with God's worship. It might have been expected, consequently, that Reuben's family would be chosen by God for the ministry of the new altar. However, according to the biblical narrative it was Aaron who was the object of God's choice. To what jealousies this gave rise later, has been indicated above. The office of the Aaronites was at first merely to take care of the lamp that was to burn perpetually before the veil of the tabernacle ({{Bibleref|Exodus|27:21|9}}). A more formal calling soon followed ({{Bibleref|Exodus|28:1|9}}). Aaron and his sons, distinguished from the commoners by their sacred functions, were also to receive holy garments suitable to their office.<ref name="phod">{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Aaron}}</ref>

Aaron offered the various sacrifices and performed the many ceremonies of the consecration of the new priests, according to divine instructions ({{Bibleref|Exodus|29|HE}}) and repeated these rites for seven days, during which Aaron and his sons were entirely separated from the rest of the people. When, on the eighth day, the high priest had inaugurated his office of sacrifice by killing the animals, he blessed the people (very likely according to the prescriptions of {{Bibleref2|Numbers|6:24-26|9|Numbers 6:24–26}}),<ref>{{cite web |last=Mariottini |first=Dr. Claude |url=http://claudemariottini.com/the-priestly-benediction-numbers-624-26/ |title=The Priestly Benediction: Numbers 6:24-26 |year=2006 |website=Dr. Claude Mariottini – Professor of Old Testament }}</ref> and, with Moses, entered into the tabernacle to possess it. They "came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the {{LORD}} appeared unto all the people. And there came a fire out from before the {{LORD}}, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: ''[which]'' when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces." ({{Bibleref2|Leviticus|9:23-24|9|Leviticus 9:23–24}}) In this way the institution of the Aaronic priesthood was established.<ref name="phod"/>

===Rebellion of ''Korah''===
From the time of the sojourn at Mount Sinai, where he became the anointed priest of Israel, Aaron ceased to be the minister of Moses, his place being taken by Joshua. He is mentioned in {{bibleref|Numbers|12|HE}} in association with Miriam in a jealous complaint against the exclusive claims of Moses as the {{LORD}}’s prophet. The presumption of the murmurers was rebuked, and Miriam became ''[[Tzaraath|leprous]]'', as white as snow. Aaron entreated Moses to intercede for her, at the same time confessing the sin and folly that prompted the uprising. Aaron himself was not struck with the plague on account of sacerdotal immunity; and Miriam, after seven days’ quarantine, was healed and restored to favor. Micah a prophet in [[Judaism]], mentions Moses, Aaron, and Miriam as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus (a judgment wholly in accord with the tenor of the narratives). ({{bibleref|Micah|6:4|9}}) In the present instance it is made clear by the express words of the oracle ({{bibleref2|Numbers|12:6-8|9|Numbers 12:6&ndash;8}}) that Moses was unique among men as the one with whom the {{LORD}} spoke face to face. The failure to recognize or concede this prerogative of their brother was the sin of Miriam and Aaron.

The validity of the exclusive priesthood of the family of Aaron was attested after the ill-fated rebellion of Korah, who was a first cousin of Aaron. When the earth had opened and swallowed up the leaders of the insurgents ({{Bibleref2|Numbers|16:25-35|9|Numbers 16:25–35}}), Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the censers of the dead priests. And when the plague had broken out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague was stayed ({{Bibleref2|Numbers.17:1-15;16:36-50||9|Numbers 17:1–15, 16:36–50}}).

[[File:Hirschvogel The Blossoming of Aarons Rod.jpg|thumb|right|The Blossoming of Aaron's Rod, etching by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]]]
Another memorable transaction followed. Each of the tribal princes of Israel took a rod and wrote his name upon it, and the twelve rods were laid up over night in the tent of meeting. The next morning Aaron’s rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds ({{Bibleref|Numbers|17:8|9}}). The miracle proved merely the prerogative of the tribe of Levi; but now a formal distinction was made in perpetuity between the family of Aaron and the other Levites. While all the Levites (and only Levites) were to be devoted to sacred services, the special charge of the sanctuary and the altar was committed to the [[Kohen|Aaronites]] alone ({{Bibleref2|Numbers|18:1-7|9|Numbers 18:1–7}}). The scene of this enactment is unknown, as is the time mentioned.

===Death===
Aaron, like Moses, was not permitted to enter Canaan with the others.<ref name="jd">{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Isidore |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&letter=A&search=aaron#18 |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from Earliest Times: Complete in Twelve Volumes |title=Aaron |year=1906 |asin=B000B68W5S |publisher=Ktav Publishing House }}</ref> The reason given is that the two brothers showed impatience at [[Meribah]] ([[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh]]) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage ({{Bibleref2|Numbers|20:12-13|9|Numbers 20:12–13}}), when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the thirst of the people.<ref name="jd"/> The action was construed as displaying a want of deference to the {{LORD}}, since they had been commanded to speak to the rock, whereas Moses struck it with the staff, twice ({{Bibleref2|Numbers|20:7-11|9|Numbers 20:7–11}}).<ref name="jd"/>

==Aaron in religious traditions==

===Jewish Rabbinic literature===
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.<ref name="j2">{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Isidore |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&letter=A&search=aaron#1 |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from Earliest Times: Complete in Twelve Volumes |title=Aaron |year=1906 |asin=B000B68W5S |publisher=Ktav Publishing House }}</ref> Thus Aaron, the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out<ref>Sifra, Wa-yiḳra, 1</ref> that it is said fifteen times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] that "the Lord spoke to Moses ''and'' Aaron." Under the influence of the priesthood that shaped the destinies of the nation under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, according to [[Malachi]] 2:4–7, and the prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with Moses.<ref name="j2"/> "At times Aaron, and at other times Moses, is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank," says [[Mekilta]],<ref name="j2"/> who strongly implies this when introducing in his record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron’s ministration.<ref name="j2"/>

====Death traditions====
In fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head ([[Leviticus Rabbah]] x., [[Midrash Tehillim|Midrash Teh.]] cxxxiii. 1), Aaron's death, as described in the [[Haggadah]], was of a wonderful tranquility.<ref name="dar">{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Isidore |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&letter=A&search=aaron#22 |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from Earliest Times: Complete in Twelve Volumes |title=Aaron |year=1906 |asin=B000B68W5S |publisher=Ktav Publishing House }}</ref> Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view.<ref name="dar"/> "Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son Eleazar!" said Moses; "and then follow me."<ref name="dar"/> Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood.<ref name="dar"/> "Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother," Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur.<ref name="dar"/> Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God.<ref name="dar"/> The cave closed behind Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: "Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!"<ref name="dar"/> When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, "Where is Aaron?" angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air.<ref name="dar"/> A voice was then heard saying: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" (Malachi 2:6).<ref name="dar"/> He died, according to [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab."<ref name="dar"/> The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a).<ref name="dar"/> The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: "There [at Mosera] died Aaron."<ref name="dar"/><ref group="note">See Mek., Beshallaḥ, Wayassa', i.; Tan., Huḳḳat, 18; Yer. Soṭah, i. 17c, and Targum Yer. Num. and Deut. on the abovementioned passages.</ref>

The rabbis also dwell with special laudation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and Moses.<ref name="dar"/> When the latter was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in one another's greatness.<ref name="dar"/> When Moses at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron, his brother, of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart" ({{Bibleref|Exodus|4:14|JPS}}).<ref name="dar"/> Indeed, Aaron was to find his reward, says [[Shimon bar Yochai]]; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother's rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the [[Urim and Thummim]], which were to "be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord" ([[Canticles Rabbah]] i. 10).<ref name="dar"/> Moses and Aaron met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers (Exodus 4:27; compare [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] 8:1), and of them it is written: "Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!" (Psalms 133:1).<ref name="dar"/> Of them it is said: "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]" (Psalms 85:10); for Moses stood for righteousness, according to Deuteronomy 33:21, and Aaron for peace, according to {{Bibleref|Malachi|2:6|JPS}}. Again, mercy was personified in Aaron, according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7 .<ref name="dar"/><ref>(Tan., Shemot, ed. Buber, 24-26)</ref>

When Moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and said: "Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office."<ref name="dar"/> Then [[Shekhinah|the Shekhinah]] spoke the words: "Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon" ({{Bibleref|Psalm|133:2-3}}) .<ref name="dar"/><ref>(Sifra, Shemini, Milluim; Tan., Korah, ed. Buber, 14)</ref>

====Moses====
According to [[Tanhuma]],<ref>ed. Buber, 2:12</ref> Aaron’s activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses.<ref name="j1">{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Isidore |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=4&letter=A&search=aaron#21 |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from Earliest Times: Complete in Twelve Volumes |title=Aaron |year=1906 |asin=B000B68W5S |publisher=Ktav Publishing House }}</ref> Hillel held Aaron up as an example, saying: "Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!"<ref name="j1"/><ref>[[Abot]], 1:12</ref> This is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in Abot de-Rabbi Natan 12, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 6b, and elsewhere, according to which Aaron was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses.<ref name="j1"/> While Moses was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong, Aaron went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse.<ref name="j1"/> The mourning of the people at Aaron’s death was greater, therefore, than at that of Moses; for whereas, when Aaron died the whole [[house of Israel]] wept, including the women, ({{Bibleref|Numbers|20:29}})<ref name="j1"/><ref>Numbers 20:29</ref> Moses was bewailed by "the sons of Israel" only ({{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|34:8|NASB}}).<ref name="j1"/> Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for Aaron.<ref name="j1"/><ref>Sanhedrin 7a</ref> His fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction.<ref name="j1"/><ref>[[Zebahim]] 115b</ref> Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|Twelve Tribes]] had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: "Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever."<ref name="j1"/><ref>[[Tanhuma]], ed.

===Christianity===
[[File:Aaron-icon.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon|Russian]] [[icon]] of Aaron (18th century, [[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], [[Karelia]], Russia).]]
While Aaron and his descendants were the high priests of Judaism, [[Melchizedek]], a person who lived more than seven centuries before Moses, is considered a  [[high priest]] and Christ is said to be of the same rite of Melchizedek of the [[New Covenant]] (see the [[Book of Hebrews]]).

However, in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] churches, Aaron is [[veneration|venerated]] as a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] is shared with his brother Moses and celebrated on September 4. (Those churches that follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]] celebrate this day on September 17 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). Aaron is also commemorated with other Old Testament saints on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, the Sunday before [[Christmas]].

Aaron is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 30.  He is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syriac Calendar.

In the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic]] order is the lesser order of priesthood, comprising the grades (from lowest to highest) of deacon, teacher, and priest. The chief office of the Aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric; the head of the priesthood is the bishop. Each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the Aaronic priesthood.<ref>{{cite book |author=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=59cf5f74db46c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=c9faff3ff4c20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____ |title=Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part A |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |year=1991 }}</ref>

'''Aaron''' ([[Arabic]]: '''هارون''', ''Hārūn'') is also mentioned in the [[Quran]] as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] of [[God]].<ref>{{Cite quran|19|53|s=ns}}</ref> The Quran praises Aaron repeatedly, calling him a "believing servant"<ref>{{Cite quran|37|122|s=ns}}</ref> as well as one who was "guided"<ref>{{Cite quran|6|84|s=ns}}</ref> and one of the "victors".<ref>{{Cite quran|37|114|e=122|s=ns}}</ref> Aaron is important in [[Islam]] for his role in the events of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]], in which, according to the Quran and [[Muslim]] [[tradition]], he preached with his brother [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] to the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Cyril |last=Glasse |encyclopedia=Concise Encyclopedia of Islam |title=Aaron |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1989 |isbn=978-0060631239 }}</ref> Aaron's significance in Islam, however, is not limited to his role as the helper of Moses.

====Aaron in the Quran====
The [[Qur'an]] contains numerous references to Aaron, both by name and without name. It says that he was a descendant of Abraham (Qur'an 4: 163) and makes it clear that both him and Moses were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment (Qur'an 10: 75). It further adds that Moses had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with Aaron (Qur'an 20: 29-30) and that Aaron helped Moses as he too was a prophet (Qur'an 19: 53) and was very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse (Qur'an 28: 34). The Qur'an adds that both Moses and Aaron were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God (Qur'an 10: 87).

The incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Qur'an paints Aaron in a positive light. The Qur'an says that Aaron was entrusted the leadership of Israel while Moses was up on [[Mount Sinai]] for a period of forty days (Qur'an 7: 142). It adds that Aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by Aaron but by a wicked man by the name of [[Samiri]] (Qur'an 19: 50). When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked Aaron for allowing the worship of the idol, to which Aaron pleaded with Moses to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Qur'an 7: 150). The Qur'an then adds that Moses here lamented the sins of Israel and said he only had the power to protect himself and Aaron (Qur'an 5: 25).

Aaron is later commemorated in the Qur'an as one who had a "clear authority" (Qur'an 23: 45) and one who was "guided to the Right Path" (Qur'an 37: 118). It further adds that Aaron's memory was left for people who came after him (Qur'an 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Qur'an 37: 120). The Qur'an also calls the [[Virgin Mary]] a "sister of Aaron" (Qur'an 19: 28). Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this "Aaron" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to Aaron of the Exodus, and the term "sister" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when Mary was a descendant of the priestly lineage of Aaron, while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of [[Christ]] by the name of "Aaron". Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked Mary spiritually with the actual sister of Aaron, her namesake [[Miriam]], whom she resembled in many ways. The Qur'an also narrates that, centuries later, when the [[Ark of the Covenant]] returned to Israel, it contained "relics from the family of Moses and relics from the family of Aaron" (Qur'an 2: 248).

====Aaron in Muhammad's time====
[[Muhammad]], in many of his sayings, speaks of Aaron. In the event of the [[Mi'raj]], his miraculous ascension through the Heavens, Muhammad is said to have encountered Aaron in the fifth heaven.<ref name="muslim">{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|309}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|314}}</ref> According to old scholars, including [[Ibn Hisham]], Muhammad, in particular, mentioned the beauty of Aaron when he encountered him in Heaven. [[Martin Lings]], in his biographical ''Muhammad'', speaks of Muhammad's wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory:
{{quote|Of Joseph he said that his face had the splendour of the moon at its full, and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty. Yet this did not diminish Muhammad's wonderment at his other brethren, and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of Aaron.<ref>[[Ibn Ishaq]], 270{{title?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lings |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Lings |title=Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_VdTAAAAYAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=wonderment+Aaron |year=1983 |publisher=[[Islamic Texts Society]] |location= |isbn=9780042970509 |page=102}}</ref>}}

Aaron was also mentioned by Muhammad in likeness to [[Ali]]. Muhammad had left Ali to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found Ali a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence. Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the Prophet said: "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet."<ref>{{cite book |last=Ishaq |first=Ibn |authorlink=Ibn Ishaq |title=Biography of the Prophet |page=897 |others=Translated by A.

====Burial Place====
{{Main|Tomb of Aaron}}
According to Islamic tradition the [[tomb of Aaron]] is located on ''Jabal Harun'', or Aaron's Mountain, near [[Petra]] in [[Jordan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlastours.net/jordan/aarons_tomb.html|title=Aaron's Tomb, Petra|publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency|accessdate=2008-07-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080726195041/http://www.atlastours.net/jordan/aarons_tomb.html| archivedate= 26 July 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/humss/bwheeler/aaron.html|title=Tomb of Aaron|publisher=United States Naval Academy |accessdate=2008-07-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080624203348/http://www.usna.edu/Users/humss/bwheeler/aaron.html| archivedate= 24 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> At 1350 meters above sea-level it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here. A 14th-century [[Mamluk]] mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.

===Baha'i===
Although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet, Aaron is merely described as a prophet. The Kitab-I-Iqan describes Imran as being his father.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bahá'u'lláh |last2='Abdu'l-Bahá |title=Selected Writings of Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá |year=1976 |publisher=US Bahá'í Publishing Trust }}

==Descendants==
Aaron married [[Elisheba]], daughter of [[Amminadab]] and sister of [[Nahshon]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{Bibleverse-nb||Exodus|6:23|9}}) of the tribe of Judah.  The sons of Aaron were [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]], and [[Nadab and Abihu]].<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|24:1|9}}</ref> A descendant of Aaron is an Aaronite, or [[Kohen]], meaning Priest.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Steinmetz |first=Sol |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Jewish Usage: A Guide to the Use of Jewish Terms |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=crESCkypt5MC&pg=PA95 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, MD |year=2005 |origyear=|title=kohen |page=95 }}

(A third group followed neither.) Ironically, and likewise according to Samaritan sources, the high priests' line of the sons of Phineas died out in 1624 CE with the death of the 112th High Priest, Shlomyah ben Pinhas, at which time the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Itamar. See article Samaritan for list of High Priests from 1613 to 2004—the 131st high priest of the Samaritans is [[Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq]]. Also see article, [[Samaritan]]</ref>

==Art history==
Depictions of Aaron within art history are rare.  Other than Aaron's inclusion in the crowd of revelers around the [[Golden Calf]] ceremony—most notably in [[Nicolas Poussin]]’s "[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]" (ca. 1633–34, [[National Gallery]] London)—there is little else.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Gallery |year=2013 |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/nicolas-poussin-the-adoration-of-the-golden-calf |title=The Adoration of the Golden Calf |website=National Gallery }}</ref>  The recent discovery in 1991 of [[Pier Francesco Mola]]’s "Aaron, Holy to the Lord" (ca. 1650, Private Collection, New York: image available for study at Fred R. Kline Gallery Archives) adds to the Aaronic mythos. The painting offers a portrayal of the single figure of Aaron in his priestly garments celebrating [[Yom Kippur]] in the wilderness Tabernacle.<ref name="kline">{{cite web |first=Fred R. |last=Kline |url=http://www.klinegallery.com/Mola_01.html |title=Aaron, Holy to the Lord |year=2010 |website=Kline Gallery }}</ref>  The Mola "Aaron" is considered the unique single figure of Aaron to have been painted by an old master artist, circa 15th–18th centuries (A.Pigler, "Barockthemen" Vol. 1; although unknown to Pigler).  The carefully rendered Judaic iconographic details in the Mola painting are rare and may have importance in relationship to mid-17th-century Jewish history.<ref name="kline"/> "Aaron, Holy to the Lord" was originally commissioned along with a now lost pendant of Moses (both from Mola) by the nobel Colonna family, wealthy Catholic art patrons living in Rome.<ref name=mola>{{cite web |author= |title=A New Discovery: "Aaron, Holy to the Lord", by Pier Francesco Mola |url=http://www.klinegallery.com/Mola_01.html |publisher=Fred R.
