'''Chile''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Chile.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|ɪ|l|i}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chile |title=Chile |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> or {{IPA|/ˈtʃɪleɪ/}}), officially the '''Republic of Chile''' ({{lang-es|link=no|República de Chile}}, {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ˈtʃile||RepChile.ogg}}), is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the [[Andes]] mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders [[Peru]] to the north, [[Bolivia]] to the northeast, [[Argentina]] to the east, and the [[Drake Passage]] in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]], [[Salas y Gómez]], [[Desventuradas Islands|Desventuradas]], and [[Easter Island]]. Chile also claims about {{convert|1250000|km2}} of [[Antarctica]], although all claims are suspended under the [[Antarctic Treaty]].

[[Atacama Desert|Chile's northern desert]] contains great mineral wealth, principally [[Copper#Production|copper]]. The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a string of [[volcano]]es and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of [[Fjords and channels of Chile|fjords, inlets, canals]], twisting peninsulas, and islands.<ref name="USDoS">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/chile/192190.htm|title=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Background Note: Chile|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|date=16 December 2011}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Chile}}

===Early history and colonization===
[[File:Urville-Araucanians.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Mapuche]] people were the original inhabitants of southern and central Chile.]]
About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Example settlement sites from the very early human habitation are [[Monte Verde]], [[Cueva del Milodon]] and the [[Pali Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]]. The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the [[Mapuche]] (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the Inca Empire to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Insight Guides: Chile|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&pg=PA27|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2002|publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group|isbn=978-981-234-890-6|page=27}}</ref> They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

==== European contact (1520) ====
In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him, the [[Strait of Magellan]], thus becoming the first European to set foot on today's Chile. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pedro de Valdivia]].]]

Conquest of the land took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite the royal prohibitions relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=Bárbaros, page 66. David J. Weber |publisher=Archive.org }}</ref>

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name="hudson"/>

The first general census was performed by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9 percent [[mestizo]]s, 8.6 percent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a census there in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of which were whites and 33.5 percent of which were natives.

The Diocese of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] conducted a census of areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1 percent of which were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10 percent of which were Indians and 3.7 percent of which were mestizos, blacks and [[mulatto]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/usuarios/cedoc_online/censos/pdf/censo_1813.pdf |title=INE – Censo de 1813. Introducción |format=PDF }}</ref>

===Independence from Spain===
[[File:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]], The Supreme Director of Chile.]]

The usurpation of the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish throne]] by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] in 1808 precipitated the drive by the colony for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. A national junta in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).

After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818 [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the Roman Catholic Church. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

[[File:Combate naval.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fighting during the [[War of the Pacific]]: The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879.]]
Chile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chiloé was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to a conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying penetration in Araucanía and colonizing   Llanquihue with German immigrants since 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John William Wilson]], the Magallanes region joined the country in 1843, while the Antofagasta area, then Bolivia, began to fill with people.

Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence.

The [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors.

===20th century===
{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}
The Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Geenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30–96}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=2013-07-14|date=2007-07-17|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163–184}}</ref>

By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name="countrystudies">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830–1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>
[[File:S.Allende 7 dias ilustrados.JPG|thumb|150px|President [[Salvador Allende]].]]
In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (part of the "[[Popular Unity]]" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name="countrystudies"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35 percent of votes.

The [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri and keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the right-wing.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Mares|first=David|coauthors=Francisco Rojas Aravena|title=The United States and Chile: Coming in from the Cold|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Y3EWkKZsYcC&pg=PA145|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93125-0|page=145}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Trento|first=Joseph J.|title=The Secret History Of The CIA|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3uPBM7z_62gC&pg=PA560|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1500-8|page=560}}</ref>

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 was exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program.

A military junta, led by General [[Augusto Pinochet Ugarte]], took over control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by [[human rights violation]]s.

In September 2013, Pedro Barrientos, Pinochet's commander at the stadium and now a resident of Florida, was sued in a United States federal court by the [[Center for Justice and Accountability]], on behalf of Jara's widow and children.

A new Constitution was approved by a controversial [[plebiscite]] on 11 September 1980, and General Pinochet became president of the republic for an 8-year term. After Pinochet obtained rule of the country, several hundred committed Chilean revolutionaries joined the [[Sandinista]] army in [[Nicaragua]], guerrilla forces in [[Argentina]] or training camps in [[Cuba]], Eastern Europe and Northern Africa.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Pamela Constable|author2=Arturo Valenzuela|title=A Nation of Enemies: Chile Under Pinochet|year=1993|publisher=W W Norton & Company Incorporated|isbn=978-0-393-30985-0|page=150}}</ref>

Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on 14 December 1989.

==Geography, climate, and environment==
{{Main|Geography of Chile}}
[[File:Parinacota volcano.jpg|thumb|[[Parinacota volcano]] in northern Chile]]
A long and narrow coastal [[Southern Cone]] country on the west side of the [[Andes Mountains]], Chile stretches over {{convert|4300|km|-1|abbr=on}} north to south, but only {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=on}} at its widest point east to west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111326/Chile |title=Chile |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> This encompasses a remarkable variety of landscapes. It contains {{convert|756950|km2}} of land area. It is situated within the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Including its offshore islands, but excluding its Antarctic claim, Chile lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[56th parallel south|56°S]], and longitudes [[66th meridian west|66°]] and [[81st meridian west|81°W]].

The northern [[Atacama Desert]] contains great mineral wealth, primarily [[Copper#Production|copper]] and [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]]s. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest north-south country in the world, and also claims {{convert|1250000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[Antarctica]] as part of its territory. However, this latter claim is suspended under the terms of the [[Antarctic Treaty]], of which Chile is a signatory.<ref>{{cite web | title = Antarctic Treaty: Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. | work = Polar Conservation Organisation | publisher = Polar Conservation Organisation | date = 1 February 2008 | url = http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204/ | accessdate =11 March 2010}}</ref>

Chile controls [[Easter Island]] and [[Sala y Gómez]] Island, the easternmost islands of Polynesia, which it incorporated to its territory in 1888, and [[Robinson Crusoe Island]], more than {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} from the mainland, in the [[Juan Fernández Islands]]. Also controlled but only temporarily inhabited (by some local fishermen) are the small islands of San Ambrosio and San Felix. These islands are notable because they extend Chile's claim to territorial waters out from its coast into the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blanco|first=Alejandro Vergara |title=Derecho de aguas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4o3G0FyArtAC|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=1998|publisher=Editorial Jurídica de Chile|isbn=978-956-10-1241-7}}</ref>

In 1950, [[CORFO]] defined, following a criteria of geographic and economical homogeniety,  six regions in [[continental Chile]]: ''Norte Grande'', ''Norte Chico'', ''Núcleo Central'', ''Concepción y La Frontera'', ''Los Lagos'' and ''Los Canales''.<ref>Geografía económica de Chile.

Unlike the current [[regions of Chile]], this territorial division has been never used administratively, although, [[natural region]]s are still used as a reference.

==== The Far North ====
[[File:Miscanti Lagoon near San Pedro de Atacama Chile Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumbnail|[[Salar de Talar]]]]
The '''Far North''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Norte Grande''') is one of the five [[natural region]]s into which [[CORFO]] divided continental Chile in 1950. It borders [[Peru]] to the north, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] to the east, and the [[Copiapó River]] to the south, beyond which lies the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]] natural region.

==== The Near North ====
[[File:ValledeCopiapo.jpg|thumbnail|left|Irrigated fields in the outskirts [[Copiapó]].]]
The '''Near North''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Norte Chico''') is one of the five [[natural region]]s on which [[CORFO]] divided continental Chile in 1950.  Its northern border is formed by the limit with the [[Far North, Chile|Far North]], on west lies the [[Pacific Ocean]], by the east the  [[Andes]] mountains and [[Argentina]], and by the south the [[Zona Central, Chile|Zona Central]] natural region. Although from a strictly geographic point of view, this natural region corresponds to the Chilean territory comprised between the rivers [[Copiapó River|Copiapó]] and [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua]], traditionally Norte Chico refers to the zone comprising the regions of [[Atacama Region|Atacama]] and [[Coquimbo Region|Coquimbo]]. This natural region was home to the [[Diaguita]] people.

==== Central Zone ====
[[File:Plaza Armas Santiago Chile.JPG|thumbnail|The Chilean capital city, [[Santiago]].]]
'''Central zone''' or '''Central Chile''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Zona Central''') is one of the five [[natural region]]s into which [[CORFO]] divided continental Chile in 1950. It is home to a majority of the Chilean population and includes the three largest metropolitan areas- [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Valparaíso]], and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. It extends from about 32° south latitude to about 37° south latitude.

==== The South ====
[[File:Termas geometricas.jpg|thumbnail|left|View of Termas Geométricas near [[Coñaripe]]. The Andes of Zona Sur host numerous hotsprings.]]
 
The '''Southern Zone''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Zona Sur''') is one of the five [[natural region]]s on which [[CORFO]] divided continental Chile in 1950. Its northern border is formed by the [[Bío-Bío River]], the limit with the [[Central Chile]] Zone.  By west with the [[Pacific Ocean]], by the east with the [[Andean mountains]] and [[Argentina]]. Its southern border is the [[Chacao Channel]], beyond it lies the [[Austral Zone]]. While [[Chiloé Archipelago]] belongs geographically to Zona Austral in terms of culture and history it lies closer to Zona Sur.

==== The Far South ====
The '''Far South''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Zona Austral''') is one of the five [[natural region]]s into which [[CORFO]] divided continental Chile in 1950 corresponding to the Chilean portion of [[Patagonia]]. It is surrounded by the [[Zona Sur]] and the [[Chacao Channel]] to the north, the Pacific Ocean and [[Drake's Passage]] to the south and west, and the [[Andean mountains]] and [[Argentina]] to the east. If excluding [[Chiloé Archipelago]] Zona Austral covers all of Chilean [[Patagonia]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Chile}}
[[File:Admiring the Galaxy.jpg|thumb|With more than 300 clear nights every year, [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]] is in an ideal position to house advanced observing instruments,]]

The diverse [[climate of Chile]] ranges from the world's driest desert in the north—the [[Atacama]]—through a [[Mediterranean climate]] in the centre, [[humid subtropical]] in Easter Island, to an [[oceanic climate]], including [[alpine tundra]] and [[glaciers]] in the east and south.<ref name="BBC-Chile">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm|title=Country profile: Chile |work=BBC News | date=16 December 2009 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Chile within its borders hosts at least seven major climatic subtypes. There are four seasons in most of the country: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November).

===Biodiversity===

[[File:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg|thumb|left|A glacier at [[Beagle Channel]] in southern Chile.]]
[[File:Culpeo MC.jpg|thumb|A [[Culpeo]] or Andean Fox at the border between Bolivia and Chile.]]
Chile's geographical isolation also has restricted the immigration of faunal life, so that only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the [[Cougar|puma]] or cougar, the llama-like [[guanaco]] and the fox-like [[South American Gray Fox|chilla]]. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the [[Pudú|pudu]] are found.<ref name= Icarito/>

There are many species of small birds, but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent. Few freshwater fish are native, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes.<ref name= Icarito/> Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl, including several penguins. Whales are abundant, and some six species of seals are found in the area.<ref name= Icarito/>

Just over 3,000 species of fungi are recorded in Chile,<ref>Oehrens, E.B. "Flora Fungosa Chilena". Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, 1980</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/robigalia/eng/index.htm |title=Cybertruffle's Robigalia – Observations of fungi and their associated organisms |publisher=cybertruffle.org.uk |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> but this number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species occurring in Chile is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.<ref>Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. "Dictionary of the Fungi". Edn 10. CABI, 2008</ref> Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Chile, and 1995 species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/chilfung/eng/endelist.htm |title=Fungi of Chile – potential endemics |publisher=cybertruffle.org.uk |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>

On the slopes of the Andes, besides the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley is characterized by several species of cacti, the hardy [[Acacia caven|espinos]], the [[Araucaria araucana|Chilean pine]], the [[nothofagus|southern beeches]] and the [[copihue]], a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower.<ref name= Icarito/>

In southern Chile, south of the Biobío River, heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.

The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina, indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation.<ref name=Bio&Con/>

The '''native flora of Chile''' is characterized by a higher degree of endemism and relatively fewer species compared to the flora of other countries of South America. A classification of this flora necessitates its division into at least three general zones: the desert provinces of the north, Central Chile, and the humid regions of the south.

====Fauna====
The''' fauna of Chile''' is characterized by a high degree of endemism, due to its particular geography. In continental Chile, the [[Atacama Desert]] in the north and the [[Andes Mountains|Andes mountains]] to the east are barriers that have led to the isolation of flora and fauna. Add to that the enormous extension in length (over {{convert|4200|km|0|abbr=on}}) this results in a wide range of climates and environments.

Landscape Chilean fauna recreating a 1744 engraving published in the historic relationship work trip to South America Jorge Juan and Antonio de UlloaThe Humboldt Current, which bathes and nourishes the South American coast of Chile, allows these to be inhabited by a large number of species.

Chile has several islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]], called Sporadic islands, among which Easter Island located in [[Polynesia]], and the [[archipelago of Juan Fernandez]]. When being separated from the rest of the Chilean territory, feature fauna, although severely degraded due to human activity.

Chile is located along a highly [[seismic]] and [[volcanic]] zone, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, due to the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates in the [[South American plate]].

Late [[Paleozoic]], 251 million years ago, Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 65 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.

The Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]], with its most alton 18 located on the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, the highest volcano in the world, in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes, with its highest point located on the hill Vicuña Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicuña Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.

The [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26° S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Coastal Range is solid and falls steeply coastal headland forming the coastal plains replaces virtually absent. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the accumulation of sediments for years.

To the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.

The [[Central zone|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific, while the coastal mountains down its height. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].

Patagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41 ° S, to the south. During the last glaciation, this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47 ° S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].

East of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.

The Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53 ° W and 90 ° W.

In the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.

In the most recent census (2002), 70 percent of the population over age 14 identified as Roman Catholic and 15.1 percent as [[evangelicalism|evangelical]]. In the census, the term "evangelical" referred to all non-Catholic Christian churches with the exception of the [[Orthodox Church]] (Greek, Persian, Serbian, Ukrainian, and Armenian), [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Seventh-day Adventists]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Approximately 90 percent of evangelicals are [[Pentecostal]]. [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan]], [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed Evangelical]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Anglican]], [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]], [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist church]]es are also present.<ref name="religiousfreedomreport">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108518.htm|title=Chile|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=United States Department of State|date=19 September 2008}}</ref> Irreligious people, atheists, and agnostics account for around 8 percent of the population.

The Constitution provides for [[freedom of religion]], and other laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors.<ref name="religiousfreedomreport"/>

Church and state are officially [[separation of church and state|separate]] in Chile. The 1999 law on religion prohibits [[religious discrimination]]. However, the Catholic Church enjoys a privileged status and occasionally receives preferential treatment.

===Languages===
The [[Chilean Spanish|Spanish spoken in Chile]] is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighbouring South American countries because final syllables and "''s''" sounds are dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation. Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the small differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

There are several indigenous languages spoken in Chile: [[Mapudungun]], [[Chilean Quechua|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]]. After the Spanish invasion, Spanish took over as the [[lingua franca]] and the indigenous languages have become minority languages, with some now extinct or close to extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CL |title=Ethnologue report for Chile |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref>

German is still spoken to some extent in southern Chile,<ref>{{cite web |author=Oliver Zoellner |url=http://www.research-worldwide.de/article-chile2005.html |title=Oliver Zoellner &#124; Generating Samples of Ethnic Minorities in Chile |publisher=Research-worldwide.de |accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref> either in small country side pockets or as a second language among the communities of larger cities.

Through initiatives such as the [[English Opens Doors]] program, the government made English mandatory for students in fifth-grade and above in public schools. Most private schools in Chile start teaching English from kindergarten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/chile/090908/lack-english-proficiency |title=Repeat after me: Hello, my name is |publisher=Globalpost.com }}</ref> Common English words have been absorbed and appropriated into everyday Spanish speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-04622005000200010&script=sci_arttext |title=Anglicism in Chilean Spanish |publisher=Scielo.cl |date=4 May 2004}}</ref>

In 2010, all students from 3rd grade in "Enseñanza Media" (secondary school) will be tested on listening and reading comprehension. The evaluation is compulsory and the instrument is TOIEC Bridge, developed by [[Educational Testing Service]].

===Identity and traditions===
[[File:TAMURE.png|thumb|305x305px|Tamure Dancers, [[Easter Island]]]]
Due to the geography of Chile dissimilar cultural expressions vary markedly in different parts of the country.

The north is characterized by various cultural events that combine the influence of Andean indigenous peoples of the Spanish conquistadors, to which is added the importance of festivals and religious traditions, highlighting the [[diablada]]s and the [[Fiesta de La Tirana]].

The central area is identified primarily with rural traditions of the Chilean countryside and culture called [[Huaso|huasa]], extending between the regions of Coquimbo and Biobío, mostly. As in this geographic region has the largest share of the Chilean population, is traditionally considered the leading country's cultural identity. Its highest expression is performed during Independence Day festivities in mid-September.

In the south, the [[Mapuche culture]] and traditions of the dominant estate in La [[Araucanía (historic region)|Araucanía]], while the German influence is predominant near [[Valdivia]], [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]] and [[Llanquihue, Chile|Llanquihue]].

The current [[Constitution of Chile]] was approved in a national [[plebiscite]] —regarded as "highly irregular" by some observers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cltoc.html|title=A Country Study: Chile|work=[[United States Library of Congress]]}}</ref>— in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|1988 plebiscite]], the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4157908.stm|title=Chile scraps Pinochet-era system|publisher=BBC | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Chile]] has a 38-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The current Senate has a 20–18 split in favor of the opposition coalition. The last congressional elections were held on 13 December 2009, concurrently with the presidential election. The current lower house-the Chamber of Deputies-contains 58 members of the governing center-right coalition, 54 from the center-left opposition and 8 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valparaíso, about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago. 
[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|227x227px|[[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] building in Valparaíso. ]]
Chile's congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]] that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertación and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislative in a roughly 50-50 split.

Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080423171251/http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view|work=Chilean Government|title=President Lagos: We can make a greater effort to make yesterday's and today's trials equally just}}</ref> The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.

In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. In the last legislative elections in Chile, the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communist Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).

Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 13 December 2009. None of the four presidential candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left [[Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia]] coalition's [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] and center-right [[Coalición por el Cambio]] coalition's [[Sebastián Piñera]], competed in a run-off election on 17 January 2010, which Piñera won. This was Chile's fifth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All five have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.

===Foreign relations===

Since the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–39) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.<ref name="hudson"/>

During the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a country that had a decisive influence on the organization of the navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name="hudson"/>

On 26 June 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml#c |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/growth.shtml |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/av/photo/detail/0001314.html?browse=all.html|title=The San Francisco Conference: Chile Signs United Nations Charter}}</ref> With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.<ref name="hudson"/>

Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007–2008 chair of the board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities. It was [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Members|re-elected]] as a member of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] in 2011 for a three-year term.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election (13 May 2010) Human Rights Council|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/64/elections/hrc/index.shtml|work=64th Session|publisher=[[United Nations General Assembly]]}}</ref> It was also [[United Nations Security Council election, 2013|elected]] to one of five non-permanent seats on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chad, Chile, Lithuania, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia elected to serve on UN Security Council|date=17 October 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=United Nations|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46277&Cr=security+council&Cr1=#.UmAVWCQd5TQ}}</ref> Chile hosted the Defense Ministerial of the Americas in 2002 and the APEC summit and related meetings in 2004. It also hosted the Community of Democracies ministerial in April 2005 and the Ibero-American Summit in November 2007. An associate member of Mercosur and a full member of APEC, Chile has been an important actor on international economic issues and hemispheric free trade.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled all its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s except part of the borderline at [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to reacquire a sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean it lost to Chile in 1879–83 War of the Pacific. The two countries maintain consular relations and are represented at the Consul General level.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Administrative divisions of Chile}}
[[File:ChileRegions.png|thumb|110px|The regions of Chile]]
Chile is divided into 15 regions, each headed by an [[intendant]] appointed by the president. The regions are further divided into provinces, with provincial governors also appointed by the president. Finally each province is divided into [[Communes of Chile|communes]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20071214000711/http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/organigrama/organigrama.asp|title=Organigrama|work=Gobierno de Chile}}</ref> which are administered by municipalities, each with its own mayor and council elected for four-year terms. Each region is designated by a name and a [[Roman numeral]], assigned from north to south. The only exception is the Santiago Metropolitan Region which is designated ''RM'' (''Región Metropolitana''). Two new regions were created in 2006 and became operative in October 2007; Los Ríos in the south (Region XIV), and Arica y Parinacota in the north (Region XV). The numbering scheme skipped Region XIII, usually asummed to be the Metropolitan Region before the 2006 reform.

===National symbols===
[[File:Colca-condor-c03.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Andean Condor]] is the national bird of Chile]]
The national flower is the [[copihue]] (''Lapageria rosea'', Chilean [[Campanula|bellflower]]), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.

The [[Coat of arms of Chile|coat of arms]] depicts the two national animals: the [[condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the [[Hippocamelus|huemul]] (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend ''Por la razón o la fuerza'' (''By reason or by force'').

The [[flag of Chile]] consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence. The flag of Chile is similar to the [[Flag of Texas]], although the Chilean flag is 21 years older. However, like the Texan flag, the flag of Chile is modeled after the [[Flag of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/samerica/chile.htm |title=Chile flag and description |publisher=Worldatlas.com |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref>

===Agriculture===

{{Main|Agriculture in Chile}}
[[File:Chilean vineyard in Andes foothills.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Many of [[Chile's vineyards]] are found on flat land within the foothills of the Andes.]]
[[Agriculture]] in Chile encompasses a wide range of different activities due to its particular [[geography]], [[climate]] and [[geology]] and human factors. Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy, now agriculture and allied sectors like forestry, logging and fishing accounts only for 4.9% of the [[GDP]] as of 2007 and employed 13.6% of the country's labor force. Some major agriculture products of Chile includes [[grapes]], apples, pears, onions, wheat, corn, oats, [[peach]]es, garlic, asparagus, beans, beef, poultry, wool, fish and timber.[1] Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as Mad Cow, fruit fly and Phylloxera, this plus being located in the southern hemisphere (having quite different harvesting times compared to the Northern Hemisphere) and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chiles main comparative advantages. However, the mountainous landscape of Chile limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory.

===Tourism===

In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6 percent, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion is attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly [[Argentina]]; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and [[Brazil]] with a growing number of Asians from [[South Korea]] and [[PR China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080408235147/http://www.rides.cl/pdf/trade_tourism_chile.pdf|title=Unknown}}</ref>

The main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country: [[San Pedro de Atacama]], in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the [[Valle de la Luna (Chile)|Valley of the Moon]]. In [[Putre]], also in the north, there is the [[Chungará Lake]], as well as the [[Parinacota Volcano|Parinacota]] and the [[Pomerape]] volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute, including [[Portillo, Chile|Portillo]], [[Valle Nevado]] and [[Termas de Chillán]].

[[Arica]], [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Coquimbo]] are the main summer centres in the north, and Pucón on the shores of [[Lake Villarrica]] is the main centre in the south. Because of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valparaíso Region, with its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. [[Viña del Mar]], Valparaíso's northern affluent neighbor, is popular because of its beaches, [[casino]], and its annual [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|song festival]], the most important musical event in Latin America.

During the period between early agricultural settlements and to the late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north, while southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Through the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th century and have continued to this day.
