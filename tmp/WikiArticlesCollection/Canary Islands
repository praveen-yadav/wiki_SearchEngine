The '''Canary Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛər|i|_|ˈ|aɪ|l|ə|n|d|z}}; {{lang-es|Islas Canarias}} {{IPA-es|ˈizlas kaˈnaɾjas|}}, {{IPA-es|ˈiɦlah kaˈnaɾjah|local}}), also known as ''the Canaries'' ({{lang-es|Canarias}}), are a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[archipelago]] located just off the northwest coast of mainland [[Africa]], {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the border between [[Morocco]] and the [[Western Sahara]]. The Canaries are one of Spain's 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] and are among the [[Special Member State territories and the European Union#Outermost regions|outermost region]] of the [[European Union]] proper. The islands include (from largest to smallest): [[Tenerife]], [[Fuerteventura]], [[Gran Canaria]], [[Lanzarote]], [[La Palma]], [[La Gomera]], [[El Hierro]], [[La Graciosa]], [[Alegranza]], [[Islote de Lobos|Isla de Lobos]], [[Montaña Clara]], [[Roque del Este]] and [[Roque del Oeste]].

The archipelago's beaches, climate and important natural attractions, especially [[Maspalomas]] in [[Gran Canaria]] and [[Teide National Park]] and Mount [[Teide]] in [[Tenerife]] (the third tallest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor), make it a major tourist destination with over 12&nbsp;million visitors per year, especially Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote.<ref name="gobiernodecanarias1">[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/turismo/area_11a_frame.html Página web] del [[ISTAC]] sobre entrada de turistas en Canarias.</ref><ref name="webtenerife1">[http://www.webtenerife.com/NR/rdonlyres/AC31568D-687A-4B60-9FC2-389A90B1A728/6179/webTurismoenCifras2007.xls#'Menú Principal'!A1 Estadísticas de Turismo de Tenerife]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> The islands have a [[subtropical climate]], with long warm summers and moderately warm winters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/51/climate/Europe/Canary-Islands.html |title=Canary Islands Weather and Climate |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080531201416/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/51/climate/Europe/Canary-Islands.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008}}</ref>  Due to their  location above the [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] layer, the high mountains of these islands are ideal for astronomical observation.

During the times of the [[Spanish Empire]] the Canaries were the main stopover for [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish galleons]] on their way to the [[Americas]] because of the prevailing winds from the northeast.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Etymology==
The name ''Islas Canarias'' is likely derived from the Latin name ''Canariae Insulae'', meaning "Island of the Dogs", a name applied originally only to Gran Canaria. According to the historian [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[Mauretania]]n king [[Juba II]] named the island ''Canaria'' because it contained "vast multitudes of dogs of very large size".<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', Chap. 37. (32.)—The Fortunate Islands</ref>

Another speculation is that the so-called dogs were actually a species of [[Monk Seal]]s (''canis marinus'' or "sea dog" was a Latin term for 'seal'<ref>Lewis and Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', '''''canis''''', sense II. B</ref>), critically endangered and no longer present in the Canary Islands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredspecieshandbook.org/persecution_seals.php |title=Seals and Sea Lions Endangered Species Handbook |publisher=Endangeredspecieshandbook.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> The dense population of seals may have been the characteristic that most struck the few [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] who established contact with these islands by sea.

Alternatively, it is said that the original inhabitants of the island, [[Guanches]], used to worship dogs, mummified them and treated dogs generally as holy animals.<ref name="10 facts">[http://www.touropia.com/facts-about-the-canary-islands/ 10 Facts about the Canary Islands] - Touropia.com - Retrieved 22 August 2011.</ref>  The ancient Greeks also knew about a people, living far to the west, who are the "dog-headed ones", who worshipped dogs on an island.<ref name="10 facts"/> Some hypothesize that the Canary Islands dog-worship and the ancient Egyptian cult of the dog-headed god, [[Anubis]] are closely connected<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NwvgPxA62KkC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=canary+islands+anubis&source=bl&ots=g3P_1D6-Tv&sig=ATRvKWSz-o30mfqQ6niQlwR41WQ&hl=en&ei=F4Z-TtPtM8eX8QPqsbiMAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&q=canary%20islands%20anubis&f=false|title= The Atlantis Encyclopaedia|author=Joseph, Frank|publisher=New Page Books| year= 2005 |accessdate= 25 September 2011}}</ref> but there is no explanation given as to which one was first.

Other theories speculate that the name comes from a reported Berber tribe living in the Moroccan Atlas, named in Roman sources as ''Canarii'', though Pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs.

The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms (shown above).

What is certain is that the name of the islands does not derive from the [[Domestic Canary|canary bird]]; rather, the birds are named after the islands.

==Geography==
[[File:Map of the Canary Islands.svg|Map of the Canary Islands|right|thumb|450px]]
[[File:Hacha grande from papagayo pano.jpg|thumb|450px|right|[[Hacha Grande]], a mountain in the south of Lanzarote, viewed from the road to the Playa de Papagayo.]]
[[File:Grancanaria.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Panoramic view of Gran Canaria, with [[Roque Nublo]] at the left and Roque Bentayga at the center]]

[[Gran Canaria]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' most populous island, and the second most populous one in Spain after [[Majorca]]. Tenerife is also the largest island of the archipelago. The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} from the African coast.

The islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.<ref>[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html (Universidad de Las Palmas,) José Mangas Viñuela, "The Canary Islands Hot Spot"] This is the source for the geological history that follows.</ref> The [[Teide]] [[volcano]] on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic [[oceanic crust]] associated with the opening of the Atlantic. Underwater [[magmatism]] commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the [[Miocene]]. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the [[Atlas Mountains]] province, which in turn is part of the larger [[African Alpine System]] division.

In the summer of 2011 a series of low magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath El Hierro. These had a linear trend of northeast-southwest. In October a submarine eruption occurred about {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Restinga. This eruption produced gases and pumice but no explosive activity was reported.

According to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east [[trade wind]]s, the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.

As a consequence, the individual islands in the canary archipelago tend to have distinct [[microclimate]]s. Those islands such as [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist [[gulf stream]]. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the gulf stream diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]] the islands which are closest to the African mainland are effectively desert or semi desert. [[Gran Canaria]] is known as a "continent in miniature" for its diverse landscapes like [[Maspalomas]] and [[Roque Nublo]]. In terms of its climate [[Tenerife]] is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]] is arid. The island rises to almost 4000 m above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]], ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' are endemic, as noted by [[Sabin Berthelot]] and [[Philip Barker Webb]] in their epic work, ''L'Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries'' (1835–50).

Four of Spain's thirteen national parks are located in the Canary Islands, more than any other autonomous community. [[Teide National Park]] is the most visited in Spain, and the oldest and largest within the Canary Islands. The parks are:

===Geology===
The originally volcanic islands –seven major islands, one minor island, and several small islets– were formed by the [[Canary hotspot]]. The Canary Islands is the only place in Spain where [[volcanic eruption]]s have been recorded during the [[Modern Era]], with some volcanoes still active (El Hierro, 2011).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fomento.es/MFOM/LANG_CASTELLANO/DIRECCIONES_GENERALES/INSTITUTO_GEOGRAFICO/Geofisica/volcanologia/C20_ERUPCIONES_HISTORICAS.htm |title=Instituto Geográfico Nacional |publisher=Fomento.es |date=1949-11-10 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

Volcanic islands such as the those in the Canary chain often have steep ocean cliffs caused by catastrophic debris avalanches and [[landslide]]s.<ref>Pararas-Carayannis, G. (2002).

The '''Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands''' consists of two [[provinces of Spain|provinces]], [[Province of Las Palmas|Las Palmas]] and [[Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], whose capitals ([[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]) are capitals of the autonomous community. Each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named ''Cabildo Insular''.

The international boundary of the Canaries is the subject of dispute between Spain and Morocco. Morocco's official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise Spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, since the Canary Islands enjoy a high degree of autonomy. {{citation needed span|text=In fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an [[autonomous community]]. Under the [[Law of the Sea]], the only islands not granted territorial waters or an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own, which is clearly not the case of the Canary Islands.|date=October 2013}}

The boundary determines the ownership of seabed oil deposits and other ocean resources. Morocco and Spain have therefore been unable to agree on a compromise regarding the territorial boundary, since neither nation wants to cede its claimed right to the vast resources whose ownership depends upon the boundary. In 2002, for example, Morocco rejected a unilateral Spanish proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html|title=CIA World Factbook}}</ref>

The Islands have 13 seats in the Spanish Senate. Of these, 11 seats are directly elected, 3 for Gran Canaria, 3 for Tenerife, 1 for each other island; 2 seats are indirectly elected by the regional Autonomous Government. The local government is presided over by [[Paulino Rivero]], the current [[President of the Canary Islands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/organizacion/estructura.jsf|title=Gobierno de Canarias}}</ref>

==History==

===Ancient and pre-colonial times===
{{Main|Canary Islands in pre-colonial times}}

Before the arrival of the [[aboriginal people|aborigines]], the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals; for example, the giant lizard (''[[Gallotia goliath]]''), or giant rats (''[[Canariomys bravoi]]'' and ''[[Canariomys tamarani]]'').<ref>[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cmayot/medioambiente/lagartodelagomera/gatos.html Según la Página Web del Gobierno de Canarias]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref>

The islands were visited by the [[Phoenicians]], the [[Greeks]], and the [[Carthaginians]]. According to the 1st century AD [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] author and philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[archipelago]] was found to be uninhabited when visited by the Carthaginians under [[Hanno the Navigator]], but that they saw ruins of great buildings.<ref name="Galindo">{{Cite book |last=Galindo |first=Juan de Abreu |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The History of the Discovery and Conquest of the Canary Islands |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |date= |year= |month= |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |location= |language= |isbn=1-4021-7269-9 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=173 |chapter=VII |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> This story may suggest that the islands were inhabited by other peoples prior to the [[Guanches]]. King [[Juba II|Juba]], [[Augustus]]'s [[Numidia]]n protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world. He dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at [[Mogador]] in what is now western Morocco in the early 1st century [[Common Era|AD]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17910 |title=C.Michael Hogan, '&#39;Chellah'&#39;, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> That same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the Canary Islands, using Mogador as their mission base.

When the Europeans began to explore the islands, they encountered several [[indigenous populations]] living at a [[Neolithic]] level of technology. Although the history of the settlement of the Canary Islands is still unclear, linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of northern Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080603042341/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary|title=Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands}}</ref> The pre-colonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the [[Guanches]], although ''Guanches'' was originally the name for the indigenous inhabitants of Tenerife. From the 14th century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from [[Majorca]], [[Portugal]] and [[Genoa]]. [[Lancelotto Malocello]] settled on Lanzarote in 1312. The [[Majorca]]ns established a [[missionary|mission]] with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.

[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Alonso Fernández de Lugo presenting the captured native kings of Tenerife to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]]]]

===Castilian conquest===
{{Main|Conquest of the Canary Islands|Kingdom of the Canary Islands}}
There may have been a Portuguese expedition that attempted to colonize the islands as early as 1336, but there is not enough hard evidence to support this. In 1402, the Castilian conquest of the islands began, with the expedition of French explorers [[Jean de Béthencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]], nobles and [[vassal]]s of [[Henry III of Castile]], to Lanzarote. From there, they conquered Fuerteventura  (1405) and El Hierro. Béthencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognized King Henry III as his overlord.

Béthencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was truly conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448 [[Maciot de Béthencourt]] sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was not accepted by the natives nor by the Castilians. Despite [[Pope Nicholas V#cite ref-8|Pope Nicholas V]] ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, a crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]]. The treaty settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic, in which Castilian control of the Canary Islands was recognized but which also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], the [[Cape Verde]] islands and gave them rights to lands discovered and to be discovered...and any other island which might be found and conquered from the Canary islands beyond toward [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]].

The Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, complete pacification was not achieved until 1495, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].

===After the conquest===
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Realm of Canary Islands.svg|thumb|right|160px|Coat of arms of the Castilian and Spanish Realm of Canary Islands]]
After the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugar cane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. In this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. Both Gran Canaria, a colony of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] since March 6, 1480 (from 1556, of Spain), and Tenerife, a Spanish colony since 1495, had separate governors.

The cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] became a stopping point for the Spanish conquerors, traders, and missionaries on their way to the [[New World]]. This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century.

The Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.

The most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt|Dutch War of Independence]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Pieter van der Does]], attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.

[[File:Iglesia.de.San.Juan.Bautista.Arucas.JPG|thumb|left|230px|Church of San Juan Bautista, [[Arucas]] in Gran Canaria.]]
The Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Brígida. 300 Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged [[Maspalomas]], on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, [[San Sebastian de La Gomera|San Sebastian]] on La Gomera, and [[Santa Cruz de la Palma|Santa Cruz]] on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and withdrew.

Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] was attacked by a British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson|the future Lord Nelson]] on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.

===18th to 19th century===
[[File:Las palmas gran canaria parque san telmo 2005.jpg|left|thumb|200px|left|Bus Station at San Telmo Park, [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]].]]
The sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's American colonies. Low prices in the sugar market in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, [[cochineal]] (''cochinilla''), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy.

By the end of the 18th century, Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as [[Havana]], [[Veracruz]], [[Santo Domingo]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm |title=www.personal.psu.edu "The Spanish of the Canary Islands" |publisher=Personal.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> [[San Antonio, Texas]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/CC/poc1.html |title=www.tshaonline.org "Handbook of Texas Online - Canary Islanders" |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.losislenos.org/ |title=www.losislenos.org "Los Isleños Heritage & Cultural Society website" |publisher=Losislenos.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |title=www.americaslibrary.gov "Isleños Society of St. Bernard Parish" |publisher=Americaslibrary.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration, primarily to the Americas, during the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to [[Venezuela]]. Also, thousands of Canarians moved to [[Puerto Rico]] where the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain. Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico. Similarly, many thousands of Canarians emigrated to the shores of [[Cuba]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm|title=The Spanish of the Canary Islands}}</ref> During the [[Spanish-American War]] of 1898, the Spanish fortified the islands against possible American attack, but an attack never came.

===Romantic period and scientific expeditions===
[[File:Coast El Golfo.JPG|thumb|250px|Coast El Golfo, El Hierro]]

Sirera and Renn (2004)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/10b.monte_en.htm |title=Montesinos Sirera, Jose Luis and Jurgen Renn (2004) '&#39;Expeditions to the Canary Islands in the romantic period (1770-1830)'&#39; |publisher=Humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770-1830, which they term "the Romantic period":

First are "expeditions financed by the States, closely related with the official scientific Institutions. characterized by having strict scientific objectives (and inspired by) the spirit of Illustration and progress".
In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travelers:
* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.
* [[Louis Feuillée]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.
* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide
* the [[Baudin-Ledru expedition]] (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection  of natural history objects.

The second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:
*[[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1799)
*[[von Buch-Smith]]
*[[Broussonet]]
*[[Philip Barker Webb|Webb]]
*[[Bertholet]].

Sirera and Renn identify the period 1770-1830 as one in which "In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase".

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Casa de Colón y Pilar Nuevo (Gran Canaria)]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new cash-crop, the banana, the export of which was controlled by companies such as [[Fyffes]].

The rivalry between the elites of the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the [[archipelago]] into two provinces in 1927. This has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities, which continues to this day.

During the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and [[Guillermo Ascanio]]. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organizations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

===Franco regime===
In 1936, [[Francisco Franco]] was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of July 17 which began the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of [[Vallehermoso, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Vallehermoso]], on La Gomera. Though there was never a proper war in the islands, the post-war [[Political repression|repression]] on the Canaries was most severe. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

During the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a [[naval base]], in the event of [[Gibraltar]] being invaded from the Spanish mainland.

Opposition to Franco's regime did not begin to organize until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.

===Self-governance===
[[File:Auditorio de Tenerife Pano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Auditorio de Tenerife]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]], and an icon of contemporary architecture in the Canary Islands, ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])]]
After the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in [[Algeria]], the [[MPAIAC]]. Now there are some pro-independence political parties, like the [[National Congress of the Canaries|CNC]] and the [[Popular Front of the Canary Islands]], but none of them calls for an armed struggle. Their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the ''cabildos insulares''.

After the establishment of a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]] in Spain, [[self-governance|autonomy]] was granted to the Canaries via a law passed in 1982. In 1983, the first autonomous elections were held. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) won. In the 2007 elections, the PSOE gained a plurality of seats, but the nationalist [[Canarian Coalition]] and the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) formed a ruling coalition government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parcan.es/|title=Website of the Canaries Parliament}}</ref>

According to "Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas" (Sociological Research Centre) in 2010, 43.5% of the population of the Canary Islands feels more Canarian than Spanish (37.6%), only Canarian (7.6%), compared to 5.4% that feels more Spanish than Canarian (2.4%) or only Spanish (3%). The most popular choice of those who feel equally Spanish and Canarian, with 49.9%. With these data, one of the Canary recorded levels of identification with higher autonomy from Spain.

The Canary Islands have a population of 2,117,519 inhabitants (2011), making it the eighth most populous of Spain's [[autonomous communities]], with a density of 282.6 inhabitants per km². The total area of the archipelago is {{convert|7493|km²|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=extension>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/territorio_ambiente/area_01_frame.html |title=Estadísticas de la Comunidad Autónoma de Canarias |publisher=Gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

The Canarian population includes long-tenured residents and new waves of mainland Spanish immigrants (including [[Galicians]], [[Castilians]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Basques]]), as well as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italians]], [[Flemings]] and [[British people|Britons]]. Of the total Canarian population in 2009 (2,098,593) 1,799,373 were Spanish (1,547,611 native Canarian and 178,613 from the Spanish mainland) and 299,220 foreigners. Of these, the majority are Europeans (55%), including [[Germans]] (39,505), [[British people|British]] (37,937) and [[Italians]] (24,177). There are also 86,287 inhabitants from the Americas, mainly [[Colombian people|Colombian]]s (21,798), [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]]s (11,958), [[Cubans]] (11,098) and [[Argentine]]s (10,159). There are also 28,136 African residents, mostly [[Morocco|Moroccans]] (16,240).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/poblacion/datos_basicos/padron_2004/pm2004_frm.html |title=Native and foreign residents in Canary Islands (Spanish) |publisher=Gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:Candelaria Basilica.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Basilica of Candelaria|Basilica of the Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patroness of the Canary Islands) in [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Candelaria]], Tenerife]]
The overwhelming majority of native Canarians are Roman Catholic with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as Protestants from northern Europe. Separate from the overwhelming Christian majority are a minority of Muslims, though no official (http://canaryislandsguide.net/pages/religion.html) mention is made of them. Other religious faiths represented include [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as well as [[Hinduism]]. Minority religions are also present such as the [[Church of the Guanche People]] which is classified as a neo-pagan religion. The appearance of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patron of Canary Islands) was credited with moving the Canary Islands toward Christianity.

The Canary Islands are divided into two Catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias|Diócesis Canariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Province of Las Palmas|Eastern Province]]: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Its capital was [[Telde]] (1351), [[San Marcial El Rubicón]] (1404) and [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] (1483–present).

*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna|Diócesis Nivariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province)|western province]]: Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro. Its capital is [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (1819–present).

[[File:Dunas de Maspalomas.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The dunes of [[Maspalomas]] in [[Gran Canaria]] is one of the tourist attractions]]

The economy is based primarily on [[Tourism in Spain|tourism]], which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12&nbsp;million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more [[arid]] islands, are being [[overexploited]] but there are still many agricultural resources like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[cochineal]], [[sugarcane]], [[grape]]s, [[vine]]s, [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s, oranges, lemons, [[ficus|fig]]s, wheat, [[barley]], maize, [[apricot]]s, [[peach]]es and [[almond]]s.

The economy is [[Euro|€]] 25&nbsp;billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands experienced continuous growth during a 20 year period, up until 2001, at a rate of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of [[Foreign Direct Investment]], mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near € 11&nbsp;billion euro in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds). Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than 5 jobs.

The Canary Islands have great natural attractions, climate and beaches make the islands a major tourist destination, being visited each year by about 12&nbsp;million people (11,986,059 in 2007, noting 29% of [[United Kingdom|Britons]], 22% of Spanish, not residents of the Canaries, and 21% of [[Germany|Germans]]). Among the islands, Tenerife has the largest number of tourists received annually, followed by Gran Canaria and Lanzarote.<ref name="gobiernodecanarias1"/><ref name="webtenerife1"/> The archipelago's principal tourist attraction is the [[Teide National Park]] (in Tenerife) where the highest mountain in Spain and third largest volcano in the world (Mount [[Teide]]), receives over 2.8&nbsp;million visitors annually.<ref name="webtenerife2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta+vacaciones+activas/Ocio/Durante+el+dia/Excursiones/EL+TEIDE.htm?Lang=es |title=Página Web Oficial de Turismo de Tenerife; El Teide |publisher=Webtenerife.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

The combination of high mountains, proximity to Europe, and clean air has made the [[Roque de los Muchachos]] peak (on La Palma island) a leading location for [[telescope]]s like the [[Grantecan]].

The islands are outside the European Union customs territory and [[VAT]] area, though politically within the EU. Instead of VAT there is a local Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a general rate of 5%, an increased tax rate of 12%, a reduced tax rate of 2% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services (e.g. telecommunications).

Canarian time is [[Western European Time]] (WET) (or [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]; in summer one hour ahead of GMT). So Canarian time is one hour behind that of mainland Spain and the same as that of the UK, Ireland and Portugal all year round.

==Transport==
The Canary Islands have eight airports altogether, two of the main ports of Spain, and an extensive network of [[Highways in Spain|autopistas]] (highways) and other roads. For a road map see multimap.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.multimap.de/world/ES/Canary_Islands |title=Canary Islands road map: Spain - Multimap |publisher=Multimap.de |date= |accessdate=2010-01-21}}</ref>

There are large ferry boats that link islands as well as fast ferries linking most of the islands. Both types can transport large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles).  Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of 30 knots) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some 20 knots). A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about 2 and a half hours and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.

The largest airport is the Gran Canaria airport, with about 10,000,000 passengers. It is also the 5th largest airport in Spain. The biggest port is in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It is an important port for commerce with Europe, Africa and the Americas. It is the 4th biggest commercial port in Spain with more than 1,400,000 TEU's. The largest commercial companies of the world,including MSC and Maersk, operate here. In this port there is an international post of the Red Cross, one of only four points like this all around the world. Tenerife has two airports, [[Tenerife North Airport]] (4,048,281 passengers) and [[Tenerife South Airport]] (6,939,168 passengers).<ref>[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/transporte_comunicaciones/aereo/pas_tot.html Airport traffic]</ref>

Canary Islands has an input of 16,874,532 passengers. The two main islands (Tenerife and Gran Canaria) receive the greatest number of passengers; Tenerife 6,204,499 passengers and Gran Canaria 5,011,176 passengers.<ref>[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/turismo/turistas/5_4_2_2_1.html Passengers in airports]</ref>

The [[port of Las Palmas]] is first in freight traffic in the islands,<ref>[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/php/saltarA.php?mid=/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/area_11_frame.html Freight traffic]</ref> while the [[port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] is the first fishing port with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Spanish government publication Statistical Yearbook of State Ports. Similarly, it is the second port in Spain as regards ship traffic, only surpassed by the [[Port of Algeciras]] Bay.<ref name="puertos.es">{{Cite web|url=http://www.puertos.es/export/download/anuarios_estadisticos/04-CAPITULO_4-2006.pdf |title=04-CAPITULO 4-2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The port's facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports from third countries or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area. The [[port of Los Cristianos]] (Tenerife) has the greatest number of passengers recorded in the Canary Islands, followed by the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.<ref name="www2.gobiernodecanarias.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/sector_servicios/transporte_comunicaciones/maritimo/pasaje.html |title=TRÁFICO DE PASAJE REGISTRADO EN LOS PUERTOS. 1996-2007 |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The Port of Las Palmas is the third port in the islands in passengers and first in number of vehicles transported.<ref name="www2.gobiernodecanarias.org"/>

===Rail transport===
The [[Tenerife Tram]] opened in 2007 and the only one in the Canary Islands, travelling between the cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]].  It is currently planned to have three lines in the Canary Islands (two in Tenerife and one in Gran Canaria).  Tenerife trains travel north and south on the island, connecting the cities of Santa Cruz (capital) and Costa Adeje in [[Adeje]] (south), and the cities of Santa Cruz and [[Los Realejos]] (north).   The planned Gran Canaria tram route will be from [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] to [[Maspalomas]] (south).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playa-del-ingles.biz/New%20railway%20train%20service%20for%20Gran%20Canaria_21_100.aspx |title=Gran Canaria Train |publisher=Playa-del-ingles.biz |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

===Terrestrial wildlife===
{{See also|List of non-marine molluscs of the Canary Islands|List of reptiles of the Canary Islands}}

With a range of habitats, the Canary Islands exhibit diverse plant species. The bird life includes European and African species, such as the [[Black-bellied Sandgrouse]]; and a rich variety of [[endemism|endemic]] (local) taxa including the:

* [[Atlantic Canary|Canary]]
* [[Red-billed Chough]] (endemic to La Palma)
* [[Blue Chaffinch]] (endemic to Tenerife and Gran Canaria)
* [[Canary Islands Chiffchaff]]
* [[Fuerteventura Chat]]
* [[Tenerife Goldcrest]]
* [[La Palma Chaffinch]]
* [[Canarian Egyptian Vulture]]
* [[Bolle's Pigeon]]
* [[Laurel Pigeon]]
* [[Plain Swift]]
* [[Houbara Bustard]]

Terrestrial fauna includes [[gecko]]s (such as the striped [[Canary Islands Gecko]]) and [[wall lizards]], and three endemic species of recently rediscovered and [[Critically Endangered|critically endangered]] giant lizard: the [[El Hierro Giant Lizard]] (or [[Roque Chico de Salmor Giant Lizard]]), [[La Gomera Giant Lizard]], and [[La Palma Giant Lizard]]. Mammals include the [[Canarian Shrew]], [[Canary Big-Eared Bat]], the [[Algerian Hedgehog]] (which may have been introduced) and the more recently introduced [[Mouflon]]. Some endemic mammals, the [[Lava Mouse]], [[Tenerife Giant Rat]] and [[Gran Canaria Giant Rat]], are extinct, as are the [[Canary Islands Quail]], [[Long-legged Bunting]], and the [[Eastern Canary Islands Chiffchaff]].

===Marine life===
{{Main|Marine life of the Canary Islands}}
[[File:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[loggerhead sea turtle]], by far the most common species of marine turtle in the Canary Islands.]]
The marine life found in the Canary Islands is also varied, being a combination of [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[endemism|endemic]] species. In recent years, the increasing popularity of both [[scuba diving]] and [[underwater photography]] have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.

Fish species found in the islands include many species of [[shark]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[moray eel]], [[Sparidae|bream]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[Grunt-fish|grunt]], [[scorpionfish]], [[triggerfish]], [[grouper]], [[goby]], and [[blenny]]. In addition, there are many invertebrate species including [[sponge]], [[jellyfish]], [[anemone]], [[crab]], [[mollusc]], [[sea urchin]], [[starfish]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] and [[coral]].

There are a total of 5 different species of [[marine turtle]] that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the [[endangered]] [[loggerhead sea turtle]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Nw8KKyu32v8C&pg=PA140&dq=%22canary+islands%22+loggerhead|title=''The IUCN Amphibia-reptilia Red Data Book'', Brian Groombridge and Lissie Wright|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-88032-601-2|author1=Groombridge, Brian|author2=Wright, Lissie|date=1982-12}}</ref> The other four are the [[green sea turtle]], [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[leatherback sea turtle]] and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [[wikt:migration|migrating]]. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.

Marine mammals include the [[Short-Finned Pilot Whale]], [[Common Dolphin|Common]] and [[Bottlenose Dolphin|Bottlenose]] dolphins.  The Canary Islands were also formerly home to a population of the rarest [[Pinniped]] in the world, the [[Mediterranean Monk Seal]].

==National parks of the Canary Islands==
[[File:Caldera de Taburiente La Palma.jpg|thumbnail|[[Caldera de Taburiente National Park]] (La Palma).]]
The Canary Islands officially has four national parks, of which two have been declared World Heritage Site by [[UNESCO]], and the other two declared a World Biosphere Reserve, these [[national parks]] are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pueblos10.com/parques-nacionales/canarias |title=Parques Nacionales de Canarias |publisher=Pueblos10.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

*[[Caldera de Taburiente National Park]] (La Palma): Created in 1954 and declared a World Biosphere Reserve in 2002. It currently covers an area of {{convert|46.9|km²|1|abbr=on}}.
*[[Garajonay National Park]] (La Gomera): Created in 1981 and declared in 1986 as a World Heritage Site. Its area is 3986 hectares at the core and some areas north of the island.

A unique form of wrestling known as [[Canarian wrestling]] (''lucha canaria'') has opponents stand in a special area called a "terrero" and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.<ref name="ctspanish.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/canarym/canary%20islands.htm |title=The Canary Islands |publisher=Ctspanish.com |date=1971-10-21 |accessdate=2010-01-21}}</ref>

Another sport is the "game of the sticks" where opponents fence with long sticks.  This may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.<ref name="ctspanish.com"/>

Another sport is called the [[Salto del pastor|shepherd's jump]] (''salto del pastor'').  This involves using a long stick to vault over an open area.  This sport possibly evolved from the shepherd's need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.<ref name="ctspanish.com"/>

The two main [[Association football|football]] teams in the archipelago are: the [[CD Tenerife]] (founded in 1912) and [[UD Las Palmas]] (founded in 1949).
