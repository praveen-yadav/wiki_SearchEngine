'''Astrobiology''' is the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], distribution, and future of life in the universe: [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[life on Earth]]. This [[interdisciplinary]] field encompasses the search for habitable environments in our [[Solar System]] and [[Planetary habitability|habitable planets]] outside our Solar System, the search for evidence of prebiotic chemistry, laboratory and field research into the origins and early evolution of life on Earth, and studies of the potential for life to adapt to challenges on [[Earth]] and in [[outer space]].<ref>{{cite news | first = [[Charles S.

Astrobiology makes use of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[ecology]], [[planetary science]], [[geography]], and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from the biosphere on Earth.<ref>[http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/11647/1066/ iTWire - Scientists will look for alien life, but Where and How?]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth |last=Ward |first=P.

[[Image:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|It is not known whether life elsewhere in the universe would utilize cell structures like those found on Earth.

''Astrobiology'' is etymologically derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}}, ''astron'', "constellation, star"; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', "life"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', ''study''. The synonyms of astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. A close synonym is ''exobiology'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|Έξω}}, "external"; Βίος, ''bios'', "life"; and λογία, -logia, ''study''. The term exobiology was first coined by molecular biologist [[Joshua Lederberg]]. Exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to earth, whereas subject area of astrobiology is wider and investigates the link between life and the [[universe]], which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes the study of life on earth, its origin, evolution and limits. Exobiology as a term has tended to be replaced by astrobiology.

Another term used in the past is '''xenobiology''', ("biology of the foreigners") a word used in 1954 by science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] in his work [[The Star Beast]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heinlein R and Harold W |title=Xenobiology |journal=Science |date=21 July 1961 |pages=223, 225 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.223 |jstor=1708323 |volume=134 |issue=3473|bibcode = 1961Sci...134..223H }}</ref>
The term ''[[xenobiology]]'' is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean "biology based on foreign chemistry", whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Since alternate chemistry analogs to some life-processes have been created in the laboratory, xenobiology is now considered as an extant subject.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Markus Schmidt | title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool | journal=BioEssays | date=9 Mar 2010 | pages=322–331 | doi=10.1002/bies.200900147 | volume=32 | issue=4 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bies.200900147/abstract | pmid=20217844 | pmc=2909387 }}</ref>

While it is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether [[life]] exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of [[science|scientific]] inquiry. Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist [[David Grinspoon]] calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory.<ref>Grinspoon 2004</ref> [[NASA]]'s interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program; Exobiology research is now one of four elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program.<ref name="about" /><ref>{{cite book |title=The Living Universe: NASA and the Development of Astrobiology |author=Steven J. Dick and James E. Strick |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick, NJ |year=2004}}</ref> In 1971, NASA funded the [[Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for [[interstellar communication|signals]] being transmitted by [[extraterrestrial life]] outside the Solar System. NASA's [[Viking program|Viking missions]] to Mars, launched in 1976, included [[Viking biological experiments|three biology experiments]] designed to look for [[biosignature|possible signs]] of present [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The [[Mars Pathfinder]] lander in 1997 carried a scientific payload intended for exopaleontology in the hopes of finding microbial fossils entombed in the rocks.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://exobiology.nasa.gov/ssx/Selected_Research/exopaleo_for_pathfinder.html | title=Exopaleontology at the Pathfinder Landing Site | publisher=[[NASA Ames Research Center]] | date=5 September 1996 | accessdate=2009-11-21| author=Jack D.

In the 21st century, astrobiology is a focus of a growing number of NASA and [[European Space Agency]] Solar System exploration missions. The first European workshop on astrobiology took place in May 2001 in Italy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_27_2001_p_EN.html |title=First European Workshop on Exo/Astrobiology |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2001 |work=ESA Press Release |publisher=European Space Agency }}</ref> and the outcome was the [[Aurora programme]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=ESA Embraces Astrobiology |journal=Science |date=1 June 2001 |volume=292 |issue=5522 |pages=1626–1627 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/292/5522/1626?maxtosho= |doi=10.1126/science.292.5522.1626 |last1=Gavaghan |first1=H. |pmid=11387447}}</ref> Currently, NASA hosts the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]] and a growing number of universities in the United States (e.g., [[University of Arizona]], [[Penn State University]], [[Montana State University – Bozeman]], [[University of Washington]], and [[Arizona State University]]),<ref name="astrobiology.asu.edu">[http://astrobiology.asu.edu/Astrobiology/Home/Home.html Astrobiology at Arizona State University]</ref> Britain (e.g., The [[University of Glamorgan]], [[Buckingham University]]),<ref name="case.glam.ac.uk">[http://case.glam.ac.uk/CASE/Degrees/AstroBio.html CASE Undergraduate Degrees]</ref> Canada, Ireland, and Australia (e.g., The [[University of New South Wales]])<ref name="aca.unsw.edu.au">[http://aca.unsw.edu.au The Australian Centre for Astrobiology, University of New South Wales]</ref> now offer graduate degree programs in astrobiology. The [[International Astronomical Union]] regularly organizes international conferences through its Bioastronomy Commission.<ref>[http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~meech/iau/ Commission 51: Bioastronomy]</ref>

Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of [[extremophile]]s with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]] due to its proximity to Earth and geological history. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of [[Water on Mars|water on its surface]], water being considered an essential precursor to the development of carbon-based life.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mars/essential.html NOVA | Mars | Life's Little Essential | PBS]</ref>

Missions specifically designed to search for life include the [[Viking program]] and [[Beagle 2]] probes, both directed to Mars. The Viking results were inconclusive,<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Viking Biological Investigation: Preliminary Results |journal=Science |date=1 October 1976 |author=Klein HP and Levin GV |volume=194 |issue=4260 |pages=99–105 |doi=10.1126/science.194.4260.99 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4260/99|format= |accessdate=2008-08-15 |pmid=17793090 |bibcode = 1976Sci...194...99K }}</ref> and Beagle 2 failed to transmit from the surface and is assumed to have crashed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMAPB8A9HE_Life_0.html |title=Possible evidence found for Beagle 2 location |accessdate=2008-08-18 |date=21 December 2005 |publisher=European Space Agency | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080930130433/http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMAPB8A9HE_Life_0.html| archivedate= 30 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> A future mission with a strong astrobiology role would have been the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]], designed to study the frozen moons of Jupiter&mdash;some of which may have liquid water&mdash;had it not been cancelled.

==Methodology==

=== Planetary habitability ===
{{Main|Planetary habitability}}

When looking for life on other planets like the earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is to assume that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon-based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life forms on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title= Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2000 |work=Astrobiology magazine }}</ref> Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of [[molecule]]s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is just at an appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of arbitrarily long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].

The presence of liquid water is a useful assumption, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the emergence of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}</ref> Some researchers posit environments of [[ammonia]], or more likely, water-ammonia mixtures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=2008-10-20 |first=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine }}</ref>

A third assumption is to focus on [[sun]]-like [[star]]s. This comes from the idea of [[planetary habitability]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2007 |publisher=Sol Company | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081001194624/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm| archivedate= 1 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Very big stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life would not likely have time to evolve on [[planet]]s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be [[Tidal lock|tidally "locked"]] to the star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=223364&source=r |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Red Orbit & Astrobiology Magazine }}</ref> Without a thick [[atmosphere]], one side of the planet would be perpetually baked and the other perpetually frozen. In 2005, the question was brought back to the attention of the [[scientific community]], as the long lifetimes of [[red dwarf]]s could allow some biology on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]).

It is estimated that 10% of the stars in our galaxy are sun-like; there are about a thousand such stars within 100 light-years of our [[Sun]]. These stars would be useful [[Project Phoenix (SETI)|primary targets]] for interstellar listening. Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor [[life]], there is no evident way to know if any of the simplifying assumptions are correct.

===Communication attempts===
{{Main|Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence}}
[[File:Pioneer10-plaque tilt.jpg|right|thumb|The illustration on the [[Pioneer plaque]] ]]
Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence ([[Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence|CETI]]) focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]] and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The [[SETI]] program, for example, uses both [[radio telescope]]s and [[optical telescope]]s to search for deliberate signals from [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].

While some high-profile scientists, such as [[Carl Sagan]], have advocated the transmission of messages,<ref>Sagan, Carl. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.</ref><ref>[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/ An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions]</ref> scientist [[Stephen Hawking]] has warned against it, suggesting that aliens might simply raid Earth for its resources and then move on.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/space/article7107207.ece Don’t talk to aliens, warns Stephen Hawking.

===Elements of astrobiology===

[[Image:Telescope Kepler-NASA.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The [[NASA]] [[Kepler mission]], launched in March 2009, searches for [[extrasolar planets]].]]
Most astronomy-related astrobiological research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs, both of which have been cancelled. Additionally, NASA has launched the [[Kepler mission]] in March 2009, and the [[French Space Agency]] has launched the [[COROT]] space mission in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/ |title=Kepler Mission |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2008 |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081031070350/http://kepler.nasa.gov/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |title=The COROT space telescope |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=2008-10-17 |publisher=CNES | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081108130307/http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/| archivedate= 8 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway. (See [[exoplanet]]).

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface; given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=2008-10-20 |year=2008 |publisher=NASA }}</ref> is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life. The [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] temporal variability of extrasolar planets may also provide clues to their surface and atmospheric properties.

An estimate for the number of planets with ''intelligent'' [[extraterrestrial life]] can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm |title=What is the Drake Equation? |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Ford |first=Steve |month=August | year=1995 |publisher=SETI League | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029212425/http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
<math>N = R^{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L</math><br>
where, '''N''' = The number of communicative civilizations, '''R*''' = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as our Sun), '''fp''' = The fraction of those stars with planets. (Current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun), '''ne''' = The number of Earth-sized worlds per planetary system, '''fl''' = The fraction of those Earth-sized planets where life actually develops, '''fi''' = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops, '''fc''' = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops), '''L''' = The "lifetime" of communicating civilizations.

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable error limits any time soon. The first term, Number of Stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, Stars with Planets and Planets with Habitable Conditions, are being evaluated for the sun's neighborhood.

Biology and chemistry, as opposed to physics, do not admit ideological contexts: either the biological phenomena are real, or they are abstract. Biologists cannot say that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, have to exist forcibly in the real nature. For biologists, the ground of speculations is well noticeable, and biologists specify what is speculative and what is not.<ref name=BC/>

Until the 1970s, [[life]] was believed to be entirely dependent on energy from the [[Sun]]. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from sunlight to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process, and are then eaten by oxygen-respiring animals, passing their energy up the [[food chain]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was believed to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did.<ref name="smoker">{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |year=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}</ref> A world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of [[giant tube worm]]s, [[clam]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.<ref name="smoker"/> These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent food chain. Instead of plants, the basis for this food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] that derives its energy from oxidization of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

[[Extremophiles]] (organisms able to survive in extreme environments) are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] which are able to survive several kilometers below the ocean's surface near [[hydrothermal vent]]s and [[microbe]]s that thrive in highly acidic environments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/050207_extremophiles.html |title=Wild Things: The Most Extreme Creatures |accessdate=2008-10-20 |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=7 February 2005 |work=Live Science }}</ref> It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life.<ref name=Cavicchioli >{{cite journal|title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life|journal=Astrobiology|date=Fall 2002 |first=R. |last=Cavicchioli |coauthors= |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=281–92 |pmid=12530238 |format=|doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode = 2002AsBio...2..281C }}</ref> It opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats.

The origin of life, distinct from the [[Evolution#Evolution of life|evolution of life]], is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S.

The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of [[panspermia]] is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth by a variety of means. Somewhat related to such a hypothesis, [[NIH|NIH scientists]] reported [[Panspermia#Complexity|studies]] that [[life]] began {{val|9.7|2.5}} billion years ago, billions of years before the [[Earth]] was formed, based on extrapolating the "genetic complexity of organisms" [from "major phylogenetic lineages"] to earlier times.<ref name="arXiv-20130328">{{cite journal |last1=Sharov |first1=Alexei A. |last2=Gordon|first2=Richard |title=Life Before Earth |url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.3381.pdf |date=28 March 2013 |journal=[[arXiv]] |arxiv=1304.3381v1 |accessdate=16 April 2013 }}</ref><ref name="NIH-20060612">{{cite journal |last=Sharov |first=Alexei A. |title=Genome increase as a clock for the origin and evolution of life |journal=[[Biology Direct]] |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |date=12 June 2006 |issue=  |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-1-17|pmc=1526419}}</ref> (also see [[Abiogenesis#Coenzyme world]])

{{Main|Geology of solar terrestrial planets}}
[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Astrogeology]] is a [[planetary science]] discipline concerned with the [[geology]] of the [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[planet]]s and their [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].

An additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the [[Earth]] and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet.

Only two of the natural atoms, [[carbon]] and [[silicon]], are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation.

The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living organism. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.<ref name=BC/><ref name='Pace'/> Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar to our own, in the generality if not in the detail.<ref name='Pace'/> Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique.

== Rare Earth hypothesis ==
{{Main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}

This hypothesis states that based on astrobiological findings, multi-cellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists initially assumed. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which suggests, "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?" It is apparently in opposition to the [[principle of mediocrity]], assumed by famed astronomers [[Frank Drake]], [[Carl Sagan]], and others. The Principle of Mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, but rather that life is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

The [[anthropic principle]] states that fundamental laws of the universe work specifically in a way that life would be possible. The anthropic principle supports the Rare Earth Hypothesis by arguing the overall elements that are needed to support life on Earth are so fine-tuned that it is nearly impossible for another just like it to exist by random chance (note that these terms are used by scientists in a different way from the vernacular conception of them). However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern [[hot dog bun]]s, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s.<ref>{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| year =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | year= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time}}</ref>

==Research==
The systematic search for possible life outside of Earth is a valid multidisciplinary scientific endeavor.<ref>[http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/nai/ NASA Astrobiology Institute]</ref> The [[University of Glamorgan]], UK, started just such a degree in 2006,<ref name="case.glam.ac.uk"/> and the American government funds the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]]. However, characterization of non-Earth life is unsettled; hypotheses and predictions as to its existence and origin vary widely, but at the present, the development of theories to inform and support the exploratory search for life may be considered astrobiology's most concrete practical application.

[[Biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and [[mathematician]] [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]], amongst others, consider '''[[xenobiology]]''' separate from astrobiology. Cohen and Stewart stipulate that astrobiology is the search for Earth-like life outside of our solar system and say that xenobiologists are concerned with the possibilities open to us once we consider that life need not be carbon-based or oxygen-breathing, so long as it has the defining [[characteristics of life]]. (See [[carbon chauvinism]]).

;Planetary systems
It is possible that some planets, like the gas giant [[Jupiter]] in our [[solar system]], may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are more hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside our solar system are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether our solar system, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observing time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, [[NASA]]'s [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s. Infrared searches have detected belts of dust and [[asteroid]]s around distant stars, underpinning the formation of planets.

;Planetary habitability
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and transit method, showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is [[Gliese 581 c]], which was found using [[radial velocity]].<ref name="Gliese">{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | coauthors= | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | date=24 April 2007 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-20 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081015075030/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html| archivedate= 15 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

== Missions ==
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix lander]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[ExoMars]] to Mars, and the [[Cassini probe]] to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] hope to further explore the possibilities of life on other [[planet]]s in our [[solar system]].

===Viking program===
{{main|Viking biological experiments}}
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] posing with a model of the Viking Lander.]]
The two [[Viking program|Viking spacecraft]] each carried four types of [[biological]] [[experiment]]s to the surface of [[Mars]] in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments to look specifically for [[biosignature]]s of [[Life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The landers used a robotic arm to put soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface; [[Viking 1]] near the equator and [[Viking 2]] further north.<ref name="Chambers">{{Cite book
