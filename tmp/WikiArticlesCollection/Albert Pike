'''Albert Pike''' (December 29, 1809–April 2, 1891) was an American [[Lawyer|attorney]], Confederate officer, writer, and [[freemasonry|Freemason]]. 

==Biography==
Pike was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], son of Ben and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in [[Byfield, Massachusetts|Byfield]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. His colonial ancestors included [[John Pike (settler)|John Pike]] (1613-1688/1689), the founder of [[Woodbridge, New Jersey]].<ref>Albert's descent from his immigrant ancestor John Pike is as follows: John Pike (1572–1654); John Pike (1613–1688/89); Joseph Pike (1638–1694); Thomas Pike (1682–1753/4); John Pike (1710–1755); Thomas Pike (1739–1836); Benjamin Pike (1780–?); Albert Pike (1809–1891).</ref> He attended school in Newburyport and [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] until he was 15. In August 1825, he passed entrance exams at [[Harvard University]], though when the college requested payment of tuition fees for the first two years which he had successfully challenged by examination, he chose not to attend. He began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Bedford, Massachusetts|North Bedford]], [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]] and Newburyport.<ref>Hubbell, Jay B. ''The South in American Literature: 1607-1900''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1954: 640.</ref>

In 1831, Pike left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and later moving on to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], [[Missouri]]. In Independence, he joined an expedition to [[Taos, New Mexico]], hunting and trading. During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the [[Llano Estacado]] in New Mexico and [[Texas]]. Trapping was minimal and, after traveling about 1300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], [[Arkansas]].<ref name= hbtx>''Handbook of Texas Online'', s.v. "Pike, Albert," http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/fpi18.html (accessed December 15, 2008).</ref>

Settling in Arkansas in 1833, he taught school and wrote a series of articles for the [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] ''Arkansas Advocate'' under the [[pen name]] of "Casca."<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net">http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1737</ref> The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the staff of the newspaper. Later, after marrying Mary Ann Hamilton, he purchased part of the newspaper with the [[dowry]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} By 1835, he was the ''Advocate''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sole owner.<ref name=hbtx/> Under Pike's administration the ''Advocate'' promoted the viewpoint of the [[United States Whig Party|Whig party]] in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas.<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net"/> 

He then began to study law and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1837, selling the ''Advocate'' the same year. He was the first reporter for the Arkansas supreme court and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled ''The Arkansas Form Book'', which was a guidebook for lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts. His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten.<ref name=hbtx/> Several volumes of his works were self-published posthumously by his daughter. In 1859, he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard,<ref name=hbtx/><ref>"The Phoenix," Manly P. Hall</ref>

Albert Pike has often been named as influential in the early [[Ku Klux Klan]], being named in 1905 as "the chief judicial officer" of the Klan by a sympathetic historian of the early Klan, Walter Fleming.<ref>"General Albert Pike, who stood high in the Masonic order, was the chief judicial officer of the Klan." Page 27, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2j4OAAAAIAAJ&q=Pike Ku Klux Klan: its origin, growth and disbandment], Walter Fleming</ref>  He was cited as the leader of the Arkansas Ku Klux Klan.<ref>"Arkansas was headed by General Albert Pike, explorer and poet.", page 58, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6O_XYBMhNYAC&lpg=PA31&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America], Wyn Craig Wade</ref>  However this has been a controversial subject with Masonic authors saying that it "is impossible to either substantiate or disprove" involvement in the Klan.<ref>[http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/kkk.html Albert Pike did not found the Ku Klux Klan]</ref>

Pike died in [[Washington, D.C.]], aged 81, and was buried at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] (against his wishes—he had left instructions for his body to be cremated).<ref name=hbtx/> In 1944, his remains were moved to the [[House of the Temple]], headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite.

==Military career==

When the [[Mexican-American War]] started, Pike joined the cavalry and was commissioned as a troop commander, serving in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]].<ref name=hbtx/> He and his commander, [[John Selden Roane]], had several differences of opinion. This situation led finally to an "inconclusive" [[duel]] between Pike and Roane on July 29, 1847 near Fort Smith, Arkansas.<ref name="Eicher429">Eicher, John H., aer, ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-8047-3641-3. p. 429</ref> Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] for a time beginning in 1853.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He wrote another book, ''Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field and becoming an advocate of [[slavery]], although retaining his affiliation with the Whig party. When that party dissolved, he became a member of the [[United States Know-Nothing Party|Know-Nothing]] party. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] he was firmly against [[secession]], but when the war started he nevertheless took the side of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].<ref name=hbtx/> At the [[Southern Commercial Convention]] of 1854, Pike said the South should remain in the Union and seek equality with the North, but if the South "were forced into an inferior status, she would be better out of the Union than in it."<ref>David Morris Potter, Don Edward. The impending crisis, 1848-1861. HarperCollins, 1976. (Page 467)</ref>

He also made several contacts among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the area, at one point negotiating an $800,000 settlement between the [[Creek (people)|Creek]]s and other tribes and the federal government. This relationship was to influence the course of his Civil War service.<ref name=hbtx/> At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated [[List of treaties of the Confederate States of America|several treaties]], one of the most important being with [[Cherokee]] chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], which was concluded in 1861.<ref name=hbtx/>

Pike was commissioned as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on November 22, 1861, and given a command in the [[Indian Territory]].<ref name=hbtx/> With Gen. [[Benjamin McCulloch|Ben McCulloch]], Pike trained three Confederate [[regiment]]s of [[Indian cavalry]], most of whom belonged to the "[[Five Civilized Tribes|civilized tribes]]", whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable. Although initially victorious at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] (Elkhorn Tavern) in March, Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray.<ref name=hbtx/> Also, as in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one point drafting a letter to [[Jefferson Davis]] complaining about his direct superior.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had [[scalping|scalped]] soldiers in the field. Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] also charged Pike with mishandling of money and material, ordering his arrest.<ref name="Smith585">Smith, Dean E. "Pike, Albert" in ''Historical Times Illustrated History of the Civil War'', edited by Patricia L. Faust. New York: Harper & Row, 1986. ISBN 978-0-06-273116-6. p. 585</ref> Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the Confederate Army on July 12.<ref name="Smith585"/> He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of [[insubordination]] and [[treason]], and held briefly in [[Warren, Texas]]{{dn|date=October 2013}}, but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.<ref name=hbtx/><ref name="Smith585"/>

==Freemasonry==

He first joined the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] in 1840 then had in the interim joined a [[Masonic Lodge]] and became extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the [[Scottish Rite]]'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859.<ref name="Eicher429"/> He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of thirty-two years), devoting a large amount of his time to developing the rituals of the order.<ref>Warner, Ezra J. ''Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders.'' Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. ISBN 0-8071-0823-5. pp. 240-241</ref> Notably, he published a book called ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'' in 1871, of which there were several subsequent editions.

Pike is still regarded in America as an eminent<ref name=Pikeeminent>[http://www.freemason.org/cfo/mar_apr_2002/pike.htm ALBERT PIKE AND FREEMASONRY], March–April 2002 edition, California Freemason On-Line {{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>{{dead link|date=July 2012}} and influential<ref name="Pikeinfluence">[http://www.masonicinfo.com/pike.htm Albert Pike], masonicinfo.com</ref> Freemason, primarily only in the Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction.

==Poetry==

As a young man, Pike wrote poetry which he continued to do for the rest of his life. At 23, he published his first poem, “Hymns to the Gods.” Later work was printed in literary journals like Blackwood’s ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and local newspapers. His first collection of poetry, ''Prose Sketches and Poems Written in the Western Country'', appeared in 1834. He later gathered many of his poems and republished them in ''Hymns to the Gods and Other Poems'' (1872). After his death these appeared again in ''Gen. Albert Pike’s Poems'' (1900) and ''Lyrics and Love Songs'' (1916).<ref>
