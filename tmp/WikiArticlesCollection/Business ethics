'''Business ethics''' (also corporate ethics ) is a form of [[applied ethics]] or [[professional ethics]] that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-business/ |title=Business Ethics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref>

Business ethics has both [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns.
Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and [[social responsibility]] charters.
[[Adam Smith]] said, "People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."<ref>Smith, A (1776/ 1952) An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55</ref> Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control.<ref>Berle, A. A., & Means, G. C. (1932). The Modern Corporation and Private Property. New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. In this book, Berle and Means observe, "Corporations have ceased to be merely legal devices through which the private business transactions of individuals may be carried on. Though still much used for this purpose, the corporate form has acquired a much larger significance. The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a 'corporate system'—as there once was a feudal system—which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution. […] We are examining this institution probably before it has attained its zenith. Spectacular as its rise has been, every indication seems to be that the system will move forward to proportions which stagger imagination today […] They [management] have placed the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve not only the owners […] but all society." p. 1.</ref> The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|p=17}}</ref>

==History==
Business norms reflect the norms of each historical period. As time passes norms evolve, causing accepted behaviors to become objectionable. Business ethics and the resulting behavior evolved as well.

The Civil Rights movement had caught the public imagination. The United States was becoming more and more of a dominant economic force. American-based multinational corporations were growing in size and importance. Big business was coming into its own, replacing small and medium-sized businesses in the societal image of business. The chemical industry was booming with innovation, and in its wake came environmental damage on a scale that had not previously been possible. The spirit of protest led to the environmental movement, to the rise of consumerism, and to criticism of multinational corporations....Corporations, finding themselves under public attack and criticism, responded by developing the notion of social responsibility. They started social responsibility programs and spent a good deal of money advertising their programs and how they were promoting the social good. Exactly what "social responsibility" meant varied according to the industry and company.</ref>

The term 'business ethics' came into common use in the United States in the early 1970s. By the mid-1980s, at least 500 courses in business ethics reached 40,000 students, using some twenty textbooks and at least ten casebooks along supported by professional societies, centers and journals of business ethics. The [[Society for Business Ethics]] was started in 1980. European business schools adopted business ethics after 1987 commencing with the European Business Ethics Network (EBEN).<ref>Richard T.

==Overview==
Business ethics reflects the [[philosophy of business]], one of whose aims is to determine the fundamental purposes of a company. If a company's purpose is to maximize shareholder returns, then sacrificing profits to other concerns is a violation of its [[fiduciary responsibility]]. Corporate entities are legally considered as persons in USA and in most nations. The 'corporate persons' are legally entitled to the rights and liabilities due to citizens as persons.

Economist [[Milton Friedman]] writes that corporate executives' "responsibility... generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom".<ref name=mf1970>{{Cite news

Another view of business is that it must exhibit [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR): an umbrella term indicating that an ethical business must act as a responsible citizen of the communities in which it operates even at the cost of profits or other goals.<ref>Pinnington, A.

Greenfield observes, "what is good for shareholders is good for corporations, and what is good for corporations is good for society....If this connection existed, the shareholder bandwagon would be attractive indeed. The problem is that advocates for shareholder primacy do not purport to say how the connection occurs or test whether the connection is true. p. 22</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|p=5}} observe, "when a company with shareholders gives some of the profits it has made to investors who have not been involved in producing the value, this is seen as a reward for risk. But why should the surplus generated by workers be given to someone else who almost certainly already has a lot of money in the first place?"</ref> In the US and most other nations corporate entities are legally treated as persons in some respects. For example, they can hold title to property, sue and be sued and are subject to taxation, although their [[free speech]] rights are limited. This can be interpreted to imply that they have independent ethical responsibilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Duska argues that stakeholders have the right to expect a business to be ethical; if business has no ethical obligations, other institutions could make the same claim which would be counterproductive to the corporation.<ref name=Duska/>

Ethical issues include the rights and duties between a company and its [[stakeholder theory|employees, suppliers, customers and neighbors]], its [[fiduciary]] responsibility to its [[shareholder]]s. Issues concerning relations between different companies include [[takeover|hostile take-overs]] and [[industrial espionage]]. Related issues include [[corporate governance]];[[Corporate Social Entrepreneurship|corporate social entrepreneurship]]; [[Campaign finance reform|political contributions]]; legal issues such as the ethical debate over introducing a crime of [[corporate manslaughter]]; and the marketing of corporations' ethics policies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Harmondsworth: Penguin. Jevons observes, "The theory…is entirely based on a calculus of pleasure and pain: the object of economics is to maximize happiness by purchasing pleasure, as it were, at the lowest cost of pain" (Jevons, 1970:91). Jevons also noted, "The strength of preferences for a good, measured by individuals' willingness to pay for their satisfaction at the margin, is an indirect measure of subjective states: it is from the quantitative effects of the feelings that we must estimate their comparative amounts" (Jevons, 1970:83). O'Neil on the other hand points out that the ideologists of neoliberalism "do not claim to prove that markets maximize well-being. Rather they claim to show that in certain 'ideal' conditions the market will issue in a state of equilibrium, defined as a state in which, so long as individuals' preferences and productive resources remain the same, any departure from that state will involve a welfare change for the worse for some party, in the sense that a previously satisfied preference will no longer be satisfied. {{harvnb|O'Neill|1998|p=54}}</ref> Neoliberal ideology promoted finance from its position as a component of economics to its core.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Proponents of the ideology hold that unrestricted financial flows, if redeemed from the shackles of "financial repressions",<ref>Montiel, P.

By the phrase 'financial repression', Montiel refers to the monitoring and regulations on capital inﬂows and outﬂows, regulations on free entry and exit of national and international financial institutions, the presence of state run financial institutions, stipulations on cash reserve ratio or liquidity ratio, interest rate ceilings, guidelines regarding priority sector financing, and other measures of monitory regulations.</ref> best help impoverished nations to grow.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The theory holds that open financial systems accelerate economic growth by encouraging foreign capital inﬂows, thereby enabling higher levels of savings, investment, employment, productivity and "welfare",<ref>{{cite news

The total amount of welfare understood as preference satisfaction over dissatisfaction appears to be remarkably static in modern market societies. There appears to be little evidence of any growth in the gap between preference satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Quoting from Lane, he points out, "The assumed positive relationship between markets and wellbeing understood as preference satisfaction is not confirmed by empirical evidence… Indeed, the fact that there is no increase in preference satisfaction over dissatisfaction no longer entails immediately that there is no increase in welfare. Not all dissatisfaction is a sign of a life that has taken a turn for the worse. Indeed, it can indicate the opposite, that a person is exercising capacities that are part of what it is for a life to be improving. Consider a pianist, who starts being greatly satisfied with her initial developments, but who, as she continues to develop technically and artistically, becomes ever more critical of her performance. Her increasing dissatisfaction is a symptom of increasing accomplishment. Or again consider the contented slave, wage earner or housewife who become discontented with their lot: it is better for them that this is so and not just in virtue of other possible improvements this might bring. This is an old point." {{harvnb|O'Neill|1998|pp=56–60}}</ref> along with containing corruption.<ref>Schaler, J. A. Corruption.{{harvnb|Hamowy|2008 |pp=105–107}} What the libertarians consider as corruption is interesting. The author concludes abruptly, "if we reduce what the government does, we also will reduce corruption…. It also may offer a way to identify and understand the moral decline that follows (and fosters) the continual expansion of the welfare state.(p. 107). However, the author is reluctant to admit that private individual/ firm corruption. For instance, he writes, "Paying money for goods or services provided by a public official constitutes bribery and often involves punishment for the parties to the transaction. Why bribery is invariably equated with corruption and condemned? It is not obviously inefficient. Indeed, in highly collectivized nations, paying public officials to allow what would otherwise be normal market exchanges may contribute much to human welfare. (p. 105). He continues, "These standard accounts of corruption and bribery involve efficiency and democratic accountability, not liberty"... "In some cases, government actions that are particularly prone to bribery—like the licensing of economic activity—inherently restrict individual liberty"… "It is possible that bribery might liberalize some parts of society"... However, he presents "in the financing of election campaigns" individuals and groups are simply "contributing to the campaigns of chosen candidates" and observes, "Campaign finance regulations, like the corruption they seek to prevent, actually serve the narrow interests of parties and incumbents instead of the interest voters have in open competition for legislative seats. Thus, campaign finance restrictions may be deemed a kind of corruption". He further points out, "However, as Nathaniel Persily discovered, campaign finance appears to have no real relationship one way or the other to trust in government. In any case, public trust in government tends to reduce, rather than protect, individual liberty (p. 106). In his statement on the primacy of liberty he argues, "But libertarians might recognize that corruption may be more than an excuse to limit liberty".</ref> Neoliberals recommended that governments open their financial systems to the global market with minimal regulation over capital flows.<ref>The neoclassical economists of the first generation in the early 70s, while the impoverished world was still struggling to recover from the adverse effects of the second world war and the consequent cold wars, recommended deregulation of financial systems of the impoverished nations which they termed liberating financial systems from the 'financial repression'. Chili, Uruguay and Argentina were chosen to be the labs of financial experiments. Contrary to the claims the countries experienced severe economic and financial setbacks of soaring interest rates, waves of bank failures and other bankruptcies, extreme asset price volatility and extensive loan defaults, the real sector entered deep and prolonged recessions contrary to what had been projected by the ideologues (Grabel, I., 2008).

Dobson observes, "a rational agent is simply one who pursues personal material advantage ad infinitum. In essence, to be rational in finance is to be individualistic, materialistic, and competitive. Business is a game played by individuals, as with all games the object is to win, and winning is measured in terms solely of material wealth. Within the discipline this rationality concept is never questioned, and has indeed become the theory-of-the-firm's sine qua non".<ref>{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|p=ix}} "Experts of finance tend to view business firm as, 'an abstract engine that uses money today to make money tomorrow'</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/296380|author=Miller, M. H. |year=1986|title=Behavioral Rationality in Finance: The Case of Dividends|journal=Journal of Business|volume=59|pages=451–468|format=p. 452}}</ref> Financial ethics is in this view a mathematical function of shareholder wealth. Such simplifying assumptions were once necessary for the construction of mathematically robust models.<ref>{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|p=xvi}} In this regard Dobson points out, "An apologist for the finance paradigm might defend its conceptual rigidity as follows. Although there are undoubtedly motivations other than wealth maximization that influence, and should influence, behaviour, the assumptions of the finance paradigm provide a reasonable approximation of agents' behaviour over a broad spectrum of business environments. The firm is an economic mechanism and agents act within the firm for fundamentally economic reasons. In addition, the construction of mathematically robust models requires simplifying assumptions. Like perfect-and-frictionless capital markets, wealth maximization is one such simplifying assumption. All disciplines have their conceptual boundaries, and any value-based normative consideration of human behaviour simply lies beyond finance's conceptual boundary. Indeed, if finance were to stretch this boundary in an attempt to encompass such questions, mathematical rigor would be lost. Finance would be set adrift in the scientifically unnavigable sea of moral philosophy. Wealth maximization provides a secure anchorage from which a rigorous theory of financial-market behaviour can be built. Says Norman Bowie, "Like perfect information and zero transaction costs, psychological egoism [i.e., wealth maximization] is one of the simplifying assumptions needed for the mathematics of equilibrium analysis"</ref> However [[signalling (economics)|signalling theory]] and [[Principal-agent problem|agency theory]] extended the paradigm to greater realism.<ref>{{harvnb|Dobson|1997|pp=xvi, 142}}</ref>

Such power is the ability to make what one wants actually happen. When a worker wants to keep a job but the owner does not want to employ him or her, the worker loses out, usually, although on a larger scale this doesn't hold true. Of course, if the worker wants to quit, he or she will win, but that is often the less visible situation. Just consider the worry about downsizing. It is also often true that employers are able to find replacements for workers more readily than workers can ﬁnd new jobs on their own terms. Even when this is not the case, the worker's situation is deemed to be more dire because of the often greater wealth of the employer. Whether this imbalance of bargaining power is justiﬁed or not is what ultimately must be addressed by those who believe that there is greater merit in a free market system than in one that is regimented by government—say, via a workers' democracy.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Machan|2007|p=67}}</ref>

Marketing ethics, regardless of the product offered or the market targeted, sets the guidelines for which good marketing is practiced. To market ethically and effectively one should be reminded that all marketing decisions and efforts are necessary to meet and suit the needs of customers, suppliers, and business partners. The mindset of many companies is that they are concerned for the population and the environment in which they do business. They feel that they have a social responsibility to people, places and things in their sphere of influence.

According to Borgerson, and Schroeder (2008), marketing can influence individuals' perceptions of and interactions with other people, implying an ethical responsibility to avoid distorting those perceptions and interactions.<ref>Borgerson, J. L. and J. E. Schroeder (2008).

Marketing ethics involves pricing practices, including illegal actions such as [[price fixing]] and legal actions including [[price discrimination]] and [[price skimming]] also the main two issues of pricing involve overprice and price markups and markdowns which may lead to a monopolistic position, force (seller), or ignorance on behalf of the buyer. Certain promotional activities have drawn fire, including  [[greenwash]]ing, [[bait and switch]], [[shill]]ing, [[viral marketing]], [[spam (electronic)]], [[pyramid scheme]]s and [[multi-level marketing]]. Advertising has raised objections about [[attack ad]]s, [[subliminal message]]s, [[sex in advertising]] and [[marketing in schools]].

===Production===
This area of business ethics usually deals with the duties of a company to ensure that products and production processes do not needlessly cause harm. Since few goods and services can be produced and consumed with zero risk, determining the ethical course can be problematic. In some case consumers demand products that harm them, such as [[tobacco]] products. Production may have environmental impacts, including [[pollution]], [[habitat destruction]] and [[urban sprawl]]. The downstream effects of technologies [[nuclear power]], [[genetically modified food]] and [[mobile phone]]s may not be well understood. While the [[precautionary principle]] may prohibit introducing new technology whose consequences are not fully understood, that principle would have prohibited most new technology introduced since the [[industrial revolution]]. Product testing protocols have been attacked for violating the rights of both [[clinical trials|humans]] and [[animal testing|animals]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Property===
{{Main|Private property||Property rights}}

The etymological root of property is  the [[Latin]] 'proprius'<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=property Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-02.</ref> which refers to 'nature', 'quality', 'one's own', 'special characteristic', 'proper', 'intrinsic', 'inherent', 'regular', 'normal', 'genuine', 'thorough, complete, perfect' etc. The word property is value loaded and associated with the personal qualities of propriety and respectability, also implies questions relating to ownership. A 'proper' person owns and is true to herself or himself, and is thus genuine, perfect and pure.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2007 |p=25}}</ref>

====Modern history of property rights====
Modern discourse on property emerged by the turn of 17th century within theological discussions of that time. For instance, [[John Locke]] justified [[property rights]] saying that God had made "the earth, and all inferior creatures, [in] common to all men".<ref>Locke, John (1690),[http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.htm Sec. 25 Of Property (chapter 5)], in [[Second Treatise on Government]]: "God, who hath given the world to men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life, and convenience. The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho' all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life." He continues in sec.27, "Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this nobody has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.</ref><ref>Harris, J.W.

=====Slaves as property=====
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, slavery spread to European colonies including America, where colonial legislatures defined the legal status of slaves as a form of property.<ref>Ely, J. W. (2008). The Guardian of Every Other Right. Oxford: Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-532332-7. Ely notes, 'In 1740 South Carolina declared slaves "to be chattels personal, in the hands of their owners and possessors ' Because slaves were property, they could be purchased, sold, inherited, taxed, or seized to pay the master's debts… The slave codes also minutely governed the slaves' activities, prohibiting them from assembling, running away, owning goods or livestock, or using ﬁ rearms. Moreover, it was unlawful to sell liquor to slaves or to teach them to read and write. Finally, crimes committed by slaves received harsher punishment than did equivalent offenses by free persons (p. 15).</ref> During this time settlers began the centuries-long process of dispossessing the natives of America of millions of acres of land.<ref>Wishart, D.

Combined with theological justification, property was taken to be essentially naturally ordained by God.<ref>In this regards Ross (1994:14) notes, "within the liberal context the private nature of property is naturalized and universalized, as though other forms are somehow less ethically defensible"</ref> Property, which later gained meaning as ownership and appeared natural to Locke, Jefferson and to many of the 18th and 19th century intellectuals<ref>{{harvnb|Rose|1994|p=58}} Rose observes, "What is the purpose of property under this . . . understanding? The purpose is to accord to each person or entity what is 'proper' or 'appropriate' to him or her. Indeed, this understanding of property historically made no strong distinction between 'property' and 'propriety', and one finds the terminology mixed up to a very considerable degree in historical texts. And what is 'proper' or appropriate, on this vision of property, is that which is needed to keep good order in the commonwealth or body politic"</ref> as land, labour or idea<ref>Jefferson wrote, "[W]hile it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance. By an universal law, indeed, whatever, whether ﬁxed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property."

However, for a slave to be considered property of another person, under the Kantian Categorical Imperative, the slave is no longer considered a person. According to Kant, all people must be treated as ends themselves, and when converted to property, that is no longer the case. Ethically speaking one can never possess another human being, it is immoral.

In the neoliberal literature, property is part of the private side of a public/private dichotomy and acts a counterweight to state power.<!-- need a cite from that literature--> Davies counters that "any space may be subject to plural meanings or appropriations which do not necessarily come into conflict".<ref>Any space may be subject to plural meanings or appropriations which do not necessarily come into conflict: pastoralists and Indigenous people may have quite different understandings of rural landscapes reflected in different types of property interests, which can—ideally—coexist legally. A nominally open public space may have 'private' or limited meanings imposed upon it—for instance religious meanings (Urban spaces such as privately owned but publicly accessible shopping malls are increasingly of a 'quasi'-public nature. At the same time, intrusions of public norms into personal proprietary spaces through, for instance, zoning, heritage, and environmental regulations, militate against seeing 'private' property as entirely private. Social transitions which transgress neat liberal distinctions put the theory under strain in key points: where the owners of a quasi-public space like a shopping mall try to enforce a dress code or standards of behaviour, private proprietorial power intrudes into the public sphere {{harvnb|Davies|2007|p=11}}</ref>

This balancing solution did not take seriously the idea that legal rules both respond to and shape the contours of social relations. They did not, in other words, take the character and structure of social relations as an important independent factor in choosing the rules that govern market life. Economists may similarly fail to give sufficient attention to the moral and customary underpinnings of market societies.

The ownership model fails to acknowledge the substantial limitations on property rights that are necessary to protect the interests of both owners and nonowners harmed by the exercise of those rights. Conflicts among owners are quite prevalent. In some cases one owner's exercise of her lawful property rights interferes with other owners' rights in their own property. We also need to restrict property rights in situations where they impinge on nonproperty rights we hold as dearly". (p. 31)</ref>

===Intellectual property===
{{main|Intellectual property|Intellectual property rights}}
[[Intellectual property]] (IP) encompasses expressions of ideas, thoughts, codes and information. "[[Intellectual property rights]]" (IPR) treat IP as a kind of [[real property]], subject to analogous protections, rather than as a reproducible good or service. Boldrin and Levine argue that "government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect. The question we address is whether it also creates social benefits commensurate with these social costs."<ref>{{harvnb|Boldrin|Levine|2008|p=10}}</ref>

International standards relating to Intellectual Property Rights are enforced through [[Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS).<ref>Drahos and Braithwaite write, "When in 1994 we interviewed a former [[US trade negotiator]], he remarked that 'less than 50 individuals' were responsible for TRIPS. Less than 50 individuals had managed to globalize a set of regulatory norms for the conduct of all those doing business or aspiring to do business in the information age" {{harvnb|Drahos|Braithwaite|2002|p=73}}</ref> In the US, IP other than [[copyright]]s is regulated by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].

Intellectual Property.{{harvnb|Hamowy|2008 |pp=249–250}}</ref> Boldrin and Levine see no value in such state-enforced monopolies stating, "we ordinarily think of innovative monopoly as an [[oxymoron]].<ref>We shall see that when monopoly over ideas is absent, competition is fierce—and that, as a result, innovation and creativity thrive. Whatever a world without patents and copyrights would be like, it would not be a world devoid of great new music and beneficial new drugs." They substantiate their argument by showing instances of key innovation in software industry prior to 1981, before the advent of patent protection … The best evidence that copyright and patents are not needed and that competition leads to thriving innovation in the software industry is the fact that there is a thriving and innovative portion of the industry that has voluntarily relinquished its intellectual monopoly—both copyright and patent. {{harvnb|Boldrin|Levine|2008|pp=10, 16–17}}</ref><ref>Välimäki, M.

Patents are taken out on all aspects of the compound, including the compound itself, dosage methods and processes of making it. Some knowledge is held back and protected under trade-secret law, brand name identity is protected through trade mark law and a lot of written information is protected by copyright. The whole point of building this wall is to ensure that protection lasts well beyond the term of any single patent and keeps cheaper generic manufacturers out of the market for as long as possible. For people in developing countries living on one or two dollars a day, the price of anti-retroviral therapies represented a king's ransom. In some countries such as South Africa, some treatments were in fact more expensive. As an aside we might note that the phenomenon of patented medicines being more expensive in developing countries is not unusual. The logic of patent monopoly is to have a safe and secure distribution system aimed at selling smaller numbers of expensive medicines to a wealthy class, rather than trying to distribute large numbers of cheap medicines at a few cents a day to the many poor. When large pharmaceutical companies speak about 'growing the market' in developing countries, it is the wealthy segment of the market they have in mind" {{harvnb|Drahos|Braithwaite|2002|p=6}}</ref><!-- Isn't the ethical issue not the existence of patents, but the misuse of them in the above circumstance? -->

One attack on IPR is moral rather than utilitarian, claiming that inventions are mostly a collective, cumulative, path dependent, social creation and therefore, no one person or ﬁrm should be able to monopolize them even for a limited period.<ref>{{harvnb|Andersen|2006|pp109–147}}</ref> The opposing argument is that the benefits of innovation arrive sooner when patents encourage innovators and their investors to increase their commitments.

In my judgment, intellectual property rights also fail to pass this test. To enforce copyright laws and the like is to prevent people from making peaceful use of the information they possess.<!--this sounds like the forced appropriation critiqued above--> If you have acquired the information legitimately (say, by buying a book), then on what grounds can you be prevented from using it, reproducing it, trading it?<!--you pay for whatever the author wishes to sell you.

It may be objected that the person who originated the information deserves ownership rights over it.

==International issues==
While business ethics emerged as a field in the 1970s, international business ethics did not emerge until the late 1990s, looking back on the international developments of that decade.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Georges|last=Enderle|year=1999|title=International Business Ethics|page=1| publisher=[[University of Notre Dame Press]]|isbn= 0-268-01214-8}}</ref> Many new practical issues arose out of the international context of business. Theoretical issues such as cultural relativity of ethical values receive more emphasis in this field. Other, older issues can be grouped here as well. Issues and subfields include:
* The search for universal values as a basis for international commercial behaviour.
* Comparison of business ethical traditions in different countries. Also on the basis of their respective GDP and [Corruption rankings].
* Comparison of business ethical traditions from various religious perspectives.
* Ethical issues arising out of international business transactions; e.g., [[bioprospecting]] and [[biopiracy]] in the pharmaceutical industry; the [[fair trade]] movement; [[transfer pricing]].
* Issues such as [[globalization]] and [[cultural imperialism]].
* Varying global standards—e.g., the use of [[child labor]].
* The way in which multinationals take advantage of international differences, such as outsourcing production (e.g. clothes) and services (e.g. call centres) to low-wage countries.
* The permissibility of international commerce with pariah states.

The success of any business depends on its financial performance. Financial accounting helps the management to report and also control the business performance.

The information regarding the financial performance of the company plays an important role in enabling people to take right decision about the company. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand how to record based on accounting conventions and concepts ensure unambling and accurate records.

Foreign countries often use dumping as a competitive threat, selling products at prices lower than their normal value. This can lead to problems in domestic markets. It becomes difficult for these markets to compete with the pricing set by foreign markets. In 2009, the International Trade Commission has been researching anti-dumping laws. Dumping is often seen as an ethical issue, as larger companies are taking advantage of other less economically advanced companies.

==Economic systems==
[[Political economy]] and [[political philosophy]] have ethical implications, particularly regarding the distribution of economic benefits.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Richard de|last=George|year=1999|title=Business Ethics|isbn=0-412-46080-7 }}</ref> [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] are both notable contributors. For example, Rawls has been interpreted as [http://works.bepress.com/julian_friedland/3/ offering a critique of offshore outsourcing] on social contract grounds, whereas Nozick's libertarian philosophy rejects the notion of any positive corporate social obligation.

==Law and regulation==
Very often it is held that business is not bound by any ethics other than abiding by the law. Milton Friedman is the pioneer of the view. He held that corporations have the obligation to make a profit within the framework of the legal system, nothing more.<ref>{{harvnb|Machan|2007}}.{{harvnb|Frederic|2002|pp=88}}</ref> Friedman made it explicit that the duty of the business leaders is, "to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in the law and those embodied in ethical custom".<ref name=f1970>Friedman, M.

[http://www.studymode.com/essays/The-Social-Responsibility-Of-Business-Is-317417.html "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profit"], ''The New York Times Magazine''.</ref> Ethics for Friedman is nothing more than abiding by 'customs' and 'laws'. The reduction of ethics to abidance to laws and customs however have drawn serious criticisms.

Counter to Friedman's logic it is observed{{by whom|date=May 2012}} that legal procedures are technocratic, bureaucratic, rigid and obligatory where as ethical act is conscientious, voluntary choice beyond normativity.<ref name=ag43>Agamben, G.

==Implementation==

===Corporate policies===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
As part of more comprehensive [[compliance and ethics program]]s, many companies have formulated internal policies pertaining to the ethical conduct of employees. These policies can be simple exhortations in broad, highly generalized language (typically called a corporate ethics statement), or they can be more detailed policies, containing specific behavioural requirements (typically called corporate ethics codes). They are generally meant to identify the company's expectations of workers and to offer guidance on handling some of the more common ethical problems that might arise in the course of doing business. It is hoped that having such a policy will lead to greater ethical awareness, consistency in application, and the avoidance of ethical disasters.

An increasing number of companies also require employees to attend seminars regarding business conduct, which often include discussion of the company's policies, specific case studies, and legal requirements. Some companies even require their employees to sign agreements stating that they will abide by the company's rules of conduct.

Many companies are assessing the environmental factors that can lead employees to engage in unethical conduct. A competitive business environment may call for unethical behaviour. Lying has become expected in fields such as trading. An example of this are the issues surrounding the unethical actions of the Saloman Brothers.

Not everyone supports corporate policies that govern ethical conduct. Some claim that ethical problems are better dealt with by depending upon employees to use their own judgment.

Others believe that corporate ethics policies are primarily rooted in utilitarian concerns, and that they are mainly to limit the company's legal liability, or to curry public favour by giving the appearance of being a good corporate citizen. Ideally, the company will avoid a lawsuit because its employees will follow the rules. Should a lawsuit occur, the company can claim that the problem would not have arisen if the employee had only followed the code properly.

Sometimes there is disconnection between the company's code of ethics and the company's actual practices. Thus, whether or not such conduct is explicitly sanctioned by management, at worst, this makes the policy duplicitous, and, at best, it is merely a marketing tool.

Jones and Parker write, "Most of what we read under the name business ethics is either sentimental common sense, or a set of excuses for being unpleasant."<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005}}</ref> Many manuals are procedural form filling exercises unconcerned about the real ethical dilemmas. For instance, US Department of Commerce ethics program treats business ethics as a set of instructions and procedures to be followed by 'ethics officers'.,<ref name=program/> some others claim being ethical is just for the sake of being ethical.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|Parker|et al.|2005|pp=3–8}}</ref> Business ethicists may trivialize the subject, offering standard answers that do not reflect the situation's complexity.<ref name=ag43/>

===Ethics officers===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
Ethics officers (sometimes called "compliance" or "business conduct officers") have been appointed formally by organizations since the mid-1980s. One of the catalysts for the creation of this new role was a series of fraud, corruption, and abuse scandals that afflicted the U.S. defense industry at that time. This led to the creation of the Defense Industry Initiative (DII), a pan-industry initiative to promote and ensure ethical business practices. The DII set an early benchmark for ethics management in corporations. In 1991, the [http://www.theecoa.org Ethics & Compliance Officer Association] (ECOA)—originally the Ethics Officer Association (EOA)—was founded at the [http://www.bentley.edu/cbe Center for Business Ethics] (at Bentley College, Waltham, MA) as a professional association for those responsible for managing organizations' efforts to achieve ethical best practices. The membership grew rapidly (the ECOA now has over 1,200 members) and was soon established as an independent organization.

Another critical factor in the decisions of companies to appoint ethics/compliance officers was the passing of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations in 1991, which set standards that organizations (large or small, commercial and non-commercial) had to follow to obtain a reduction in sentence if they should be convicted of a federal offense. Although intended to assist judges with sentencing, the influence in helping to establish best practices has been far-reaching.

In the wake of numerous corporate scandals between 2001 and 2004 (affecting large corporations like [[Enron]], [[WorldCom]] and [[Tyco International|Tyco]]), even small and medium-sized companies have begun to appoint ethics officers. They often report to the Chief Executive Officer and are responsible for assessing the ethical implications of the company's activities, making recommendations regarding the company's ethical policies, and disseminating information to employees. They are particularly interested in uncovering or preventing unethical and illegal actions. This trend is partly due to the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] in the United States, which was enacted in reaction to the above scandals. A related trend is the introduction of risk assessment officers that monitor how shareholders' investments might be affected by the company's decisions.

The effectiveness of ethics officers is not clear. If the appointment is made primarily as a reaction to legislative requirements, one might expect little impact, at least over the short term. In part, this is because ethical business practices result from a corporate culture that consistently places value on ethical behaviour, a culture and climate that usually emanates from the top of the organization. The mere establishment of a position to oversee ethics will most likely be insufficient to inculcate ethical behaviour: a more systemic programme with consistent support from general management will be necessary.

The foundation for ethical behaviour goes well beyond corporate culture and the policies of any given company, for it also depends greatly upon an individual's early moral training, the other institutions that affect an individual, the competitive business environment the company is in and, indeed, society as a whole.


=== Ethics services ===
Some organizations offer services to help others implement corporate ethics, to evaluate codes of conduct or to rank companies by their ethics.

Such organizations may be op to criticism for conflicts of interest.
For example, the journalist [[Will Evans (journalist)|Will Evans]] criticized<ref name="Evans_2010">http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2010/03/its_all_good.single.html, Article of 19 March 2010 on ''Slate'' by Will Evans criticizing [[Ethisphere]].</ref> the [[Ethisphere Institute]] in March 2010 on ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate magazine]]''
for receiving payment from the companies they rank in their “World’s Most Ethical Companies” awards,
for claiming as members of its “panel of independent experts” people who did not actively participate
and for including [[McDonald's]] in their awards.
<!-- [[Chris McDonald (on-line journalist)]] published a reaction<ref>http://businessethicsblog.com/2010/03/</ref> to these criticisms on [[The Business Ethics Blog]]. -->

==Academic discipline==
As an academic discipline, business ethics emerged in the 1970s. Since no academic business ethics journals or conferences existed, researchers published in general management journals, and attended general conferences. Over time, specialized peer-reviewed journals appeared, and more researchers entered the field. Corporate scandals in the earlier 2000s increased the field's popularity. As of 2009, sixteen academic journals devoted to various business ethics issues existed, with [[Journal of Business Ethics]] and [[Business Ethics Quarterly]] considered the leaders.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1504/IJBGE.2009.023790|accessdate=2009-10-21|url=http://www.aserenko.com/papers/IJBGE040405_PUBLISHED.pdf|author=Serenko, A. and Bontis, N. |year=2009|title=A citation-based ranking of the business ethics scholarly journals|journal= International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics |volume=4|issue=4|pages=390–399}}</ref>

[[The International Business Development Institute]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Post a Job |url=http://www.ibdinstitute.org |title=IBD Institute |publisher=IBD Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> is a global non-profit organization that represents 217 nations and all 50 United States. It offers a Charter in Business Development (CBD) that focuses on ethical business practices and standards. The Charter is directed by [[Harvard]], [[MIT]], and [[Fulbright]] Scholars, and it includes graduate-level coursework in economics, politics, marketing, management, technology, and legal aspects of business development as it pertains to business ethics. IBDI also oversees the International Business Development Institute of Asia<ref>http://www.ibdinstitute.asia</ref> which provides individuals living in 20 Asian nations the opportunity to earn the Charter.

==Religious views==
The Ten Commandments found in the Old Testament contain injunctions to truthfulness and honesty and prohibitions against theft that many people can and do apply to business. The notion of treating others as one would wish to be treated also applies, as do many other religious traditions that have guided people's actions for centuries and continue to do so. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/ Thomas Aquinas] condemned usury, and such Reformation figures as [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=luther Luther], [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=john%20calvin Calvin], and [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=john%20wesley John Wesley] paved the way for the notion of Protestant work ethic. In more recent periods, the Popes, starting with Pope Leo XIII in 1891 and his Encyclical ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html Rerum Novarum]'', began the tradition of dealing with issues of social justice which has been continued to the present day. In the Protestant tradition likewise, figures such as [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414557/Reinhold-Niebuhr Reinhold Niebuhr] criticized capitalism in ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'' and influenced courses in seminaries and schools of theology.<ref>DeGeorge, Richard T. Business Ethics. 7th. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc. , 2010. 9. Print.</ref>

==Related disciplines==
[[Business]] ethics is part of the [[philosophy of business]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that deals with the philosophical, political, and [[ethics|ethical]] underpinnings of business and [[economics]].<ref>Christoph Luetge (ed.): Handbook of the Philosophical Foundations of Business Ethics. Heidelberg/New York: Springer 2013, ISBN 978-9400714953.</ref> Business ethics operates on the premise, for example, that the ethical operation of a private business is possible—those who dispute that premise, such as [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]], (who contend that "business ethics" is an [[oxymoron]]) do so by definition outside of the domain of business ethics proper.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The philosophy of business also deals with questions such as what, if any, are the [[social responsibility|social responsibilities]] of a business; [[business management]] [[theory]]; theories of [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]]; [[free will]] among participants in the [[marketplace]]; the role of [[selfishness|self interest]]; [[invisible hand]] theories; the requirements of [[social justice]]; and [[natural rights]], especially [[property rights]], in relation to the business enterprise.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Business ethics is also related to [[political economy]], which is [[economic analysis]] from political and [[economic history|historical]] perspectives. Political economy deals with the distributive consequences of economic actions. It asks who gains and who loses from [[economic activity]], and is the resultant [[distribution of wealth|distribution]] fair or just, which are central ethical issues.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
