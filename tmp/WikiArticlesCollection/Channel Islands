The '''Channel Islands''' ([[Norman language|Norman]]: ''Îles d'la Manche'', [[French language|French]]: ''Îles Anglo-Normandes'' or ''Îles de la Manche'') are an [[archipelago]] of British [[Crown Dependencies]] in the [[English Channel]], off the French coast of [[Normandy]]. They include two separate [[bailiwick]]s: the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]]. They are considered the remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], and are not part of the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/ChannelIslands.aspx |title=Royal.gov.uk |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> They have a total population of about 168,000 and their respective [[Capital (political)|capitals]], [[Saint Peter Port]] and [[Saint Helier]], have populations of 16,488 and 28,310. The total area of the islands is 194&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The Bailiwicks have been administered separately since the late 13th century; common institutions are the exception rather than the rule. The two Bailiwicks have no common laws, no common elections, and no common representative body (although their politicians consult regularly).

== Geography ==
[[File:Wyspy Normandzkie.png|thumb|right|240px|The Channel Islands and adjacent coast of France.]]
[[File:Jethou Herm Sark viewed from Jersey.jpg|thumb|Viewed from Jersey's north coast, [[Jethou]], [[Herm]] and [[Sark]] are hazy outlines on the horizon.]]

The eight permanently inhabited islands of the Channel Islands are 
* [[Jersey]]
* [[Guernsey]]
* [[Alderney]]
* [[Sark]]
* [[Herm]]
* [[Jethou]]
* [[Brecqhou]] (Brechou)
* [[Lihou]]
All of these except Jersey are in the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

There are also several uninhabited islets. Four are part of the Bailiwick of Jersey:

* The [[Minquiers]]
* [[Écréhous]]
* [[Les Dirouilles]]
* Les [[Pierres de Lecq]] (the Paternosters)

These lie off Alderney:

* [[Burhou]]
* [[Casquets]]
* [[Ortac]]
* Renonquet

These lie off Guernsey:
* [[Crevichon]]
* Grande Amfroque
* Les [[Houmets]]
(See also [[List of islands of the Bailiwick of Guernsey]])

In general the larger islands have the ''-ey'' suffix, and the smaller ones have the ''[[-hou]]'' suffix; these are believed to be from the [[Old Norse]] ''ey'' and ''holmr'', respectively which means island and islet.

The [[Chausey]] Islands south of Jersey are not generally included in the geographical definition of the Channel Islands but are occasionally described in English as 'French Channel Islands' in view of their French jurisdiction. They were historically linked to the Duchy of Normandy, but they are part of the French territory along with continental Normandy, and not part of the [[British Isles]] or of the Channel Islands in a political sense. They are an incorporated part of the commune of Granville ([[Manche]]). While they are popular with visitors from France, Channel Islanders rarely visit them as there are no direct transport links from the other islands.

In official [[Jersey Legal French|Jersey French]], the islands are called 'Îles de la Manche', while in France, the term 'Îles Anglo-normandes' (Anglo-Norman isles) is used to refer to the British 'Channel Islands' in contrast to other islands in the Channel. Chausey is referred to as an 'Île normande' (as opposed to ''anglo-normande''). 'Îles Normandes' and 'Archipel Normand' have also, historically, been used in Channel Island French to refer to the islands as a whole.

The very large tidal variation provides an environmentally rich inter-tidal zone around the islands, and some islands such as [[Burhou]], the [[Écréhous]], and the [[Minquiers]] have been designated [[Ramsar sites]].

The waters around the islands include the following:

* [[The Swinge]] (between Alderney and Burhou)
* The Little Swinge (between Burhou and Les Nannels)
* La Déroute (between Jersey and Sark, and Jersey and the Cotentin)
* Le Raz Blanchard, or Race of Alderney (between Alderney and the Cotentin)
* The [[Great Russel]] (between Sark, Jéthou and Herm)
* The [[Little Russel]] (between Guernsey, Herm and Jéthou)
* Souachehouais (between Le Rigdon and L'Étacq, Jersey)
* Le Gouliot (between Sark and Brecqhou)
* La Percée (between Herm and Jéthou)

The highest point in the islands is [[Les Platons]] in Jersey at 143 metres (469&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest point is the Atlantic Ocean (sea level).

===Prehistory===
The earliest evidence of human occupation of the Channel Islands has been dated to 250,000 years ago when they were attached to the landmass of continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/island-life/history-heritage/la-cotte/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> The islands became detached by rising sea levels in the Neolithic period. The numerous [[dolmen]]s and other archaeological sites extant and recorded in history demonstrate the existence of a population large enough and organised enough to undertake constructions of considerable size and sophistication, such as the burial mound at [[La Hougue Bie]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/la-hougue-bie/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> in Jersey or the [[statue menhir]]s of Guernsey.

===From the Iron Age===

Hoards of [[Armorica]]n coins have been excavated, providing evidence of trade and contact in the [[Iron Age]] period. Evidence for Roman settlement is sparse, although evidently the islands were visited by Roman officials and traders. The traditional Latin names of the islands (Caesarea for Jersey, Sarnia for Guernsey, Riduna for Alderney) derive (possibly mistakenly) from the [[Antonine Itinerary]]. Gallo-Roman culture was adopted to an unknown extent in the islands.<ref>''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) ISBN 1-86077-065-7</ref>

In the 6th century Christian missionaries visited the islands. [[Samson of Dol]], [[Helier]], [[Marculf]] and [[Magloire]] are among saints associated with the islands. Although originally included within the [[diocese of Dol]], in the 6th century the islands were transferred to the [[diocese of Coutances]], perhaps under the influence of [[Prætextatus (Bishop of Rouen)|Prætextatus]].

From the beginning of the 9th century [[Vikings|Norse]] [[Viking expansion|raiders]] appeared on the coasts. Norse settlement succeeded initial attacks, and it is from this period that many place names of Norse origin appear, including the modern names of the islands.

===From the Duchy of Normandy===

The islands were annexed to the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in 933. In 1066, [[William I of England|William II of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] to the king of France, invaded and conquered England, becoming William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. In the period 1204–1214, [[John of England|King John]] lost the [[Angevin lands]] in northern France, including mainland Normandy, to [[Philip II of France|King Philip II of France]]; in 1259 his successor, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] officially surrendered his claim and title to the Duchy of Normandy, while retaining the Channel Islands. Since then, the Channel Islands have been governed as possessions of [[the Crown]] separate from the Kingdom of England and its successor kingdoms of Great Britain and the United Kingdom.

The islands were invaded by the French in 1338, who held some territory until 1345. [[Owain Lawgoch]], a mercenary leader of a [[Free Company]] in the service of the French Crown,  attacked Jersey and Guernsey in 1372, and in 1373 [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] besieged [[Mont Orgueil]].<ref>
[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/bertrand-du-guesclin/ Bertrand du Guesclin: The Black Dog of Brittany] Thisisjersey.com, copyright 2010, accessed 31 October 2010.</ref> Jersey was occupied by the French in the [[Wars of the Roses]] from 1461 to 1468. In 1483 a [[Papal Bull]] decreed that the islands would be neutral during time of war. This privilege of neutrality enabled islanders to trade with both France and England and was respected until 1689 when it was abolished by [[Order in Council]] following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in Great Britain.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Various attempts to transfer the islands from the diocese of Coutances (to Nantes (1400), Salisbury (1496) and Winchester (1499)) had little effect until an Order in Council of 1569 brought the islands formally into the [[diocese of Winchester]]. Control by the bishop of Winchester was ineffectual as the islands had turned overwhelmingly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and the episcopacy was not restored until 1620 in Jersey and 1663 in Guernsey.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Sark in the 16th century was uninhabited until colonised from Jersey in the 1560s. The grant of seigneurship from [[Elizabeth I of England]] forms the basis of Sark's constitution today.

Over a dozen [[windmills]] are known to have existed in the Channel Isles. They were mostly [[tower mill]]s used for grinding corn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===From the 17th century===

During the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Jersey held out strongly for the Royalist cause, providing refuge for [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1646 and 1649–1650, while the more strongly Presbyterian Guernsey more generally favoured the parliamentary cause (although [[Castle Cornet]] was, on 15 December 1651, the last Royalist stronghold in the British Isles to surrender).<ref>''Portrait of the Channel Islands'', Lemprière, London 1970</ref>

The islands acquired commercial and political interests in the North American colonies. Islanders became involved with the [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] fisheries in the 17th century. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] gave [[George Carteret]], Bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he promptly named [[New Jersey]], now part of the United States of America. [[Edmund Andros|Sir Edmund Andros]] of Guernsey was an early colonial governor in North America, and head of the short-lived [[Dominion of New England]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the 19th century, wealthy French émigrés fleeing the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] sought residency in the islands. Many of the town domiciles existing today were built in that time. In [[Saint Peter Port]], a large part of the harbour had been built by 1865.

===20th century===

====World War II====

The islands were the only part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] to be [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by the German Army]] during [[World War II]].

The [[British Government]] demilitarised the islands in June 1940 and the Lieutenant-Governors were withdrawn on 21 June, leaving the insular administrations to continue government as best they could under impending military occupation.<ref name="GOotCI" />

Before German troops landed, between 30 June and 4 July 1940, evacuation took place (many young men had already left to join the Allied armed forces): 6,600 out of 50,000 left Jersey whilst 17,000 out of 42,000 left Guernsey.<ref name="guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com">{{cite web|url=http://guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com/evacuation/ |title=A Forgotten Story &#124; Guernsey Evacuees Oral History |publisher=Guernseyevacuees.wordpress.com |date=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref> Thousands of children were evacuated with their schools to [[England]] and [[Scotland]].

The population of Sark largely remained where they were;<ref name="GOotCI" /> but in [[Alderney#History|Alderney]], the entire population, save for six persons, left. In Alderney, the occupying Germans built [[Alderney concentration camps|four concentration camps]] in which over 700 people out of a total prisoner population of about 6,000 died. Due to the destruction of documents, it is impossible to state how many forced workers died in the other islands.<ref name="GOotCI" /> These were the only Nazi concentration camps on [[British Islands|British]] soil.<ref name="okeefe">{{cite web |author=Christine O'Keefe |url=http://www.tartanplace.com/tartanhistory/concentrationcamps.html |title=Appendix F: Concentration Camps: Endlösung – The Final Solution |accessdate=6 June 2009 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The [[Royal Navy]] [[blockade]]d the islands from time to time, particularly following the [[Invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944. There was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation, particularly in the final months when the population was close to starvation. Intense negotiations resulted in some humanitarian aid being sent via the [[Red Cross]], leading to the arrival of the [[Red Cross]] supply ship ''Vega'' in December 1944.

The German occupation of 1940–45 was harsh: over 2,000 Islanders were deported by the Germans,<ref name="GOotCI">''The German Occupation of the Channel Islands'', Cruikshank, Oxford 1975 ISBN 0-19-285087-3</ref> and Jews were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]; [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] resistance and retribution, accusations of [[collaborationism|collaboration]], and slave labour also occurred. Many Spaniards, initially refugees from the [[Spanish Civil War]], were brought to the islands to build [[fortification]]s.<ref>[http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/german-occupation Thisisjersey.com]/</ref><ref name=Ginns /> Later, [[Russia]]ns and [[Eastern Europe]]ans continued the work.<ref name=Ginns>{{cite book|last=Ginns|first=Michael|title=Jersey Occupied: The German Armed Forces in Jersey 1940-1945|year=2009|publisher=Channel Island Publishing|isbn=1905095295}}</ref> Many [[land mine]]s were laid, with 65,718 land mines laid in Jersey alone.<ref>''German Fortifications in Jersey'', Ginns & Bryans, Jersey 1975</ref>

There was no resistance movement in the Channel Islands on the scale of that in mainland France. This has been ascribed to a range of factors including the physical separation of the Islands, the density of troops (up to one German for every two Islanders), the small size of the Islands precluding any hiding places for resistance groups and the absence of the Gestapo from the occupying forces. Moreover, much of the population of military age had joined the British Army already.

The end of the occupation came after [[VE-Day]] on 8 May 1945, Jersey and Guernsey being liberated on 9 May. The German garrison in Alderney did not surrender until 16 May, and it was one of the last of the [[Nazi German]] remnants to surrender.<ref name="dday">{{cite web |author=Legacy Publishers |title=Nazi Germany Surrenders: February 1945 – May 1945 |url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/world-war-ii/nazi-germany-surrenders12.htm |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====Post-1945====

Following the liberation of 1945, reconstruction led to a transformation of the economies of the islands, attracting immigration and developing tourism. The legislatures were reformed and non-party governments embarked on social programmes, aided by the incomes from [[offshore finance]], which grew rapidly from the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/community/history-heritage/finance-industry/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>

Since the 1990s declining profitability of agriculture and tourism have challenged the governments of the islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/lifestyle/hanging-on-to-our-heritage/the-bailiwick-of-guernsey/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisguernsey.com |date=1945-05-09 |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>

The Channel Islands fall into two separate [[federacy|self-governing]] bailiwicks, the Bailiwick of [[Guernsey]] and the Bailiwick of [[Jersey]]. Both are [[British Empire|British]] [[Crown dependency|Crown Dependencies]], and neither is part of the United Kingdom. They have been part of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] since the 10th century and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is often referred to by her traditional and conventional title of [[Duke of Normandy]]. However, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)]], she  governs in her right as The Queen (the "Crown in right of Jersey",<ref>{{cite web

This notwithstanding, it is a matter of local pride for monarchists to treat the situation otherwise: the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]] at formal dinners is to 'The Queen, our Duke', rather than to 'Her Majesty, The Queen' as in the UK.<ref>{{cite web

A bailiwick is a territory administered by a Bailiff. Although the words derive from a common root ('bail' = 'to give charge of') there is a vast difference between the meaning of the word 'bailiff' (English) and 'Bailiff' (CI). (The former is a court appointed private debt-collector authorised to collect judgment debts, while the latter is the most important citizen within his or her Bailwick.)  The [[Bailiff (Channel Islands)|Bailiff]] in each Bailiwick is the civil head, presiding officer of the States, and also head of the [[judiciary]].

In the early part of the twenty-first century, the existence of governmental offices such as the Bailiffs' which incorporate multiple roles straddling the different branches of Government came under increased scrutiny for their apparent contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers—most notably in the Guernsey case of McGonnell -v- United Kingdom (2000) 30 EHRR 289 which following final judgement at the European Court of Human Rights became part of the impetus for much recent constitutional change, particularly the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (2005 c.4) in the UK itself, including the separation of the roles of the Lord Chancellor, the abolition of the House of Lords' judicial role, and its replacement by the UK Supreme Court. The Islands' Bailiffs however, still retain their historic roles.

The systems of government in the Islands date from [[Normans|Norman]] times, which accounts for the names of the legislatures, the States, derived from the [[Norman language|Norman]] 'États' or '[[Estates of the realm|estates]]' (i.e. the Crown, the Church, and the people). The States have evolved over the centuries into democratic parliaments.

[[File:States Chamber public entrance Jersey.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the public gallery of the States Chamber in Jersey.]]

Each island has its own primary legislature, known as the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[States of Jersey]], with Chief Pleas in Sark and the [[States of Alderney]] - the Channel Islands are not represented in the [[UK Parliament]]. Laws passed by the States are given [[Royal Assent]] by [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|The Queen in Council]], to whom the islands' governments are responsible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/crown/bg-info-crown-dependencies.pdf |title=Background briefing on the Crown Dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>

The islands are not part of the [[European Union]], but are part of the Customs Territory of the [[European Community]] by virtue of Protocol Three to the [[Treaty on European Union]]. In September 2010, a Channel Islands Brussels Office was set up jointly by the two Bailiwicks to develop the Channel Islands' influence with the EU, to advise the Channel Islands' governments on European matters, and to promote economic links with the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/ID%20InternationalInsight%2020101118%20JN.pdf |title=Guernsey and Jersey begin recruiting for senior Brussels positions |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>

Both Bailiwicks are members of the [[British-Irish Council]], and [[Jèrriais]] and [[Guernésiais]] are recognised [[regional language]]s of the Isles.

The legal courts are separate; separate courts of appeal have been in place since 1961. Among the legal heritage from Norman law is the [[Clameur de haro|Clameur de Haro]].

Islanders are full British citizens, and therefore European citizens. Any British citizen who applies for a passport in Jersey or Guernsey receives a passport bearing the words "[[British Islands]], Bailiwick of Jersey" or "British Islands, Bailiwick of Guernsey". Under the provisions of Protocol Three, Channel Islanders who do not have a close connection with the UK (no parent or grandparent from the UK, and have never been resident in the UK for a five-year period) do not automatically benefit from the EU provisions on free movement within the EU and their passports receive an endorsement to that effect. This affects only a minority of islanders.

Under the UK [[Interpretation Act 1978]], the Channel Islands are deemed to be part of the British Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1838152 |title="British Islands" means the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

Tourism is the major industry in the smaller islands (with some agriculture). However Jersey and Guernsey have, since the 1960s, become major [[offshore financial center]]s & [[tax haven]]s on the scale of the [[Cayman Islands]] or [[Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zyen.com/GFCI/GFCI%208.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 8 |publisher=[[Z/Yen]] |year=2010}}</ref> Guernsey's horticultural and greenhouse activities have been more significant than in Jersey, and Guernsey has maintained [[light industry]] as a higher proportion of its economy than Jersey. Jersey's economy since the 1980s has been substantially more reliant on finance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Both Bailiwicks issue their own banknotes and coins, which circulate freely in all the islands alongside UK coinage and Bank of England and Scottish banknotes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

There are many exports, largely consisting of crafted goods and farmed produce.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Transport and communications ==

===Post===
{{main|Jersey Post|Guernsey Post}}
Since 1969, Jersey and Guernsey have operated postal administrations independently of the UK's [[Royal Mail]], with their own postage stamps, which can be used for postage only in their respective Bailiwicks. UK stamps are no longer valid, but mail to the islands, and to the [[Isle of Man]], is charged at UK inland rates. It was not until the early 1990s that the islands joined the [[UK postcodes|UK's postcode]] system, Jersey postcodes using the initials JE and Guernsey GY.

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Guernsey|Transport in Jersey}}

====Road====
{{main|Roads in Jersey}}
Each of the three largest islands has a distinct vehicle registration scheme:

* Guernsey (GBG): a number of up to five digits;
* Jersey (GBJ): ''J'' followed by up to six digits (''JSY'' vanity plates are also issued);
* Alderney (GBA): ''AY'' followed by up to five digits (four digits are the most that have been used, as redundant numbers are re-issued).

In [[Sark]], where most motor traffic is prohibited, the few vehicles{{spaced ndash}}nearly all tractors{{spaced ndash}}do not display plates. Bicycles display tax discs.

====Sea====
In the 1960s, names used for the cross-Channel ferries plying the mail route between the islands and [[Weymouth, Dorset]], were taken from the popular Latin names for the islands: ''Caesarea'' (Jersey), ''Sarnia'' (Guernsey) and ''Riduna'' (Alderney).

Today, the ferry route between the Channel Islands and the UK is operated by [[Condor Ferries]] from both St Helier, Jersey and St Peter Port, Guernsey, using high-speed catamaran fast craft to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Poole]] in the UK. A regular passenger ferry service on the Commodore Clipper goes from both Channel Island ports to [[Portsmouth]] daily, and carries both passengers and freight.

Ferry services to Normandy are operated by Manche Îles Express, and services between Jersey and [[Saint Malo]] are operated by Compagnie Corsaire and Condor.

The Isle of Sark Shipping Company operates small ferries to Sark.

====Air====
There are three airports in the Channel Islands; [[Alderney Airport]], [[Guernsey Airport]] and [[Jersey Airport]], which are directly connected to each other by services operated by [[Blue Islands]] and [[Aurigny]].

====Rail====
Historically there have been railway networks on Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, but all of the lines on Jersey and Guernsey have been closed and dismantled. Today there are three working railways in the Channel Islands, of which the [[Alderney Railway]] is the only one providing a regular timetabled passenger service. The other two are a {{RailGauge|7.25}} gauge miniature railway, also on Alderney, and the heritage steam railway operated on Jersey as part of the [[Pallot Heritage Steam Museum]].

===Media===
Regional television and radio broadcasts are available in the islands.  These services are provided by [[BBC Radio Jersey]], [[BBC Radio Guernsey]], [[Spotlight (BBC News)#BBC Channel Islands|BBC Channel Islands]], [[ITV Channel Television]], [[Island FM]], and [[Channel 103]].

Television programmes are broadcast from the [[Frémont Point transmitting station]].

There are some local newspapers including the [[Guernsey Press and Star|Guernsey Press]] and the [[Jersey Evening Post]].

===Telephone===
{{main|Telecommunications in Jersey}}
Jersey always operated its own telephone services independently of the UK's national system, but Guernsey did not establish its own telephone services until 1969. Both islands still form part of the [[Telephone numbers in the United Kingdom|UK telephone numbering plan]], but [[Ofcom]] in the UK does not have responsibility for telecommunications regulatory and licensing issues on the islands. It is responsible for wireless telegraphy licensing throughout the islands, and by agreement, for broadcasting regulation in the two large islands only.

===Internet===
Modern broadband speeds are available in all the islands, including VDSL for home and business. Providers include Sure (Cable & Wireless) and JT (Jersey Telecome).

The two Bailiwicks each have their own internet domain [[.GG]] (Guernsey, Alderney, Sark) and [[.JE]] (Jersey) which are managed by [http://www.channelisles.net CHANNELISLES.NET].

The [[Norman language]] predominated in the islands until the 19th century, when increasing influence from English-speaking settlers and easier transport links led to Anglicisation.<ref>''The Triumph of the Country'', Kelleher, Jersey 1994, ISBN 0-9518162-4-1</ref> There are four main dialects/languages of Norman in the islands, [[Auregnais]] (Alderney, extinct in late 20th century), [[Guernésiais|Dgèrnésiais]] (Guernsey), [[Jèrriais]] (Jersey) and [[Sercquiais]] (Sark, an offshoot of Jèrriais).<ref>''La Grève de Lecq'', Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 ISBN 2-905385-13-8</ref>

The annual "[[Muratti]]", the inter-island [[association football|football]] match, is considered the sporting event of the year, although, due to broadcast coverage, it no longer attracts the crowds of spectators, travelling between the islands, that it did during the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/2009/05/08/passion-plays-a-part-%E2%80%93-right-across-the-board/ |title=Thisisjersey.com |publisher=Thisisjersey.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>

* Guernsey: ''les ânes'' ("[[donkey]]s" in French and Norman): the steepness of St Peter Port streets required beasts of burden, but Guernsey people also claim it is a symbol of their strength of character{{spaced ndash}}which Jersey people traditionally interpret as stubbornness.
* Jersey: ''les crapauds'' ("[[toad]]s" in French and Jèrriais): Jersey has toads and snakes, which Guernsey lacks.
* Sark: ''les corbins'' ("[[crow]]s" in [[Sercquiais]], [[Dgèrnésiais]] and [[Jèrriais]], ''les corbeaux'' in French): crows could be seen from the sea on the island's coast.
* Alderney: ''les lapins'' ("[[rabbit]]s" in French and [[Auregnais]]): the island is noted for its [[warren (domestic)|warren]]s.

=== Faith and religious history ===
Christianity was brought to the islands around the 6th century; according to tradition, Jersey was evangelised by St [[Helier]], Guernsey by St [[Samson of Dol]], and the smaller islands were occupied at various times by monastic communities representing strands of [[Celtic Christianity]]. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the islands turned [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] under the influence of an influx of French-language pamphlets published in [[Geneva]]. [[Anglicanism]] was imposed in the 17th century, but the Non-Conformist tendency re-emerged with a strong adoption of [[Methodism]]. The presence of long-term Catholic communities from France and seasonal workers from Brittany and Normandy added to the mix of denominations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In late 20th Century, a strong Roman Catholic presence re-emerged with the many Portuguese workers (both from Mainland [[Portugal]] and the Island of [[Madeira]]) coming to live in the islands then more recently Polish Roman Catholics and other Eastern Europe worshipers. Services in a number of languages can be found along with many new more evangelical churches.
