==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The origin of the name Barbados is either the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word '''Barbados''' or the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] equivalent '''Barbudos''', both meaning "the bearded ones". It is unclear whether "bearded" refers to the long, hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]''), indigenous to the island; or to the allegedly bearded [[Carib people|Caribs]] once inhabiting the island; or, more fancifully, to the foam spraying over the outlying reefs giving the impression of a beard. In 1519, a map produced by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] mapmaker [[Visconte Maggiolo]] showed and named Barbados in its correct position. Furthermore, an island in the [[Leeward Islands|Leewards]] that is very close in name is [[Barbuda]] and was once named Las Barbudas by the Spanish. 

The uncertainty lies in which European nation arrived first in Barbados. According to some sources it was the Spanish during the early [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]. Others believe the [[History of Portugal (1415-1542)|Portuguese]], en route to [[Brazil]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbados.org/history1.htm |title=AXSES Systems Caribbean Inc., The Barbados Tourism Encyclopaedia |publisher=Barbados.org |date=8 February 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/52655/Barbados/54603/History |title=''Britannica Encyclopaedia'': History of Barbados |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> were the first Europeans to come upon the island.

The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was '''Ichirouganaim''' according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]-speaking tribes in other regional areas, with possible translations including "Red land with white teeth",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Barbados the Red Land with White Teeth: Home of the Amerindians|url=http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/ |accessdate=14 May 2010 |publisher=Barbados Museum & Historical Society| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100505161730/http://www.barbmuse.org.bb/| archivedate= 5 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no |quote=A temporary exhibit which examined some of the preliminary excavations conducted at the dig site at Heywoods, St. Peter.}}</ref> "Redstone island with teeth outside (reefs)",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Barbados – Geography / History |url=http://www.coucouandflyingfish.com/where.php |accessdate=14 May 2010 |year=2008 |publisher=Fun 'N' Sun Publishing Inc.}}</ref> or simply "Teeth".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/News/pdf/guyana_consul_visit.pdf |title=Guyana Consul (Barbados) Visit to Former Amerindian Village Site in B'dos |first=Norman |last=Faria |date=17 June 2009 |work=Guyana Chronicle |publisher=Pan-Tribal Confederacy of Indigenous Tribal Nations |page=2 |accessdate=14 May 2010 |quote=Adjacent to the park, there is still a fresh water stream. This as a main reason the village was here. A hundred or so metres away is the sea and a further five hundred metres out across a lagoon was the outlying reef where the Atlantic swells broke on the coral in shallow waters. As an aside, the word "Ichirouganaim", said to be an Arawak word used by the Amerindians to describe Barbados, is thought to refer to the imagery of "teeth" imagery of the waves breaking on the reefs off most of southern and eastern coasts. }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Drewett |first1=Dr. Peter|title=Prehistoric Barbados|accessdate=14 May 2010 |publisher=Barbados Museum and Historical Society |isbn=1-873132-15-8}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Drewett |first1=Dr. Peter|title=Prehistoric Settlements in the Caribbean: Fieldwork on Barbados, Tortola and the Cayman Islands |accessdate=14 May 2010 |date=April |year=2000 |publisher=Archetype Publications Ltd. |isbn=1-873132-22-0}}</ref>

Other names or nicknames associated with Barbados include "Bim" and "Bimshire". The origin is uncertain but several theories exist. The [[National Cultural Foundation]] of Barbados says that "Bim" was a word commonly used by [[slave]]s and that it derives from the phrase "bi mu" or either ("bem", "Ndi bem", "Nwanyi ibem" or "Nwoke ibem")<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25">{{Cite book |author=Carrington, Sean |title=A~Z of Barbados Heritage |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Caribbean Publishers Limited|page=25 |isbn=0-333-92068-6}}</ref> from an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] phrase meaning "my people" or "my place". In colloquial or literary contexts, "Bim" can also take a more deific tone, referring to the "goddess" Barbados.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The word ''Bim'' and ''Bimshire'' are recorded in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and ''[[Chambers Dictionary|Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionaries]]''. Another possible source for "Bim" is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868, The Rev. N. Greenidge (father of one of the island's most famous scholars, [[Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge]]) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England. Expressly named were "Wiltshire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Bimshire".<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25" /> Lastly in the ''Daily Argosy'' (of Demerara, i.e. Guyana) of 1652 it referred to Bim as a possible corruption of the word "Byam", who was a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians. That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as Bims and became a word for all Barbadians.<ref name="Carrington, Sean 2007 25" />

The Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] briefly claimed Barbados from the late 16th to the 17th centuries.The Arawaks are believed to have fled to neighbouring islands. Apart from possibly displacing the Caribs, the Spanish and Portuguese left little impact and left the island uninhabited. Some Arawaks migrated from Guyana in the 1800s and continue to live in Barbados.<ref name="UCTP"/><ref>[http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/history.php An Abbreviated Synopsys of Eagle Clan Arawak History 1692–1999], Origin of the Eagle Clan, Pan-Tribal Confederacy of Indigenous Tribal Nations</ref><ref>[http://www.pantribalconfederacy.com/confederacy/pdf/marion_desc.pdf Descendants of Princess Marian].

From the arrival of the first English settlers in 1627–1628 until independence in 1966, Barbados was under uninterrupted English and later British governance and was the only Caribbean island that did not change hands during the colonial period. In the very early years, the majority of the population was [[white people|white]] and male, with African slaves providing little of the workforce. Cultivation of tobacco, cotton, [[ginger]] and [[indigo]] was handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the [[sugar cane]] industry in the 1640s. As Barbados' economy grew, Barbados developed a large measure of local autonomy through its founding as a [[proprietary colony]]. Its [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] began meeting in 1639. Among the island's earliest leading figures was the Anglo-Dutch [[William Courten|Sir William Courten]].

The [[Great Hurricane of 1780|1780 hurricane]] killed over 4,000 people on Barbados. In 1854, a [[cholera]] epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/caribbean-islands/83.htm Barbados]". [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].</ref> At emancipation in the late 1830s, the size of the slave population was approximately 83,000.

==Government and politics==
[[File:Bridgetown barbados parliament building.jpg|thumb|right|Parliament Building]]
{{Main|Government of Barbados|Politics of Barbados}}
Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966. It functions as a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]], modelled on the British [[Westminster system]], with [[Elizabeth II]], [[Queen of Barbados]], as [[head of state]], represented locally by the [[List of Governors-General of Barbados|Governor-General]], [[Elliott Belgrave]], and the [[Prime Minister of Barbados|Prime Minister]] as [[head of the government]]. The number of representatives within the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] has gradually increased from 24 at independence to its present total of 30 seats.

During the 1990s, at the suggestion of Trinidad and Tobago's [[Patrick Manning]], Barbados attempted a [[political union]] with [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Guyana]]. The project stalled after the then Prime Minister of Barbados, [[Lloyd Erskine Sandiford]], became ill and his [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] lost the next general election.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090624141705/http://jamaicaobserver.com/columns/html/20030720T080000-0500_46578_OBS_CHASING_AFTER_AN_ELUSIVE_UNION.asp Chasing after an elusive union].

NationNews.com. 14 July 2003</ref> However, Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and with Guyana, claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Barbados functions as a [[two-party system]], the two dominant parties being the ruling Democratic Labour Party and the opposition [[Barbados Labour Party]] (BLP). Until 2003, each party had served two terms in office alternately.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foreign.gov.bb/pageselect.cfm?page=18 |title=Government of Barbados |author=G. O. B. |year=2011 |work=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade]] B.G.I.S. |accessdate=16 October 2011 }}</ref> The [[Barbadian general election, 2003|general election of 2003]] victory for the Barbados Labour Party gave it a third term in office, as a result of which it achieved a total of fourteen continuous years in government, from 1994 until the [[Barbadian general election, 2008|2008 elections]]. Under that administration, the former Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Owen S. Arthur, acted as the [[CARICOM Heads of Government|Regional Leader]] of the Caribbean Single Market (CSM).

The Honourable [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]], who was elected Prime Minister of Barbados in 2008, died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on 23 October 2010 and was succeeded by his Deputy Prime Minister, [[Freundel Stuart]], was sworn in as head of government the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/12828.html#axzz1mmwqxqKU |title=Barbados elections: A sweeping change |publisher=Caribbean360.com|date= 19 February 2012 |accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/10/23/barbados.prime.minister.obit/index.html?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=Barbados PM dies at 48 | date=25 October 2010}}</ref>

A General Election held on 21 February 2013 returned the DLP to power with a 16 to 14 majority and the Honourable Freundel Stuart was re-elected as Prime Minister.

Barbados has had several third parties since independence: The People's Pressure Movement, formed in the early 1970s, which contested the 1976 elections; The National Democratic Party, which contested the 1994 elections; and the People's Democratic Congress, which contested the 2008 elections. Apart from these, several independents have stood for election, but no independent has yet won a seat in Parliament.

===Law===
The [[Constitution of Barbados]] is the supreme law of the nation.<ref>[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Barbados/barbados66.html The official Constitution of Barbados] (1966) version.</ref> The Attorney General heads the independent [[judiciary]]. Historically, Barbadian law was based entirely on [[English common law]] with a few local adaptations. At the time of independence, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] lost its ability to legislate for Barbados, but the existing English and British common law and statutes in force at that time, together with other measures already adopted by the [[Barbadian Parliament]], became the basis of the new country's legal system.

More recently, Barbadian legislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the United Nations, the [[Organization of American States]], or other international bodies to which Barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty. Additionally, through international co-operation, other institutions may supply the Barbados Parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before enacting it as local law.

New Acts are passed by the Barbadian Parliament, and require [[royal assent]] by the Governor-General to become law.

In Barbados, [[camouflage]] clothing is reserved for military use, being forbidden for civilians, including children, to wear.<ref name=fco/>

Barbados has been identified as one of the nations in which the [[International Press Institute]] would like to see the removal of [[criminal libel]] from the list of offences.<ref>[http://www.freemedia.at/our-activities/missions/americas-caribbean/singleview/article/ipi-caribbean-missions-to-focus-on-criminal-defamation.html IPI Caribbean Missions to Focus on Abolishing Criminal Defamation], Thursday, 19 April 2012</ref>

===Judiciary===
{{main|Judiciary of Barbados}}
The local court system of Barbados is made-up of:
*Magistrates' Courts: Covering Criminal, Civil, Domestic, Domestic Violence, and Juvenile matters. But can also take up matters dealing with Coroner's Inquests, Liquor Licences, and civil marriages. Further, the Magistrates' Courts deal with Contract and Tort law where claims do not exceed $10,000.00.<ref name="court">{{cite web|url=http://www.lawcourts.gov.bb/Aboutus.html |title=Law Courts of Barbados |publisher=Lawcourts.gov.bb |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>
*The [[Supreme Court of Barbados|Supreme Court]]: is made up of High Court and Court of Appeals.<ref name="court" />
**High Court: Consisting of Civil, Criminal, and Family law divisions.
**Court of Appeal: Handles appeals from the High Court and Magistrates' Court. It hears appeals in both the civil, and criminal law jurisdictions. It may consist of a single Justice of Appeal sitting in Chambers; or may sit as a Full Court of three Justices of Appeals.
*The [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), (based in [[Port of Spain]], Trinidad and Tobago), is the court of last resort (final jurisdiction) over Barbadian law. It replaced the London-based [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC). The CCJ may resolve other disputed matters dealing with the [[Caribbean (CARICOM) Single Market and Economy]] (CSME).

===Foreign relations===

[[File:David Thompson with Obamas.jpg|thumb|[[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]], sixth Prime Minister of Barbados, with President Obama]]
Barbados is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS).<ref>[http://barbadosbusiness.gov.bb/miib/Barbados/regional_links.cfm BarbadosBusiness.gov.bb], The Barbados government's Regional and International affiliations</ref> [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), which currently pertains only to Barbados, [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]]. In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] with the Caribbean Court of Justice.

Barbados is an original Member (1995) of the [[World Trade Organisation]] (WTO), and participates actively in its work. It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners. As of December 2007, Barbados is linked by an [[Economic Partnership Agreement]] with the [[European Commission]]. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) subgroup of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific states]] (ACP). CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the [[European Union]].

Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities, mostly food production, from foreign competition, while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports.

In 2013, CARICOM called for European nations to pay [[reparations for slavery]] and established an official reparations commission.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587236-pressure-grows-compensation-caribbean-trade-blood-money |title=Slavery reparations: Blood money |publisher=''[[The Economist]]'' |date=October 5, 2013}}</ref>

Barbados is the easternmost island in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west, the [[Windward Islands]]. The island rises gently to the central highland region, with the highpoint of the nation being [[Mount Hillaby]], in the geological [[Scotland District]], {{convert|340|m|ft}} above sea level. The island is situated in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the other [[West Indies]] Islands.

In the parish of [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]] lies Barbados' capital and main city, [[Bridgetown]]. Other major towns scattered across the island include [[Holetown]], in the parish of [[Saint James, Barbados|Saint James]]; [[Oistins]], in the parish of [[Christ Church, Barbados|Christ Church]]; and [[Speightstown]], in the parish of [[Saint Peter, Barbados|Saint Peter]].

The dating was carried out by the German Geographical Institute, and visitors can see a "map" of the dating work in the bar and restaurant.

The erosion of limestone rock in the North East of the island, in the [[Scotland District]], has resulted in the formation of various caves and [[gully]]s, some of which have become popular tourist attractions such as [[Harrison's Cave]] and Welchman Hall Gully. On the [[Atlantic]] East coast of the island [[coastal landforms]], including stacks, have been created due to the limestone composition of the area.

===Climate===
[[File:Bathsheba, Barbados 08.jpg|thumb|[[Bathsheba, Saint Joseph, Barbados|Bathsheba]] on the east coast of the island]]
The country generally experiences two seasons, one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall. Known as the "[[wet season]]", this period runs from June to November. By contrast, the "[[dry season]]" runs from December to May. The annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|40|in|mm}} and {{convert|90|in|mm}}.
From December to May the average temperatures range from {{convert|21|to|31|C|F}}, while between June and November, they range from {{convert|23|to|31|C|F}}.<ref name="weather1">{{cite web | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003280 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070220165443/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003280 | archivedate =20 February 2007 | title =Average and Record Conditions at Bridgetown, Barbados| accessdate =10 September 2009 | publisher =BBC Weather}}</ref>

On the [[Köppen climate classification]] scale, much of Barbados is regarded as a [[Tropical monsoon climate]] (Am). However, gentle breezes of 12–16 kilometres per hour (8–10&nbsp;mph) abound throughout the year and give Barbados a warm [[climate]] which is moderately tropical.

Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes, [[landslip]]s, and [[hurricanes]]. Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region's [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricanes]] during the rainy season. The far eastern location in the Atlantic Ocean puts the country just outside the principal [[hurricane strike zone]]. On average, a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years. The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was [[Hurricane Janet]] in 1955, and more recently in 2010 the island was struck by [[Hurricane Tomas]], but this caused only minor damage across the country.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11660080 Hurricane Tomas lashes Caribbean islands]. BBC News, 30 October 2010.</ref>

===Environmental issues===
[[File:BarbadosFromISS.jpg|thumb|Barbados, seen from the [[International Space Station]]]]
The island is susceptible to environmental pressures. As one of the world's most [[List of island countries by population density|densely populated isles]], the government worked during the 1990s<ref>[http://www.cep.unep.org/pubs/Techreports/tr43en/Barbados.htm Domestic and Industrial Wastewater Treatment Techniques in Barbados]</ref> to aggressively integrate the growing south coast of the island into the Bridgetown Sewage Treatment Plant to reduce contamination of offshore coral reefs.<ref>[http://archive.wri.org/reefsatrisk/casestudy_text.cfm?ContentID=3332 Barbados], World Resources Institute</ref><ref>[http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=local&NewsID=4130 Perspectives: A continuing problem and persistent threat]</ref> As of the 2000s, a second treatment plant has been proposed along the islands' west coast. With such a dense populace, Barbados has placed large efforts on protecting its underground [[aquifer]]s. As a coral-limestone island, Barbados is highly permeable to seepage of surface water into the earth. As such, a major emphasis by the government has been placed on protecting the catchment areas (in specific surface areas known as buffer zones) that lead directly into the huge network of underground aquifers and streams.<ref>[http://www.barbadosadvocate.com/newsitem.asp?more=local&NewsID=185 PERSPECTIVES: Squatting – a continuing problem]</ref> On occasion illegal squatters have breached these areas, and the government has removed squatters to preserve the cleanliness of the underground springs which provide the island's drinking water.<ref>[http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/squatters-get-thumbs-down-from-mp-forde/ Squatters get thumbs down from MP Forde]</ref>

The government has placed a huge emphasis on keeping Barbados clean with the aim of protecting the environment and preserving offshore coral reefs which surround the island.

Barbados is host to four species of nesting turtles ([[green turtles]], [[Loggerhead sea turtle|loggerheads]], and [[leatherbacks]]) and has the second largest [[hawksbill turtle]] breeding population in the Caribbean.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/travel/caribbean/article/1144716--caribbean-travel-swim-with-the-turtles-in-barbados Caribbean Travel: Swim with the turtles in Barbados]</ref> The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried in the sand and such activity should be avoided in nesting areas.<ref>[http://www.divebarbadosblue.com/snorkeling/turtles-shipwrecks/ Sea Turtles – Dive Operators Association of Barbados], Barbados Blue Inc.</ref>

Though on the opposite side of the Atlantic, and some 3000 miles west of Africa, Barbados is one of many places in the American continent which experiences heightened levels of [[mineral dust]] from the [[Sahara Desert]].<ref>[http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/19-2_prospero.pdf Saharan Dust Impacts and Climate Change]</ref> Some particularly intense dust episodes have been blamed partly for the impacts on the health of coral reefs<ref>[http://coastal.er.usgs.gov/african_dust/ The Effects of African Dust on Coral Reefs and Human Health]</ref> surrounding Barbados or [[asthmatic]] episodes,<ref>[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Dust/ When the Dust Settles (DAAC Study)], NASA</ref> but evidence has not wholly supported the former such claim.<ref>[http://commprojects.jhsph.edu/globaltobacco/ProjectDetail.cfm?project_id=7780&country_code=BB The Impact of African Dust on Childhood Asthma Morbidity in Barbados]</ref>

Historically, the economy of Barbados had been dependent on [[sugarcane]] cultivation and related activities, but in the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors. Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners, and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector. Since the 1990s the Barbados Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The island has seen a construction boom, with the development and redevelopment of hotels, office complexes, and homes. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Recent government administrations have continued efforts to reduce unemployment, encourage [[foreign direct investment]], and privatise remaining state-owned enterprises. Unemployment has been reduced to 10.7 in 2003.<ref name="cia"/>

The economy contracted in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism, consumer spending and the impact of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], but rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004.<ref name="cia"/> Traditional trading partners include Canada, the [[Caribbean Community]] (especially [[Trinidad and Tobago]]), the United Kingdom and the United States.

Business links and investment flows have become substantial: as of 2003 the island saw from Canada [[Canadian dollar|CA$]] 25&nbsp;billion in investment holdings, placing it as one of Canada's top five destinations for Canadian foreign direct investment (FDI). Businessman [[Eugene Melnyk]] of Toronto, Canada, is said to be Barbados' richest permanent resident. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

It has been reported that the year 2006 would have been one of the busiest years for building construction ever in Barbados, as the building-boom on the island entered the final stages for several multi-million dollar commercial projects.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.nationnews.com/story/285076846570648.php |title=Builders paradise |accessdate=29 July 2009 |first=Roy |last=Morris |date=2 January 2006 |work=The Nation Newspaper |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060104024455/http://www.nationnews.com/story/285076846570648.php |archivedate=4 January 2009 |quote=Industry sources are warning, however, that while the boom will bring many jobs and much income, ordinary Barbadians hoping to undertake home construction or improvement will be hard pressed to find materials or labour, given the large number of massive commercial projects with which they will have to compete.&nbsp;...

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Barbados|Barbadian people}}
[[File:Barbados bus stop.jpg|thumb|right|A bus stop in Barbados]]
[[File:High street Barbados.jpg|right|thumb|High Street]]
Barbados has a population of about 281,968 and a population growth rate of 0.33% (Mid-2005 estimates). It currently ranks as: the fourth most densely populated country in [[the Americas]] ([[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|18th globally]]), and the [[List of Caribbean island countries by population|10th most populated]] island country in the region, ([[List of islands by population#Population 100,000 to 1,000,000|101st globally]]). Close to 90% of all Barbadians (also known colloquially as "Bajan") are of [[Afro-Caribbean]] descent ("Afro-Bajans") and mixed-descent. The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans ("Anglo-Bajans" / "Euro-Bajans") mainly from the United Kingdom and Ireland, along with Asians, mostly Chinese and Indians (both Hindu and Muslim).
Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. Barbadians who return after years of residence in the US and children born in America to Bajan parents are called "Bajan Yankees", a term considered derogatory by some.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Judith Ann-Marie Byfield|author2=LaRay Denzer|author3=Anthea Morrison|title=Gendering the African diaspora: women, culture, and historical change in the Caribbean and Nigerian hinterland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C6_aWWN5aoUC&pg=PA39|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-22153-7|pages=39–}}</ref> Generally, Bajans recognise and accept all "children of the island" as Bajans, and refer to each other as such.

The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are:

# The [[Indo-Guyanese]], an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country [[Guyana]]. There are reports of a growing Indo-Bajan diaspora originating from Guyana and [[India]]. They introduced [[roti]] and other Indian dishes to Barbados' culture. Mostly from southern India and Hindu states, they are growing in size but smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad & Guyana.
# Euro-Bajans (4% of the population)<ref name="cia">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bb.html Barbados] CIA World Factbook</ref> have settled in Barbados since the 17th century, originating from England, Ireland and [[Scotland]]. In 1643, there were 37,200 whites in Barbados (86% of the population).<ref>Karl Watson [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/barbados_01.shtml Population], ''Slavery and Economy in Barbados'', BBC. Last updated 17 February 2011</ref> More commonly they are known as "[[White Barbadian|White Bajans]]". Euro-Bajans introduced folk music, such as [[Irish music]] and Highland music, and certain place names, such as "Scotland", a mountainous region. Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as [[Redlegs]]; the descendants of [[Irish people|Irish]] slaves, and prisoners imported to the island.<ref>[http://www.irlandeses.org/0711rodgers2.htm The Irish in the Caribbean 1641–1837: An Overview], By Nini Rodgers, Society for Irish Latin American Studies</ref> Many additionally moved on to become the earliest settlers of modern-day [[Province of Carolina|North]] and [[Colonial period of South Carolina|South Carolina]] in the United States.
# Chinese-Barbadians are a small portion of Barbados' Asian demographics, smaller than the equivalent communities of Jamaica and Trinidad. Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s during the Second World War, originating mainly from the then British territory of Hong Kong. Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin, Chynn or Lee, although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island. Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture.
# Lebanese and Syrians form the [[Arab]] community on the island, and the Muslim minority among them make up a small percentage of the Muslim population. The majority of the Lebanese and Syrians arrived in Barbados through trade opportunities. However, the numbers are dwindling due to emigration to other countries.
# [[Jewish people]] arrived in Barbados just after the first settlers in 1627. Bridgetown is the home of [[Nidhe Israel Synagogue]], the oldest Jewish synagogue in the Americas, dating from 1654, though the current structure was erected in 1833 replacing one ruined by the hurricane of 1831. Tombstones in the neighbouring cemetery date from the 1630s. Now under the care of the Barbados National Trust, the site was deserted in 1929 but was subsequently saved and restored by the Jewish community beginning in 1986.
# The Muslim-Indian Barbadian community is largely of [[Gujarat]]i ancestry. Many small businesses in Barbados are run and operated by Muslim-Indian Bajans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The average life expectancy is 72 years for males and 77 years for females.<ref name="cia"/> Barbados and Japan have the highest per capita occurrences of [[centenarian]]s in the world.<ref>Tony Best [http://web.archive.org/web/20071211110656/http://www.nationnews.com/story/284159291378094.php Bajan secrets to living long]. nationnews.com. 9/4/05</ref>

===Languages===
English is the [[official language]] of Barbados, and is used for communications, administration, and public services all over the island. In its capacity as the official language of the country, the standard of English tends to conform to the vocabulary, pronunciations, spellings, and conventions akin to, but not exactly the same as, those of [[British English]].

A regional variant of English, referred to locally as [[Bajan Creole|Bajan]], is spoken by most Barbadians in everyday life, especially in informal settings. In its full-fledged form, Bajan sounds markedly different from the Standard English heard on the island. The degree of intelligibility between Bajan and general English depends on the level of creolised vocabulary and idioms. A Bajan speaker may be completely unintelligible to an English speaker from another country. Bajan is influenced by other [[Caribbean English]] dialects.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Barbados}}
Most Barbadians of African and European descent are Christians (95%), chiefly [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] (40%). Other Christian denominations with significant followings in Barbados are the Catholic Church, Pentecostals (Evangelicals) [[Jehovah's Witness]]es, the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Spiritual Baptist]]s. The [[Church of England]] was the official state religion until its legal disenfranchisement by the Parliament of Barbados following independence.<ref>{{cite web|author=www.redspider.biz, Rajkumar Singh |url=http://www.caricomlaw.org/doc.php?id=179Barbados |title=Parliament: Act of Parliament concerning the Anglican church |publisher=Caricomlaw.org |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2010}} {{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Other religions in Barbados include [[Hinduism]], [[Islam in Barbados|Islam]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org/dir/bahaullah|title=Baha'u'llah|publisher=Bci.org |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> [[History of the Jews in Barbados|Judaism]] and [[Wicca]].

{{Main|Culture of Barbados}}
{{See also|Music of Barbados|Rihanna|Rupee (musician)|Shontelle|Cover Drive}}
The influence of the English on Barbados is more noticeable than on other islands in the West Indies. A good example of this is the island's national sport: [[cricket]]. Barbados has brought forth several great cricketers, including [[Garfield Sobers|Sir Garfield Sobers]] and [[Frank Worrell|Sir Frank Worrell]].

Citizens are officially called Barbadians. The term "Bajan" (pronounced BAY-jan) may have come from a localised pronunciation of the word Barbadian, which at times can sound more like "Bar-bajan".

The largest [[carnival]]-like cultural event that takes place on the island is the [[Crop Over]] festival. As in many other Caribbean and Latin American countries, Crop Over is an important event for many people on the island, as well as the thousands of tourists that flock to there to participate in the annual events. The festival includes musical competitions and other traditional activities, and features the majority of the island's homegrown [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[soca music|soca]] music for the year. The male and female Barbadians who harvested the most sugarcane are crowned as the King and Queen of the crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2camels.com/crop-over-festival.php |title=Crop Over Festival |publisher=2camels.com |accessdate=30 July 2009}}</ref> Crop Over gets under way at the beginning of July and ends with the costumed parade on Kadooment Day, held on the first Monday of August.

In music, [[Grammy awards|Grammy winner]] [[Rihanna]] (born in Saint Michael) is one of Barbados' best-known artists. In 2009 she was appointed as an Honorary Ambassador of youth and culture for Barbados by the late Prime Minister, [[David Thompson (Barbadian politician)|David Thompson]].

Singer-songwriter [[Shontelle]], the band [[Cover Drive]], and musician [[Rupee (musician)|Rupee]] also originate from Barbados. [[Grandmaster Flash]] (born Joseph Saddler in Bridgetown in 1958) is a hugely influential musician of Barbadian origin, pioneering [[hip-hop]] DJing, cutting, and [[DJ mix|mix]]ing in 1970s New York. [[The Merrymen]] are a well known Calypso band based in Barbados, performing from the 1960s into the 2010s.

==Health==
Similar to other nations within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], all Barbadian citizens are covered by [[national healthcare]]. The life expectancy for Barbados residents as of 2011 is 76.74 years. The crude birth rate is 12.23 births per 1,000 people, and the crude death rate is 8.39 deaths per 1,000 people. The infant mortality rate is 11.63 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Barbados has over twenty [[polyclinic]]s throughout the country in addition to the main [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (General Hospital) located in Bridgetown. In 2011, the Government of Barbados signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] to lease its 22-acre Saint Joseph Hospital site to the Denver, Colorado based [[America World Clinics]]. Under the deal, the group will use Barbados as one of its main destinations for [[medical tourism]] at that facility. The government also announced it would begin constructing a new $900 million state-of-the-art hospital to replace the QEH.

Barbados [[List of countries by literacy rate|literacy rate]] is ranked close to 100%, with both UNESCO and the Minister of Education stating that Barbados was in the top 5 countries worldwide for literacy rate.<ref name="unesco">{{cite web| url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/tableviewer/document.aspx?ReportId=143| title=Unesco Institute for Statistics: Date Centre| date=14 September 2007| accessdate=28 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110130085835/http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/tableviewer/document.aspx?ReportId=143| archivedate= 30 January 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> thus placing the country alongside many of the industrialised nations of the world. The mainstream public education system of Barbados is fashioned after the British model. The government of Barbados spends 6.7% of the GDP on education (2008).<ref name="cia"/> All young people in the country must attend school until age 16. Barbados has over 70 primary schools, and over 20 secondary schools throughout the island. There are also a number of private schools catering to various teaching models including [[Montessori]] and [[International Baccalaureate]]. Degree level education in the country is provided by the [[Barbados Community College]], the Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic, and the [[Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados|Cave Hill campus]] and Open Campus of the [[University of the West Indies]]

==Sports==
{{Main|Sport in Barbados}}

[[File:Garfield Sobers Pavilion.jpg|thumb| [[Kensington Oval]], in [[Bridgetown]], hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup final. Cricket is one of the most followed games in the nation and Kensington Oval is often referred to as the "Mecca in Cricket" due to its significance and contributions to the sport.]]

As in other Caribbean countries of British colonial heritage, [[cricket]] is very popular on the island. The [[West Indies cricket team]] usually includes several Barbadian players. In addition to several warm-up matches and six "Super Eight" matches, the country hosted the final of the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Barbados has produced many great cricketers including [[Sir Garfield Sobers]], [[Sir Frank Worrell]], [[Sir Clyde Walcott]], [[Sir Everton Weekes]], [[Gordon Greenidge]], Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]].

[[Horse racing]] takes place at the [[Garrison Savannah Racetrack|Historic Garrison Savannah]] close to Bridgetown. Spectators can pay for admission to the stands, or else can watch races from the public "rail", which encompasses the track.

[[Obadele Thompson]] is a world-class [[sprint (running)|sprinter]] from Barbados; he won a bronze medal at the Olympic Games of 2000 in the 100m sprint. [[Ryan Brathwaite]], a hurdler, reached the 2008 Olympic semi-finals in Beijing. Brathwaite also earned Barbados its first ever medal at the world championships in Berlin, Germany on 20 August 2009, when he won the men's 110 meter hurdles title. The 21-year-old timed a national record of 13.14 seconds to win the Gold Medal.

[[Polo]] is very popular amongst the rich elite on the island and the "High-Goal" [[Apes Hill]] team is based in the St James's Club.<ref>[http://www.apeshillclub.com/Polo/ Apes Hill Polo • Apes Hill Club]. Apeshillclub.com. Retrieved on 19 February 2012.</ref> It is also played at the private [[Holders Festival]] ground.

In golf, the [[Barbados Open]] is an annual stop on the [[European Seniors Tour]]. In December 2006 the [[WGC-World Cup]] took place at the country's [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort on the Country Club course, an 18-hole course designed by [[Tom Fazio]]. The Barbados Golf Club is the other main course on the island. Sanctioned by the PGA European Tour to host a PGA Seniors Tournament in 2003 and it has also hosted the Barbados Open on several occasions.

Basketball is a popular sport, played at school or college, and is increasing in popularity, as is volleyball, though volleyball is mainly played indoors.

Motorsports also play a role, with Rally Barbados occurring each summer and currently being listed on the FIA NACAM calendar.

The presence of the trade winds along with favourable swells make the southern tip of the island an ideal location for wave sailing (an extreme form of the sport of [[windsurfing]]).

[[Netball]] is also popular with women in Barbados.

==Transport==

[[File:BdsZRNov95.jpg|thumb|Typical ZR-van with markings indicating that it serves the number 11 route]]
In addition to being one of the world's most densely populated countries, Barbados also has one of the most dense road networks in the world. Although Barbados is only about {{convert|34|km|mi}} at its widest point, a car journey from Six Cross Roads in St. Philip (south-east) to North Point in St. Lucy (north-central) can take one and a half hours or longer, thanks to the country's narrow, winding and rough roads.

Barbados has half as many registered cars as citizens in the country. The first letter of a vehicle's licence plate designates its usage or owner's registered parish of residence. "Z" and "ZR" are for taxis; "H" for rental cars; "B" for buses and minibuses; "CD" for diplomatic cars; and "3D" or "7D" for defence force vehicles, while "ML" or "MP" with green plates usually designate military, police or government vehicles. As regards residence, "X" is for Christ Church; "A" for St. Andrew; "G" for St. George; "S" for St. James; "J" for St. John; "O" for St. Joseph; "L" for St. Lucy; "M" for St. Michael; "E" for St. Peter; "P" for St. Philip; and "T" for St. Thomas.

Public transport on the island is relatively convenient, with "[[share taxis|route taxis]]", called "ZRs" (pronounced "[[Z]]ed-Rs"), travelling to most points on the island. These small buses can at times be crowded, as passengers are generally never turned down, regardless of the number. However, they will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations. They generally depart from the capital [[Bridgetown]] or from [[Speightstown, Barbados|Speightstown]] in the northern part of the island.

Including the ZRs, there are three bus systems running seven days a week (though less frequently on Sundays). There are ZRs, the yellow minibuses and the blue [[Barbados Transport Board|Transport Board buses]]. A ride on any of them costs BBD$2.00. The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems ("ZRs" and "minibuses") can give change; the larger blue buses from the government-operated [[Barbados Transport Board]] system cannot, but do give receipts. Children in school uniform ride for free on the government buses and for $1.50 on the minibuses and ZRs. Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown. Some drivers within the competitive privately owned systems are reluctant to advise persons to use competing services, even if those would be more suitable.

Some hotels also provide visitors with shuttles to points of interest on the island from outside the hotel lobby. There are several locally owned and operated vehicle rental agencies in Barbados but there are no multi-national companies.

The island's lone airport is the [[Grantley Adams International Airport]]. It receives daily flights by several major airlines from points around the globe, as well as several smaller regional commercial airlines and charters. The airport serves as the main air-transportation hub for the eastern Caribbean. In the first decade of the 21st century it underwent a US$100&nbsp;million upgrade and expansion.

There is also a helicopter shuttle service, which offers air taxi services to a number of sites around the island, mainly on the West Coast tourist belt. Air and maritime traffic is regulated by the [[Barbados Port Authority]].
