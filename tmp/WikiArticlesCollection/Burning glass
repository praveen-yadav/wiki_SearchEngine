A '''burning glass''' or '''burning lens''' is a large [[Biconvex lens|convex lens]] that can concentrate the [[sun]]'s rays onto a small area, heating up the area and thus resulting in [[Combustion|ignition]] of the exposed surface. '''Burning mirrors''' achieve a similar effect by using reflecting surfaces to focus the light. They were used in 18th-century chemical studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the products of [[combustion]] could be trapped for analysis. The burning glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition was easily achieved.

==History==
The technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity. Vases filled with water used to start fires were known in the ancient world, and metaphorical significance was drawn (by the early [[Church Fathers]], for instance) from the fact that the water remained cool even though the light passing through it would set materials on fire. Burning lenses were used to [[cauterise]] wounds and to light sacred fires in temples. ''[[Plutarch]]'' refers to a burning mirror made of joined triangular metal mirrors installed at the temple of the [[Vestal Virgins]]. [[Aristophanes]] mentions the burning lens in his play ''[[The Clouds]]'' (424 BC). The [[Perpetual fire|perpetual sacred fire]] in the classic temples as the [[Olympic torch]] had to be pure and to come directly from the gods. For this they used the sun's rays focused with mirrors or lenses and not impure triggers.

[[Archimedes]], the renowned mathematician, was said to have used a burning glass (or more likely a large number of angled hexagonal mirrors{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}) as a weapon in 212 BC, when [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was besieged by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]. The [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] was supposedly incinerated, though eventually the city was taken and Archimedes was slain.<ref>Meijer, Fik (1986), A History of Seafaring in the Classical World, Routledge, ISBN 978-0-7099-3565-0</ref>

The legend of Archimedes gave rise to a considerable amount of research on burning glasses and lenses until the late 17th century. Various researchers worked with burning glasses, including [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (6th century AD), Proclus (6th century) (who by this means purportedly destroyed the fleet of Vitellus besieging [[Constantinople]]), [[Ibn Sahl]] in his ''On Burning Mirrors and Lenses'' (10th century), [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021),<ref>Roshdi Rashed (1990), "A Pioneer in Anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on Burning Mirrors and Lenses", ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''81''' (3), p. 464-491 [464-468].</ref> [[Roger Bacon]] (13th century), [[Giambattista della Porta]] and his friends (16th century), [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[Gaspar Schott]] (17th century), and the Comte du Buffon in 1740 in Paris.

The pop science TV program ''[[MythBusters]]'' attempted to model Archimedes' feat by using mirrors to ignite a small wooden boat covered with tar, with little success—they found it too difficult to focus light from their hand-held mirrors onto a point small enough to ignite the boat. However, an episode of [[Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections]] relating to the [[Keck Observatory]] (whose reflector glass is based on the Archimedes' Mirror) did successfully use a much smaller curved mirror to burn a wooden model, though not made of the same quality of materials as in the ''MythBusters'' effort.

Burning lenses were used both by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in their experiments to obtain oxides contained in closed vessels under high temperatures. These  included carbon dioxide by burning diamond, and [[Mercury(II)_oxide|mercuric oxide]] by heating [[Mercury_(element)|mercury]]. This type of experiment contributed to the discovery of [[Phlogiston theory|"dephlogisticated air"]] by Priestley, which became better known as oxygen, following Lavoisier's investigations.<ref>Joseph Priestley, ''Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air'' [[books.google.com/books?id=rk4TaRQTY7cC|Vol.2]] (1776)</ref>

In 1796, during the [[French Revolution]] and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, [[Étienne-Gaspard Robert]] met with the French government and proposed the use of mirrors to burn the invading ships of the British [[Royal Navy]].  They decided not to take up his proposal.<ref name="PreCinema">Burns, Paul.  "[http://www.precinemahistory.net/1750.htm The History of The Discovery of Cinematography: Chapter Six 1750-1799]".

Chapter 17 of [[William Bates (physician)|William Bates]]' 1920 book ''Perfect Sight Without Glasses'', in which the author argues that observation of the sun is beneficial to those with poor vision, includes a figure of somebody ''"Focussing the Rays of the Sun Upon the Eye of a Patient by Means of a Burning Glass."''<ref name="BatesChap17">{{cite book | last=Bates | first=William H. | title=Perfect Sight Without Glasses | year=1920 | chapter = Chapter 17: Vision Under Adverse Conditions a Benefit to the Eye | pages=183–197 | publisher=New York: Central Fixation Publish Co. | chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&pg=PA183&cad=0_0 | isbn=88-900756-3-5 }}</ref> Needless to say, this is highly dangerous and will damage the eye in seconds.

Burning glasses (often called '''fire lenses''') are still used to light fires in outdoor and primitive settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivefire.com/Fire-Glass_c_1.html |title=Fire Glass |publisher=Primitivefire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Large burning lenses sometimes take the form of [[Fresnel lens]]es, similar to [[lighthouse]] lenses,<ref>

They sometimes employ a large [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] array of mirrors (some facilities are several storeys high) to focus light to a high intensity.
