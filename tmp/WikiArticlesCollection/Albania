== Etymology ==
''Albania'' is the [[Medieval Latin]] name of the country which is called ''Shqipëri'' by its people. In [[Medieval Greek]], the country's name is ''Albania'' besides variants ''Albanitia'', ''Arbanitia''.

The name may be derived from the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the Albani recorded by [[Ptolemy]], the geographer and astronomer from [[Alexandria]] who drafted a map in 150&nbsp;AD<ref>Madrugearu A, Gordon M. The wars of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. p. 146.</ref> that shows the city of [[Albanopolis]]<ref>{{Barrington|49 & notes}}</ref> (located northeast of [[Durrës]]).

The name may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called Albanon and Arbanon, although it is not certain this was the same place.<ref>The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 279,"We cannot be certain that the Arbanon of Anna Comnena is the same as Albanopolis of the Albani, a place located on the map of Ptolemy (3.12)"</ref> In his ''History'' written in 1079–1080, the [[Byzantine]] historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was the first to refer to ''[[Albanoi]]'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the Duke of [[Dyrrachium]].<ref>Robert Elsei. ''The Albanian lexicon of Dion Von Kirkman. Earliest reference to the existence of the Albanian language'', pp. 113–122.</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], the Albanians called their country ''Arbër'' or ''Arbën'' and referred to themselves as [[Arbëresh]] or ''Arbnesh''.<ref>[http://www.pinocacozza.it/ Pinocacozza.it {{sq icon}}] {{it icon}}</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/ Radio-Arberesh.eu] {{it icon}}</ref>

As early as the 17th century the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëresh''. While the two terms are [[folk etymology|popularly]] interpreted as "Land of the Eagles" and "Children of the Eagles", they derive from the adverb ''shqip'', which means "understanding each other".<ref>Kristo Frasheri. ''History of Albania (A Brief Overview)''. Tirana, 1964.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mirror.undp.org/albania/download/pdf/albanian.pdf|title=The Albanian Language|last=Lloshi|first=Xhevat|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>
Under the [[Ottoman Empire]] Albania was referred to officially as ''Arnavutluk'' and its inhabitants as [[Arnauts]] (Turkic ''Arnavutlar''). These terms remain the same officially and in common usage in the current Republic of Turkey.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Arnaut Arnaut] at the Free Dictionary</ref> The word is considered to be a [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from the word [[Arvanite]], which was the Medieval Greek name for the [[Albanians]].<ref name="Akademia e Shkencave e RPSH.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Albania}}
The history of Albania emerged from the [[Prehistoric Balkans|prehistoric stage]] from the 4th century BC, with early records of [[Illyria]] in [[Greco-Roman historiography]]. The modern territory of Albania has no counterpart in antiquity, comprising parts of the Roman provinces of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] (southern [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]) and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] (particularly [[Epirus Nova]]).

The territory remained under Roman ([[Albania under the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) control until the [[Slavic migrations]] of the 7th century, and was integrated into the [[Albania under the Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 9th century. After the weakening of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Bulgarian Empire]] in the middle and late 13th century, most of the territory of modern-day Albania became part of Serbia. Initially, as a part of the [[Serbian Grand Principality]] and in 14th century as a part of the [[Serbian Empire]]. The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state formed in the Middle Ages, as the [[Principality of Arbër]] and the [[Kingdom of Albania]]. The [[Origins of the Albanians|first records]] of the [[Albanian people]] as a distinct ethnicity also date to this period.

=== Ottoman Period ===
{{Main|Ottoman Albania}}
[[File:Sanjak of Albania Map 1431.svg|thumb|The [[Sanjak of Albania]] in 1431]]

At the dawn of the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Southeast Europe, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1415 and established formal jurisdiction over most of Albania by 1431.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Licursi |first=Emiddio Pietro|title=Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in theLate Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/72122169/7/Pashko-Vasa|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |origyear=|year=2011 |month= |publisher= Columbia University |location= New York |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi_inactivedate= |bibcode= |id=|page=19 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= By 1415, after a chaotic interregnum, Sultan Mehmet I sent the military to erect the first Ottoman garrisons throughout southern Albania, establishing direct military authority in the region...l jurisdiction over most of Albania...|first2=,lastn=,authorn= |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Enjoying this privileged position in the empire, Muslim Albanians held various administrative positions, with over two dozen [[Grand Viziers]] of Albanian origin, such as Gen. [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]], who commanded the Ottoman forces during the [[Ottoman-Persian Wars]]; Gen. [[Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed]], who led the Ottoman army during the [[Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664)]]; and, later, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] of Egypt.<ref name="Arnawutluá¸³ - Brill Reference" >" Arnawutluḳ."

In the 15th century, when the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain (at end of the 15th century). [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Istanbul]]. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates in Europe.<ref name="Arnawutluá¸³ - Brill Reference"/>

Albanians could also be found throughout the empire, in [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]] and across the [[Maghreb]] as vital military and administrative retainers.<ref>H. T. Norris, Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World, p. 196.</ref> This was partly due to the [[Devşirme]] system. The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim). [[Timar]] holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in Southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is [[Skanderbeg]] (his figure would be used later in the 19th century as a central component of Albanian national identity). The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population, although such a process became widespread only in the 17th century.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline">Clayer, Nathalie. " Albania ." Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE. Edited by: Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.

Mainly [[Catholics]] converted in the 17th century, while the [[Orthodox Christian Church|Orthodox]] Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century. Initially confined to the main city centres of [[Elbasan]] and [[Shkoder]], by this period the countryside was also embracing the new religion.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline"/> The motives for conversion according to scholars were diverse, depending on the context. The lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.<ref>Clayer, Nathalie. " Albania ." Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE.

Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the [[Rumelia]] province until 1912, when the first [[Independent Albania|independent Albanian state]] was [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declared]]. The formation of an [[National Renaissance of Albania|Albanian national consciousness]] dates to the latter 19th century .

=== Era of Nationalism & League of Prizren ===
[[File:Principality of Albania.svg|thumb|Proposed boundaries of the Principality of Albania (1912-1914).]]
The first organization that opposed the [[partition of Albania]] and pushed for greater autonomy was the [[League of Prizren]], formed on 1 June 1878, in [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo]]. The League used military force to prevent the annexing of northern Albanian areas assigned to Montenegro and Serbia, and southern Albanian areas assigned to Greece by the [[Congress of Berlin]]. After several battles with Montenegrin troops, the league was forced to give up [[Ulcinj]] to Montenegro and then was defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the Sultan in order to prevent the league from achieving autonomy for Albania.<ref name="League of Prizren">{{cite web|title=Albanian League|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12553/Albanian-League|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>	
The uprisings of 1910–1912, the Ottoman defeat in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the advancing Montenegrin, Serbian and Greek armies into the territories where Albanians were majority, led to the proclamation of independence by [[Ismail Qemali]] in [[Vlora]], on 28 November 1912.

=== Independence ===
Albania's independence was recognized by the [[London Conference of 1912-1913|Conference of London]] on 29 July 1913, but the drawing of the borders of Albania ignored the demographic realities of the time.<ref name=EB>{{cite web|title=Albania:History|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/129453/History%7Cpublisher=Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%7Caccessdate=6%20January%202012|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> The short-lived [[Principality of Albania|monarchy]] (1914–1925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first [[Albanian Republic]] (1925–1928), to be replaced by another [[Albanian Kingdom|monarchy]] (1928–1939). Albania was occupied by [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Albanian Kingdom (1943-1944)|then]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II.

=== Communist Albania (1944–1992) ===
After the liberation of Albania from Nazi occupation, the country became a [[Communist state]], the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] (renamed "the People's Socialist Republic of Albania" in 1976), which was led by [[Enver Hoxha]] and the [[Party of Labour of Albania]].

The socialist reconstruction of Albania was launched immediately after the annulling of the monarchy and the establishment of a "[[People's Republic]]". In 1947, Albania's first railway line was completed, with the second completed eight months later. New land reform laws were passed granting the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it. Agriculture began to become [[Worker cooperative|cooperative]], and production increased significantly, leading to Albania becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. By 1955, illiteracy was eliminated among Albania's adult population.<ref>''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani</ref>
[[File:Tirana-opera-2001.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Culture of Tirana]], Albania whose first stone was symbolically laid by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]]]

During this period Albania became industrialized and saw rapid economic growth, as well as unprecedented progress in the areas of education and health. The average annual rate of increase of Albania's national income was 29% higher than the world average and 56% higher than the European average. Also during this period, because of the monopolized socialist economy, Albania was the only country in the world that did not impose any tax on its people.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pano|first=Aristotel|title=Panorama of the Economic-Social Development of Socialist Albania |url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/archive/panorama.htm|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>

Religious freedoms were severely curtailed during the Communist period, with many forms of worship being outlawed. In August 1945, the Agrarian Reform Law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups (mostly Islamic [[waqfs]]) were nationalized, along with the estates of monasteries and dioceses. Many believers, with the [[ulema]], and many [[priests]] were arrested, tortured and executed. In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that they and all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.<ref>Library of Congress Country Studies, Albania: Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign</ref>

In 1967 Hoxha proclaimed Albania the world's first '[[State atheism|atheist state]]'. Hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries&nbsp;— containing priceless manuscripts&nbsp;— were destroyed.<ref>Kombësia dhe feja në Shqipëri, 1920-1944 / Roberto Moroco dela Roka ; e përktheu nga origjinali Luan Omari.</ref> Churches were not spared either, and many were converted into cultural centers for young people. The new law banned all "fascist, religious, warmongerish, antisocialist activity and propaganda." Preaching religion carried a three- to ten-year prison sentence. Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice in secret.

Hoxha's political successor [[Ramiz Alia]] oversaw the dismemberment of the "[[Hoxhaist]]" state during the wider collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the later 1980s.

=== Contemporary Albania ===

The People's Republic was dissolved in 1991-92 after protests beginning in 1989 and reforms made by the communist government in 1990, and the Republic of Albania was founded. The Communists retained a stronghold in parliament after popular support in the elections of 1991. However, in March 1992, amid liberalisation policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new front led by the new [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]] took power. The economic crisis spread in late 1996 following the failure of some [[Ponzi scheme]]s operating in the country, peaking in 1997 in an [[1997 rebellion in Albania|armed rebellion]] that led to another [[Albanian diaspora|mass emigration of Albanians]], mostly to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]] and North America. In 1999, the country was affected by the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Kosovo War]], when a great number of Albanians from Kosovo found refuge in Albania. Albania became a full member of [[NATO]] in 2009, and has [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|applied]] to join the [[European Union]].

{{Politics of Albania}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}
The Albanian republic is a parliamentary democracy established under a constitution renewed in 1998. Elections are held every four years to a unicameral 140-seat chamber, the People's Assembly. In June 2002, a compromise candidate, [[Alfred Moisiu]], former [[Army General]], was elected to succeed President [[Rexhep Meidani]]. Parliamentary elections in July 2005 brought [[Sali Berisha]], the leader of the Democratic Party, while on 20 July 2007 Bamir Topi became president. The current Albanian president [[Bujar Nishani]] was elected by Parliament in July 2012.

The Euro-Atlantic integration of Albania has been the ultimate goal of the post-communist governments. Albania's EU membership bid has been set as a priority by the European Commission.

Albania, along with Croatia, joined NATO on 1 April 2009, becoming the 27th and 28th members of the alliance.<ref>{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7977332.stm | accessdate =2 April 2009 |work=BBC News |title=Nato welcomes Albania and Croatia | date=1 April 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090404233013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7977332.stm| archivedate= 4 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Executive branch ===
The head of state in Albania is the [[List of Presidents of Albania|President]] of the Republic. The President is elected to a 5-year term by the [[Assembly of Albania|Assembly of the Republic of Albania]] by secret ballot, requiring a 50%+1 majority of the votes of all deputies. The current President of the Republic is Bujar Nishani elected in July 2012.

The President has the power to guarantee observation of the constitution and all laws, act as commander in chief of the armed forces, exercise the duties of the Assembly of the Republic of Albania when the Assembly is not in session, and appoint the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (prime minister).

Executive power rests with the Council of Ministers (cabinet). The Chairman of the Council (prime minister) is appointed by the president; ministers are nominated by the president on the basis of the prime minister's recommendation. The People's Assembly must give final approval of the composition of the Council. The Council is responsible for carrying out both foreign and domestic policies. It directs and controls the activities of the ministries and other state organs.

=== Legislative branch ===
The [[Assembly of Albania|Assembly of the Republic of Albania]] (''Kuvendi i Republikës së Shqipërisë'') is the lawmaking body in Albania. There are 140 deputies in the Assembly, which are elected through a [[party-list proportional representation]] system. The President of the Assembly (or Speaker), who has two deputies, chairs the Assembly. There are 15 permanent commissions, or committees. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years.

The Assembly has the power to decide the direction of domestic and foreign policy; approve or amend the constitution; declare war on another state; ratify or annul international treaties; elect the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General and his or her deputies; and control the activity of state radio and television, state news agency and other official information media.

=== Armed forces ===
{{Main|Military of Albania}}
[[File:Patrol Boat Iliria.jpg|thumb|Patrol boat ''Iliria'' of the [[Albanian Navy]].]]

The [[Military of Albania|Albanian Armed Forces]] (''Forcat e Armatosura të Shqipërisë'') were first formed after independence in 1912. Albania reduced the number of active troops from 65,000 in 1988<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1935630.stm |work=BBC News |title=Albania sells off its military hardware | date=17 April 2002}}</ref> to 14,500 in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/08/21/feature-03 |title=Albania to abolish conscription by 2010 |publisher=SETimes.com |date=21 August 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref> and the military now consists mainly of a small fleet of aircraft and sea vessels. In the 1990s, the country scrapped enormous amounts of obsolete hardware, such as tanks and [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM systems]] from China.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Today it consists of: the [[Albanian General Staff|General Staff]], the [[Albanian Land Force]], the [[Albanian Air Force]] and the [[Albanian Naval Force]]. Increasing the military budget was one of the most important conditions for [[NATO]] integration. Military spending has generally been lower than 1.5% since 1996 only to peak in 2009 at 2% and fall again to 1.5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Albanian military expenditure as % of GDP|url=http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=ms_mil_xpnd_gd_zs&idim=country:ALB&dl=en&hl=en&q=military+expenditure+of+albania#!ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=ms_mil_xpnd_gd_zs&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=region&idim=country:ALB&ifdim=region&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false|publisher=World Bank}}</ref> Since February 2008, Albania participates officially in NATO's [[Operation Active Endeavor]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>[http://www.nato.int/issues/active_endeavour/index.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> It received a NATO membership invitation on 3 April 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Albania membership Nato|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/issues/nato_albania/evolution.html}}</ref> Albania became a full member of NATO on 2 April 2009.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Albania}}
{{Infobox Administration in Albania}}

Albania is divided into 12 administrative counties ({{lang-sq|qark or prefekturë}}). These counties include 36 districts ({{lang-sq|rreth}}) and 373 municipalities ({{lang-sq|bashki or komunë}}). 72 municipalities have city status ({{lang-sq|qytet}}). There are overall 2980 villages/communities ({{lang-sq|fshat}}) in all Albania. Each district has its council which is composed of a number of municipalities. The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |title=On the Organization and Functioning of the Local Government, Republic of Albania, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sskA8M0G |archivedate = 20 September 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Albania}}
[[File:Albania space.jpg|thumb|A satellite image of Albania.]]

Albania has a total area of {{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=off}}. It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[19th meridian east|19°]] and [[21st meridian east|21° E]] (a small area lies east of 21°). Albania's coastline length is {{convert|611|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="Albania pdf">{{cite web| author=R. Eftimi|url=http://aguas.igme.es/igme/publica/tiac-02/ALBANIA-I.pdf|title=SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON SEAWATER-FRESHWATER RELATIONSHIP IN ALBANIAN COASTAL AREA|publisher=ITA Consult}}</ref>{{rp|240}} and extends along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s. The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea.

The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside. The highest mountain is [[Mount Korab|Korab]] situated in the [[district of Dibër]], reaching up to {{convert|2764|m|ft}}. The climate on the coast is typically [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] with mild, wet winters and warm, sunny, and rather dry summers.

Inland conditions vary depending on elevation, but the higher areas above 1,500&nbsp;m/5,000&nbsp;ft are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with snow may linger into spring. Besides the capital city of [[Tirana]], which has 420,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durrës]], [[Korçë]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkodër]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Kukës]]. In Albanian grammar, a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: both ''Tiranë'' and ''Tirana'', ''Shkodër'' and ''Shkodra'' are used.

The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] are partly located in Albania. [[Lake Shkodër]] in the country's northwest has a surface which can vary between {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and 530&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, out of which one third belongs to Albania and rest to Montenegro. The Albanian shoreline of the lake is {{convert|57|km|0|abbr=on}}. [[Ohrid Lake]] is situated in the country's southeast and is shared between Albania and Republic of Macedonia. It has a maximal depth of 289&nbsp;meters and a variety of unique flora and fauna can be found there, including "living fossils" and many endemic species. Because of its natural and historical value, Ohrid Lake is under the protection of [[UNESCO]]. There is also Butrinti Lake which is a small tectonic lake. It is located in the national park of Butrint.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Albanian Riviera.jpg|thumb|Albanian Riviera in Borsh]]
With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions relative to its landmass. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean weather; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.

The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Summer temperatures average {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.

Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the [[Balkan]]s. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and [[river valley]]s are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.

Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.

When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.

Lowland rainfall averages from {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.
[[File:Albania pasture.jpg|thumb|Landscape of Albanian countryside]]

Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and are as high as {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in some northern areas. The western Albanian Alps (valley of Boga) are among the wettest areas in Europe, receiving some {{convert|3100|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qendrim.forumotion.net/gjeografia-f61/tiparet-e-pergjithshme-te-klimes-t3725.htm |title=Tiparet e pergjithshme te klimes |publisher=Qendrim.forumotion.net |date=2009-12-20 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.

The higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the intermediate uplands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area.

In 2009 an expedition from University of Colorado discovered four small glaciers in the 'Cursed' mountains in North Albania. The glaciers are at the relatively low level of 2,000&nbsp;meters&nbsp;– almost unique for such a southerly latitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://instaar.metapress.com/content/273213h3t4370272/ |title=Twenty-first Century Glaciers and Climate in the Prokletije Mountains, Albania Journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research Publisher Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado ISSN 1523-0430 (Print) 1938–4246 (Online) Issue Volume 41, Number 4 / November 2009 DOI 10.1657/1938-4246-41.4.455 Pages 455–459 Online Date: 30 November 2009|publisher=Instaar.metapress.com |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2010}} {{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

Although a small country, Albania is distinguished for its rich biological diversity. The variation of geomorphology, climate and terrain create favorable conditions for a number of endemic and [[sub-endemic]] species with 27 endemic and 160 subendemic vascular plants present in the country. The total number of plants is over 3250 species, approximately 30% of the entire flora species found in Europe.

Over a third of the territory of Albania&nbsp;– about {{convert|10000|km2|0|abbr=off}};– is forested and the country is very rich in flora. About 3,000 different species of plants grow in Albania, many of which are used for medicinal purposes.[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Albania belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Adriatic and [[East Mediterranean]]provinces of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. Coastal regions and lowlands have typical Mediterranean [[macchia]] vegetation, whereas [[oak]] forests and vegetation are found on higher elevations. Vast forests of [[European Black Pine|black pine]], [[beech]] and [[fir]] are found on higher mountains and alpine [[grasslands]] grow at elevations above 1800&nbsp;meters.<ref name="cbd.int">http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/al/al-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf</ref>

According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Albania can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric Alpine]] mixed forests. The forests are home to a wide range of mammals, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[wild boar]]s and [[chamois]]. [[Lynx]], [[wildcat]]s, [[pine marten]]s and [[European Polecat|polecats]] are rare, but survive in some parts of the country.

There are around 760 vertebrate species found so far in Albania. Among these there are over 350 bird species, 330 freshwater and marine fish and 80 mammal species. There are some 91 globally threatened species found within the country, among which the [[Dalmatian pelican]], [[Pygmy cormorant]], and the [[European sea sturgeon]]. Rocky coastal regions in the south provide good habitats for the endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]].

Some of the most significant bird species found in the country include the [[golden eagle]]&nbsp;– known as the national symbol of Albania<ref name="Streissguth"/> &nbsp;– [[vulture]] species, [[capercaillie]] and numerous [[waterfowl]]. The Albanian forests still maintain significant communities of large mammals such as the [[brown bear]], [[gray wolf]], [[chamois]] and [[wild boar]].<ref name="cbd.int"/> The north and eastern mountains of the country are home to the last remaining [[Balkan Lynx]]&nbsp;– a critically endangered population of the [[Eurasian lynx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catsg.org/balkanlynx/20_blx-compendium/index.htm |title=The Balkan Lynx Conservation Compendium|publisher=Catsg.org |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref>

Albania's troubled transition from communist to free-market [[capitalism]] has been largely successful. There are signs of increasing investments, and power cuts are reduced to the extent that Albania is now exporting energy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8406675.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Albania's strides to EU accession |date=11 December 2009}}</ref> Its [[GDP per capita]] (expressed in PPS—[[Purchasing power parity|Purchasing Power Standards]]) stood at 35 percent of the EU average in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-13122011-BP/EN/2-13122011-BP-EN.PDF|format=PDF|title=Albania's GDP per capita in PPS (2008) |publisher=Eurostat |accessdate=13 December 2011}}</ref> Still, Albania has shown potential for economic growth, as more and more businesses relocate there and consumer goods are becoming available from emerging market traders as part of the current massive global cost-cutting exercise.

[[Tourism in Albania|Tourism]] is gaining a fair share of Albania's GDP with visitors growing every year.

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Albania}}
[[File:Pics (23).jpg|thumb|left|[[Porto Palermo Castle]] south of Himara]]
[[File:Butrint, Albania.jpg|thumb|Ancient Amphitheater of [[Butrint]]]]
[[File:Ag.Saranta.jpg|thumb|Seaside town of [[Saranda]] across from [[Corfu]]]]
An important percentage of Albania's national income comes from tourism. Tourism - as of 2013 - funds 10% of the gross domestical product, and this number is expected to increase dramatically within the next decade. Albania welcomed around 4,2 million visitors in 2012, mostly from neighbouring countries and the European Union. In 2011 Albania was listed as the top travel destination worldwide, by [[Lonely Planet|lonely planet]].<ref name="Lonely Planet's top 10"/>

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic and the Ionian Sea coast. The latter has the most beautiful and pristine beaches, and is often called  the [[Albanian Riviera]]. The increase in foreign visitors is dramatic, Albania had only 500,000 visitors in 2005, while in 2012 had an estimated 4.2 million tourists. An increase of 840% in only 7 years.

Most of the international tourists going to Albania are from [[Kosovo]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], Greece, and Italy.<ref>http://www.mtkrs.gov.al/web/Treguesit_statistikore_te_turizmit_30_1.php</ref> Foreign tourists mostly come from Eastern Europe, particularly from [[Poland]], and the [[Czech Republic]], but also from Western European countries such as [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], Scandinavia, and others.<ref>[http://lajme.shqiperia.com/lajme/artikull/iden/1046860598/titulli/Turizmi-ne-Shqiperi-reklama-per-Evropen-Lindore Turizmi ne Shqiperi: Reklama per Evropen Lindore], Shqiperia.com</ref>

== Crime and Law Enforcement ==
Law Enforcement in Albania is primarily the responsibility of the [[Albanian Police]]. Albania also has a counter-terrorism unit called [[RENEA]]. On a list of 75 countries, Albania listed at 17th lowest crime rate ahead of many western nations such as Denmark, the [[Crime statistics in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], Sweden and France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp |title=Crime Index by Country 2013 |publisher=Numbeo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> However, homicide is still a problem in the country, especially blood feuds in rural areas of the north and domestic crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gendercide.org/case_honour.html |title=Gendercide Watch: "Honour" Killings and Blood Feuds |publisher=Gendercide.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

== Science and technology ==
{{Main|Science and technology in Albania}}

From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased. Various surveys show that during 1991–2005, approximately 50% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.<ref name="dfid">[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutputID=177440 Research for Development] Highly Skilled Migration from Albania</ref>

However in 2009 the government approved the "National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsdc.gov.al/dsdc/pub/national_strategy_of_science_technology_and_innovation_final_draft_381_1.pdf |title=Strategy of Science, Technology and Innovation 2009–2015 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> covering the period 2009–2015. It aims to triple public spending on research and development (R&D) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&D from foreign sources, including via the [[European Union]]'s Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others.

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Albania}}

=== Highways ===
[[File:Autostrada Durrës-Morina-04.jpg|thumb|The A1 highway in Albania]]
Currently there are three main motorways in Albania: the dual carriageway connecting Durrës with [[Vlorë]], the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]], and the [[Tirana–Elbasan Highway]].

The [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]] links [[Kosovo]] to Albania's Adriatic coast: the Albanian side was completed in June 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wynne |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/transport/albania-motorway-making-the-first-move/5203302.article# |title=Albania highway: Making the first move |publisher=Nce.co.uk |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref> and now it takes only two hours and a half to go from the Kosovo border to [[Durrës]]. Overall the highway will be around {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} when it reaches [[Pristina]]. The project was the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken in Albania. The cost of the highway appears to have breached €800&nbsp;million, although the exact cost for the total highway has yet to be confirmed by the government.

Two additional highways will be built in Albania in the near future: [[Pan-European corridors|Corridor VIII]], which will link Albania with the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and the north-south highway, which corresponds to the Albanian side of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]], a larger regional highway connecting [[Croatia]] with Greece along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] coasts. When all three corridors are completed Albania will have an estimated 759&nbsp;kilometers of highway linking it with all its neighboring countries: Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Greece.

=== Aviation ===
[[File:Terminal jashte.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]]]]

The civil air transport in Albania marked its beginnings in November 1924, when the Republic of Albania signed a governmental agreement with German air company [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]]. On the basis of a ten-year concession agreement, the Albanian Airlines Company [[Adria Aero Lloyd]] was established.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In the spring of 1925, the first domestic flights from [[Tirana]] to [[Shkodër]] and [[Vlorë]] began.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In August 1927, the office of Civil Aviation of Air Traffic Ministry of Italy purchased Adria Aero Lloyd. The company, now in Italian hands, expanded its flights to other cities, such as [[Elbasan]], [[Korçë]], [[Kukës]], [[Peshkopi]] and [[Gjirokastër]], and opened up international lines to Rome, [[Milan]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Sofia]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Podgorica]].

The construction of a more modern airport in [[Laprakë]] started in 1934 and was completed by the end of 1935. This new airport, which was later officially named "Airport of Tirana", was constructed in conformity with optimal technological parameters of that time, with a reinforced concrete runway of {{convert|2700|m|0|abbr=on}}, and complemented with technical equipment and appropriate buildings.

During 1955–1957, the [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza|Rinasi Airport]] was constructed for military purposes. Later, its administration was shifted to the Ministry of Transport. On 25 January 1957 the State-owned Enterprise of International Air Transport ([[Transport in Albania|Albtransport]]) established its headquarters in Tirana. [[Aeroflot]], [[Jat Airways]], [[Malév]], [[TAROM]] and [[Interflug]] were the air companies that started to have flights with Albania until 1960.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website">{{cite web |url=http://www.tirana-airport.com/?RoseToken=169180229114147161160144183148154169229193083155156151160214184090168180231crc339 | title=History of the Airport | accessdate=15 January 2011 | publisher=Tirana International Airport Website}}</ref>

During 1960–1978, several airlines ceased to operate in Albania due to the impact of the politics, resulting in a decrease of influx of flights and passengers. In 1977 Albania's government signed an agreement with Greece to open the country's first air links with non-communist Europe. As a result, [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic Airways]] was the first non-communist airline to commercially fly into Albania after World War II. By 1991 Albania had air links with many major European cities, including Paris, Rome, [[Zürich]], Vienna and [[Budapest]], but no regular domestic air service.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website"/>

A French-Albanian joint venture [[Ada Air]], was launched in Albania as the first private airline, in 1991. The company offered flights in a thirty-six-passenger airplane four days a week between Tirana and [[Bari]], Italy and a charter service for domestic and international destinations.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website"/>

From 1989 to 1991, because of political changes in the Eastern European countries, Albania adhered to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), opened its air space to international flights, and had its duties of Air Traffic Control defined. As a result of these developments, conditions were created to separate the activities of air traffic control from Albtransport. Instead, the [[National Agency of Air Traffic]] (NATA) was established as an independent enterprise. In addition, during these years, governmental agreements of civil air transport were established with countries such as [[Bulgaria]], Germany, [[Slovenia]], Italy, Russia, Austria, the UK and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

[[File:Albanian railway.jpg|thumb|[[Durrës Rail Station]], the main railway station in Albania.]]
The Directory General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was established on 3 February 1991, to cope with the development required by the time. Albania has one [[international airport]], [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]], which is linked to 29 destinations by 14 airlines. It has seen a dramatic rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the early 1990s. The data for 2009 is 1.3&nbsp;million passengers served and an average of 44 landings and takeoffs per day.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== Railways ===
{{Main|Rail transport in Albania|Hekurudha Shqiptare}}

The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company ''[[Hekurudha Shqiptare]]'' (HSH) (which means ''Albanian Railways''). It operates a {{RailGauge|1435}} gauge (standard gauge) rail system in Albania. All trains are hauled by [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-built [[ČKD]] [[diesel-electric locomotive]]s.

The railway system was extensively promoted by the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime of [[Enver Hoxha]], during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and [[bus]] usage. Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

External migration was prohibited in Communist Albania while internal one was quite limited, hence this was a new phenomenon.

Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. "Although official statistics have suggested that Albania is one of the most homogenous countries in the region (with an over 97 per cent Albanian majority) minority groups (such as Greeks, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Roma and Vlachs/Aromanians) have often questioned the official data, claiming a larger share in the country’s population."<ref name="EUDO"/> The last census that contained ethnographic data (before the 2011 one) was conducted in 1989.<ref name="barjaba">{{cite web|url=http://www.watsoninstitute.org/bjwa/archive/11.1/Essays/Barjarba.pdf|author=Kosta Barjarba|title=Migration and Ethnicity in Albania: Synergies and Interdependencies|format=PDF}}</ref>

According to the 2011 census the population of Albania declared the following ethnic affiliation: [[Albanians]] 2,312,356 (82.6% of the total), [[Greeks in Albania|Greeks]] 24,243 (0.9%), [[Macedonians of Albania|Macedonians]] 5,512 (0.2%), [[Montenegrins of Albania|Montenegrins]] 366 (0.01%), [[Aromanians]] 8,266 (0.30%), [[Romani people|Romani]] 8,301 (0.3%), [[Balkan Egyptians]] 3,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities 2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant 44,144 (1.6%).<ref name="Population and Housing Census 2011"/>

Macedonian and some Greek minority groups have sharply criticized Article 20 of the Census law, according to which a $1,000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate.

=== Language ===
{{main|Languages of Albania}}
[[Albanian language|Albanian]] is the official language of Albania. Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, [[Gheg]] and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]]; though, it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect.

According to 2011 census, 58.79% of Albania adheres to [[Islam]], making it the largest [[religion]] in the country. The majority of Albanian Muslims are secular Sunni with a significant [[Bektashi]] Shia minority. [[Christianity]] is practiced by 16.99% of the population, making it the second largest religion in the country. The remaining population is either [[irreligious]] or belongs to other religious groups.<ref>http://www.instat.gov.al/media/177358/njoftim_per_media_-_fjala_e_drejtorit_te_instat_ines_nurja_per_rezultatet_finale_te_census_2011.pdf</ref> Before World War II, 70% of the population were Muslims, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholics.<ref name="cia"/> Today religion plays a role in the lives of only 39% of Albanians, and Albania had been ranked the thirteenth least religious country in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128210/Gallup-Global-Reports.aspx |title=Gallup Global Reports |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref>

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late-11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. [[Islam]] later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1940s and 1950s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[anti-religious|banned religion]] to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch) are found throughout the country whereas [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country.<ref name="International Religious Freedom Report 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov|date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100828091818/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm| archivedate= 28 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>

The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] sent its first missionaries into Albanian territory as early as 1909. Following decades of communist repression, the Albanian Mission of Seventh-day Adventists was re-established in Tirana in 1992 and has now over 10 churches and groups throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ted-adventist.org/countries/europe/albania |title=Albania |publisher=TED Adventist |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}</ref> Its humanitarian wing, the [[Adventist Development and Relief Agency]] (ADRA) is renowned for being the first humanitarian organization to enter post-communist Albania.<ref>{{cite web|title=Famous British celebrity visits ADRA Albania|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/albania/famous-british-celebrity-visits-adra-albania}}</ref>

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS or 'Mormons') involvement in Albania began with humanitarian aid during the 1990s. The first missionaries were sent in 1992 with the Albania Tirana Mission being opened in 1996. In 2008, there were nearly 2,000 members of the LDS church in Albania, spread throughout ten branches with two purpose-built chapels and one Family History Center.<ref>{{cite web|title=LDS Newsroom-Country Profile-Albania|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/albania|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref>

{{Main|Music of Albania}}
Albanian folk music falls into three stylistic groups, with other important [[music area]]s around [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]; the major groupings are the [[Gheg]]s of the north and southern Labs and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosks]]. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the "rugged and heroic" tone of the north and the "relaxed" form of the south.

These disparate styles are unified by "the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]]", as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.<ref>Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Kombëtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjetër Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''</ref> The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by [[Pjetër Dungu]] in 1940.

Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic [[lullaby|lullabies]], love songs, [[wedding music]], [[work song]]s and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate St. Lazarus Day, which inaugurates the springtime. Lullabies and [[vajtim]]s are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.<ref name="koco">{{cite web|title=Albanian Music|work=Eno Koco at the University of Leeds|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/|accessdate=28 August 2005| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050828104120/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/| archivedate= 28 August 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Albanian language and literature ===
[[File:Ismail Kadare.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ismail Kadare]] at a reading, 2007]]
{{Main|Albanian language|Albanian literature|List of Albanian writers}}

Albanian was proved to be an [[Indo-European language]] in 1854 by the German [[Comparative linguistics|philologist]] [[Franz Bopp]]. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family.

Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]<ref>Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis, 1997 ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5, ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5 (''"Although there are some lexical items that appear to be shared between Romanian (and by extension Dacian) and Albanian, by far the strongest connections can be argued between Albanian and Illyrian."'' page 11)
Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World By Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Contributor Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Edition: illustrated Published by Elsevier, 2008 ISBN 978-0-08-087774-7, ISBN 978-0-08-087774-7 (''"Albanian constitutes a single branch of the Indo-European family of languages. It is often held to be related to Illyrian, a poorly attested language spoken in the Western Balkans in classical times"'' page 22)</ref> while others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=txh|title=The Thracian language|publisher=The Linguist List|accessdate=27 January 2008|quote=An ancient language of Southern Balkans, belonging to the Satem group of Indo-European. This language is the most likely ancestor of modern Albanian (which is also a Satem language), though the evidence is scanty. 1st Millennium BC&nbsp;– 500&nbsp;AD.| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080203035926/http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=txh| archivedate= 3 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> claim that it derives from [[Dacian language|Daco]]-[[Thracian language|Thracian]]. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)

Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of [[isogloss]]es with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long ''o'' has fallen to ''a'', much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative ''jos'' and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives.

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language what [[Martin Luther|Luther]] did for German.

[[File:Meshari.jpg|thumb|left|Excerpt from ''[[Meshari]]'' by [[Gjon Buzuku]]]]

''[[Meshari]]'' (The Missal) by [[Gjon Buzuku]], published in 1555, is considered the first literary work of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

The earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durrës]], [[Pal Engjëlli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.
[[File:Tirana Museum 1988.jpg|thumb|right|The [[National Historical Museum (Albania)|National Museum of Albania]] features exhibits from [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] times to the fall of Communism in the 1990s.]]

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who, in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|''Rrethimi i Shkodrës'' (The Siege of Shkodër)]] (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'').

During the 16th to 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] ''E mbësuame krishterë'' (Christian Teachings) (1592) by [[Lekë Matrënga]], ''Doktrina e krishterë'' (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and ''Rituale romanum'' (1621) by [[Pjetër Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer is probably [[Ismail Kadare]].

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Albania}}

Before the establishment of the [[People's Republic]], Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Party]] gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population.<ref>Zickel, Iwaskiw, 1994</ref>

Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male [[literacy rate]] is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.<ref name="cia"/> With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The [[University of Tirana]] is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

== Sport ==
[[File:QemalStafaStadiumTirana.JPG|thumb|right|Qemal Stafa Stadium in Tirana]]
[[Association Football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Albania, both at a participatory and spectator level. The sport is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ({{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}, F.SH.F.), created in 1930, member of [[FIFA]] and a founding member of [[UEFA]]. Other sports played include basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, [[rugby union]], and gymnastics.

Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded by [[King Zog]] in 1938. RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH ''Televizioni Shqiptar'', four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name ''Radio Tirana''. In addition, 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via [[medium wave]] (AM) and [[short wave]] (SW).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picasaweb.google.es/ec2adn/RadioTiranaBroadcastingSchedules/photo#5187887711939456834 |title=Radio Tirana's Broadcasting Schedule as of 2007&nbsp;– RadioTirana.org |publisher=Picasaweb.google.es |date=2008-10-25 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The international service has used the theme from the song "Keputa një gjethe dafine" as its [[signature tune]]. The international television service [[satellite|via satellite]] was launched since 1993 and aims at [[Albanian language|Albanian]] communities in [[Kosovo]], Serbia, [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], Montenegro and northern [[Greece]], plus the Albanian [[diaspora]] in the rest of Europe. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing.

According to the Albanian Media Authority, AMA, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.
Last years Albania has organized several shows as a part of worldwide series like [[Dancing with the Stars]], [[Big Brother Albania]], [[Albanians Got Talent]], [[The Voice of Albania]], and [[X-Factor Albania]].

The Faculty of Medicine of the [[University of Tirana]] is the main medical school in the country. There are also nursing schools in other cities. [[Newsweek]] ranked Albania 57 out of 100 Best Countries in the World in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/the-world-s-best-countries.html |title=The World's Best Countries |work=Newsweek |date=16 August 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5s2FdnYG4 | archivedate = 16 August 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

The general improvement of health conditions in the country is reflected in the lower mortality rate, down to an estimated 6.49 deaths per 1,000 in 2000, as compared with 17.8 per 1,000 in 1938. In 2000, average life expectancy was estimated at 74 years, compared to 38 years at the end of World War II. Albania's infant mortality rate, estimated at 20 per 1,000 live births in 2000, has also declined over the years since the high rate of 151 per 1,000 live births in 1960. There were 69,802 births in 1999 and the fertility rate in 1999 was 2.5 while the maternal mortality rate was 65 per 100,000 live births in 1993. In addition, in 1997, Albania had high immunization rates for children up to one year old: tuberculosis at 94%; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 99%; measles, 95%; and polio, 99.5%. In 1996, the incidence of tuberculosis was 23 in 100,000 people. In 1995 there were two reported cases of AIDS and seven cases in 1996. In 2000 the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at less than 100. The leading causes of death are cardiovascular disease, trauma, cancer, and respiratory disease.

== Cuisine ==
{{Main|Albanian cuisine}}

The cuisine of Albania&nbsp;– as with most [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations&nbsp;– is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by Greece, Serbia, Italy and the [[Ottoman Turk]]s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine. The main meal of [[Albanians]] is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a [[salad]] of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, green [[bell pepper|peppers]] and [[olive]]s with [[olive oil]], [[vinegar]] and salt. It also includes a main dish of vegetables and meat. Seafood specialties are also common in the coastal cities of [[Durrës]], [[Sarandë]] and [[Vlorë]]. In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common.
