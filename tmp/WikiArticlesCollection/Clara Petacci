On 27 April 1945, Mussolini and Petacci were captured by [[Italian resistance movement|Communist partisans]] while traveling with a convoy of [[Italian Social Republic]] members.  On 28 April, she and Mussolini were taken to [[Mezzegra]] and shot.  On the following day, 29 April, Mussolini's and Petacci's bodies were taken to the [[Piazzale Loreto]] in [[Milan]] and hung upside down in front of a petrol station.  The bodies were photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cidc.library.cornell.edu/dof/italy/captioned/hanging.htm |title=Death of the Father-Mussolini & Fascist Italy: the 'infamous' exhibit |publisher=[[Cornell Institute for Digital Collections]] |year=1999}}</ref>
