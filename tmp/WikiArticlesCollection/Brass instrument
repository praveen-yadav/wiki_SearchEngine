A '''brass instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] that produces sound by [[Sympathetic resonance|sympathetic vibration]] of air in a tubular [[resonator]] in sympathy with the vibration of the player's lips. Brass instruments are also called ''labrosones'', literally meaning "lip-vibrated instruments".<ref>{{cite book

There are several factors involved in producing different [[Pitch of brass instruments|pitches on a brass instrument]]. Slides, [[valve]]s, crooks, or keys are used to change vibratory length of tubing, thus changing the available [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]], while the player's [[embouchure]], lip tension and air flow serve to select the specific harmonic produced from the available series.

The view of most scholars (see [[organology]]) is that the term "brass instrument" should be defined by the way the sound is made, as above, and not by whether the instrument is actually made of [[brass]]. Thus one finds brass instruments made of wood, like the [[alphorn]], the [[cornett]], the [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[didgeridoo]], while some [[woodwind instrument]]s are made of brass, like the [[saxophone]].

== Families ==
Modern brass instruments generally come in one of two families:
* '''Valved''' brass instruments use a set of valves (typically three or four but as many as seven or more in some cases) operated by the player's fingers that introduce additional tubing, or [[Crook (music)|crooks]], into the instrument, changing its overall length. This family includes all of the modern brass instruments except the [[trombone]]: the [[trumpet]], [[horn (instrument)|horn]] (also called French horn), [[euphonium]], and [[tuba]], as well as the [[cornet]], [[flügelhorn]], [[tenor horn|tenor horn (alto horn)]], [[baritone horn]], [[sousaphone]], [[mellophone]], and the [[saxhorn]]. As valved instruments are predominant among the brasses today, a more thorough discussion of their workings can be found below. The valves are usually [[piston valve]]s, but can be [[rotary valve]]s; the latter are the norm for the horn and are also prevalent on the tuba.
* '''Slide''' brass instruments use a slide to change the length of tubing. The main instruments in this category are the [[trombone]] family, though valve trombones are occasionally used, especially in [[jazz]]. The trombone family's ancestor, the [[sackbut]], and the folk instrument [[Bazooka (instrument)|bazooka]] are also in the slide family.

There are two other families that have, in general, become functionally obsolete for practical purposes. Instruments of both types, however, are sometimes used for [[historically informed performance|period-instrument performances]] of Baroque or Classical pieces. In more modern compositions, they are occasionally used for their intonation or tone color.
* '''Natural''' brass instruments only play notes in the instrument's [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. These include the [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] and older variants of the [[trumpet]] and [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]. The [[natural trumpet|trumpet was a natural brass instrument]] prior to about 1795, and the [[natural horn|horn before about 1820]]. In the 18th century, makers developed interchangeable [[Crook (music)|crooks]] of different lengths, which let players use a single instrument in more than one key. Natural instruments are still played for period performances and some ceremonial functions, and are occasionally found in more modern scores, such as those by [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]].
* '''Keyed or Fingered''' brass instruments used holes along the body of the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a [[woodwind instrument]]. These included the [[cornett]], [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], [[ophicleide]], [[keyed bugle]] and [[keyed trumpet]]. They are more difficult to play than valved instruments.

=== Bore taper and diameter ===
Brass instruments may also be characterised by two generalizations about geometry of the [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], that is, the tubing between the mouthpiece and the flaring of the tubing into the [[Bell (wind)#Parts|bell]]. Those two generalizations are with regard to
* the degree of taper or conicity of the bore and
* the diameter of the bore with respect to its length.

==== Cylindricality vs. conicality ====
While all modern valved and slide brass instruments consist in part of conical and in part of cylindrical tubing, they are divided as follows:
* '''Cylindrical bore''' brass instruments are those in which approximately constant diameter tubing predominates. Cylindrical bore brass instruments are generally perceived as having a brighter, more penetrating tone quality compared to conical bore brass instruments. The [[trumpet]], [[baritone horn]] and all [[trombone]]s are cylindrical bore. In particular, the slide design of the trombone necessitates this.
* '''Conical bore''' brass instruments are those in which tubing of constantly increasing diameter predominates. Conical bore instruments are generally perceived as having a more mellow tone quality than the cylindrical bore brass instruments. The "[[Brass band (British style)|British brass band]]" group of instruments fall into this category. This includes the [[flugelhorn]], [[cornet]], [[alto horn|tenor horn (alto horn)]], [[horn (instrument)|horn]], [[euphonium]] and [[tuba]]. Some conical bore brass instruments are more conical than others. For example, the flugelhorn differs from the cornet by having a higher percentage of its tubing length conical than does the cornet, in addition to possessing a wider bore than the cornet. In the 1910s and 1920s, the [[E.A. Couturier]] company built brass band instruments utilizing a patent for a continuous conical bore without cylindrical portions even for the valves or tuning slide.

==== Whole-tube vs. half-tube ====
The second division, based on bore diameter in relation to length,<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Bombardon 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article on the Bombardon]</ref> determines whether the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental tone]] or the first [[overtone]] is the lowest [[Harmonic series (music)#Harmonic vs. partial|partial]] practically available to the player:
{{rquote|right|Neither the horns nor the trumpet could produce the 1st note of the harmonic series ... A horn giving the C of an open 8&nbsp;ft organ pipe had to be {{convert|16|ft|0|abbr=on}}. long. Half its length was practically useless ... it was found that if the calibre of tube was sufficiently enlarged in proportion to its length, the instrument could be relied upon to give its fundamental note in all normal circumstances. – Cecil Forsyth, ''Orchestration'', p. 86<ref name="Forsyth_Orchestration">[http://books.google.com/books/download/ORCHESTRATION.pdf?id=m9_CTe8qNWIC&output=pdf ''Orchestration''], Forsyth, Cecil; MacMillan Books, 1922.</ref>}}
* '''Whole-tube''' instruments have larger bores in relation to tubing length, and can play the fundamental tone with ease and precision. The [[tuba]] and [[euphonium]] are examples of whole-tube brass instruments.
* '''Half-tube''' instruments have smaller bores in relation to tubing length and cannot easily or accurately play the fundamental tone. The second partial (first overtone) is the lowest note of each tubing length practical to play on half-tube instruments. The [[trumpet]] and [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] are examples of half-tube brass instruments.

=== Other brass instruments ===
The instruments in this list fall for various reasons outside the scope of much of the discussion above regarding families of brass instruments.
* [[Alphorn]] (wood)
* [[Conch]] ([[animal shell|shell]])
* [[Didgeridoo]] ([[wood]], [[Australia]])
* [[Natural horn]] (no valves or slides—except tuning crook)
* [[Keyed bugle]] (keyed brass)
* [[Keyed trumpet]] (keyed brass)
* [[Serpent (instrument)|Serpent]] (keyed brass)
* [[Ophicleide]] (keyed brass)
* [[Shofar]] ([[horn (anatomy)|animal horn]])
* [[Vladimirskiy rozhok]] (wood, [[Russia]])
* [[Vuvuzela]] (simple short horn, origins disputed but achieved fame or notoriety through many [[plastic]] examples in the [[2010 World Cup]])
* [[Lur]]

Valves are used to change the length of tubing of a brass instrument allowing the player to reach the notes of various harmonic series. Each valve pressed diverts the air stream through additional tubing, individually or in conjunction with other valves. This lengthens the vibrating air column thus lowering the fundamental tone and associated harmonic series produced by the instrument. Designs exist, although rare, in which this behaviour is reversed, i.e., pressing a valve removes a length of tubing rather than adding one.  One modern example of such an ascending valve is the Yamaha YSL-350C trombone,<ref name="YSL-350C"/> in which the extra valve tubing is normally engaged to pitch the instrument in Bb, and pressing the thumb lever removes a whole step to pitch the instrument in C.  Valves require regular [[Valve oil|lubrication]].

A core standard valve layout based on the action of three valves had become almost universal by (at latest) 1864 as witnessed by [[Arban method|Arban's Method]] published in that year. The effect of a particular combination of valves may be seen in the table below. This table is correct for the core 3-valve layout on almost any modern valved brass instrument. The most common four-valve layout is a superset of the well-established 3-valve layout and is noted in the table, despite the exposition of four-valve and also five-valve systems (the latter used on the [[tuba]]) being incomplete in this article.

: * Note that since valves ''lower'' the pitch, a valve that makes a pitch too low (flat) creates an interval wider than desired, while a valve that plays sharp creates an interval narrower than desired. [[Intonation (music)|Intonation]] deficiencies of brass instruments that are independent of the tuning or temperament system are inherent in the physics of the most popular valve design, which uses a small number of valves in combination to avoid redundant and heavy lengths of tubing<ref>[http://music.ou.edu/applied/horn/intonation.html Understanding Brass Instrument Intonation], University of Oklahoma Horn Studio</ref> (this is entirely separate from the slight deficiencies between [[Classical music|Western music's]] dominant [[Equal temperament|equal (even) temperament system]] and the [[Just intonation|just (not equal) temperament]] of the harmonic series itself). Since each lengthening of the tubing has an inversely proportional effect on pitch ([[Pitch of brass instruments]]), while pitch perception is logarithmic, there is no way for a simple, uncompensated addition of length to be correct in every combination when compared with the pitches of the open tubing and the other valves.<ref>http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html#valves</ref>

For example, given a length of tubing equaling 100&nbsp;inches when open, one may obtain the following tuning discrepancies:

Playing notes using valves (notably 1st + 3rd and 1st + 2nd + 3rd) requires [[#Valve tuning compensation|compensation]] to adjust the tuning appropriately, either by the player's lip-and-breath control, via mechanical assistance of some sort, or, in the case of horns, by the position of the stopping hand in the bell. 'T' stands for trigger on a trombone.

=== Tuning compensation ===
The additional tubing for each valve usually features a short tuning slide of its own for fine adjustment of the valve's tuning, except when it is too short to make this practicable. For the first and third valves this is often designed to be adjusted as the instrument is played, to account for the deficiencies in the valve system.
[[Image:Trumpet valve bypass.svg|thumb|Trumpet valve bypass (depressed)]]

In most trumpets and cornets, the compensation must be provided by extending the third valve slide with the third or fourth finger, and the first valve slide with the left hand thumb (see [[#Trigger or throw|Trigger or throw]] below). This is used to lower the pitch of the 1-3 and 1-2-3 valve combinations. On the trumpet and cornet, these valve combinations correspond to low D, low C{{music|♯}}, low G, and low F{{music|♯}}, so chromatically, to stay in tune, one must use this method.

In instruments with a fourth valve, such as [[tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[piccolo trumpet]]s, etc. that valve lowers the pitch by a perfect fourth; this is used to compensate for the sharpness of the valve combinations 1-3 and 1-2-3 (4 replaces 1-3, 2-4 replaces 1-2-3). All three normal valves may be used in addition to the fourth to increase the instrument's range downwards by a perfect fourth, although with increasingly severe [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems.

When four-valved models without any kind of compensation play in the corresponding register, the sharpness becomes so severe that players must finger the note a half-step below the one they are trying to play. This eliminates the note a half-step above their open fundamental.

Manufacturers of low brass instruments may choose one or a combination of four basic approaches to compensate for the tuning difficulties, whose respective merits are subject to debate:

==== Compensation system ====
In the Compensation system, each of the first two (or three) valves has an additional set of tubing extending from the back of the valve. When the third (or fourth) valve is depressed in combination with another one, the air is routed through both the usual set of tubing plus the extra one, so that the pitch is lowered by an appropriate amount. This allows compensating instruments to play with accurate intonation in the octave below their open second partial, which is critical for tubas and euphoniums in much of their repertoire.

The compensating system was applied to horns to serve a different purpose. It was used to allow a double horn in F and B flat to ease playing difficulties in the high register. In contrast to the system in use in tubas and euphoniums, the default 'side' of the horn is the longer F horn, with secondary lengths of tubing coming into play when the first, second or third valves are pressed; pressing the thumb valve takes these secondary valve slides and the extra length of main tubing out of play to produce a shorter B-flat horn. A later "full double" design has completely separate valve section tubing for the two sides, and is considered superior, although rather heavier in weight.

==== Additional valves ====
Initially, compensated instruments tended to sound stuffy and blow less freely due to the air being doubled back through the main valves. In early designs, this led to sharp bends in the tubing and other obstructions of the air-flow. Some manufacturers therefore preferred adding more ‘straight’ valves instead, which for example could be pitched a little lower than the 2nd and 1st valves and were intended to be used instead of these in the respective valve combinations. While no longer featured in euphoniums for decades, many professional tubas are still built like this, with five valves being common on CC- and BB{{music|♭}}-tubas and five or six valves on F-tubas.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Compensating double horns can also suffer from the stuffiness resulting from the air being passed through the valve section twice, but as this really only affects the longer F side, a compensating double can be very useful for a 1st or 3rd horn player, who uses the F side less.

==== Additional sets of slides on each valve ====
Another approach was the addition of two sets of slides for different parts of the range. Some euphoniums and tubas were built like this, but today, this approach has become highly exotic for all instruments except [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s, where it is the norm, usually in a double, sometimes even triple configuration.

==== Trigger or throw ====
Some valved brass instruments provide '''triggers''' or '''throws''' that manually lengthen (or, less commonly, shorten) the main tuning slide, a valve slide, or the main tubing. These mechanisms alter the pitch of notes that are naturally sharp in a specific register of the instrument, or shift the instrument to another playing range. Triggers and throws permit speedy adjustment while playing.

Trigger is used in two senses:
* A trigger can be a mechanical lever that lengthens a slide when pressed in a contrary direction. Triggers are sprung in such a way that they return the slide to its original position when released.
* The term "trigger" also describes a device that lengthens certain brass instruments' main length of tubing to shift its range to another playing range, as with [[#Trombone|certain trombones]].

A throw is a simple metal grip for the player's finger or thumb, attached to a valve slide. The general term "throw" can describe a u-hook, a saddle (u-shaped grips), or a ring (ring-shape grip) in which a player's finger or thumb rests. A player extends a finger or thumb to lengthen a slide, and retracts the finger to return the slide to its original position.

====Examples of instruments that use triggers or throws====

=====Trumpet or cornet=====
Triggers or throws are sometimes found on the first valve slide. They are operated by the player's thumb and are used to adjust a large range of notes using the first valve, most notably the player's written top line F, the A above directly above that, and the B{{music|♭}} above that. Other notes that require the first valve slide, but are not as problematic without it include the first line E, the F above that, the A above that, and the third line B{{music|♭}}.

Triggers or throws are often found on the third valve slide. They are operated by the player's fourth finger, and are used to adjust the lower D and C{{music|#}}. Trumpets typically use throws, whilst cornets may have a throw or trigger.

=====Trombone=====
[[Trombone]] triggers are primarily but not exclusively<ref name="YSL-350C">[http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref> installed on the F-trigger, bass, and contrabass trombones<ref>[http://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/List/ModelSeriesListHE.html?CTID=242800 Yamaha Catalog "Professional Trombones"]</ref> to alter the length of tubing, thus making certain ranges and pitches more accessible.

=====Euphoniums=====
A [[euphonium]] occasionally has a trigger on valves other than 2 (especially 3), although many professional quality [[euphoniums]], and indeed other brass band instruments, have a trigger for the main tuning slide.<ref>The [[Besson (company)|Besson]] Prestige [http://www.besson.com/en/instruments.php?mode=productDetails&pid=42 euphonium].</ref>

=== Mechanism ===
The two major types of valve mechanisms are ''[[rotary valve]]s'' and ''[[piston valve]]s''.  The first piston valve instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The ''Stölzel valve'' (invented by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the ''Vienna valve'' was an improved design. However many professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century. Since the early decades of the 20th century, piston valves have been the most common on brass instruments except for the orchestral [[Horn (instrument)|horn]] and the [[tuba]].<ref>[http://www.public.asu.edu/~jqerics/about_articles.htm The Early Valved Horn] by John Q. Ericson, Associate Professor of horn at Arizona State University</ref> See also the article [[Brass Instrument Valves]].

==Sound production in brass instruments==
Because the player of a brass instrument has direct control of the prime vibrator (the lips), brass instruments exploit the player's ability to select the [[harmonic]] at which the instrument's column of air vibrates. By making the instrument about twice as long as the equivalent woodwind instrument and starting with the second harmonic, players can get a good range of notes simply by varying the tension of their lips (see [[embouchure]]).

Most brass instruments are fitted with a removable [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]. Different shapes, sizes and styles of mouthpiece may be used to suit different embouchures, or to more easily produce certain tonal characteristics.  [[Trumpet]]s, [[trombones]], and [[tuba]]s are characteristically fitted with a cupped mouthpiece, while [[horn (instrument)|horns]] are fitted with a conical mouthpiece.

One interesting difference between a [[woodwind instrument]] and a brass instrument is that woodwind instruments are non-directional. This means that the sound produced propagates in all directions with approximately equal volume. Brass instruments, on the other hand, are highly directional, with most of the sound produced traveling straight outward from the bell. This difference makes it significantly more difficult to record a brass instrument accurately. It also plays a major role in some performance situations, such as in marching bands.

==Manufacture==
Traditionally the instruments are normally made of [[brass]], [[Metal polishing|polish]]ed and then [[lacquer]]ed to prevent [[corrosion]]. Some higher quality and higher cost instruments use [[gold]] or [[silver]] plating to prevent corrosion.  A few specialty instruments are made from wood.

Alternatives to brass include other alloys containing significant amounts of [[copper]] or silver. These alloys are [[biostatic]] due to the [[oligodynamic effect]], and thus suppress growth of [[mold]]s, [[fungi]] or [[bacteria]]. Brass instruments constructed from [[stainless steel]] or [[aluminium]] have good sound quality but are rapidly colonized by microorganisms and become unpleasant to play.

Most higher quality instruments are designed to prevent or reduce [[galvanic corrosion]] between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing.  This may take the form of desiccant design, to keep the valves dry, [[sacrificial zinc]]s, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic insulating washers, or nonconductive or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.

The process of making the large open end (bell) of a brass instrument is called '''metal beating'''. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes [[sheet metal]] into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting|torch]] and smoothed using a hammer or file. A draw bench or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] is used to [[metal spinning|spin]] the bell head and to form a bead at the edge of bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.
