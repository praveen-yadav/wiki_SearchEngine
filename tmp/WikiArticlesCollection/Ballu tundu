'''Ballu tundu''' or '''ballu bardu''' is a traditional [[Italian folk dance#Sardinia|Sardinian folk dance]] which is typically danced in a closed or open circle. The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by [[Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora|La Marmora]] in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to ''[[launeddas]]'' and the shepherd's ''sulittu'' but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century. The Introduction is in 2/4 time but the dance itself is done in 6/8.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dances of Italy|last=Galanti|first=Bianca M.|location=New York|publisher=Chanticleer Press|year=1950|pages=13â€“14}}</ref><ref name="ond">{{cite book|title=Costumi, musica, danze e feste popolari italiane|last=Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro|location=Roma|publisher=Edizione O.N.D.|year=1931}}</ref>

At least in the past, the manner of holding hands was very important and followed strict rules. Married or engaged couples could hold hands palm to palm with fingers entwined, but a man could not do this with a young girl or another man's wife. If a stranger entered the circle, he had to do so to the woman's right so as not to come between her and her husband.<ref name="ond"/>
