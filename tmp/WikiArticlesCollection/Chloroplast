'''Chloroplasts''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔr|ə|p|l|æ|s|t|s}} are [[organelle]]s, specialised subunits, in [[plant cell|plant]] and [[algal]] cells. Their main role is to conduct [[photosynthesis]], where the [[photosynthetic]] pigment [[chlorophyll]] captures the [[energy]] from [[sunlight]], and stores it in the energy storage molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] while freeing [[oxygen]] from water. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from [[carbon dioxide]] in a process known as the [[Calvin cycle]]. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including [[fatty acid synthesis]], much [[amino acid]] synthesis, and the [[immune response]] in plants.

A chloroplast is one of three types of '''[[plastid]]''', characterized by its high concentration of [[chlorophyll]]. (The other two types, the [[leucoplast]] and the [[chromoplast]]), contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.)
Chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally [[Chloroplast division|pinch in two]] to reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. Chloroplasts, like mitochondria, contain their own [[DNA]], which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic [[cyanobacterium]] that was engulfed by an early [[eukaryotic]] cell. Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell, and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.

With one exception (a member of the genus ''[[Paulinella]]''), all chloroplasts can probably be traced back to a single [[endosymbiotic event]] (the cyanobacterium being engulfed by the eukaryote). Despite this, chloroplasts can be found in an extremely wide set of organisms, some not even directly related to each other—a consequence of many [[secondary endosymbiotic events|secondary]] and even [[tertiary endosymbiotic events]].

The word ''chloroplast'' (χλωροπλάστης) is derived from the Greek words ''chloros'' (χλωρός), which means green, and ''plastes'' (πλάστης), which means "the one who forms".<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=chloroplast|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chloroplast&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref>

==Chloroplast lineages and evolution==

Chloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell. They are considered to have originated from [[cyanobacteria]] through [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]]—when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium which remained and became a permanent resident in the cell. [[Mitochondria]] are thought to have come from a similar event, where an [[Aerobic organism|ærobic]] [[prokaryote]] was engulfed.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece /> This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] in 1905<ref>{{cite journal|author= Mereschkowsky C|title= Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche |trans_title=About the nature and origin of chromatophores in the vegetable kingdom |language=German|journal= Biol Centralbl|year=1905|volume=25|pages=593–604 |url=http://archive.org/details/cbarchive_51353_bernaturundursprungderchromato1881}}</ref> after [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]] observed that chloroplasts closely resemble [[cyanobacteria]] in 1883.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Schimper AFW|title= Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper |trans_title=About the development of the chlorophyll grains and stains |language=German|journal= Bot.

===Cyanobacterial ancestor===
{{main|Cyanobacteria}}
Cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts. They are sometimes called blue-green [[algae]] even though they are [[prokaryotes]]. They are a diverse [[phylum]] of [[bacteria]] capable of carrying out [[photosynthesis]], and are [[gram-negative]], meaning they have two cell membranes. They also contain a  [[peptidoglycan cell wall]], which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria, and which is located between their two cell membranes.<ref name=CyanobacterialHeterocysts>{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a000315 |title=Cyanobacterial Heterocysts |year=2010 |last1=Kumar |first1=K. |last2=Mella-Herrera |first2=R.

The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage, providing food for the eukaryotic host, which allowed it to live within it.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece /> Over time, the cyanobacterium was assimilated, and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the [[nuclear genome|nucleus]] of the host.<ref name=BMCBiology-EvolvinganOrganelle /> Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell, and imported back into the chloroplast.<ref name=BMCBiology-EvolvinganOrganelle /><ref name=PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastOrigin />

This event is called ''[[endosymbiosis]]'', or "cell living inside another cell". The cell living inside the other cell is called the ''endosymbiont''; the endosymbiont is found inside the ''host cell''.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece />

Chloroplasts are believed to have arisen after [[mitochondria]], since all [[eukaryotes]] contain mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece>{{cite book|title=Biology 8th Edition Campbell & Reece|year=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson)|page=516}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.067 |title=The Puzzle of Plastid Evolution |year=2009 |last1=Archibald |first1=John M. |journal=Current Biology |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=R81–8 |pmid=19174147}}</ref> This is called ''[[serial endosymbiosis]]''—an early eukaryote engulfing the [[mitochondrion]] ancestor, and some descendants of it then engulfing the chloroplast ancestor, creating a cell with both chloroplasts and mitochondria.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece />

Whether or not chloroplasts came from a single endosymbiotic event, or many independent engulfments across various eukaryotic lineages has been long debated, but it is now generally held that all organisms with chloroplasts either share [[monophyly|a single ancestor]] or obtained their chloroplast from organisms that share a common ancestor that took in a [[cyanobacterium]] 600–1600 million years ago.<ref name=CurrentBiology-Endosymbiosis>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.041 |title=Evolution: Red Algal Genome Affirms a Common Origin of All Plastids |year=2004 |last1=McFadden |first1=Geoffrey I |last2=Van Dooren |first2=Giel G |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=13 |pages=R514–6 |pmid=15242632}}</ref>

These chloroplasts, which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor are known as ''primary [[plastids]]''<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> (''"[[plastid]]"'' in this context means the almost the same thing as chloroplast<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece />). All primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages—the [[glaucophyte]] chloroplast lineage, the [[rhodophyte]], or red algal chloroplast lineage, or the [[chloroplastidan]], or green chloroplast lineage.<ref name="Plastid endosymbiosis" /> The second two are the largest,<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> and the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the [[land plants]].<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids />

=====Helicosproidia=====

The [[helicosproidia]] are nonphotosynthetic parasitic green algae that are thought to contain a vestigal chloroplast.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> Genes from a chloroplast<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.femsle.2004.02.006 |title=The non-photosynthetic, pathogenic green algaHelicosporidiumsp.

===Secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis===

Many other organisms obtained chloroplasts from the primary chloroplast lineages through secondary endosymbiosis—engulfing a red or green alga that contained a chloroplast. These chloroplasts are known as secondary plastids.<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" />

While primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their [[cyanobacterial]] ancestor, secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event, when a nonphotosynthetic [[eukaryote]] engulfed an chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> The engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its [[cell membrane]] and [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], forming a chloroplast with three to four membranes<ref name="Plant Molecular Biology">{{cite journal|title=Protein import pathways in 'complex' chloroplasts derived from secondary endosymbiosis involving a red algal ancestor|journal=Plant Molecular Biology|year=2005|month=February|pmid=15830125|doi=10.1007/s11103-004-7848-y|volume=57|issue=3|pages=333–42|last1=Chaal|first1=Balbir K.|last2=Green|first2=Beverley R.}}</ref>—the two cyanobacterial membranes, sometimes the eaten alga's cell membrane, and the [[phagosomal vacuole]] from the host's cell membrane.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids />

The genes in the phagocytosed eukaryote's nucleus are often transferred to the secondary host's nucleus.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids />
[[Cryptomonads]] and [[chlorarachniophytes]] retain the phagocytosed eukaryote's nucleus, an object called a [[nucleomorph]],<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> located between the second and third membranes of the chloroplast.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name=PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastOrigin />

All secondary chloroplasts come from [[green algae|green]] and [[red algae]]—no secondary chloroplasts from [[glaucophytes]] have been observed, probably because glaucophytes are relatively rare in nature, making them less likely to have been taken up by another eukaryote.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids />

[[File:Two Euglena.jpg|thumb|''[[Euglena]]'', a [[euglenophyte]], contains secondary chloroplasts from green algae.]]

=====Euglenophytes=====

Euglenophytes are a group of common [[flagellated]] [[protists]] that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> [[Euglenophyte]] chloroplasts have three membranes—it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost, leaving the cyanobacterial membranes, and the secondary host's phagosomal membrane.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> Euglenophyte chloroplasts have a [[pyrenoid]] and [[thylakoids]] stacked in groups of three. Starch is stored in the form of [[paramylon]], which is contained in membrane-bound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

[[File:Chlorarachnion reptans.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Chlorarachnion reptans]]'' is a chlorarachniophyte. Chlorarachniophytes replaced their original [[red algal]] endosymbiont with a [[green alga]].]]

=====Chlorarachniophytes=====

[[Chlorarachniophytes]] {{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|l|ɔɹ|ə|ˈ|ɹ|æ|k|n|i|ɵ|ˌ|f|aɪ|t|s}} are a rare group of organisms that also contain chloroplasts derived from green algae,<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> though their story is more complicated than that of the euglenophytes. The ancestor of chlorarachniophytes is thought to have been a [[chromalveolate]], a eukaryote with a ''red'' algal derived chloroplast. It is then thought to have lost its first red algal chloroplast, and later engulfed a green alga, giving it its second, green algal derived chloroplast.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

Chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are bounded by four membranes, except near the cell membrane, where the chloroplast membranes fuse into a double membrane.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> Their thylakoids are arranged in loose stacks of three.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> Chlorarachniophytes have a form of starch called [[chrysolaminarin]], which they store in the cytoplasm,<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> often collected around the chloroplast [[pyrenoid]], which bulges into the cytoplasm.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

Chlorarachniophyte chloroplasts are notable because the green alga they are derived from has not been completely broken down—its nucleus still persists as a [[nucleomorph]]<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> found between the second and third chloroplast membranes<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />—the [[periplastid space]], which corresponds to the green alga's cytoplasm.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

=====Early chromalveolates=====

Recent research has suggested that the ancestor of the [[chromalveolates]] acquired a green algal [[prasinophyte]] endosymbiont. The green algal derived chloroplast was lost and replaced with a [[red algal]] derived chloroplast, but not before contributing some of its genes to the early chromalveolate's nucleus. The presence of both green algal and red algal genes in chromalveolates probably helps them thrive under fluctuating light conditions.<ref name="Science—Prasinophytes in chromalveolates">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1172983 |title=Genomic Footprints of a Cryptic Plastid Endosymbiosis in Diatoms |year=2009 |last1=Moustafa |first1=Ahmed |last2=Beszteri |first2=Bánk |last3=Maier |first3=Uwe G. |last4=Bowler |first4=Chris |last5=Valentin |first5=Klaus |last6=Bhattacharya |first6=Debashish |journal=Science |volume=324|issue=5935 |pages=1724–6 |pmid=19556510|bibcode = 2009Sci...324.1724M }}</ref>

====Red algal derived chloroplasts <span style="font-weight: 400;">(chromalveolate chloroplasts)</span>====

Like [[green algae]], [[red algae]] have also been taken up in secondary endosymbiosis, though it is thought that all red algal derived chloroplasts are descended from a single red alga that was engulfed by an early [[chromalveolate]], giving rise to the [[chromalveolates]], some of which, like the [[ciliates]], subsequently lost the chloroplast.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /><ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /><ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 582–592">{{cite book|title=Biology 8th Edition Campbell & Reece|year=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson)|pages=582–92}}</ref> This is still debated though.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /><ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 582–592" />

[[Pyrenoids]] and stacked [[thylakoids]] are common in chromalveolate chloroplasts, and the outermost membrane of many are continuous with the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] and studded with [[ribosomes]].<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> They have lost their [[phycobilisomes]] and exchanged them for [[chlorophyll c (disambiguation)|chlorophyll ''c'']], which isn't found in primary red algal chloroplasts themselves.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

[[File:Rhodomonas salina CCMP 322.jpg|thumb|''[[Rhodomonas salina]]'' is a [[Cryptomonad|cryptophyte]].]]

=====Cryptophytes=====

[[Cryptomonad|Cryptophytes]], or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the [[chlorarachniophytes]].<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> Cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes, the outermost of which is continuous with the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]. They synthesize ordinary [[starch]], which is stored in granules found in the [[periplastid space]]—outside the original double membrane, in the place that corresponds to the red alga's cytoplasm. Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a [[pyrenoid]] and [[thylakoids]] in stacks of two.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

Their chloroplasts do not have [[phycobilisomes]],<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> but they do have [[phycobilin pigments]] which they keep in their thylakoid space, rather than anchored on the outside of their thylakoid membranes.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name=AJB-historyofplastids />

[[File:Gephyrocapsa oceanica brighter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of ''[[Gephyrocapsa oceanica]]'', a haptophyte.|200px]]

=====Haptophytes=====

[[Haptophytes]] are similar and closely related to cryptophytes, and are thought to be the first chromalveolates to branch off.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> Their chloroplasts lack a nucleomorph,<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> their thylakoids are in stacks of three, and they synthesize [[chrysolaminarin]] sugar, which they store completely outside of the chloroplast, in the cytoplasm of the haptophyte.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

=====Heterokontophytes <span style="font-weight: 400;">(stramenopiles)</span>=====
[[File:20110123 185042 Diatom.jpg|thumb|upright|The photosynthetic pigments present in their chloroplasts give [[diatoms]] a greenish-brown color.]]
The [[heterokontophytes]], also known as the stramenopiles, are a very large and diverse group of algae that also contain red algal derived chloroplasts.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> Heterokonts include the [[diatoms]] and the [[brown algae]], [[golden algae]],<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 582–592" /> and [[yellow-green algae]].

Heterokont chloroplasts are very similar to haptophyte chloroplasts, containing a [[pyrenoid]], triplet thylakoids, and with some exceptions,<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> having an [[epiplastid membrane]] connected to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. Like haptophytes, heterokontophytes store sugar in [[chrysolaminarin]] granules in the cytoplasm.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> Heterokontophyte chloroplasts contain [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']] and with a few exceptions<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> [[chlorophyll c (disambiguation)|chlorophyll ''c'']],<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> but also have [[carotenoids]] which give them their many colors.<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 582–592" />

=====Apicomplexans=====

[[Apicomplexans]] are another group of chromalveolates. Like the [[helicosproidia]], they're parasitic, and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> They were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia, but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than [[chromalveolates]].<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> The apicomplexans include ''[[Plasmodium]]'', the [[malaria]] parasite. Many apicomplexans keep a [[vestigial]] red algal derived chloroplast<ref name="PLoS—Apicomplexans" /><ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> called an [[apicoplast]], which they inherited from their ancestors. Other apicomplexans like ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' have lost the chloroplast completely.<ref name="PLoS—Apicomplexans" /> Apicomplexans store their energy in [[amylopectin]] starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm, even though they are nonphotosynthetic.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

Apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function, and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids. They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes are not connected to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> The fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than [[photosynthesis]]. [[Plant]] chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar, and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize [[fatty acids]], [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]], [[iron-sulfur clusters]], and carry out part of the [[heme]] pathway.<ref name="PLoS—Apicomplexans" /> This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases.<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> The most important apicoplast function is [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] synthesis—in fact, apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function, and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium, they dump the organelle.<ref name="PLoS—Apicomplexans" />

====Dinophytes====

The [[dinoflagellates]] are yet another very large and diverse group of [[protists]], around half of which are (at least [[mixotrophy|partially]]) [[photosynthetic]].<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 582–592" /><ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates">{{cite journal |doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1523 |title=Dinoflagellates: A remarkable evolutionary experiment |year=2004 |last1=Hackett |first1=J.

Most dinophyte chloroplasts are secondary [[red algae|red algal]] derived chloroplasts, like other chromalveolate chloroplasts.

Most dinophyte chloroplasts contain at least the [[photosynthetic pigments]] [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']], [[chlorophyll c2|chlorophyll ''c<sub>2</sub>'']], [[beta-carotene|''beta''-carotene]], and at least one dinophyte-unique [[xanthophyll]] ([[peridinin]], [[dinoxanthin]], or [[diadinoxanthin]]), giving many a golden-brown color.<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> All dinophytes store starch in their cytoplasm, and most have chloroplasts with thylakoids arranged in stacks of three.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

=====Peridinin-containing dinophyte chloroplast=====
[[File:Ceratium furca.jpg|thumb|''[[Ceratium furca]]'', a [[peridinin]]-containing dinophyte<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/botm.1982.25.8.347 |title=Characterization of Peridinin-Chlorophyll α-Proteins from the Marine Dinoflagellate Ceratium furca |year=1982 |last1=Meeson |first1=B.

The most common dinophyte chloroplast is the [[peridinin]]-type chloroplast, characterized by the [[carotenoid]] pigment [[peridinin]] in their chloroplasts, along with [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']] and [[chlorophyll c2|chlorophyll ''c''<sub>2</sub>]].<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /><ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> Peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts.<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> The peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes (occasionally two),<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> having lost the red algal endosymbiont's original cell membrane.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /><ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> The outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> They contain a [[pyrenoid]], and have triplet-stacked thylakoids. Starch is found outside the chloroplast<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> An important feature of these chloroplasts is that their [[chloroplast DNA]] is highly [[genome reduction|reduced]] and fragmented into many small circles. Most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus, and only critical photosynthesis-related genes remain in the chloroplast.<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" />

The peridinin chloroplast is thought to be the dinophytes' "original" chloroplast,<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> which has been lost, reduced, replaced, or has company in several other dinophyte lineages.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

=====Fucoxanthin-containing dinophyte chloroplasts <span style="font-weight: 400;">(haptophyte endosymbionts)</span>=====
[[File:Karenia brevis.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Karenia brevis]]'' is a [[fucoxanthin]]-containing dynophyte responsible for [[algal bloom]]s called "[[red tide]]s".<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" />]]

The [[fucoxanthin]] dinophyte lineages (including ''[[Karlodinium]]'' and ''[[Karenia (dinoflagellate)|Karenia]]'')<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> lost their original red algal derived chloroplast, and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a [[haptophyte]] endosymbiont. ''[[Karlodinium]]'' and ''[[Karenia (dinoflagellate)|Karenia]]'' probably took up different heterokontophytes.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> Because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes, tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast, adding the haptophyte's [[cell membrane]] and the dinophyte's [[phagosomal vacuole]].<ref name="MBE—Fucoxanthin-chloroplasts" /> However, the haptophyte was heavily reduced, stripped of a few membranes and its nucleus, leaving only its chloroplast (with its original double membrane), and possibly one or two additional membranes around it.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /><ref name="MBE—Fucoxanthin-chloroplasts">{{cite journal|pmid=10779532|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/5/718.full|year=2000|last1=Tengs|first1=T|last2=Dahlberg|first2=OJ|last3=Shalchian-Tabrizi|first3=K|last4=Klaveness|first4=D|last5=Rudi|first5=K|last6=Delwiche|first6=CF|last7=Jakobsen|first7=KS|title=Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the 19'Hexanoyloxy-fucoxanthin-containing dinoflagellates have tertiary plastids of haptophyte origin|volume=17|issue=5|pages=718–29|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a026350}}</ref>

Fucoxanthin-containing chloroplasts are characterized by having the pigment [[fucoxanthin]] (actually [[19′-hexanoyloxy-fucoxanthin]] and/or [[19′-butanoyloxy-fucoxanthin]]) and no peridinin. Fucoxanthin is also found in haptophyte chloroplasts, providing evidence of ancestry.<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" />

Members of the genus ''[[Dinophysis]]'' have a [[phycobilin]]-containing<ref name="MBE—Fucoxanthin-chloroplasts" /> chloroplast taken from a [[cryptomonad|cryptophyte]].<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> However, the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast seems to have been taken, and the chloroplast has been stripped of its [[nucleomorph]] and outermost two membranes, leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to maintain themselves, and ''Dinophysis'' species grown in [[cell culture]] alone cannot survive, so it is possible (but not confirmed) that the ''Dinophysis'' chloroplast is a [[kleptoplast]]—if so, ''Dinophysis'' chloroplasts wear out and ''Dinophysis'' species must continually engulf cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts to replace the old ones.<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" />

=====Diatom derived dinophyte chloroplasts=====

Some dinophytes, like ''[[Kryptoperidinium]]'' and ''[[Durinskia]]''<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> have a [[diatom]] ([[heterokontophyte]]) derived chloroplast.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> These chloroplasts are bounded by up to ''five'' membranes,<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids /> (depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it). The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original [[mitochondria]],<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> and has [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[ribosomes]], a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete [[cell (biology)|cell]],<ref name="Grana—Dinophyte chloroplasts">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00173139908559217 |title=Dinophyte chloroplasts and phylogeny - A review |year=1999 |last1=Schnepf |first1=Eberhard |last2=Elbrächter |first2=Malte |journal=Grana |volume=38 |issue=2–3 |pages=81–97}}</ref> all inside the host's [[endoplasmic reticulum lumen]].<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> However the diatom endosymbiont can't store its own food—its starch is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name="Grana—Dinophyte chloroplasts" /> The diatom endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a [[nucleomorph]] because it shows no sign of [[genome reduction]], and might have even been ''expanded''.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" /> Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

''[[Lepidodinium viride]]'' and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast (more specifically, a [[prasinophyte]]).<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> ''[[Lepidodinium]]'' is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that's not from the [[rhodoplast]] lineage. The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].<ref name="AJB—Dinoflagellates" /> The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was [[serial secondary endosymbiosis]] rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a [[green alga]] containing a primary chloroplast (making a secondary chloroplast).<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

===Chromatophores===
While most chloroplasts originate from that first set of endosymbiotic events, ''[[Paulinella]] chromatophora'' is an exception, which has acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently. It is not clear whether that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids/> Being in the early stages of endosymbiosis, ''Paulinella chromatophora'' can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved.<ref name="BMCBiology-EvolvinganOrganelle">{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-10-35 |title=Evolving a photosynthetic organelle |year=2012 |last1=Nakayama |first1=Takuro |last2=Archibald |first2=John M |journal=BMC Biology |volume=10 |pages=35 |pmid=22531210 |pmc=3337241}}</ref><ref name=MolecularBiologyEvol-EndosymbioticGeneTransfer>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq209 |title=Endosymbiotic Gene Transfer and Transcriptional Regulation of Transferred Genes in ''Paulinella chromatophora'' |year=2010 |last1=Nowack |first1=E.

===Kleptoplastidy===

In some groups of [[mixotrophic]] [[protist]]s, like some [[dinoflagellate]]s, chloroplasts are separated from a captured alga or [[diatom]] and used temporarily. These [[kleptoplasty|klepto chloroplasts]] may only have a lifetime of a few days and are then replaced.<ref name=Skovgaard>{{cite journal |doi=10.3354/ame015293 |title=Role of chloroplast retention in a marine dinoflagellate |year=1998 |last1=Skovgaard |first1=Alf |journal=Aquatic Microbial Ecology |volume=15 |pages=293–301}}</ref>

====Inverted repeats====
Many chloroplast DNAs contain two ''inverted repeats'', which separate a long single copy section (LSC) from a short single copy section (SSC).<ref name=AmericanJournalofBotany>{{cite journal |doi=10.3732/ajb.94.3.275 |title=Comparison of whole chloroplast genome sequences to choose noncoding regions for phylogenetic studies in angiosperms: The tortoise and the hare III |year=2007 |last1=Shaw |first1=J. |last2=Lickey |first2=E.

While a given pair of inverted repeats are rarely completely identical, they are always very similar to each other, apparently resulting from [[concerted evolution]].<ref name=Springer-TheChloroplast-18 />

The inverted repeats vary wildly in length, ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 [[base pairs]] long each and containing as few as four or as many as over 150 genes.<ref name=Springer-TheChloroplast-18 /> Inverted repeats in plants tend to be at the upper end of this range, each being 20,000–25,000 base pairs long.<ref name=AmericanJournalofBotany /><ref name=PNAS-InvertedRepeats>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.76.1.41 |title=Inverted Repeats in Chloroplast DNA from Higher Plants |year=1979 |last1=Kolodner |first1=R. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=76 |pages=41–5 |pmid=16592612 |last2=Tewari |first2=KK |issue=1 |pmc=382872|bibcode = 1979PNAS...76...41K }}</ref>

====Nucleoids====

New chloroplasts may contain up to 100 copies of their DNA,<ref name=BioscienceExplained /> though the number of chloroplast DNA copies decreases to about 15–20 as the chloroplasts age.<ref name=PlantBiochemistry>{{cite book|title=Plant Biochemistry |edition=3rd |year=2005|publisher=Academic Press|page=517|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qHCzrDHajtoC&pg=PA517&lpg=PA517&dq=number+of+copies+of+ctDNA+per+chloroplast#v=onepage&q=number%20of%20copies%20of%20ctDNA%20per%20chloroplast&f=false|isbn=9780120883912}}</ref> They are usually packed into [[nucleoids]] which can contain several identical chloroplast DNA rings.

Among land plants, the contents of the chloroplast genome are fairly similar.<ref name=AmericanJournalofBotany />

====Chloroplast genome reduction and gene transfer====

Over time, many parts of the chloroplast genome were transferred to the [[nuclear genome]] of the host,<ref name=BioscienceExplained /><ref name=PNAS-RatesofctDNAevolution /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature01435 |title=Direct measurement of the transfer rate of chloroplast DNA into the nucleus |year=2003 |last1=Huang |first1=Chun Y. |last2=Ayliffe |first2=Michael A. |last3=Timmis |first3=Jeremy N. |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6927 |pages=72–6 |pmid=12594458|bibcode = 2003Natur.422...72H }}</ref> a process called ''[[endosymbiotic gene transfer]]''.
As a result, the chloroplast genome is heavily [[genome reduction|reduced]] compared to that of free-living cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts may contain 60–100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often have more than 1500 genes in their genome.<ref name="PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis">{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.182432999 |title=Evolutionary analysis of Arabidopsis, cyanobacterial, and chloroplast genomes reveals plastid phylogeny and thousands of cyanobacterial genes in the nucleus |year=2002 |last1=Martin |first1=W. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=99 |issue=19 |pages=12246–51 |bibcode=2002PNAS...9912246M |pmid=12218172 |last2=Rujan |first2=T |last3=Richly |first3=E |last4=Hansen |first4=A |last5=Cornelsen |first5=S |last6=Lins |first6=T |last7=Leister |first7=D |last8=Stoebe |first8=B |last9=Hasegawa |first9=M |last10=Penny |first10=D |pmc=129430}}</ref>

Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the [[Chloroplast#Secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis|lost chloroplasts]] in many [[chromalveolate]] lineages. Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence. For example, while [[diatoms]] (a [[heterokontophyte]]) now have a [[red algal derived chloroplast]], the presence of many [[green algal]] genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor (probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too) had a [[green algal derived chloroplast]] at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast.<ref name="Science—Prasinophytes in chromalveolates" />

In land plants, some 11–14% of the DNA in their nuclei can be traced back to the chloroplast,<ref name=MolecularBiologyEvol-EndosymbioticGeneTransfer /> up to 18% in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', corresponding to about 4,500 protein-coding genes.<ref name="Current Biology—Algal genomics">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.11.008 |title=Algal Genomics: Exploring the Imprint of Endosymbiosis |year=2006 |last1=Archibald |first1=John M. |journal=Current Biology |volume=16 |issue=24 |pages=R1033–5 |pmid=17174910}}</ref> There have been a few recent transfers of genes from the chloroplast DNA to the nuclear genome in land plants.<ref name=PNAS-RatesofctDNAevolution />

Of the approximately three-thousand proteins found in chloroplasts, some 95% of them are encoded by nuclear genes. Many of the chloroplast's protein complexes consist of subunits from both the chloroplast genome and the host's nuclear genome. As a result, [[protein synthesis]] must be coordinated between the chloroplast and the nucleus. The chloroplast is mostly under nuclear control, though chloroplasts can also give out signals regulating [[gene expression]] in the nucleus, called ''[[retrograde signaling (cell biology)|retrograde signaling]]''.<ref name=Science-ChloroplastSignals-NuclearGeneExpression>{{cite journal |bibcode=2007Sci...316..715K |title=Signals from Chloroplasts Converge to Regulate Nuclear Gene Expression |last1=Koussevitzky |first1=Shai |last2=Nott |first2=A |first3=TC |first4=F |first5=G |first6=M |first7=J |first8=R |first9=J  |volume=316 |year=2007 |pages=715–9 |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1140516 |pmid=17395793 |issue=5825 |last3=Mockler |last4=Hong |last5=Sachetto-Martins |last6=Surpin |last7=Lim |last8=Mittler |last9=Chory |doi_brokendate=August 24, 2013 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/316/5825/715.short}}</ref>

====Protein synthesis====
{{See also|transcription (genetics)|Translation (biology)|label 1=Transcription|label 2=translation}}
Protein synthesis within chloroplasts relies on two [[RNA polymerase]]s. One is coded by the chloroplast DNA, the other is of [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] origin.

===Protein targeting and import===
{{See also|Translation (biology)|label 1=Translation}}

The movement of so many chloroplast genes to the nucleus means that lots of chloroplast [[proteins]] that were supposed to be [[Translation (biology)|translated]] in the chloroplast are now synthesized in the cytoplasm. This means that these proteins must be directed back to the chloroplast, and imported through at least two chloroplast membranes.<ref name="Nature—Protein import">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrm1333 |title=Plant cell biology: Protein import into chloroplasts |year=2004 |last1=Soll |first1=Jürgen |last2=Schleiff |first2=Enrico |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=198–208 |pmid=14991000}}</ref>

Curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became [[exaptations]], taking on new functions like participating in [[cell division]], [[protein routing]], and even [[disease resistance]]. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the [[mitochondrial genome]]—most became nonfunctional [[pseudogenes]], though a few [[tRNA]] genes still work in the [[mitochondrion]].<ref name="PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis" /> Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the [[secretory pathway]]<ref name="PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis" /> (though it should be noted that many [[secondary plastids]] are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's [[cell membrane]], and therefore [[topologically]] outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the [[cytosol]], you have to cross the [[cell membrane]], just like if you were headed for the [[extracellular space]]. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway).<ref name="RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids" />

Because the cell acquiring a chloroplast [[Chloroplast#Primary endosymbiosis|already]] had [[mitochondria]] (and [[peroxisomes]], and a [[cell membrane]] for secretion), the new chloroplast host had to develop a unique [[protein targeting system]] to avoid having chloroplast proteins being sent to the wrong [[organelle]], and the wrong proteins being sent to the chloroplast.<ref name="Nature—Protein import" />

{{plain image|File:Tetrapeptide structural formulae.svg| The two ends of a polypeptide are called the [[N-terminus]], or ''amino end'', and the [[C-terminus]], or ''carboxyl end''.<ref name="Biology 8th edition—Campbell & Reece—340">{{cite book|title=Biology 8th edition—Campbell & Reece|year=2008|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=978-0-321-54325-7|page=340}}</ref> This [[polypeptide]] has four [[amino acids]] linked together.

In most, but not all cases, nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are [[Translation (biology)|translated]] with a ''[[cleavable transit peptide]]'' that's added to the N-terminus of the protein precursor. Sometimes the transit sequence is found on the C-terminus of the protein,<ref name="The Plant Cell—C-terminal transit sequences">{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.112.096248 |title=A Transit Peptide-Like Sorting Signal at the C Terminus Directs the Bienertia sinuspersici Preprotein Receptor Toc159 to the Chloroplast Outer Membrane |year=2012 |last1=Lung |first1=S.-C. |last2=Chuong |first2=S.

====Transport proteins and membrane translocons====

After a chloroplast [[polypeptide]] is synthesized on a [[ribosome]] in the [[cytosol]], an enzyme [[enzyme specificity|specific]] to chloroplast proteins<ref name="JBC—Transit sequence phosphorylation">{{cite journal |doi=10.1074/jbc.271.11.6545 |title=Phosphorylation of the Transit Sequence of Chloroplast Precursor Proteins |year=1996 |last1=Soll |first1=J r. |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=271 |issue=11 |pages=6545–54 |pmid=8626459 |last2=Soll |first2=J}}</ref> [[phosphorylates]], or adds a [[phosphate group]] to many (but not all) of them in their transit sequences.<ref name="Nature—Protein import" />
Phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide, keeping it from [[protein folding|folding]] prematurely.<ref name="Nature—Protein import" /> This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place—the [[cytosol]].<ref name="The Plant Cell—14-3-3 proteins" /><ref name="BBA—Tic-toc">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-4889(01)00147-1 |title=Toc, Tic, and chloroplast protein import |year=2001 |last1=Jarvis |first1=Paul |last2=Soll |first2=Jürgen |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research |volume=1541 |pages=64–79 |pmid=11750663 |issue=1–2}}</ref> At the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast.<ref name="The Plant Cell—14-3-3 proteins">{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.12.1.53 |title=14-3-3 Proteins Form a Guidance Complex with Chloroplast Precursor Proteins in Plants |year=2000 |last1=May |first1=T. |journal=The Plant Cell Online |volume=12 |pages=53}}</ref> These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast.<ref name="Nature—Protein import" />

All chloroplasts have at least three membrane systems—the outer chloroplast membrane, the inner chloroplast membrane, and the [[thylakoid]] system. Chloroplasts that are the product of [[Chloroplast#Endosymbiosis|secondary endosymbiosis]] may have additional membranes surrounding these three.<ref name="Plant Molecular Biology" /> Inside the outer and inner chloroplast membranes is the chloroplast [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]], a semi-gel-like fluid<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity">{{cite book |last=Wise |first=edited by Robert R.|title=The structure and function of plastids|year=2006|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-4061-0|pages=3–21|url=http://www.uwosh.edu/biology/faculty-and-staff/faculty/wise/publications/wise-the-diversity-of-plastid|coauthors=Hoober, J. Kenneth}}</ref> that makes up much of a chloroplast's volume, and in which the thylakoid system floats.

{{See also|Chloroplast membrane}}

There are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast membranes. The fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic [[cyanobacteria]]. This is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host's [[cell membrane]] infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral [[cyanobacterium]]—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the cyanobacterium's original double membranes.<ref name=AJB-historyofplastids />

The chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the [[mitochondrial]] double membrane. This is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run [[proton pumps]] and carry out [[oxidative phosphorylation]] across to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy. The only chloroplast structure that can considered [[analogy (biology)|analogous]] to it is the internal thylakoid system. Even so, in terms of "in-out", the direction of chloroplast [[hydronium|H{{sup|+}}]] ion flow is in the opposite direction compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /><ref name="Biology 8th—Campbell & Reece—196–197">{{cite book|title=Biology 8th edition—Campbell & Reece|year=2008|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=978-0-321-54325-7|pages=196–197}}</ref> In addition, in terms of function, the inner chloroplast membrane, which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials, has no counterpart in the mitochondrion.<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" />

===Outer chloroplast membrane===

{{main|Chloroplast membrane}}

The outer chloroplast membrane is a semi-porous membrane that small molecules and [[ions]] can easily diffuse across.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029400 |title=Polypeptide Composition of Envelopes of Spinach Chloroplasts: Two Major Proteins Occupy 90% of Outer Envelope Membranes |year=1998 |last1=Koike |first1=H. |last2=Yoshio |first2=M. |last3=Kashino |first3=Y. |last4=Satoh |first4=K. |journal=Plant and Cell Physiology |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=526–32 |pmid=9664716}}</ref> However, it is not permeable to larger [[proteins]], so chloroplast [[polypeptides]] being synthesized in the cell [[cytoplasm]] must be transported across the outer chloroplast membrane by the [[TOC complex]], or ''[[translocon|'''t'''ranslocon]] on the '''o'''uter '''c'''hloroplast'' membrane.<ref name="Nature—Protein import" />

The chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm, forming a [[stromule]], or [[stroma (fluid)|'''strom'''a]]-containing tub'''ule'''. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other [[plastids]] like [[chromoplasts]] and [[amyloplasts]] in petals and roots, respectively.<ref name="Köhler2000">{{cite journal |author=Köhler RH, Hanson MR |title=Plastid tubules of higher plants are tissue-specific and developmentally regulated |journal=J.

===Intermembrane space and peptidoglycan wall===
[[File:Glaucocystis sp.jpg|thumb|Instead of an intermembrane space, [[glaucophyte algae]] have a [[peptidoglycan wall]] between their inner and outer chloroplast membranes.]]

Usually, a thin intermembrane space about 10–20 [[nanometers]] thick exists between the outer and inner chloroplast membranes.<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46">{{cite book|last=Burgess,|first=Jeremy|title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521316111|page=46|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA46|edition=[Pbk.}}</ref>

[[Glaucophyte algal]] chloroplasts have a [[peptidoglycan]] layer between the chloroplast membranes. It corresponds to the [[peptidoglycan cell wall]] of their [[cyanobacterial]] ancestors, which is located between their two cell membranes. These chloroplasts are called [[muroplasts]] (from Latin ''"mura"'', meaning "wall"). Other chloroplasts have lost the cyanobacterial wall, leaving an intermembrane space between the two chloroplast envelope membranes.<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" />

===Inner chloroplast membrane===

{{main|Chloroplast membrane}}

The inner chloroplast membrane borders the stroma and regulates passage of materials in and out of the chloroplast. After passing through the [[TOC complex]] in the outer chloroplast membrane, [[polypeptides]] must pass through the [[TIC complex]] ''([[translocon|'''t'''ranslocon]] on the '''i'''nner '''c'''hloroplast membrane)'' which is located in the inner chloroplast membrane.<ref name="Nature—Protein import" />

In addition to regulating the passage of materials, the inner chloroplast membrane is where [[fatty acids]], [[lipids]], and [[carotenoids]] are synthesized.<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" />

====Peripheral reticulum====
Some chloroplasts contain a structure called the [[chloroplast peripheral reticulum]].<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" /> It is often found in the chloroplasts of [[C4 plant|{{C4}} plants]], though it has also been found in some {{C3}} [[angiosperms]],<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> and even some [[gymnosperms]].<ref name="NewPhytologist-GymnospermPeripheralReticulum">{{cite journal|last=Whatley|first=Jean M|title=The occurrence of a peripheral reticulum in plastids of the gymnosperm Welwitschia mirabilis|journal=New Phytologist|date=5|year=1994|month=July|volume=74|issue=2|pages=215–220|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1975.tb02608.x}}</ref> The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the [[inner chloroplast membrane]] that extends into the internal [[stroma (fluid)|stromal]] fluid of the chloroplast. Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's [[surface area to volume ratio|surface area]] for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell [[cytoplasm]]. The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as [[transport vesicles]] to shuttle stuff between the [[thylakoids]] and intermembrane space.<ref name=StructureandFunctionofPlastids />

===Stroma===
{{main|Stroma (fluid)|l1=Stroma}}

The [[protein]]-rich,<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> [[alkaline]],<ref name="Biology 8th—Campbell & Reece—196–197" /> [[aqueous]] fluid within the inner chloroplast membrane and outside of the thylakoid space is called the stroma,<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> which corresponds to the [[cytosol]] of the original [[cyanobacterium]]. [[Nucleoids]] of [[chloroplast DNA]], chloroplast [[ribosomes]], the thylakoid system with [[plastoglobuli]], [[starch]] granules, and many [[proteins]] can be found floating around in it. The [[Calvin cycle]], which fixes [[CO2|CO{{sub|2}}]] into [[G3P|sugar]] takes place in the stroma.

====Chloroplast ribosomes====
{{plain image|File:Chloroplast and bacterial ribosome comparison.png|'''Chloroplast ribosomes''' Comparison of a chloroplast ribosome (green) and a bacterial ribosome (yellow). Important features common to both ribosomes and chloroplast-unique features are labeled.|300px|right|bottom|triangle|#cec51b}}
Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins. Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of [[Eukaryotic Ribosome (80S)|cytoplasmic ribosomes]] (around 17 [[Nanometre|nm]] vs 25 [[Nanometre|nm]]).<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" /> They take [[mRNAs]] transcribed from the [[chloroplast DNA]] and [[translation (biology)|translate]] them into protein. While similar to [[bacterial ribosomes]],<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece /> chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria, so chloroplast ribosomes include some chloroplast-unique features.<ref name="PLoS—Chloroplast ribosomes">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050209 |title=Structure of the Chloroplast Ribosome: Novel Domains for Translation Regulation |year=2007 |last1=Manuell |first1=Andrea L. |last2=Quispe |first2=Joel |last3=Mayfield |first3=Stephen P. |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=e209 |pmid=17683199 |pmc=1939882}}</ref>

====Plastoglobuli====

[[Plastoglobuli]] ('''singular''' ''plastoglobulus'', sometimes spelled ''plastoglobule(s)''), are spherical bubbles of [[lipids]] and [[proteins]]<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> about 45–60 nanometers across.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" /> They are surrounded by a [[lipid monolayer]].<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" /> Plastoglobuli are found in all chloroplasts,<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" /> but become more common when the chloroplast is under [[oxidative stress]],<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli">{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.039859 |title=Plastoglobules Are Lipoprotein Subcompartments of the Chloroplast That Are Permanently Coupled to Thylakoid Membranes and Contain Biosynthetic Enzymes |year=2006 |last1=Austin |first1=J. R. |journal=The Plant Cell Online |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=1693–703 |pmid=16731586 |last2=Frost |first2=E |last3=Vidi |first3=PA |last4=Kessler |first4=F |last5=Staehelin |first5=LA |pmc=1488921}}</ref> or when it ages and transitions into a [[gerontoplast]].<ref name="Wise—Plastid diversity" /> Plastoglobuli also exhibit a greater size variation under these conditions.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" /> They are also common in [[etioplasts]], but decrease in number as the etioplasts mature into chloroplasts.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" />

Plastoglubuli contain both structural proteins and enzymes involved in [[lipid synthesis]] and [[metabolism]]. They contain many types of [[lipids]] including [[plastoquinone]], [[vitamin E]], [[carotenoids]] and [[chlorophylls]].<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" />

Plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]], but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a [[thylakoid]] or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" /> In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly, attached directly to their parent thylakoid. In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a thylakoid.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" />

Plastoglobuli form when a bubble appears between the layers of the [[lipid bilayer]] of the thylakoid membrane, or bud from existing plastoglubuli—though they never detach and float off into the stroma.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" /> Practically all plastoglobuli form on or near the highly curved edges of the [[thylakoid]] disks or sheets. They are also more common on stromal thylakoids than on [[granum|granal]] ones.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli" />

====Starch granules====
[[Starch granules]] are very common in chloroplasts, typically taking up 15% of the organelle's volume,<ref name="Plant Physiology—Starch granules in Arabidopsis" /> though in some other plastids like [[amyloplasts]], they can be big enough to distort the shape of the organelle.<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" /> Starch granules are simply accumulations of starch in the stroma, and are not bounded by a membrane.<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" />

Starch granules appear and grow throughout the day, as the chloroplast synthesizes [[sugars]], and are consumed at night to fuel [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] and continue sugar export into the [[phloem]],<ref name="FPB—Starch breakdown">{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/FP06313 |title=Starch breakdown: Recent discoveries suggest distinct pathways and novel mechanisms |year=2007 |last1=Zeeman |first1=Samuel C. |last2=Delatte |first2=Thierry |last3=Messerli |first3=Gaëlle |last4=Umhang |first4=Martin |last5=Stettler |first5=Michaela |last6=Mettler |first6=Tabea |last7=Streb |first7=Sebastian |last8=Reinhold |first8=Heike |last9=Kötting |first9=Oliver |journal=Functional Plant Biology |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=465–73}}</ref> though in mature chloroplasts, it is rare for a starch granule to be completely consumed or for a new granule to accumulate.<ref name="Plant Physiology—Starch granules in Arabidopsis">{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.111.186957 |title=Control of Starch Granule Numbers in Arabidopsis Chloroplasts |year=2011 |last1=Crumpton-Taylor |first1=M. |last2=Grandison |first2=S. |last3=Png |first3=K.

===Thylakoid system===
[[File:Chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 85000x.png|thumb|right|[[Transmission electron microscope]] image of some thylakoids arranged in grana stacks and lamellæ. Plastoglobuli (dark blobs) are also present.]]

{{main|Thylakoid}}

Suspended within the chloroplast stroma is the [[thylakoid]] system, a highly dynamic collection of membranous sacks called [[thylakoids]] where [[chlorophyll]] is found and the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]] happen.<ref name=Biology8th-Campbell&Reece-186-187 />
In most [[vascular plant]] chloroplasts, the thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana,<ref name="The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system" /> though in certain [[C4 plant|{{C4}} plant]] chloroplasts<ref name=PlantCellBiology-C4 /> and some [[algal]] chloroplasts, the thylakoids are free floating.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

====Granal structure====
Using a [[light microscope]], it is just barely possible to see tiny green granules—which were named [[Thylakoid|grana]].<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" /> With [[electron microscopy]], it became possible to see the thylakoid system in more detail, revealing it to consist of stacks of flat [[thylakoids]] which made up the grana, and long interconnecting stromal thylakoids which linked different grana.<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" />
In the [[transmission electron microscope]], thylakoid membranes appear as alternating light-and-dark bands, 8.5 nanometers thick.<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" />

For a long time, the three dimensional structure of the thylakoid system has been unknown or disputed. One model has the granum as a stack of thylakoids linked by [[helical]] stromal thylakoids; the other has the granum as a single folded thylakoid connected in a "hub and spoke" way to other grana by stromal thylakoids. While the thylakoid system is still commonly depicted according to the folded thylakoid model,<ref name=Biology8th-Campbell&Reece-186-187 /> it was determined in 2011 that the stacked and helical thylakoids model is correct.<ref name="Plant Physiology—Granal structure" />

In the helical thylakoid model, grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids,<ref name="Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46" /> though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system">{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly |year=2008 |last1=Mustardy |first1=L. |last2=Buttle |first2=K. |last3=Steinbach |first3=G. |last4=Garab |first4=G. |journal=The Plant Cell Online |volume=20 |issue=10 |pages=2552–7 |pmid=18952780 |pmc=2590735}}</ref> Wrapped around the grana are [[helicoid]] stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or [[lamellar]] thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana.<ref name="Plant Physiology—Granal structure" /> While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system" />

====Thylakoids====

Thylakoids (sometimes spelled ''thylakoïds''),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chloroplast Import Receptor Toc90 Partially Restores the Accumulation of Toc159 Client Proteins in the Arabidopsis thaliana ppi2 Mutant|url=http://mplant.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/2/252/F3.expansion.html|publisher=Molecular Plant|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> are small interconnected sacks which contain the membranes that the [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis take place on. The word ''thylakoid'' comes from the Greek word ''thylakos'' which means "sack".<ref>{{cite web|title=thylakoid|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thylakoid|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>

Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are important [[protein complexes]] which carry out the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]]. [[Photosystem II]] and [[photosystem I]] contain [[light-harvesting complexes]] with [[chlorophyll]] and [[carotenoids]] that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump [[hydrogen ions]] into the thylakoid space, decreasing the [[pH]] and turning it acidic. [[ATP synthase]] is a large protein complex that harnesses the [[concentration gradient]] of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine.<ref name="Biology 8th—Campbell & Reece—196–197" />

There are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]]. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are [[helicoid]] sheets that spiral around grana.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system" /> The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat [[photosystem II]] protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and [[surface area]] for light capture.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system" />

In contrast, [[photosystem I]] and [[ATP synthase]] are large protein complexes which jut out into the stroma. They can't fit in the appressed granal membranes, and so are found in the stromal thylakoid membrane—the edges of the granal thylakoid disks and the stromal thylakoids. These large protein complexes may act as spacers between the sheets of stromal thylakoids.<ref name="The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system" />

The number of thylakoids and the total thylakoid area of a chloroplast is influenced by light exposure. Shaded chloroplasts contain larger and more [[Thylakoid|grana]] with more thylakoid membrane area than chloroplasts exposed to bright light, which have smaller and fewer grana and less thylakoid area. Thylakoid extent can change within minutes of light exposure or removal.<ref name=StructureandFunctionofPlastids />

====Pigments and chloroplast colors====

Inside the photosystems embedded in chloroplast thylakoid membranes are various [[photosynthetic pigments]], which absorb and transfer [[light energy]]. The types of pigments found are different in various groups of chloroplasts, and are responsible for a wide variety of chloroplast colorations.

=====Chlorophylls=====

[[Chlorophyll a|Chlorophyll ''a'']] is found in all chloroplasts, as well as their [[cyanobacterial]] ancestors. Chlorophyll ''a'' is a [[blue-green]] pigment<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 190–193">{{cite book|title=Biology 8th Edition Campbell & Reece|year=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson)|pages=190–193}}</ref> partially responsible for giving most cyanobacteria and chloroplasts their color. Other forms of chlorophyll exist, such as the [[accessory pigments]] [[chlorophyll b|chlorophyll ''b'']], [[chlorophyll c (disambiguation)|chlorophyll ''c'']], [[chlorophyll d|chlorophyll ''d'']],<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> and [[chlorophyll f|chlorophyll ''f'']].

[[Chlorophyll b|Chlorophyll ''b'']] is an [[olive green]] pigment found only in the chloroplasts of [[plants]], [[green algae]], any secondary chloroplasts obtained through the [[secondary endosymbiosis]] of a green alga, and a few [[cyanobacteria]].<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> It is the chlorophylls ''a'' and ''b'' together that make most plant and green algal chloroplasts green.<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 190–193" />

[[Chlorophyll c (disambiguation)|Chlorophyll ''c'']] is mainly found in secondary endosymbiotic chloroplasts that originated from a [[red alga]], although it is not found in chloroplasts of red algae themselves. Chlorophyll ''c'' is also found in some [[green algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]].<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

Chlorophylls [[chlorophyll d|''d'']] and [[chlorophyll f|''f'']] are pigments found only in some cyanobacteria.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name=usydney2010>{{cite web|url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=5463|title=Australian scientists discover first new chlorophyll in 60 years|date=20 August 2010|publisher=University of Sydney}}</ref>

=====Carotenoids=====
{{plain image|File:Delesseria sanguinea Helgoland.JPG|''[[Delesseria sanguinea]]'', a [[red alga]], has chloroplasts that contain red pigments like [[phycoerytherin]] that mask their blue-green [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']].<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 582–592" />|300px|right|bottom|triangle|#aa2040}}

In addition to [[chlorophylls]], another group of [[yellow]]–[[orange (colour)|orange]]<ref name="Biology—Campbell & Reece 190–193" /> pigments called [[carotenoids]] are also found in the photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids.<ref name="Marine Drugs—Algal carotenoids">{{cite journal|last=Takaichi|first=Shinichi|title=Carotenoids in Algae: Distributions, Biosyntheses and Functions|journal=Marine Drugs|date=15 June 2011|volume=9|issue=12|pages=1101–1118|doi=10.3390/md9061101|pmc=3131562}}</ref> They help transfer and dissipate excess energy,<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the [[autumn|fall]], when the leaves of [[Deciduous tree|some land plants]] change color.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shapley|first=Dan|title=Why Do Leaves Change Color in Fall?|url=http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/why-do-leaves-change-color-0909|work=News Articles|publisher=The Daily Green|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> [[β-carotene]] is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like [[chlorophyll a|chlorophyll ''a'']].<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> [[Xanthophylls]], especially the orange-red [[zeaxanthin]], are also common.<ref name="Marine Drugs—Algal carotenoids" /> Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

=====Phycobilins=====

[[Phycobilins]] are a third group of pigments found in [[cyanobacteria]], and [[glaucophyte]], [[red algal]], and [[Cryptomonad|cryptophyte]] chloroplasts.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /><ref name="RSB—The origin of plastids">{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0050 |title=The origin of plastids |year=2008 |last1=Howe |first1=C.J |last2=Barbrook |first2=A.C |last3=Nisbet |first3=R.E.R |last4=Lockhart |first4=P.J |last5=Larkum |first5=A.W.D |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=363 |issue=1504 |pages=2675–85 |pmid=18468982 |pmc=2606771}}</ref> Phycobilins come in all colors, though [[phycoerytherin]] is one of the pigments that makes many red algae red.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Rhodophyta|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rhodophyta.html|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called [[phycobilisomes]].<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> Like [[photosystem I]] and [[ATP synthase]], phycobilisomes jut into the stroma, preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" /> [[Cryptomonad|Cryptophyte]] chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria don't have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and keep them in their thylakoid space instead.<ref name="Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes" />

===Specialized chloroplasts in {{C4}} plants===
{{Plain image|File:C4 photosynthesis is less complicated.svg|Many [[C4 plant|{{C4}} plants]] have their [[Mesophyll tissue|mesophyll cells]] and [[bundle sheath cells]] arranged radially around their [[leaf veins]]. The two types of cells contain different types of chloroplasts specialized for a particular part of [[photosynthesis]].|500px|right|bottom|triangle|#00cd4c}}

{{See also|Photosynthesis|C4 carbon fixation|label 2={{C4}} photosynthesis}}

To fix [[carbon dioxide]] into sugar molecules in the process of [[photosynthesis]], chloroplasts use an enzyme called [[rubisco]]. Rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]], so at high oxygen concentrations, rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors. This has the end result of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy being wasted and {{CO2}} being released, all with no sugar being produced. This is a big problem, since O{{sub|2}} is produced by the initial [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the [[Calvin cycle]] which uses rubisco.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201>{{cite book|title=Biology 8th Edition Campbell & Reece|year=2009|publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson)|pages=200–201}}</ref>

[[C4 plants|{{C4}} plants]] evolved a way to solve this—by spatially separating the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions, which store light energy in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]], are done in the [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells of a {{C4}} leaf. The Calvin cycle, which uses the stored energy to make sugar using rubisco, is done in the [[bundle sheath cells]], a layer of cells surrounding a [[vein (botany)|vein]] in a [[leaf]].<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201 />

As a result, chloroplasts in {{C4}} mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack [[rubisco]], and have normal [[Thylakoid|grana]] and [[thylakoids]],<ref name=PlantCellBiology-C4>{{cite book|last=Steer|first=Brian E.S. Gunning, Martin W.|title=Plant cell biology : structure and function|year=1996|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0867205040|page=24|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MilSkxsmtrYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT49#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store {{CO2}} in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called [[C4 carbon fixation|''{{C4}} photosynthesis'']]. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off {{CO2}} and returns to the mesophyll. Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions, preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201 /> Because of this, they lack thylakoids organized into [[Thylakoid|grana]] stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have free-floating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out [[cyclic electron flow]], a light-driven method of synthesizing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen. They lack [[photosystem II]], and only have [[photosystem I]]—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow.<ref name=PlantCellBiology-C4 /><ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201 /> Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar, they often contain large [[starch]] grains.<ref name=PlantCellBiology-C4 />

Both types of chloroplast contain large amounts of [[chloroplast peripheral reticulum]],<ref name=PlantCellBiology-C4 /> which they use to get more [[surface area to volume ratio|surface area]] to transport stuff in and out of them.<ref name="NewPhytologist-GymnospermPeripheralReticulum"/><ref name=StructureandFunctionofPlastids>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Robert R|title=The Structure and Function of Plastids|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402065705|pages=17–18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FKeCVPbJ3asC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Mesophyll chloroplasts have a little more peripheral reticulum than bundle sheath chloroplasts.<ref name=NewPhytologist-ChloroplastMembraneUltrastructure>{{cite journal|last=Lawton|first=June R|title=Ultrastructure of Chloroplast Membranes in Leaves of Maize and Ryegrass as Revealed by Selective Staining Methods|journal=New Phytologist|year=1988|month=March|volume=108|issue=3|pages=277–283|jstor=2433294|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb04163.x}}</ref>

===Distribution in a plant===
Not all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts. All green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the [[chlorophyll]] in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green.<ref name=Biology8th-Campbell&Reece-186-187>{{cite book|title=Biology 8th edition—Campbell&Reece|year=2008|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=978-0-321-54325-7|pages=186–187}}</ref> The [[plant cells]] which contain chloroplasts are usually [[parenchyma]] cells, though chloroplasts can also be found in [[collenchyma]] tissue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=editor, Keith|title=Handbook of plant science|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|isbn=978-0-470-05723-0|page=16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ucilIjrex5cC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a [[chlorenchyma]] cell. A typical [[chlorenchyma]] cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.

{{Plain image|File:Leaf tissue structure flat.svg|A cross section of a leaf, showing chloroplasts in its [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells. Stomal guard cells also have chloroplasts, though much fewer than mesophyll cells.|600px|center|bottom|triangle|#5ca255}}

In some plants such as [[cacti]], chloroplasts are found in the [[Plant stem|stems]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Biology 8th edition—Campbell&Reece|year=2008|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=978-0-321-54325-7|page=742}}</ref> though in most plants, chloroplasts are concentrated in the [[leaves]]. One square [[millimeter]] of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts.<ref name=Biology8th-Campbell&Reece-186-187 /> Within a leaf, chloroplasts are mainly found in the [[Mesophyll cell|mesophyll]] layers of a [[leaf]], and the [[guard cells]] of [[stomata]]. [[Palisade mesophyll]] cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell, while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell, as well as much less [[chlorophyll]]. Chloroplasts can also be found in the [[bundle sheath]] cells of a leaf, especially in [[C4 plants|C{{sub|4}} plants]], which carry out the [[Calvin cycle]] in their bundle sheath cells. They are often absent from the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of a leaf.<ref name="Plant Physiology Online—Guard Cell Photosynthesis">{{cite web|title=Guard Cell Photosynthesis|url=http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=&id=265|work=Plant Physiology Online|publisher=Sinauer|accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref>

====Chloroplast movement====

{{plain image|File:Chloroplast movement.svg|When chloroplasts are exposed to direct sunlight, they stack along the [[wiktionary:anticlinal|anticlinal cell walls]] to minimize exposure. In the dark they spread out in sheets along the [[wiktionary:periclinal|periclinal walls]] to maximize light absorption.|460px|right|bottom|triangle|#3fbceb}}

{{see also|Cytoplasmic streaming}}
The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's [[cell wall]] or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on.

In higher plants, chloroplast movement is run by [[phototropins]], blue light [[Photoreceptor protein|photoreceptors]] also responsible for plant [[phototropism]]. In some algae, [[mosses]], [[fern]]s, and [[flowering plants]], chloroplast movement is influenced by red light in addition to blue light,<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastMovement /> though very long red wavelengths inhibit movement rather than speeding it up. Blue light generally causes chloroplasts to seek shelter, while red light draws them out to maximize light absorption.<ref name=JEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovement />

Studies of ''[[Vallisneria gigantea]]'', an aquatic [[flowering plant]], have shown that chloroplasts can get moving within five minutes of light exposure, though they don't initially show any net directionality. They may move along [[microfilament]] tracks, and the fact that the microfilament mesh changes shape to form a honeycomb structure surrounding the chloroplasts after they have moved suggests that microfilaments may help to anchor chloroplasts in place.<ref name=PlantCellPhysiology-MicrofilamentAnchors /><ref name=JEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovement />

==Function and chemistry==

===Guard cell chloroplasts===
{{expand section|determined functions, controversial functions, characteristics and population|date=August 2013}}

Unlike most epidermal cells, the [[guard cells]] of plant [[stomata]] contain relatively well developed chloroplasts.<ref name="Plant Physiology Online—Guard Cell Photosynthesis" /> However, exactly what they do is controversial.<ref>{{cite doi |10.1046/j.0028-646X.2001.NPH328.doc.x}}</ref>

===Plant innate immunity===

[[Plants]] lack specialized [[immune cells]]—all plant cells participate in the plant [[plant innate immunity|immune response]]. Chloroplasts, along with the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[cell membrane]], and [[endoplasmic reticulum]],<ref name=MPMI-AllHandsonDeck>{{cite journal |doi=10.1094/MPMI-05-10-0113 |title=All Hands on Deck—The Role of Chloroplasts, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and the Nucleus in Driving Plant Innate Immunity |year=2010 |last1=Padmanabhan |first1=Meenu S. |last2=Dinesh-Kumar |first2=S. P. |journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=1368–80 |pmid=20923348}}</ref> are key players in [[pathogen]] defense. Due to its role in a plant cell's immune response, pathogens frequently target the chloroplast.<ref name=MPMI-AllHandsonDeck />

Plants have two main immune responses—the [[hypersensitive response]], in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo [[programmed cell death]], and [[systemic acquired resistance]], where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence.
Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing [[reactive oxygen species]]. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the [[hypersensitive response]]. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate [[systemic acquired resistance]], triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.<ref name=MPMI-AllHandsonDeck />

In some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] during an infection.<ref name=MPMI-AllHandsonDeck />

Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like [[salicylic acid]], [[jasmonic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[reactive oxygen species]] which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate [[retrograde signaling (cell biology)|retrograde signaling]]—signals from the chloroplast that regulate [[gene expression]] in the nucleus.<ref name=MPMI-AllHandsonDeck />

In addition to defense signaling, chloroplasts, with the help of the [[peroxisome]]s,<ref name="katsir">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2008.05.004 |title=Jasmonate signaling: A conserved mechanism of hormone sensing |year=2008 |last1=Katsir |first1=Leron |last2=Chung |first2=Hoo Sun |last3=Koo |first3=Abraham JK |last4=Howe |first4=Gregg A |journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=428–35 |pmid=18583180 |pmc=2560989}}</ref> help synthesize an important defense molecule, [[jasmonate]].

===Photosynthesis===
{{Main|Photosynthesis}}

One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in [[photosynthesis]], the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of [[sugars]]. [[Water]] (H<sub>2</sub>O) and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is made, using [[light energy]]. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the [[light reactions]], where water is split to produce oxygen, and the [[dark reactions]], or [[Calvin cycle]], which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP<sup>+</sup>).<ref name=CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis /><ref name="Campbell 2006">{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Neil A. |first2=Brad |last2=Williamson |first3=Robin J. |last3=Heyden |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |pages= |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}</ref>

====Light reactions====
{{Plain image|File:Thylakoid membrane.png|The [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis take place across the [[thylakoid]] membranes.<!-- [[Photosystem&nbsp;II]] is usually found in the appressed thylakoid membranes between stacked granal thylakoids, while [[photosystem&nbsp;I]] and [[ATP synthase]] is found in portions of the thylakoid membrane in contact with the stroma.-->|450px|right|top|triangle|#ccc}}
{{main|Light reactions}}
The light reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. They take [[light energy]] and store it in [[NADPH]], a form of NADP<sup>+</sup>, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to fuel the [[dark reactions]].

=====Energy carriers=====
{{main|Adenosine triphosphate|NADPH}}
ATP is the phosphorylated version of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP), which stores energy in a cell and powers most cellular activities. ATP is the energized form, while ADP is the (partially) depleted form. NADP<sup>+</sup> is an electron carrier which ferries high energy electrons. In the light reactions, it gets [[redox reaction|reduced]], meaning it picks up electrons, becoming [[NADPH]].

=====Photophosphorylation=====
{{main|Photophosphorylation}}

Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the [[potential energy]] stored in an [[Hydron (chemistry)|H<sup>+</sup>]], or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two [[photosystems]] capture light energy to energize [[electrons]] taken from [[water]], and release them down an [[electron transport chain]]. The [[Plastoquinone|molecules]] between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a [[concentration gradient]], with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many)<ref name="Biology 8th—Campbell & Reece—196–197" /> inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then [[diffuse]] back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through [[ATP synthase]]. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to [[phosphorylate]] [[adenosine diphosphate]] into [[adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP.<ref name="Biology 8th—Campbell & Reece—196–197" /> Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.<ref name="Biochemistry—Proton gradient">{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Jeremy M. Berg; John L. Tymoczko; Lubert Stryer. Web content by Neil D.|title=Biochemistry|year=2002|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0-7167-3051-0|pages=Section 19.4|edition=5. ed., 4. print.|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22519/}}</ref>

=====NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction=====
{{see also|Redox reaction}}

[[Electrons]] are often removed from the [[electron transport chains]] to charge [[NADP+|NADP<sup>+</sup>]] with electrons, [[reduction reaction|reducing]] it to [[NADPH]]. Like ATP synthase, [[ferredoxin—NADP+ reductase|ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase]], the enzyme that reduces NADP<sup>+</sup>, releases the NADPH it makes into the stroma, right where it is needed for the dark reactions.<ref name="Biochemistry—Proton gradient" />

Because NADP<sup>+</sup> reduction removes electrons from the electron transport chains, they must be replaced—the job of [[photosystem II]], which splits [[water]] molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O) to obtain the electrons from its [[hydrogen atoms]].<ref name="Biology 8th—Campbell & Reece—196–197" /><ref name=CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis>{{cite book|title=Biology—Concepts and Connections|year=2009|publisher=Pearson|pages=108–118}}</ref>

=====Cyclic photophosphorylation=====
{{main|Cyclic photophosphorylation}}
While [[photosystem II]] [[photolyzes]] water to obtain and energize new electrons, [[photosystem I]] simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain. Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP<sup>+</sup>, though sometimes they can flow back down more H<sup>+</sup>-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed [[cyclic photophosphorylation]] because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in [[C4 plants|{{C4}} plants]], which need more [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] than [[NADPH]].<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201 />

====Dark reactions====
{{Plain image|File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|'''The Calvin cycle''' ''(Interactive diagram)'' The [[Calvin cycle]] incorporates carbon dioxide into sugar molecules.|435px|right|top|triangle|#ccc|image override=<div></div>}}
{{Calvin cycle}}

{{Main|Dark reactions}}
The [[Calvin cycle]], also known as the [[dark reactions]], is a series of biochemical reactions that fixes [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] into [[G3P]] sugar molecules and uses the energy and electrons from the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] made in the light reactions. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201 />

While named ''"the dark reactions"'', in most plants, they take place in the light, since the dark reactions are dependent on the products of the light reactions.<ref name=Biology8th-Campbell&Reece-186-187 />

=====Carbon fixation and G3P synthesis=====

The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme [[Rubisco]] to fix CO<sub>2</sub> into five-carbon [[Ribulose bisphosphate]] (RuBP) molecules. The result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called [[3-phosphoglyceric acid]], or 3-PGA.
The [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3-PGA into [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]], or G3P sugar molecules. Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle—the end product of the dark reactions.<ref name=Biology-Campbell&Reece-200-201 />

=====Sugars and starches=====

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate can double up to form larger sugar molecules like [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. These molecules are processed, and from them, the still larger [[sucrose]], a [[disaccharide]] commonly known as table sugar, is made, though this process takes place outside of the chloroplast, in the [[cytoplasm]].<ref name="Biochemistry—Calvin cycle">{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Jeremy M. Berg; John L. Tymoczko; Lubert Stryer. Web content by Neil D.|title=Biochemistry|year=2002|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0-7167-3051-0|pages=Section 20.1|edition=5. ed., 4. print.}}</ref>

{{Plain image|File:Saccharose2.svg|Sucrose is made up of a [[glucose]] monomer (left), and a [[fructose]] monomer (right).|width=200px|align=left|caption position=top|triangle=triangle|triangle color=#aaa}}

Alternatively, glucose [[monomers]] in the chloroplast can be linked together to make [[starch]], which accumulates into the [[chloroplast starch granule|starch grains]] found in the chloroplast.<ref name="Biochemistry—Calvin cycle" />
Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation />
Waterlogged [[root]]s can also cause [[starch]] buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less [[sucrose]] being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the [[plant cell]]). This depletes a plant's [[free phosphate]] supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation>{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.73.1.195 |title=Effect of Flooding on Starch Accumulation in Chloroplasts of Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) |year=1983 |last1=Wample |first1=R. L. |last2=Davis |first2=R. W. |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=73 |pages=195–8 |pmid=16663176 |issue=1 |pmc=1066435}}</ref>
While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Carmi, A.; Shomer, I.|year=1979|title=Starch Accumulation and Photosynthetic Activity in Primary Leaves of Bean (''Phaseolus vulgaris'' L.)|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=44|issue=4|pages=479–484|url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/4/479.abstract}}</ref> and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation />

=====Photorespiration=====

[[Photorespiration]] can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high. Rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O<sub>2</sub> instead of CO<sub>2</sub> to [[RuBP]]. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO<sub>2</sub>, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle.<ref name=CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis /> Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called [[carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism]]s, or CCMs. These include [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]], [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]],<ref name=CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis /> and [[pyrenoid]]s. Chloroplasts in {{C4}} plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct [[Chloroplast#Specialized chloroplasts in C4 plants|chloroplast dimorphism]].

===pH===
Because of the [[Hydron (chemistry)|H<sup>+</sup>]] gradient across the thylakoid membrane, the interior of the thylakoid is [[acidic]], with a [[pH]] around 4,<ref>{{cite book|title=Biochemistry.|year=2002|publisher=W H Freeman|pages=Section 19.4|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22519/|author=Berg JM|edition=5th|coauthors=Tymoczko JL, Stryer L.|accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> while the stroma is slightly basic, with a pH of around 8.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastpH>{{cite journal |pmid=12228527 |year=1995 |last1=Hauser |first1=M |last2=Eichelmann |first2=H |last3=Oja |first3=V |last4=Heber |first4=U |last5=Laisk |first5=A |title=Stimulation by Light of Rapid pH Regulation in the Chloroplast Stroma in Vivo as Indicated by CO2 Solubilization in Leaves |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=1059–1066 |pmc=157457 |journal=Plant physiology}}</ref>
The optimal stroma pH for the Calvin cycle is 8.1, with the reaction nearly stopping when the pH falls below 7.3.<ref name="Werdan 1975" />

[[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] in water can form [[carbonic acid]], which can disturb the pH of isolated chloroplasts, interfering with photosynthesis, even though CO<sub>2</sub> is [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|used]] in photosynthesis. However, chloroplasts in living [[plant cells]] are not affected by this as much.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastpH />

Chloroplasts can pump [[Potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] and H<sup>+</sup> ions in and out of themselves using a poorly understood light-driven transport system.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastpH />

In the presence of light, the pH of the thylakoid lumen can drop up to 1.5 pH units, while the pH of the stroma can rise by nearly one pH unit.<ref name="Werdan 1975">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0005-2728(75)90041-9 |title=The role of pH in the regulation of carbon fixation in the chloroplast stroma.

Chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a '''plastid''', though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are many other types of plastids, which carry out various functions. All chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated [[proplastids]] found in the [[zygote]],<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56>{{cite book|last=Burgess,|first=Jeremy|title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521316111|page=56|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA56|edition=[Pbk.}}</ref> or fertilized egg. Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant's [[apical meristems]]. Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in [[root tip meristems]]<ref name=PlantCellBiology-Plastids>{{cite book|last=Steer|first=Brian E.S. Gunning, Martin W.|title=Plant cell biology : structure and function|year=1996|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0867205040|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MilSkxsmtrYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT41#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>—instead, the formation of starch-storing [[amyloplasts]] is more common.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56 />

In [[shoots]], proplastids from [[shoot apical meristems]] can gradually develop into chloroplasts in [[photosynthetic]] leaf tissues as the leaf matures, if exposed to the required light.<ref name="Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis" /> This process involves invaginations of the inner plastid membrane, forming sheets of membrane that project into the internal [[Stroma (fluid)|stroma]]. These membrane sheets then fold to form [[thylakoids]] and [[Thylakoid|grana]].<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54>{{cite book|last=Burgess,|first=Jeremy|title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521316111|pages=54–55|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA54|edition=[Pbk.}}</ref>

If [[angiosperm]] shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an [[etioplast]] stage before becoming chloroplasts. An etioplast is a plastid that lacks [[chlorophyll]], and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a [[prolamellar body]]. While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] stocked.<ref name="Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis" /> Within a few minutes of light exposure, the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced. This process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast, takes several hours.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54 /> [[Gymnosperms]] do not require light to form chloroplasts.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54 />

Light, however, does not guarantee that a proplastid will develop into a chloroplast. Whether a proplastid develops into a chloroplast some other kind of plastid is mostly controlled by the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]<ref name="Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis" /> and is largely influenced by the kind of cell it resides in.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56 />

{{plain image|Plastids conversions-en.svg|Many plastid interconversions are possible.|350px|right|bottom|triangle|#bbb}}

===Plastid interconversion===
Plastid differentiation is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may be converted to [[chromoplasts]], which are [[pigment]]-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors you see in [[flowers]] and ripe [[fruit]]. Starch storing [[amyloplasts]] can also be converted to chromoplasts, and it is possible for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what happens when you illuminate a [[carrot]] or a [[potato]]. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a [[meristematic]] state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56 />

===Chloroplast division===
{{expand section|functions, Z-ring dynamic assembly, regulators such as Giant Chloroplast 1 <!--- Sorry, just had to mention it.--->|date=February 2013}}

Most chloroplasts in a photosynthetic cell do not develop directly from proplastids or etioplasts. In fact, a typical [[shoot meristematic]] plant cell contains only 7–20 [[proplastids]]. These proplastids differentiate into chloroplasts, which divide to create the 30–70 chloroplasts found in a mature photosynthetic plant cell. If the cell [[Mitosis|divides]], chloroplast division provides the additional chloroplasts to partition between the two daughter cells.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidDivision-57>{{cite book|last=Burgess,|first=Jeremy|title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521316111|page=57|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA57|edition=[Pbk.}}</ref>

In single-celled [[algae]], chloroplast division is the only way new chloroplasts are formed. There is no proplastid differentiation—when an algal cell divides, its chloroplast divides along with it, and each [[daughter cell]] receives a mature chloroplast.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54 />

Almost all chloroplasts in a cell divide, rather than a small group of rapidly dividing chloroplasts.<ref name=RSPBChloroplastDivision>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1976.0047 |title=Chloroplast Replication and Chloroplast DNA Synthesis in Spinach Leaves |year=1976 |last1=Possingham |first1=J.

Much of what we know about chloroplast division comes from studying organisms like ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and the red alga ''[[Cyanidioschyzon merolæ]]''.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision />

{{plain image with caption|Chloroplast division.svg|Most chloroplasts in plant cells, and all chloroplasts in [[algae]] arise from chloroplast division.<ref name=IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54 /> ''Picture references,<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision /><ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision />''|800px|center|bottom|triangle|#00cd4c}}

The division process starts when the proteins [[FtsZ1]] and [[FtsZ2]] assemble into filaments, and with the help of a protein [[ARC6]], form a structure called a Z-ring within the chloroplast's stroma.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0854.2007.00545.x |title=Chloroplast Division |year=2007 |last1=Glynn |first1=Jonathan M. |last2=Miyagishima |first2=Shin-ya |last3=Yoder |first3=David W. |last4=Osteryoung |first4=Katherine W. |last5=Vitha |first5=Stanislav |journal=Traffic |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=451–61 |pmid=17451550}}</ref><ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision>{{cite journal |doi=10.1105/tpc.009373 |title=A Plant-Specific Dynamin-Related Protein Forms a Ring at the Chloroplast Division Site |year=2003 |last1=Miyagishima |first1=S.-y. |journal=The Plant Cell Online |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=655–65 |pmid=12615939 |last2=Nishida |first2=K |last3=Mori |first3=T |last4=Matsuzaki |first4=M |last5=Higashiyama |first5=T |last6=Kuroiwa |first6=H |last7=Kuroiwa |first7=T |pmc=150020}}</ref> The [[Min system]] manages the placement of the Z-ring, ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly. The protein [[MinD]] prevents FtsZ from linking up and forming filaments. Another protein [[ARC3]] may also be involved, but it is not very well understood. These proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast, preventing Z-ring formation there, but near the center of the chloroplast, [[MinE]] inhibits them, allowing the Z-ring to form.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision />

Next, the two [[plastid-dividing rings]], or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring is located in the inner side of the chloroplast's inner membrane, and is formed first.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision /> The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across,<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision /> arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins.<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision /> <br />In a few species like ''[[Cyanidioschyzon merolæ]]'', chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision /><ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision />

Late into the constriction phase, [[dynamin]] proteins assemble around the outer plastid-dividing ring,<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision /> helping provide force to squeeze the chloroplast.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision /> Meanwhile, the Z-ring and the inner plastid-dividing ring break down.<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision /> During this stage, the many chloroplast DNA plasmids floating around in the stroma are partitioned and distributed to the two forming daughter chloroplasts.<ref name=PlantPhysiology-EffectofLightonChloroplastDivision>{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.89.4.1178 |title=Effect of Light on the Chloroplast Division Cycle and DNA Synthesis in Cultured Leaf Discs of Spinach |year=1989 |last1=Hashimoto |first1=H. |last2=Possingham |first2=J. V. |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=1178–83 |pmid=16666681 |pmc=1055993}}</ref>

Later, the dynamins migrate under the outer plastid dividing ring, into direct contact with the chloroplast's outer membrane,<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision /> to cleave the chloroplast in two daughter chloroplasts.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision />

A remnant of the outer plastid dividing ring remains floating between the two daughter chloroplasts, and a remnant of the dynamin ring remains attached to one of the daughter chloroplasts.<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision />

Of the five or six rings involved in chloroplast division, only the outer plastid-dividing ring is present for the entire constriction and division phase—while the Z-ring forms first, constriction does not begin until the outer plastid-dividing ring forms.<ref name=ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision />

====Regulation====
In species of [[algae]] which contain a single chloroplast, regulation of chloroplast division is extremely important to ensure that each daughter cell receives a chloroplast—chloroplasts can't be made from scratch.<ref name="Molecular biology of the cell—The Genetic Systems of Mitochondria and Plastids">{{cite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8153-4072-9|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26924/|edition=4. ed.}}</ref><ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision />  In organisms like plants, whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts, coordination is looser and less important. It is likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat synchronized, though the mechanisms for it are mostly unknown.<ref name=Traffic-ChloroplastDivision />

Light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division. Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under [[Chlorophyll#Spectrophotometry|poor quality green light]], but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division. Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts. Exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts.<ref name="RSPBChloroplastDivision" /><ref name=PlantPhysiology-EffectofLightonChloroplastDivision />

===Chloroplast inheritance===
Like [[Mitochondrion#Replication and inheritance|mitochondria]], chloroplasts are usually inherited from a single parent. Biparental chloroplast inheritance—where plastid genes are inherited from both parent plants—occurs in very low levels in some flowering plants.<ref name=AJB-ChloroplastInheritance />

Many mechanisms prevent biparental chloroplast DNA inheritance including selective destruction of chloroplasts or their genes within the [[gamete]] or [[zygote]], and chloroplasts from one parent being excluded from the embryo. Parental chloroplasts can be sorted so that only one type is present in each offspring.<ref name=PNAS-ChloroplastInheritance>{{cite journal |bibcode=1995PNAS...9211331B |title=Uniparental Inheritance of Mitochondrial and Chloroplast Genes: Mechanisms and Evolution |last1=Birky |first1=C. William |volume=92 |year=1995 |pages=11331–8 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |doi=10.1073/pnas.92.25.11331 |pmid=8524780 |issue=25 |pmc=40394}}</ref>

[[Gymnosperms]], such as [[pine trees]], mostly pass on chloroplasts paternally,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Powell W, Morgante M, McDevitt R, Vendramin GG, Rafalski JA |title=Polymorphic simple sequence repeat regions in chloroplast genomes: applications to the population genetics of pines |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=92 |issue=17 |pages=7759–63 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7644491 |pmc=41225 |quote=In the pines, the chloroplast genome is transmitted through pollen |doi=10.1073/pnas.92.17.7759 |bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.7759P }}</ref> while [[flowering plants]] often inherit chloroplasts maternally.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1430924100 |title=High-frequency gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the nucleus |year=2003 |last1=Stegemann |first1=S. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=100 |issue=15 |pages=8828–33 |pmid=12817081 |last2=Hartmann |first2=S |last3=Ruf |first3=S |last4=Bock |first4=R |pmc=166398 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8828S }}</ref><ref name=ruf2007/> Flowering plants were once thought to only inherit chloroplasts maternally. However, there are now many documented cases of [[angiosperms]] inheriting chloroplasts paternally.<ref name=AJB-ChloroplastInheritance>{{cite journal |doi=10.3732/ajb.94.1.42 |title=Paternal, maternal, and biparental inheritance of the chloroplast genome in Passiflora (Passifloraceae): Implications for phylogenetic studies |year=2007 |last1=Hansen |first1=A. K. |last2=Escobar |first2=L. K. |last3=Gilbert |first3=L. E. |last4=Jansen |first4=R. K. |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=94 |pages=42–6 |pmid=21642206 |issue=1}}</ref>

[[Angiosperms]] which pass on chloroplasts maternally have many ways to prevent paternal inheritance. Most of them produce [[sperm cells]] which do not contain any plastids. There are many other documented mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance in these flowering plants, such as different rates of chloroplast replication within the embryo.<ref name=AJB-ChloroplastInheritance />

Among angiosperms, paternal chloroplast inheritance is observed more often in [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] than in offspring from parents of the same species. This suggests that incompatible hybrid genes might interfere with the mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance.<ref name=AJB-ChloroplastInheritance />

====Transplastomic plants====
Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of [[genetically modified crops]]. Since in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, [[transgene]]s in these plastids cannot be disseminated by [[pollen]]. This makes [[plastid transformation]] a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This [[biological containment]] strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture]]. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.<ref name=ruf2007>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700008104 |title=Determining the transgene containment level provided by chloroplast transformation |year=2007 |last1=Ruf |first1=S. |last2=Karcher |first2=D. |last3=Bock |first3=R. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=17 |pages=6998–7002 |pmid=17420459 |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.6998R |pmc=1849964}}</ref>
