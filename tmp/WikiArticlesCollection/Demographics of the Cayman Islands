This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[Cayman Islands]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

The population of the '''Cayman Islands''' reflects its status as a [[British overseas territory]], its history as a former dependency of [[Jamaica]], and its present financial partnerships with the [[United States]] and other countries. The vast majority of its 45,436 residents live on the island of [[Grand Cayman]]. According to the [[Cayman Islands]] Chamber of Commerce, in 1999 an estimated 1,300 people lived on [[Cayman Brac]], while only 115 resided on [[Little Cayman]].

Although many [[Caribbean]] islands were initially populated by [[Amerindian]] groups such as the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s, [[Taíno people|Taino]]s, and [[Carib people|Carib]]s, no evidence of this has been found in the Cayman Islands. Therefore, native Caymanians do not have any Amerindian heritage from their own islands; however, a significant number of Jamaicans have settled in the Cayman Islands over the years, so they and their descendants may have some Amerindian blood via Jamaica. [[Slavery]] was less common on the Cayman Islands than in many other parts of the Caribbean, resulting in a more even division of [[Africa]]n and [[Europe]]an ancestry. Those of mixed race make up 40% of the population, with blacks and whites following at 20% each. The remaining 20% belong to various immigrant ethnic groups.

With its success in the tourism and financial service industries, the Cayman Islands have attracted many international businesses and citizens to relocate. The largest numbers of expatriates living in the Cayman Islands (as of the government's 1999 Census Report) hail from Jamaica (8,320), the [[United Kingdom]] (2,392), the United States (2,040), [[Canada]] (1,562), and [[Honduras]] (873). Approximately 3,300 more residents are citizens of various other countries. While the government doesn't restrict foreign land ownership, it does strongly enforce its immigration laws. Businesses are required to grant access to job openings to Caymanian citizens first; if none of them are suitable, the business may then seek employees from other countries. In order to work in the Cayman Islands, foreigners must have a job offer before immigrating.

To encourage [[literacy]], the Cayman Islands government requires all legal resident children between the ages of four and 16 years old to attend school. Education for Caymanians is free, with both public and private schools available. Based on the English school system, primary schools teach children from four to 11 years, while high schools handle 11 to 16 year-olds. The government also provides facilities for [[special education]], training for the [[disabled]], and an education center for [[juvenile offender]]s. In addition, [[higher education]] may be pursued at The University College and The Law School. Consequently, literacy rates are high, estimated at 98% in 1995 by [[UNESCO]] and 90% by the Cayman Islands government.

The predominant religion on the Cayman Islands is [[Christianity]]. Denominations practiced include [[United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands|United Church]], [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], [[Anglican Church]], [[Baptist Church]], [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and [[Pentecostal Church]]. Many citizens are deeply religious, regularly going to church. Ports are closed on Sundays and Christian holidays. There are also places of worship in George Town for [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and followers of [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The Cayman Islands also hosts a small [[Jewish]] community.<ref>[http://coloring-pages.tv/bible-coloring-pages/dove-of-peace.gif Jewish Community of the Cayman Islands]</ref>

The official language of the Cayman Islands is English. Islanders' accents retain elements passed down from English, Scottish, and Welsh settlers (among others) in a language variety known as [[Cayman Creole]]. Caymanians of Jamaican origin speak in their own vernacular (see [[Jamaican Creole]] and [[Jamaican English]]).
