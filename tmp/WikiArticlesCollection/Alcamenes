'''Alcamenes''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀλκαμένης}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]] of [[Lemnos]] and [[Athens]],  who flourished in the 2nd half of the 5th century BC. He was a younger contemporary of [[Phidias]] and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a [[Hephaestus]] and an [[Aphrodite of the Gardens|Aphrodite "of the Gardens"]] were conspicuous.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] says<ref>''Description of Greece'' V. 10. 8</ref> that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of [[Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility. Pausanias,<ref>''Description of Greece'' I. 8. 4</ref> also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the [[Athenian agora]], which some have related to the [[Ares Borghese]].  However, the temple of Ares to which he refers had only been moved from [[Acharnes]] and re-sited in the Agora in [[Augustus]]'s time, and statues known to derive from Alcamenes' statue show the god in a [[breastplate]],<ref>one is depicted [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idNotice=20221 in this relief]</ref> so the identification of Alcamenes' Ares with the Ares Borghese is not secure.  

At [[Pergamum]] there was discovered in 1903 a Hellenistic copy of the head of the Hermes "Propylaeus" of Alcamenes.<ref>''Athenische Mittheilungen'', 1904, p.&nbsp;180</ref> As, however, the deity is represented in an [[Neo-Attic]], archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.

It is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the [[Parthenon]], in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Phidias. He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in [[Athens]] after the departure of Phidias for [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.
