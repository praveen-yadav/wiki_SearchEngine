'''Carlo Lorenzini''' (November 24, 1826 &ndash; October 26, 1890), better known by the [[pen name]] '''Carlo Collodi''', was an  [[Italians|Italian]] [[children's writer]] known for the world-renowned [[fairy tale]] [[novel]], ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.

==Early life==
Collodi was born in [[Florence]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Career==
During the [[Italian unification|Italian wars of Independence]] in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] army. His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper ''Il Lampione''. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1849 but re-emerged in May 1860.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Lorenzini had won fame as early as 1856 with his novel ''In vapore'' and had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as ''Il Fanfulla''; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including ''[[Macchiette]]'' (1880), ''[[Occhi e nasi]]'' (1881), ''[[Storie allegre]]'' (1887).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1875, he entered the domain of children's literature with ''Racconti delle fate'', a translation of French fairy tales by [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote ''[[Giannettino]]'' (inspired by [[Alessandro Luigi Parravicini]]'s ''Giannetto''), the ''[[Minuzzolo]]'', and ''Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino'', a series which explored the re-unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character [[Giannettino]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through [[allegory]]. In 1880 he began writing ''Storia di un burattino'' ("The story of a [[marionette]]"), also called ''Le avventure di [[Pinocchio]]'', which was published weekly in ''[[Il Giornale per i Bambini]]'' (the first Italian newspaper for children).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Death and legacy==
Lorenzini died in Florence in 1890, unaware of the fame and popularity that awaited his work: as in the allegory of the story, Pinocchio eventually went on to lead his own independent life, distinct from that of the author.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Lorenzini is buried at [[Basilica di San Miniato al Monte|San Miniato al Monte Basilica]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
