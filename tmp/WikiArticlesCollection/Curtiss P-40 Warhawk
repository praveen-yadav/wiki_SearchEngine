The '''Curtiss P-40 Warhawk''' was an American single-engined, single-seat, all-metal [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[ground-attack aircraft]] that first flew in 1938. The P-40 design was a modification of the previous [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] which reduced development time and enabled a rapid entry into production and operational service. The Warhawk was used by most [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] during World War II, and remained in frontline service until the end of the war. It was the third most-produced American fighter, after the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]; by November 1944, when production of the P-40 ceased, 13,738 had been built,<ref name=Murphy>Murphy and McNiece 2009, p. 83.</ref> all at [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation]]'s main production facilities at [[Buffalo, New York]].

'''Warhawk''' was the name the [[United States Army Air Corps]] adopted for all models, making it the official name in the United States for all P-40s. The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] air forces used the name '''Tomahawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40B and P-40C, and the name '''Kittyhawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40D and all later variants.

P-40s first saw combat with the British Commonwealth squadrons of the [[Desert Air Force]] in the Middle East and North African campaigns, during June 1941.<ref name = "nijbrw">Alexander 2006, p. 25.</ref><ref name = "lmnsbs">Brown 1983, p. 20.</ref> [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No. 112 Squadron]] [[Royal Air Force]], was among the first to operate Tomahawks in North Africa and the unit was the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military aviation unit to feature the "shark mouth" logo,<ref name=Crawford>Crawford 1977, p. 14.</ref> copying similar markings on some Luftwaffe [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] twin-engine fighters.<ref name=Crawford/> {{#tag:ref|Inspired by 112 Squadron's usage of them in North Africa, and by the Luftwaffe's earlier use of it, both via Allied wartime newspaper and magazine article images, the "shark mouth" logo on the sides of the P-40's nose was most famously used on those of the [[Flying Tigers]] in China.  The Bf 110s were from ''II Gruppe/[[Zerstörergeschwader 76]]''. Shilling, an AVG pilot indicated, "I was looking through a British magazine one day and saw a photo of a Messerschmitt-110 with a shark face on it."<ref>[http://www.flyingtigerline.org/memoriam/schilling_erik.htm Erik Shilling&mdash; ''Off on his Last Flight''.] Retrieved: 28 February 2008.</ref>|group=N}}
 
The P-40's lack of a [[supercharger|two-stage supercharger]] made it inferior to [[Luftwaffe]] fighters such as the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] or the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] in high-altitude combat and it was rarely used in operations in [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwest Europe]]. Between 1941 and 1944, the P-40 played a critical role with Allied air forces in three major theaters: [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]] and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China]]. It also had a significant role in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|Southeast Asia]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Europe]], [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Alaska]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. The P-40's performance at high altitudes was not as important in those theaters, where it served as an [[air superiority]] fighter, bomber escort and [[fighter bomber]]. Although it gained a postwar reputation as a mediocre design, suitable only for [[close air support]], recent research including scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons, indicates that the P-40 performed surprisingly well as an air superiority fighter, at times suffering severe losses but also taking a very heavy toll of enemy aircraft,<ref name="P40Zero"/> especially when flown against the lightweight and maneuverable Japanese fighters like the [[Nakajima Ki-43|Oscar]] and [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero]] in the manner recommended in 1941 by General [[Claire Chennault]], the AVG's commander in southern China. The P-40 offered the additional advantage of low cost, which kept it in production as a ground-attack aircraft long after it was obsolete as a fighter. In 2008, 29 P-40s were airworthy.<ref>[http://www.warbirdalley.com/p40.htm "Curtiss P-40 Warhawk."] ''Warbird Alley.'' Retrieved: 18 February 2011.</ref>

==Design and development==

===Origins===
[[Image:Xp 40.jpg|right|thumb|An XP-40, ''11 MD'', which was used for test purposes by the [[Air Force Materiel Command|Materiel Division]] of the U.S. Army Air Corps]]

On 14 October 1938, Curtiss test pilot Edward Elliott flew the prototype XP-40, on its first flight in Buffalo.<ref>[http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/chrono1.htm "Chronology: The Army Air Corps to World War II."] ''Air Force Historical Studies Office.'' Retrieved: 20 July 2011.</ref> The XP-40 was the 10th production Curtiss P-36 Hawk,<ref name="Famous Fighters">Green 1957, p. 43.</ref> with its [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830]] (Twin Wasp) 14-cylinder air-cooled [[radial engine]] replaced at the direction of Chief Engineer [[Don R. Berlin]] by a liquid-cooled, supercharged [[Allison V-1710]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] engine. The first prototype placed the glycol coolant radiator in an underbelly position on the fighter, just aft of the wing's trailing edge.<ref name=Merriam>Merriam 2000, p. 15.</ref> USAAC Fighter Projects Officer Lieutenant [[Benjamin S. Kelsey]] flew this prototype some 300 miles in 57 minutes, approximately {{convert|315|mph}}. Hiding his disappointment, he told reporters that future versions would likely go {{convert|100|mph}} faster.<ref>''American Aviation'', Volume 3, 1939, p. 2.</ref> Kelsey was interested in the Allison engine because it was sturdy and dependable, and it had a smooth, predictable power curve. The V-12 engine offered as much power as a radial engine but had a smaller frontal area and allowed a more streamlined cowl than an aircraft with radial engines, promising a theoretical 5% increase in top speed.<ref name=Wilson1997>Wilson, Randy. [http://rwebs.net/dispatch/output.asp?ArticleID=19 "The Heart of the Cobra: Development of the Allison V-1710 Engine".] ''Allison Press Release on the Certification of its V-1710 Engine by the Air Corps'' via ''The Dispatch'', Volume 22, Number 1, Spring, 1997. Retrieved: 20 July 2011.</ref>

Curtiss engineers worked to improve the XP-40's speed by moving the radiator forward in steps. Seeing little gain, Kelsey ordered the aircraft to be evaluated in a [[NACA]] wind tunnel to identify solutions for better aerodynamic qualities. From 28 March to 11 April 1939, the prototype was studied by NACA.<ref>Wagner, Ray. [http://www.americancombatplanes.com/p40_1.html "P-40."] ''American Combat Planes of the 20th century''. Retrieved: 20 July 2011.</ref> Based on the data obtained, Curtiss moved the glycol coolant radiator forward to the chin; its new air scoop also accommodated the oil cooler air intake. Other improvements to the landing gear doors and the exhaust manifold combined to give performance that was satisfactory to the USAAC.<ref name=Merriam/> Without beneficial tail winds, Kelsey flew the XP-40 from Wright Field back to Curtiss's plant in Buffalo at an average speed of {{convert|354|mph|abbr=on}}.{{#tag:ref|Due to the reporter's unfamiliarity with the type, the XP-40 was inaccurately identified as an upgraded P-36.<ref>"America Creeps Up." ''The Aeroplane'' (Temple Press), Volume 56, 1938, p. 730.</ref>|group=N}} Further tests in December 1939 proved the fighter could reach {{convert|366|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>Molesworth 2008, p. 10.</ref>

An unusual production feature was a special truck rig to speed delivery at the main Curtiss plant in Buffalo, New York. The rig moved the newly built P-40s in two main components, the main wing and the fuselage, the eight miles from the plant to the airport where the two units were mated for flight and delivery.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=4m2FTsGiHYfe0QHOutj2Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&q&f=true "New Army Warplane Rides a Trailer on Its First Trip to Airport."] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1941, p. 91.</ref>

===Performance characteristics===
[[Image:Curtiss P-40, ¾-front view, in flight (00910460 023).jpg|left|thumb|A three-quarter view of a P-40B, X-804 (''39-184'') in flight. This aircraft served with an advanced training unit at [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], Arizona.]]
The P-40 had good agility, especially at high speed and at medium-to-low altitude. It was one of the tightest-turning [[monoplane]] fighters of the war,<ref name="Flying">Higam 2004, p. 3.</ref> although at lower speeds it could not out-turn the extremely maneuverable [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] fighters such as the [[A6M Zero]] and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] "Oscar".<ref name="P40Zero">Masell, Patrick. [http://www.chuckhawks.com/p-40_vs_zero.htm "The P-40 and the Zero."] ''Naval Aviation and Military History'', 2002. Retrieved: 7 March 2006.</ref>

Allison V-1710 engines produced about {{convert|1040|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at sea level and at {{convert|14000|ft|m|abbr=on}}: not powerful by the standards of the time and the early P-40 variants' top speeds were unimpressive. Also, the single-stage, single-speed [[supercharger]] meant that the P-40 could not compete with contemporary designs as a high-altitude fighter. Later versions, with {{convert|1200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Allisons or more powerful 1,400&nbsp;hp [[Packard V-1650|Packard Merlin]] engines were more capable. Climb performance was fair to poor, depending on the subtype.<ref name="P40Zero"/> Dive acceleration was good and dive speed was excellent.<ref name="P40Zero"/> The highest-scoring P-40 [[Flying Ace|ace]], [[Clive Caldwell]] ([[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]), who claimed 22 of his 28½ kills in the type, said that the P-40 had "almost no vices", although "it was a little difficult to control in terminal velocity".<ref>Alexander 2006, p. 22.</ref> Caldwell added that the P-40 was "faster downhill than almost any other aeroplane with a propeller."

The P-40 tolerated harsh conditions in the widest possible variety of climates. It was a semi-[[modular]] design and thus easy to maintain in the field. It lacked innovations of the time, such as boosted [[aileron]]s or automatic [[High-lift device|leading edge slats]], but it had a strong structure including a five-[[Spar (aviation)|spar]] wing, which enabled P-40s to survive some midair collisions: both accidental impacts and intentional [[Ramming#Air warfare|ramming attacks]] against enemy aircraft were occasionally recorded as victories by the [[Desert Air Force]] and [[Soviet Air Forces]].<ref name="Romanenko">Romanenko, Valeriy and James F. Gebhardt. [http://lend-lease.airforce.ru/english/articles/romanenko/p-40/index.htm "The P-40 in Soviet Aviation."] ''Lend-lease on airforce.ru''. Retrieved: 7 March 2006.</ref> Caldwell said P-40s "would take a tremendous amount of punishment, violent aerobatics as well as enemy action."<ref name="Alexander p.21"/> Operational range was good by early war standards, and was almost double that of the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] or [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], although it was inferior to the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], [[Nakajima Ki-43]] and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].
[[Image:Kittyhawkdamaged.jpg|thumb|left|Evidence of the P-40's durability: in 1944 [[Flying Officer|F/O]] T. R. Jacklin (pictured) flew this [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF]] P-40N-5 more than {{convert|200|mi|0|abbr=on}} after the loss of the port aileron and 25% of its wing area, to a direct hit from an [[artillery shell]]. {{#tag:ref|The fighter was repaired and served out the war.|group=N}}]]

Caldwell found the P-40C Tomahawk's armament of two .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[Browning M2|Browning AN/M2]] "light-barrel" dorsal nose-mount synchronized machine guns and two .303 [[Browning machine gun]]s in each wing to be inadequate.<ref name="Alexander p.21">Alexander 2006, p. 21.</ref> This was rectified with the P-40E Kittyhawk, which abandoned the synchronized gun mounts and instead had three .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns in each wing, although Caldwell preferred the Tomahawk in other respects. It had armor around the engine and the cockpit, which enabled it to withstand considerable damage. This was one of the characteristics that allowed Allied pilots in Asia and the Pacific to attack Japanese fighters head on, rather than try to out-turn and out-climb their opponents. Late-model P-40s were regarded as well armored. Visibility was adequate, although hampered by an overly complex windscreen frame, and completely blocked to the rear in early models due to the raised turtledeck. Poor ground visibility and the relatively narrow landing gear track led to many losses due to accidents on the ground.<ref name="P40Zero"/>

==Operational history==
In April 1939, the U.S. Army Air Corps, witnessing the new sleek, high speed, in-line-engined fighters of the European air forces, placed the largest, single fighter order it had ever made: 524 P-40s.

===French Air Force===
An early order came from the French ''[[French Air Force|Armée de l'Air]]'', which was already operating P-36s. The ''Armée de l'Air'' initially ordered 100 (later the order was increased to 230) as the '''Hawk 81A-1''' but the French military had been defeated before the aircraft had left the factory, consequently, the aircraft were diverted to British and Commonwealth service (as the Tomahawk I), in some cases complete with metric flight instruments.

In late 1942, as French forces in North Africa split from the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] to side with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], U.S. forces transferred P-40Fs from [[33d Operations Group|33rd FG]] to the ''GC II/5'', a squadron that was historically associated with the [[Lafayette Escadrille]]. GC II/5 used its P-40Fs and Ls in combat in [[Tunisia]] and, later, for patrol duty off the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]] until mid-1944 when they were replaced by [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|Republic P-47D Thunderbolts]].

===British Commonwealth units in Mediterranean and European theatres===

====Deployment====
In all, 18 [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) squadrons, as well as four [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), three [[South African Air Force]] (SAAF), and two [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) squadrons serving with RAF formations, used P-40s.<ref>[http://www.rafweb.org/aircraftM-T.htm "Aircraft of the RAF (M - T)."] ''rafweb.org'', 2007. Retrieved 6 January 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.rafweb.org/aircraftE-L.htm rafweb.org, 2007, "Aircraft of the RAF (E - L)."] ''rafweb.org'', 2007. Retrieved 6 January 2008.</ref>

The first units to convert were [[Hawker Hurricane]] squadrons of the [[Desert Air Force]] (DAF), in early 1941. The first Tomahawks delivered came without armor, bulletproof windscreens or [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s. These were installed in subsequent shipments. Pilots used to British-designed fighters sometimes found it difficult to adapt to the P-40's rear-folding landing gear, which was more prone to collapse than the lateral-folding landing gear found on the [[Hawker Hurricane]] or [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. In contrast to the "three-point landing" commonly employed with British types, P-40 pilots were obliged to use a "wheels landing": a longer, low angle approach that touched down on the main wheels first.

Testing showed the aircraft did not have adequate performance for use in [[North-West Europe|Northwest Europe]] in high-altitude combat due to the effective service ceiling limitation. Spitfires used in the theater operated at heights around {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, while the P-40's Allison engine, with its single-stage, low altitude rated supercharger, worked best at {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} or lower. When the Tomahawk was used by Allied units based in the UK from February 1941, this limitation relegated the Tomahawk to low-level reconnaissance with [[RAF Army Cooperation Command]]
and only one squadron, [[No. 403 Squadron RCAF]] was used in the fighter role. Subsequently, the British [[Air Ministry]] deemed the P-40 completely unsuitable for the theater. UK P-40 squadrons from mid-1942 re-equipped with aircraft such as Mustangs.

The Tomahawk was superseded in North Africa by the more powerful Kittyhawk ("D"-mark onwards) types from early 1942, though some Tomahawks remained in service until 1943. Kittyhawks included many major improvements, and were the DAF's air superiority fighter for the critical first few months of 1942, until "[[Tropics|tropicalised]]" [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s were available. An interesting discovery in 2012 was the virtually intact remains of a Kittyhawk that ran out of fuel in the Egyptian Sahara in June 1942.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/11/world/british-wwii-plane/index.html?iid=article_sidebar "British WWII Plane."] ''CNN News'', 11 May 2012,</ref>

DAF units received nearly 330 [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650 Merlin]]-powered P-40Fs, called Kittyhawk IIs, most of which went to the USAAF, and the majority of the 700 "lightweight" L models, also powered by the Packard Merlin, in which the armament was reduced to four .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) Brownings (Kittyhawk IIA). The DAF also received some 21 of the later P-40K and the majority of the 600 P-40Ms built; these were known as Kittyhawk IIIs. The "lightweight" P-40Ns (Kittyhawk IV) arrived from early 1943 and were used mostly in the fighter-bomber role. {{#tag:ref| Late P-40Fs, as well as the majority of the Ks, Ls and the P-40Ms had lengthened rear fuselages; the F/Ls had no carburettor airscoop on the upper engine cowlings.<ref>Green and Swanborough 1977, pp. 57–59.</ref>|group=N}}

From July 1942 until mid-1943, elements of the [[57th Operations Group|U.S. 57th Fighter Group]] (57th FG) were attached to DAF P-40 units. The British government also donated 23 P-40s to the Soviet Union.

====Combat performance====
Tomahawks and Kittyhawks bore the brunt of ''Luftwaffe'' and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' fighter attacks during the [[North African campaign]]. The P-40s were considered superior to the Hurricane, which they replaced as the primary fighter of the Desert Air Force.<ref name="P40Zero"/> {{Quote box| width=30%

The P-40 initially proved quite effective against Axis aircraft and contributed to a slight shift of momentum in the Allied favor. The gradual replacement of Hurricanes by the Tomahawks and Kittyhawks led to the ''Luftwaffe'' accelerating retirement of the Bf 109E and introducing the newer Bf 109F; these were to be flown by the veteran pilots of elite ''Luftwaffe'' units, such as [[Jagdgeschwader 27|''Jagdgeschwader'' 27]] (JG27), in North Africa.<ref name="Scutts pp. 12–13"/>

The P-40 was generally considered roughly equal or slightly superior to the Bf 109 at low altitude, but inferior at high altitude, particularly against the Bf 109F.<ref>Pentland 1974, p. 22.</ref> Most air combat in North Africa took place well below {{convert|16000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, thus negating much of the Bf 109's superiority. The P-40 usually had an edge over the Bf 109 in horizontal maneuverability, dive speed and structural strength, was roughly equal in firepower, but was slightly inferior in speed and outclassed in rate of climb and operational ceiling.<ref name="P40Zero"/><ref name="Scutts pp. 12–13">Scutts 1994, pp. 12–13.</ref>

The P-40 was generally superior to early Italian fighter types, such as the [[Fiat G.50]] and the [[Macchi C.200]]. Its performance against the [[Macchi C.202|Macchi C.202 ''Folgore'']] elicited varying opinions. Some observers consider the Macchi C.202 superior.<ref name= "Gunston p. 226.">Gunston 1984, p. 226.</ref> Clive Caldwell, who scored victories against them in his P-40, felt that the ''Folgore'' was superior to both the P-40 and the Bf 109 except that its armament of only two or four machine guns was inadequate.<ref>Ethell and Christy 1979, p. 51.</ref> Other observers considered the two equally matched, or favored the ''Folgore'' in aerobatic performance, such as turning radius. Aviation historian [[Walter J. Boyne]] wrote that over Africa, the P-40 and the ''Folgore'' were "equivalent".<ref>Boyne 2002, p. 406.</ref><ref>Snedden 1997, p. 51.</ref><ref>Glancey 2006, p. 166.</ref>

Against its lack of high-altitude performance, the P-40 was considered to be a stable gun platform, and its rugged construction meant that it was able to operate from rough front line airstrips with a good rate of serviceability.<ref>Pentland 1974, pp. 8, 20.</ref>

The earliest victory claims by P-40 pilots include [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] aircraft, during the 1941 [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]], against [[Dewoitine D.520]]s, a type often considered to be the best French fighter used during World War II.<ref name = "nijbrw"/> The P-40 was deadly against Axis bombers in the theater, as well as against the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] twin-engine fighter.

In June 1941, Caldwell, who was serving at the time with [[No. 250 Squadron RAF]] in [[Egypt]], and flying as [[flying Officer|F/O]] Jack Hamlyn's wingman, recorded in his log book that he was involved in the first air combat victory for the P-40. This was a [[CANT Z.1007]] bomber on 6 June.<ref name = "nijbrw"/> The claim was not officially recognized, as the crash of the CANT was not witnessed. The first official victory occurred on 8 June, when Hamlyn and [[Flight Sergeant|Flt Sgt]] Tom Paxton destroyed a CANT Z.1007 from ''211<sup>a</sup> Squadriglia'' of the ''Regia Aeronautica'', over [[Alexandria]].<ref name = "lmnsbs"/> Several days later, the Tomahawk was in action over Syria with [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF]], which claimed 19 aerial victories over Vichy French aircraft during June and July 1941, for the loss of one P-40 (as well as one lost to ground fire).<ref>Brown 1983, p. 17.</ref>
[[Image:P03372.011 kittybomber.jpg|thumb|left|North Africa, c. 1943. A P-40 "Kittybomber" of [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF]], loaded with six {{convert|250|lb|abbr=on}} bombs]]

Some DAF units initially failed to use the P-40's strengths and/or utilised outdated defensive tactics such as the [[Lufbery circle]]. However, the superior climb rate of the Bf 109 enabled fast, swooping attacks, neutralizing the advantages offered by conventional defensive tactics. Various new formations were tried by Tomahawk units in 1941-42, including: "fluid pairs" (similar to the German ''rotte''); [[Thach Weave|one or two "weavers"]] at the back of a squadron in formation, and whole squadrons bobbing and weaving in loose formations.<ref name= "Brown P. 26-29">Brown 1983, pp. 28–29.</ref> [[Werner Schröer]], who was credited with destroying 114 Allied aircraft in only 197 combat missions, referred to the latter formation as "bunches of grapes", because he found them so easy to pick off.<ref name= "Brown P. 26-29"/> The leading German ''expert'' in North Africa, [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]], [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|claimed]] as many as 101 P-40s during his career.<ref name="wwii_ace_stories_marseille">Ratuszynski, Wilhelm. [http://www.elknet.pl/acestory/aces.htm "Hans-Joachim Marseille: Desert Eagle."] ''World War II Ace Stories''. Retrieved: 8 March 1999.</ref>

From 26 May 1942, all Kittyhawk units operated primarily as fighter-bomber units,<ref>Brown 1983, pp. 257–258.</ref> giving rise to the nickname "Kittybomber". As a result of this change in role, and because DAF P-40 squadrons were frequently used in bomber escort and close air support missions, they suffered relatively high attrition rates; many Desert Air Force P-40 pilots were caught flying low and slow by marauding Bf 109s.

The [[Flying Tigers]], known officially as the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG), were a unit of the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]], recruited from U.S. aviators. From late 1941, the P-40B was used by the Flying Tigers. They were divided into three pursuit squadrons, the "Adam & Eves", the "Panda Bears" and the "Hell's Angels".<ref name=tiger1>Rossi, J.R.

Compared to opposing Japanese fighters, the P-40B's strengths were that it was sturdy, well armed, faster in a dive and possessed an excellent rate of roll. While the P-40s could not match the maneuverability of the Japanese Army air arm's [[Nakajima Ki-27]]s and [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43s]], nor the much more famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero naval fighter]] in a slow speed turning dogfight, at higher speeds the P-40s were more than a match. AVG leader [[Claire Chennault]] trained his pilots to use the P-40's particular performance advantages.<ref name=tiger1/> The P-40 had a higher dive speed than any Japanese fighter aircraft of the early war years, for example, and could be used to exploit so-called "boom-and-zoom" tactics. The AVG was highly successful, and its feats were widely published, to boost sagging public morale at home, by an active cadre of international journalists. According to their official records, in just 6 1/2 months, the Flying Tigers destroyed 115 enemy aircraft for the loss of just four of their own in air-to-air combat.

A total of 15 entire USAAF pursuit/fighter [[group (air force unit)|group]]s (FG), along with other pursuit/fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s and a few [[tactical reconnaissance]] (TR) units, operated the P-40 during 1941–45.<ref name="P40CBI"/><ref name="P40MTO2"/><ref name = "P40PTO"/>

As was also the case with the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]], many USAAF officers considered the P-40 inadequate, and it was gradually replaced by the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and the [[North American P-51 Mustang]]. However, the bulk of the fighter operations by the USAAF in 1942–43 were borne by the P-40 and the P-39. In the Pacific, these two fighters, along with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy's]] [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]], contributed more than any other U.S. types to breaking Japanese air power during this critical period.

====Pacific theaters====
[[Image:P-40-flightline-201024.jpg|thumb|right| By mid-1943, the USAAF was phasing out the P-40F (pictured); the two nearest aircraft, "White 116" and "White 111" were flown by the aces 1Lt Henry E. Matson and 1Lt Jack Bade, 44th FS, at the time part of [[AirSols]], on [[Guadalcanal]].]]

The P-40 was the main USAAF fighter aircraft in the [[South West Pacific theater of World War II|South West Pacific]] and [[Pacific Ocean Area|Pacific Ocean theater]]s during 1941–42.

Due to aircraft fatigue, scarcity of spare parts and replacement problems, the US [[Fifth Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] created a joint P-40 management and replacement pool on 30 July 1942 and many P-40s went back and forth between the air forces.<ref>Birkett, Gordon.

The [[49th Fighter Group]] was in action in the Pacific from the beginning of the war. [[Robert DeHaven]] scored 10 kills (of 14 overall) in the P-40 with the 49th FG. He compared the P-40 favorably with the P-38:
:"If you flew wisely, the P-40 was a very capable aircraft. [It] could outturn a P-38, a fact that some pilots didn't realise when they made the transition between the two aircraft. [...] The real problem with it was lack of range. As we pushed the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly left out of the war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [believe] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 would allow us to reach the enemy. I was a fighter pilot and that was what I was supposed to do."<ref name="Acepilots">[http://www.acepilots.com/usaaf_pto_aces.html#DeHaven "PTO/CBI Pilots of WWII".] ''Acepilots.com'', 2005. Retrieved: 7 March 2006.</ref>

The 8th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 49th, 343rd and 347th PGs/FGs, flew P-40s in the Pacific theaters between 1941 and 1945, with most units converting to P-38s during 1943-44. In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed [[forward air controllers]] during ground operations in the Philippines until it received delivery of P-51s.<ref name="P40PTO"/> They claimed 655 aerial victories.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, with sufficient altitude the P-40 could actually turn with the A6M and other Japanese fighters, using a combination of a nose-down vertical turn with a bank turn, a technique known as a [[low yo-yo]]. Robert DeHaven describes how this tactic was used in the 49th Fighter group:
:[Y]ou could fight a Jap on even terms, but you had to make him fight your way. He could outturn you at slow speed. You could outturn him at high speed. When you got into a turning fight with him, you dropped your nose down so you kept your airspeed up, you could outturn him. At low speed he could outroll you because of those big ailerons ... on the Zero. If your speed was up over 275, you could outroll [a Zero]. His big ailerons didn't have the strength to make high speed rolls... You could push things, too. Because ... [i]f you decided to go home, you could go home. He couldn't because you could outrun him. [...] That left you in control of the fight.

====China Burma India Theater====
USAAF and Chinese P-40 pilots performed well in this theater, scoring high [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|kill ratios]] against Japanese types such as the Ki-43, [[Nakajima Ki-44]] "Tojo" and the Zero. The P-40 remained in use in the [[China Burma India Theater]] (CBI) until 1944, and was reportedly preferred over the P-51 Mustang by some US pilots flying in China.

The American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) was integrated into the USAAF as the [[23rd Fighter Group]] in June 1942. The unit continued to fly newer model P-40s until the end of the war, racking up a high kill-to-loss ratio.<ref name="P40CBI"/><ref name="23FG">Pike, John. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/23fg.htm  "23rd Fighter Group Official Website."] ''GlobalSecurity'', 21 August 2005. Retrieved: 5 September 2006.</ref>

Units arriving in the CBI after the AVG in the 10th and 14th Air Forces continued to perform well with the P-40, [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories|claiming]] 973 kills in the theater, or 64.8 percent of all enemy aircraft shot down. Aviation historian Carl Molesworth stated that "...the P-40 simply dominated the skies over Burma and China. They were able to establish air superiority over free China, northern Burma and the Assam valley of India in 1942, and they never relinquished it."<ref name="P40CBI"/>

In addition to the 23rd FG, the 3rd, 5th, 51st and 80th FGs, along with the 10th TRS, operated the P-40 in the CBI.{{#tag:ref|Although part of the US 14th AF, the P-40s of 3rd and 5th FGs of the Chinese American Composite Wing were flown by both American and Chinese pilots.<ref name="P40CBI"/>|group=N}} In addition to its role as a fighter aircraft, CBI P-40 pilots used the aircraft very effectively as a fighter-bomber. The [[80th Flying Training Wing|80th Fighter Group]] in particular used its so-called ''B-40'' (P-40s carrying 1,000-pound high explosive bombs) to destroy Japanese-held bridges and kill bridge repair crews, sometimes demolishing their target with a single bomb.<ref>"Playing Large Part In Burma Fighting Against Japs". ''CBI Roundup'', Vol. II, No. 32, 20 April 1944.</ref> At least 40 U.S. pilots reached ace status while flying the P-40 in the CBI.

====Europe and Mediterranean theaters====
[[Image:Curtiss P-40 Warhawk USAF.JPG|thumb|Top to Bottom: P-40 F/L, P-40K Warhawk]]
On 14 August 1942, the first confirmed victory by a USAAF unit over a German aircraft in World War II was achieved by a P-40C pilot. 2nd Lt Joseph D. Shaffer, of the 33rd Fighter Squadron, intercepted a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]]C-3 maritime patrol plane that overflew his base at [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. Shaffer damaged the Fw 200, which was finished off by a P-38F.

Warhawks were used extensively in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTO) by USAAF units, including the [[33d Operations Group|33rd]], [[57th Operations Group|57th]], [[58th Operations Group|58th]], [[79th Fighter Group|79th]], [[324th Fighter Group|324th]] and [[325th Operations Group|325th Fighter Group]]s.<ref name="P40MTO2">Molesworth 2002</ref>

While the P-40 suffered heavy loses in the MTO, many USAAF P-40 units achieved high kill-to-loss ratios against Axis aircraft. For example, the 324th FG scored better than a 2:1 ratio in the MTO.<ref name="Flying">Higham 2004, pp. 3–4.</ref> In all, 23 U.S. pilots became aces in the MTO while flying the P-40, most of them during the first half of 1943.<ref name = "P40MTO2"/> As in the Pacific, success in combat depended in part on experience and effective tactics.

Individual pilots from the 57th FG were the first USAAF P-40 pilots to see action in the MTO, while attached to Desert Air Force Kittyhawk squadrons, from July 1942. The 57th was also the main unit involved in the "Palm Sunday Massacre", on 18 April 1943. De-coded [[Ultra (World War II intelligence)|Ultra]] signals had given away a plan for a large formation of German [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports to cross the Mediterranean, escorted by German and Italian fighters. Between 1630 and 1830 hours, all wings of the Group were engaged in an intensive effort against the enemy air transports. Of the four Kittyhawk Wings, three had left the patrol area before a convoy of a 100+ enemy transports were sighted by 57 Group, who tallied 74 aircraft destroyed. 57 Group was last in the area, and intercepted the Ju 52s escorted by large numbers of Bf 109s, Bf 110s and [[Macchi C.202]]s. In all, they claimed 58 Ju 52s, 14 Bf 109s and two Bf 110s destroyed with a number of others probably destroyed and damaged. Between 20–40 of the E/A landed on the beaches around [[Cap Bon]] to avoid being shot down. Six Allied fighters were lost, five of them P-40s.

On 22 April, in [[Operation Flax]], a similar force of P-40s attacked a formation of 14 [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] ''Gigant'' ("Giant") six-engine transports, covered by seven Bf 109s from II./JG 27. All the transports were shot down, for a loss of three P-40s destroyed. The 57th FG was equipped with the Curtiss fighter until early 1944, during which time they were credited with at least 140 air-to-air kills.<ref name= "Weal p. 91">Weal 2003, p. 91.</ref>

In early 1943, 75 P-40Ls were transported on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|6}}. On 23 February, during [[Operation Torch]], the pilots of the 58th FG flew these P-40s off ''Ranger'' to land at newly captured Vichy French airfield, Cazas, near [[Casablanca]], in [[French Morocco]]. The aircraft resupplied the 33rd FG and the pilots were reassigned.<ref>USAAF General Orders; USAAF History of the 58th FG. [Sic. These need checking.]</ref>

The 325th FG (known as the "Checkertail Clan") flew P-40s in the MTO. The 325th was credited with at least 133 air-to-air kills in April–October 1943, of which 95 were Bf 109s and 26 were Macchi C.202s, for the loss of 17 P-40s in combat.<ref name="P40MTO2"/><ref name="325MTO2">Cathcart, Carol.

A famous [[African-American]] unit, the [[Tuskegee Airmen|99th FS]], better known as the "Tuskegee Airmen" or "Redtails", flew P-40s in stateside training and for their initial eight months in the MTO. On 9 June 1943, they became the first African-American fighter pilots to engage enemy aircraft, over [[Pantelleria]], Italy. A single [[Focke Wulf Fw 190]] was reported damaged by Lieutenant Willie Ashley Jr. On 2 July the squadron claimed its first verified kill; a Fw 190 destroyed by Captain Charles Hall. The 99th continued to score with P-40s until February 1944, when they were assigned P-39s.<ref>[http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1356 "Tuskegee Airmen."] ''National Museum of the USAF''.

The much-lightened P-40L was most heavily used in the MTO, primarily by U.S. pilots. Many US pilots stripped down their P-40s even further to improve performance, often removing two or more of the wing guns from the P-40F/L.

===Royal Australian Air Force===
[[Image:AWM 026647 P-40 Milne.jpg|thumb|right|A P-40E-1 piloted by the ace [[Keith Truscott|Keith "Bluey" Truscott]], commander of [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF]], taxis along [[Marsden Matting]] at [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]] in September 1942.]]
The Kittyhawk was the main fighter used by the RAAF in World War II, in greater numbers than the Spitfire. Two RAAF squadrons serving with the Desert Air Force, [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3]] and [[No. 450 Squadron RAAF|No. 450 Squadron]]s, were the first Australian units to be assigned P-40s. Other RAAF pilots served with RAF or SAAF P-40 squadrons in the theater.

Many RAAF pilots achieved high scores in the P-40. At least five reached "double ace" status: Clive Caldwell, [[Nicky Barr]], [[John Lloyd Waddy|John Waddy]], [[Bob Whittle]] (11 kills each) and [[Bobby Gibbes]] (10 kills) in the Middle East, North African and/or [[New Guinea campaign]]s. In all, 18 RAAF pilots became aces while flying P-40s.<ref name="P40RAF"/>

Nicky Barr, like many Australian pilots, considered the P-40 a reliable mount: "The Kittyhawk became, to me, a friend. It was quite capable of getting you out of trouble more often than not. It was a real warhorse."<ref name="Nicky Barr quiet Soldier">Barr, Nicky. [http://www.abc.net.au/austory/transcripts/s513633.htm  "Interview Transcript."] ''ABC Australia''. Retrieved: 8 November 2007.</ref>

At the same time as the heaviest fighting in North Africa, the [[Pacific War]] was also in its early stages, and RAAF units in Australia were completely lacking in suitable fighter aircraft. Spitfire production was being absorbed by the war in Europe; P-38s were trialled, but were difficult to obtain; Mustangs had not yet reached squadrons anywhere, and Australia's tiny and inexperienced aircraft industry was geared towards larger aircraft. USAAF P-40s and their pilots originally intended for the [[United States Far East Air Force|U.S. Far East Air Force]] in the Philippines, but diverted to Australia as a result of Japanese naval activity were the first suitable fighter aircraft to arrive in substantial numbers. By mid-1942, the RAAF was able to obtain some USAAF replacement shipments; the P-40 was given the RAAF designation A-29.

RAAF Kittyhawks played a crucial role in the [[South West Pacific theater of World War II|South West Pacific theater]]. They fought on the front line as fighters during the critical early years of the Pacific War, and the durability and bomb-carrying abilities (1,000&nbsp;lb/454&nbsp;kg) of the P-40 also made it ideal for the ground attack role. For example, [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|75]], and [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76]] Squadrons played a critical role during the [[Battle of Milne Bay]],<ref>[http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/asfaras/milnebay.html "Australia's War 1939-1945".] ''Official Australian Government, Department of Veterans Affairs''. Retrieved: 8 January 2007.</ref><ref>Pentland 1974, pp. 27–39.</ref> fending off Japanese aircraft and providing effective close air support for the Australian infantry, negating the initial Japanese advantage in light tanks and sea power.

The RAAF units that most used Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific were: 75, 76, [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77]], [[No. 78 Squadron RAAF|78]], [[No. 80 Squadron RAAF|80]], [[No. 82 Squadron RAAF|82]], [[No. 84 Squadron RAAF|84]] and [[No. 86 Squadron RAAF|86]] Squadrons. These squadrons saw action mostly in the New Guinea and [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Borneo campaigns]].

Late in 1945, RAAF fighter squadrons in the South West Pacific began converting to P-51Ds. However, Kittyhawks were in use with the RAAF until the end of the war, in Borneo. In all, the RAAF acquired 841 Kittyhawks (not counting the British-ordered examples used in North Africa), including 163 P-40E, 42 P-40K, 90 P-40 M and 553 P-40N models.<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/RAAF/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A29.htm RAAF Museum, 2007, "A29 Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk."] ''defence.gov.au''. Retrieved: 1 August 2007.</ref> In addition, the RAAF ordered 67 Kittyhawks for use by [[No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron]] (a joint Australian-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] unit in the South West Pacific). The P-40 was retired by the RAAF in 1947.

===Royal Canadian Air Force===
A total of 13 [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] units operated the P-40 in the North West European or Alaskan theaters.

In mid-May 1940, Canadian and US officers watched comparative tests of a XP-40 and a Spitfire, at [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|RCAF Uplands]], Ottawa. While the Spitfire was considered to have performed better, it was not available for use in Canada and the P-40 was ordered to meet home air defense requirements. In all, eight Home War Establishment Squadrons were equipped with the Kittyhawk: 72 Kittyhawk I, 12 Kittyhawk Ia, 15 Kittyhawk III and 35 Kittyhawk IV aircraft, for a total of 134 aircraft. These aircraft were mostly diverted from RAF Lend-Lease orders for service in Canada. The P-40 Kittyhawks were obtained in lieu of 144 P-39 Airacobras originally allocated to Canada but reassigned to the RAF.

However, before any home units received the P-40, three RCAF [[Article XV squadron]]s operated Tomahawk aircraft from bases in the United Kingdom. No. 403 Squadron RCAF, a fighter unit, used the Tomahawk Mk II briefly before converting to Spitfires. Two [[Close air support|Army Co-operation]] (close air support) squadrons: 400 and 414 Sqns trained with Tomahawks, before converting to Mustang Mk. I aircraft and a fighter/reconnaissance role. Of these, only No. 400 Squadron used Tomahawks operationally, conducting a number of armed sweeps over France in the late 1941. RCAF pilots also flew Tomahawks or Kittyhawks with other British Commonwealth units based in North Africa, the Mediterranean, South East Asia and (in at least one case) the South West Pacific.{{#tag:ref|After being evacuated from Singapore to Australia in 1942, F/L Thomas W.

In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupied two islands]], [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], in the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutians]], off [[Alaska]]. RCAF home defense P-40 squadrons saw combat over the Aleutians, assisting the USAAF. The RCAF initially sent 111 Squadron, flying the Kittyhawk I, to the US base on [[Adak Airport|Adak]] island. During the drawn-out campaign, 12 Canadian Kittyhawks operated on a rotational basis from a new, more advanced base on [[Amchitka]],{{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Kiska]]. 14 and 111 Sqns took "turn-about" at the base. During a major attack on Japanese positions at Kiska on 25 September 1942, Squadron Leader [[Ken Boomer]] shot down a [[Nakajima A6M2-N]] ("Rufe") seaplane. The RCAF also purchased 12 P-40Ks directly from the USAAF while in the Aleutians. After the Japanese threat diminished, these two RCAF squadrons returned to Canada and eventually transferred to England without their Kittyhawks.

In January 1943, a further Article XV unit, 430 Squadron was formed at [[RAF Hartford Bridge]], England and trained on obsolete Tomahawk IIA.<ref>[http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/1w-1e/sqns-escs/page-eng.asp?id=394 Canadian Forces, "430 Squadron &ndash; History."] ''airforce.forces.gc''.

In early 1945 pilots from No. 133 Squadron RCAF, operating the P-40N out of [[Victoria International Airport|RCAF Patricia Bay]], (Victoria, BC), intercepted and destroyed two Japanese [[fire balloon|balloon-bomb]]s,<ref name="Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks of the RCAF"/> which were designed to cause wildfires on the North American mainland. On 21 February, Pilot Officer E. E. Maxwell shot down a balloon, which landed on [[Sumas Mountain]] in Washington State. On 10 March, Pilot Officer J. 0. Patten destroyed a balloon near [[Saltspring Island]], BC. The last interception took place on 20 April 1945 when Pilot Officer P.V. Brodeur from 135 Squadron out of [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]] shot down a balloon over Vedder Mountain.<ref>Coyle 2002, pp. 214–215.</ref>

The "Wildcat" emblem was applied by a US unit that previously used the aircraft. Fisken kept it, while adding "[[Wairarapa]]", after his home region.]]
Some [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) pilots and New Zealanders in other air forces flew British P-40s while serving with DAF squadrons in North Africa and Italy, including the ace [[Jerry Westenra]].

A total of 301 P-40s were allocated to the RNZAF under [[Lend-Lease]], for use in the Pacific Theater, although four of these were lost in transit. The aircraft equipped [[14 Squadron RNZAF|14 Squadron]], [[No. 15 Squadron RNZAF|15 Squadron]], [[No. 16 Squadron RNZAF|16 Squadron]], [[No. 17 Squadron RNZAF|17 Squadron]], [[No. 18 Squadron RNZAF|18 Squadron]], [[No. 19 Squadron RNZAF|19 Squadron]] and [[No. 20 Squadron RNZAF|20 Squadron]].

RNZAF P-40 squadrons were successful in air combat against the Japanese between 1942 and 1944. Their pilots claimed 100 aerial victories in P-40s, whilst losing 20 aircraft in combat{{#tag:ref|In total, the RNZAF claimed 106 victories in the Pacific: three by [[No. 488 Squadron RNZAF|488(NZ) Sqn]] in [[Singapore]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]] (all confirmed), three by [[Lockheed Hudson]]s (one confirmed) and the remaining 102 by P-40 pilots.

The overwhelming majority of RNZAF P-40 victories were scored against Japanese fighters, mostly Zeroes. Other victories included [[Aichi D3A]] "Val" dive bombers. The only confirmed twin engine claim, a [[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Ki-21]] "Sally" (misidentified as a [[Mitsubishi G4M|G4M]] "Betty") fell to Fisken in July 1943.<ref name= "Chris Rudge 2003"/>

From late 1943 and 1944, RNZAF P-40s were increasingly used against ground targets, including the innovative use of naval depth charges as improvised high-capacity bombs. The last front line RNZAF P-40s were replaced by [[Vought F4U Corsair]]s in 1944. The P-40s were relegated to use as advanced pilot trainers.<ref>Horn 1992</ref><ref>Mossong, Peter.

The remaining RNZAF P-40s, excluding the 20 shot down and 154 written off, were mostly scrapped at [[Hamilton International Airport|Rukuhia]] in 1948.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet ''[[Soviet Air Forces|Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily]]'' (VVS; "Military Air Forces") and ''[[Soviet Naval Aviation|Morskaya Aviatsiya]]'' (MA; "Naval Air Service") also referred to P-40s as "Tomahawks" and "Kittyhawks". In fact, the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk / Kittyhawk was the first Allied fighter supplied to the USSR under the Lend-Lease agreement.<ref name="Gordon p. 435">Gordon 2008, p. 435.</ref>
The Soviet units received 247 P-40B/Cs (equivalent to the Tomahawk IIA/B in RAF service) and 2,178 P-40E, -K, -L, and -N models between 1941 and 1944.<ref name="Romanenko"/> The Tomahawks were shipped from Great Britain and directly from the US, many of them arriving incomplete, lacking machine guns and even the lower half of the engine cowling. In late September 1941, the first 48 P-40s were assembled and checked in USSR.<ref name="Gordon pp. 436-437">Gordon 2008, pp 436-437.</ref> Test flights showed some manufacturing defects: generator and oil pump gears and generator shafts failed repeatedly, which led to emergency landings. The test report indicated that the Tomahawk was inferior to Soviet "M-105P-powered production fighters in speed and rate of climb. However, it had good short field performance, horizontal manoeuvrability, range and endurance."<ref name="Gordon p. 437">Gordon 2008, p. 437.</ref>
Nevertheless, Tomahawks and Kittyhawks were used against the Germans. The 126th IAP fighting on the Western and Kalinin fronts were the first unit to receive the P-40. The regiment entered action on 12 October 1941. By 15 November 1941, that unit had shot down 17 German aircraft. However, Lt (SG) Smirnov noted that the P-40 armament was sufficient for strafing enemy lines but rather ineffective in aerial combat. Another pilot, S.G. Ridnyy (Hero of Soviet Union), remarked that he had to shoot half the ammunition at 50–100 meters (164–339&nbsp;ft) to shoot down an enemy aircraft.<ref name="Gordon p. 437"/>

[[Image:P-40 B Tomahawk NMNA.jpg|thumb|left|Hawk 81A-3/Tomahawk IIb ''AK255'', at the U.S. [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]], is shown in the colors of the Flying Tigers, but never actually served with them; it began life with the RAF and was later transferred to the Soviet Union.]]
In January 1942, some 198 aircraft sorties were flown (334 flying hours) and 11 aerial engagements were conducted, in which five Bf 109s, one Ju 88, and one He 111 were downed. These statistics reveal a surprising fact: it turns out that the Tomahawk was fully capable of successful air combat with a Bf 109. The reports of pilots about the circumstances of the engagements confirm this fact. On 18 January 1942, Lieutenants S. V. Levin and I. P. Levsha (in pair) fought an engagement with seven Bf 109s and shot down two of them without loss. On 22 January, a flight of three aircraft led by Lieutenant E. E. Lozov engaged 13 enemy aircraft and shot down two Bf 109Es, again without loss. Altogether, in January, two Tomahawks were lost; one downed by German antiaircraft artillery and one lost to Messerschmitts.<ref name="Romanenko"/>

The Soviets stripped down their P-40s significantly for combat, in many cases removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40, which were superior to most of the Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: "The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armoured seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not have hand microphones but throat microphones. These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable."<ref name= "Drabkin p. 129">Drabkin 2007, p. 129.</ref> The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. <!-- statement already made; is there need to repeat it?---Tomahawks' Allison engine was regarded as "not very good but powerful as such". When pushed to full RPMs, towards maximum output, it began to "make metal dust".<ref name= "Drabkin p. 130">Drabkin 2007, p. 130.</ref>----> VVS pilots usually flew the P-40 at War Emergency Power settings while in combat, bringing the acceleration and speed performance closer to that of their German rivals, but could burn out engines in a matter of weeks.<ref name="Romanenko"/> They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines. A fair number of burnt out P-40s were re-engined with Soviet Klimov engines but these performed relatively poorly and were relegated to rear area use.<ref name="Romanenko"/>

|quote=''Actually, the P-40 could engage all Messerschmitts on equal terms, almost to the end of 1943. If you take into consideration all the characteristics of the P-40, then the Tomahawk was equal to the Bf 109F and the Kittyhawk was slightly better. Its speed and vertical and horizontal manoeuvre were good and fully competitive with enemy aircraft. Acceleration rate was a bit low, but when you got used to the engine, it was OK.

The P-40 saw the most front line use in Soviet hands in 1942 and early 1943.  Deliveries over the Alaska-Siberia [[ALSIB]] ferry route began in October 1942.  It was used in the northern sectors and played a significant role in the [[Siege of Leningrad|defense of Leningrad]]. The most numerically important types were P-40B/C, P-40E and P-40K/M. By the time the better P-40F and N types became available, production of superior Soviet fighters had increased sufficiently so that the P-40 was replaced in most Soviet Air Force units by the [[Lavochkin La-5]] and various later Yakovlev types. In spring 1943, Lt D.I. Koval of the 45th IAP gained ace status on the North-Caucasian front, shooting down six German aircraft flying a P-40. Some Soviet P-40 squadrons had good combat records. They provided close air support as well as air-to-air capability while Soviet pilots became aces on the P-40, not as many as on the P-39 Airacobra, which was the most numerous Lend Lease fighter used by the Soviet Union.<ref name="Romanenko"/> However Soviet commanders considered the Kittyhawk to significantly outclass the Hurricane, although it was "not in the same league as the Yak-1".<ref name= "Drabkin p. 130.">Drabkin 2007, p. 130.</ref><ref name="Gordon p. 437-438">Gordon 2008, pp. 437–438.</ref>

===Japan===
The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] captured some P-40s and later operated a number in [[Burma]]. The Japanese appear to have had as many as 10 flyable P-40Es.<ref>[http://www.j-aircraft.com/captured/capturedby/p40warhawk/captured_p40.htm "Japanese Captured P-40."] ''J-Aircraft.com''. Retrieved: 19 June 2010.</ref> For a brief period in 1943, a few of them were actually used operationally by 2 ''Hiko Chutai'', 50 ''Hiko Sentai'' (2nd Air Squadron, 50th Air Regiment) in the defense of [[Rangoon]]. Testimony of this is given by [[Yasuhiko Kuroe]], a member of the 64 ''Hiko Sentai''. In his memoirs, he says one Japanese-operated P-40 was shot down in error by a friendly [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] "Sally" over Rangoon.

===Other nations===
The P-40 was used by over two dozen countries during and after the war. The P-40 was used by [[Brazil]], [[Egypt]], [[Finland]] and [[Turkey]]. The last P-40s in military service, used by the [[Brazilian Air Force]] (FAB), were retired in 1958.

In the air war over Finland, several Soviet P-40s were shot down or had to crash-land due to other reasons. The Finns, short of good aircraft, collected these and managed to repair one P-40M, P-40M-10-CU 43-5925, ''white 23'', which received [[Finnish Air Force]] serial number KH-51 (KH denoting "Kittyhawk", as the British designation of this type was Kittyhawk III). This aircraft was attached to an operational squadron HLeLv 32 of the [[Finnish Air Force]], but lack of spares kept it on the ground, with the exception of a few evaluation flights.

==Variants and development stages==
[[Image:Curtiss P-40, with shark mouth paint (00910460 060).jpg|thumb|A USAAF Curtiss P-40K-10-CU, serial number 42-9985, c. 1943]]
{{See also|Curtiss P-40 variants}}
;XP-40
:The original Curtiss XP-40, ordered July 1937, was converted from the 10th P-36A by replacing the radial engine with a new Allison V-1710-19 engine. It flew for the first time in October 1938.
This new liquid-cooled engine fighter had a radiator mounted under the rear fuselage
but the prototype XP-40 was later modified and the radiator was moved forward under the engine.
;P-40
:The P-40 (Curtiss Model 81A-1) was the first production variant, 199 built.
;P-40A
:One P-40 was modified with a camera installation in the rear fuselage and re-designated P-40A.
*Revised versions of the P-40 soon followed: the '''P-40B''' or '''Tomahawk IIA''' had extra .30in&nbsp;in (7.62&nbsp;mm) U.S., or [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns in the wings and a partially protected fuel system; the '''P-40C''' or '''Tomahawk IIB''' added underbelly drop tank and bomb shackles, self-sealing fuel tanks and other minor revisions, but the extra weight did have a negative impact on aircraft performance. (All versions of the P-40 had a relatively low [[power-to-weight ratio]] compared to contemporary fighters.)
*Only a small number of '''P-40D''' or '''Kittyhawk Mk I'''s were made, less than 50. With a new, larger Allison engine, slightly narrower fuselage, redesigned canopy, and improved cockpit, the P-40D eliminated the nose-mounted .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns and instead had a pair of .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns in each wing. The distinctive chin airscoop grew larger so they could adequately cool the large Allison engine.
*Retrospective designation for a single prototype. The '''P-40A''' was a single camera-carrying aircraft.
*The '''P-40E''' or '''P-40E-1''' was similar in most respects to the P-40D, except for a slightly more powerful engine and an extra .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) gun in each wing, bringing the total to six. Some aircraft also had small underwing bomb shackles. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IA'''. The P-40E was the variant that bore the brunt of air-to-air combat by the type in the key period of early to mid 1942, for example with the first US squadrons to replace the AVG in China (the AVG was already transitioning to this type from the P-40B/C), the type used by the Australians at Milne Bay, by the New Zealand squadrons during most of their air to air combat, and by the RAF/Commonwealth in North Africa as the Kittyhawk IA.

*'''P-40F''' and '''P-40L''', which both featured [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650 Merlin]] engine in place of the normal Allison, and thus did not have the [[carburetor]] scoop on top of the nose. Performance for these models at higher altitudes was better than their Allison-engined cousins. The L in some cases also featured a fillet in front of the [[vertical stabilizer]], or a stretched fuselage to compensate for the higher torque. The P-40L was sometimes nicknamed "[[Gypsy Rose Lee]]", after a famous stripper of the era, due to its stripped-down condition. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces under the designation '''Kittyhawk Mk II''', a total of 330 Mk IIs were supplied to the RAF under Lend-Lease. The first 230 aircraft are sometimes known as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IIA'''. The P-40F/L was extensively used by U.S. fighter groups operating in the Mediterranean Theater.
*'''P-40G''' : 43 P-40 aircraft fitted with the wings of the Tomahawk Mk IIA. A total of 16 aircraft were supplied to the Soviet Union, and the rest to the US Army Air Forces. It was later redesignated '''RP-40G'''.
*'''P-40K''', an Allison-engined P-40L, with the nose-top scoop retained and the Allison-configured nose radiators scoop, cowl flaps and vertical-stabilizer-to-fuselage fillet. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk III''', it was widely used by US units in the CBI.
*'''P-40M''', version generally similar to the P-40K, with a stretched fuselage like the P-40L and powered by an Allison V-1710-81 engine giving better performance at altitude (compared to previous Allison versions). It had some detail improvements and it was characterized by two small air scoops just before the exhaust pipes. Most of them were supplied to Allied countries (mainly UK and USSR), while some others remained in the USA for advanced training. It was also supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk. III'''.
*'''P-40N''' (manufactured 1943–44), the final production model. The P-40N featured a stretched rear fuselage to counter the torque of the larger, late-war Allison engine, and the rear deck of the cockpit behind the pilot was cut down at a moderate slant to improve rearward visibility. A great deal of work was also done to try and eliminate excess weight to improve the Warhawk's climb rate. Early N production blocks dropped a .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) gun from each wing, bringing the total back to four; later production blocks reintroduced it after complaints from units in the field. Supplied to Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IV'''. A total of 553 P-40Ns were acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the variant most commonly used by the RAAF. Subvariants of the P-40N ranged widely in specialization from stripped down four-gun "hot rods" that could reach the highest top speeds of any production variant of the P-40 (up to 380&nbsp;mph), to overweight types with all the extras intended for fighter-bombing or even training missions. The 15,000th P-40 was an N model decorated with the markings of 28 nations that had employed any of Curtiss-Wright's various aircraft products, not just P-40s. "These spectacular markings gave rise to the erroneous belief that the P-40 series had been used by all 28 countries."<ref>McDowell 1968, p. 68.</ref>
[[Image:Curtiss P-40N.jpg|thumb|right|Curtiss P-40N Warhawk "Little Jeanne" in flight]]
*'''P-40P''' : The designation of 1,500 aircraft ordered with V-1650-1 engines, but actually built as the P-40N with V-1710-81 engines.
*'''XP-40Q''' with a 4-bladed prop, cut-down rear fuselage and [[bubble canopy]], supercharger, squared-off wingtips and tail surfaces, and improved engine with two-speed supercharger was tested, but its performance was not enough of an improvement to merit production when compared to the contemporary late model '''P-47D'''s and '''P-51D'''s pouring off production lines. The XP-40Q was, however, the fastest of the P-40 series with a top speed of {{convert|422|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} as a result of the introduction of a high-altitude supercharger gear. (No P-40 model with a single-speed supercharger could even approach {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}) With the end of hostilities in Europe, the P-40 came to the end of its front line service.
*'''P-40R''' : The designation of P-40F and P-40L aircraft, converted into training aircraft in 1944.
*'''RP-40''' : Some American P-40s were converted into reconnaissance aircraft.
*'''TP-40''' : Some P-40s were converted into two-seat trainers.
*'''Twin P-40''' : Probably the most unusual variant, it was a P-40C outfitted in 1942 with a pair of 1,300&nbsp;hp (969&nbsp;kW) [[Packard V-1650|Packard V-1650-1 Merlin]] engines mounted atop the wings, over the main landing gear.<ref>Donald 1997, p. 291.</ref>
