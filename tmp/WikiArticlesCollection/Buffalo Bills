The '''Buffalo Bills''' are a professional [[American football|football]] team based in [[Orchard Park, New York]]. They are members of the [[AFC East|East Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The Bills are the only team to win four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|conference championships]], and are the only NFL team to play in four consecutive [[Super Bowl]] games, all of which they lost. They have only had one owner, [[Ralph Wilson]], in their fifty-three years of existence. They have also featured many of the League's most prominent and popular players, including [[Jack Kemp]], [[Cookie Gilchrist]], [[Bob Kalsu]], [[O.J. Simpson]], [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Thurman Thomas]], and [[Andre Reed]].

Since 1972, the Bills have played home games at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in the Buffalo suburb of [[Orchard Park (town), New York|Orchard Park]]. The Bills are the only NFL team to play their home games within [[New York]] state. (Both the [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] play in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]].) Since the [[2008 NFL season]] the Bills have played one regular season home game per season in [[Toronto]] as part of the [[Bills Toronto Series]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Five-year extension of Buffalo Bills' Toronto series approved|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82943e05/article/fiveyear-extension-of-buffalo-bills-toronto-series-approved|work=NFL.com|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> The Bills conduct summer training camp at [[St. John Fisher College]] in [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford, New York]], an eastern suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalobills.com/team/training-camp/index.html |title=Training Camp |publisher=Buffalobills.com |date= |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> In January 2013, [[Doug Marrone]] agreed to become the next head coach of the Bills.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bills hire Syracuse's Doug Marrone|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/bills/2013/01/06/buffalo-bills-hire-syracuse-coach-doug-marrone/1811827/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref> The Bills currently have the longest playoff drought in the NFL, having not appeared since 1999, and the longest active streak of losing seasons, having not finished .500 or better since 2004.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Buffalo Bills}}
{{Main|List of Buffalo Bills seasons}}

The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/stats/franchises.aspx |title=History: History of NFL franchises, 1920–present |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref> The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in [[1964 American Football League Championship Game|1964]] and [[1965 American Football League Championship Game|1965]], but the club has not won a league championship since then.

Once the [[AFL–NFL merger]] took effect, the Bills became the second NFL team to represent the city; they followed the [[Buffalo All-Americans]], a charter member of the league. Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the [[Buffalo Indians|Indians/Tigers]] of the early 1940s and another team named the Bills in the late 1940s.

The Bills were named as the result of the winning entry in a local contest by Michael Doucas (son of legendary NFL star Sam Davies), which named the team after the [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|AAFC Buffalo Bills]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Buffalo Bills History|url=http://www.history.buffalobills.com/Buffalo+Bills+History|work=BuffaloBills.com|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> a previous football franchise from the [[All-America Football Conference]] that merged with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in 1950. That team was named after a male bison or "Billy". The name was chosen from a contest that was won by Bill Keenan. The similarity to famous Wild West showman [[Buffalo Bill Cody]], while used as a play on words in the previous Bills team's iconography, is not (nor has it ever been) used by the current team. The Bills' cheerleaders are known as the [[Buffalo Jills]]. The official mascot is [[Billy Buffalo]].

[[Image:AFCE-Uniform-jersey pants combination-BUF.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Buffalo Bills uniform 2002–2010]]

The Bills' uniforms in its first two seasons were based on those of the [[Detroit Lions]] at the time.<ref name="gwarnerbuffnews">[http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130408/CITYANDREGION/130409304/1082 Warner, Gene. "Bills logo was artist's crowning achievement," ''The Buffalo'' (NY) ''News'', Tuesday, April 9, 2013.]</ref>

In [[1962 Buffalo Bills season|1962]], the standing red bison was designated as the logo and took its place on a white helmet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hometown.aol.com/bkbubco/60-Buf.html |title=Elbert Dubenion – 1960 |publisher=Hometown.aol.com |date= |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}{{Verify credibility|date=December 2010}}</ref> In 1962, the team's colors also changed to red, white, and blue. The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white stripes on the shoulders. the helmets were white with a red center stripe.<ref>http://hometown.aol.com/bkbubco/62-Buf.html{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> The jerseys again saw a change in [[1964 Buffalo Bills season|1964]] when the shoulders stripes were replaced by a distinctive stripe pattern on the sleeves consisting of four stripes, two thicker inner stripes and two thinner outer stripes all bordered by red piping. By [[1965 Buffalo Bills season|1965]], red and blue center stripes were put on the helmets.<ref>[http://hometown.aol.com/bkbubco/65-Buf.html Billy Shaw & Tom Sestak – 1965]{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

The Bills introduced blue pants worn with the white jerseys in [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|1973]], the last year of the standing buffalo helmet. The blue pants remained through [[1985 Buffalo Bills season|1985]]. The face mask on the helmet was blue from [[1974 Buffalo Bills season|1974]] through [[1986 Buffalo Bills season|1986]] before changing to white.

The standing bison logo was replaced by a blue charging one with a red slanting stripe streaming from its horn. The newer emblem, which is still the primary one used by the franchise, was designed by [[Howard University]] art major John Dupri in 1968 for the university, but failed to copyright his work and the Bills took the logo and copyrighted it for the 1974 season http://www.thehilltoponline.com/sports/taking-a-look-back-at-the-bison-1.463358#.Uiu_ecaUSbY

Another account has the current charging buffalo designed by aerospace designer Stevens Wright http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9682706/uni-watch-remembering-stevens-wright-created-buffalo-bills-logo-much-more

In [[1984 Buffalo Bills season|1984]], the helmet's background color was changed from white to red, primarily to help Bills quarterback [[Joe Ferguson]] distinguish them more readily from three of their division rivals at that time, the [[Indianapolis Colts]], the [[Miami Dolphins]], and the [[New England Patriots]], who all also wore white helmets at that point. Ferguson said that "Everyone we played had white helmets at that time. Our new head coach Kay Stephenson just wanted to get more of a contrast on the field that may help spot a receiver down the field."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-2/Untold-uniform-stories-Fergie-behind-helmet-color-change/363e8e60-8573-42ac-8f4a-2bb56169e127 | title=Untold uniform stories: Fergie behind helmet color change | publisher=Buffalo Bills | accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref> (The Patriots now use a silver helmet, the Colts have since been realigned to the [[AFC South]], and the [[New York Jets]], who switched to green helmets after the [[1978 New York Jets season|1978 season]], have since switched back to white helmets.)

In [[2002 Buffalo Bills season|2002]], under the direction of general manager [[Tom Donahoe]], the Bills' uniforms went through radical changes. A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers.  The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized "B" consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974—a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball—remained unchanged.

In [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|2005]], the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.

The Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms. They stopped wearing blue-on-white after [[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]], while the white-on-blue was not worn after [[2007 Buffalo Bills season|2007]].

For the [[2011 Buffalo Bills season|2011 season]], the Bills unveiled a new uniform design, an updated rendition of the 1975–83 design.  This change includes a return to the white helmets with "charging buffalo" logo, and a return to [[royal blue]] instead of [[Navy blue|navy]].

Buffalo sporadically wore white at home in the 1980s, but stopped doing so before their Super Bowl years. On November 6, 2011, against the New York Jets, the Bills wore white at home for the first time since [[1986 Buffalo Bills season|1986]] and did it again on November 15, 2012, against the Miami Dolphins. Buffalo has wore white twice during the 2013 season. First on September 15, 2013, against the Carolina Panthers, and again on November 3, 2013, against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The only number officially retired is the #12 worn by Kelly, although the Bills have other numbers no longer issued to any player or in reduced circulation:<ref name=reduced/>

;'''Unofficially retired:'''
*32 [[O.J. Simpson]], [[Running back|RB]], 1969–77
*34 [[Thurman Thomas]], [[Running back|RB]], 1988–99; previously worn by Cookie Gilchrist, [[Running back|RB]], 1962–64
*78 [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]], [[Defensive end|DE]], 1985–99 ''(although guard [[Ruben Brown]] used 78 as his practice jersey; he wore 79 on the field)''

;'''Reduced circulation:'''<ref name=reduced>Brown, Chris (June 17, 2011). [http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-2/The-untouchable-numbers/d99eac04-f960-4a5d-b9e8-f67b1b1c971f The untouchable numbers]. ''BuffaloBills.com''. Retrieved June 17, 2011.</ref>
*15 [[Jack Kemp]], [[Quarterback|QB]], 1962–69
*44 [[Elbert Dubenion]], WR, 1960–68
*66 [[Billy Shaw]], OG, 1961–69
*83 [[Andre Reed]], WR, 1985–99 ''([[Lee Evans III]] wore #83 by special permission)''
*94, see below

Since the earliest days of the team, the number 31 was not supposed to be issued to any other player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' The tradition was broken in 1969 when reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] was issued number 31 for one game while his normal number 36 jersey was repaired by equipment manager Tony Marchitte. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice James (J.D.) Williams wore it for his first two seasons. The number has since been released for use by any player and is currently being worn by starting free safety [[Jairus Byrd]]. Byrd had used number 32 in college, but switched to 31 because the team does not issue Simpson's former number 32.<ref name=reduced/>

Number 94 is also in reduced circulation, and for reasons unknown went unissued until the 1987 season, when two [[replacement player]]s wore the number during the players' strike that year. It has traditionally been reserved for quality defensive players; among those that have worn it include special teams standout [[Mark Pike]], defensive end [[Bryce Fisher]], defensive end [[Aaron Schobel]], and current user, defensive end [[Mario Williams]].<ref>Gaughan, Mark (May 22, 2012).

The [[Buffalo Bills Radio Network]] is currently flagshipped at [[WGR]], AM 550 in Buffalo.  [[John Murphy (announcer)|John Murphy]] is the team's current [[Sports commentary|play-by-play]] announcer; he was a [[color commentator]] alongside, and eventually succeeded, longtime voice [[Van Miller]] after Miller's retirement at the end of the [[2003 NFL season]]. [[Mark Kelso]] serves as the color analyst. The Bills radio network has approximately seventeen affiliates in [[upstate New York]] and one affiliate, [[CJCL]] 590AM (The Fan) in [[Toronto]]. As of early 2012, it is composed mostly of [[WGR]], Entercom's sister stations [[WCMF]] (96.5 FM) and [[WROC-AM]] 950 in Rochester, and a fleet of independent AM and FM stations across upstate New York from Jamestown east to Albany. Previous flagship [[Citadel Broadcasting]] was purchased by [[Cumulus Media]], who in turn ceased carrying Bills games at the end of the 2011 season, leaving the network without affiliates in Syracuse, Binghamton, and Erie. (The Syracuse affiliations were later picked up by [[Galaxy Communications]].)

Buffalo is one of ten teams that is contracted with [[Compass Media Networks]] to syndicate selected games nationwide.

During the preseason, most games are televised on Buffalo's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WKBW-TV]] channel 7, with several other affiliates in [[western New York]]. These games are simulcast on sister stations [[WTVH]] in Syracuse, [[WICU-TV|WICU]] in Erie, [[WHAM-TV]] in Rochester, and beginning in 2008, [[CITY-TV]] in Toronto.  [[Ray Bentley]], a former Bills linebacker, does play by play, while CBS analyst and former Bills special teams player [[Steve Tasker]] does color commentary on these games. WHAM-TV sports anchor [[Mike Catalana]] is the sideline reporter. Since 2008, preseason games have been broadcast in [[High-definition television|high definition]].

In the event that regular season or, should the situation arise, postseason games are broadcast by a cable outlet ([[ESPN]] or [[NFL Network]]), the Bills' local broadcast outlet since the 2012 season has been [[WBBZ-TV]], whose upstart sports department is under the supervision of former [[Empire Sports Network]] general manager [[Bob Koshinski]].

==Mascots, cheerleaders and marching band==
The Bills' official mascot is [[Billy Buffalo]], an eight-foot tall, anthropomorphic blue [[American bison]] who wears the jersey "number" BB.

The Bills' [[cheerleaders]] are known as the [[Buffalo Jills]]. The Jills are not owned by the Bills, but instead are a separate organization funded primarily by the [[Buffalo Bills Radio Network]], a subsidiary of [[Entercom]].

The Attica High School Marching Band is the official [[marching band]] of the Buffalo Bills. Along with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Washington Redskins]], the Bills are one of only three teams in the NFL to designate an official marching band. The Marching Band performs a yearly pregame. However, the Bills have also used the marching bands from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Syracuse University]] at home games in recent years.

The Bills have several theme songs associated with them. One is a variation of the Isley Brothers hit ''[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]'', which served as the Bills' official promotional song throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was officially replaced circa 2000 with "The Power of the Bills," although "Shout" remains in use. The Bills' unofficial [[fight song]], "Go Bills," was penned by Bills head coach [[Marv Levy]] in the mid-1990s on a [[friendly political wager|friendly wager]] with his players that he will write the song if the team won a particular game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-12-01/features/0611300370_1_fight-song-chicago-bears-philadelphia-eagles|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=Mooshil|first=Maria|title=10 more things to know about Bears fight song|date=December 1, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref>

In the bone-chilling winter, it is not uncommon to see shirtless fans painted with Bills decals, especially the "B-I-L-L-S" lettering.

The Bills also have a huge fan base that goes by the name "Bills Mafia", that use the [[Twitter]] symbol slightly altered to resemble the charging Buffalo.

==In popular culture==
Buffalo's rivalry with the [[Miami Dolphins]] is referenced on [[Steve Martin]]'s 1979 album [[Comedy Is Not Pretty]] on the track "How To Meet A Girl."  On the track Martin simulates chatter about football at a party and one "partier" expresses disbelief that Buffalo could beat Miami – at the time of the album's release the Dolphins had won 18 straight over the Bills.

[[Howard University]]'s mascot, the Bison, is the source of the Buffalo Bills' "charging buffalo" logo.
 
In the 2007 "[[Doctor Who]]" episode "[[The Sound of Drums]]", A man watching television, in a #12 Buffalo Bills shirt is attacked by a spherical alien.

In the 1996 ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' episode "[[Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man]]", the titular character, a member of a shadowy government cabal, states that the Buffalo Bills will not win a Super Bowl while he lives.

The Buffalo Bills were featured on the direct-to-TV movie, ''[[Second String (Film)|Second String]]'' and in the [[Vincent Gallo]] drama ''[[Buffalo 66]]''.
<!-- Tagging out trivial references.
The Bills are mentioned by rapper Gudda Gudda in a piece entitled "Break Up" along with artists Lil Wayne and Short Dogg. The lyric states "All about my Bills like Buffalo."
-->
The Buffalo Bills are mentioned in the 1995 movie ''[[Heavyweights]]''. The character Josh ([[Shaun Weiss]]) says, "Perkis caved like the Buffalo Bills in the [[Super Bowl]]", referring to their string of four straight [[Super Bowl]] losses in the early 1990s.

On the show "[[Malcolm in the Middle]]", you can spot a Buffalo Bills 'football field' rug in the boys' bedroom.

In the 1996 ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' episode S04E01, "Lord of the Flies", Clark picks up a blue Buffalo Bills hat with the Charging Buffalo emblem in the center and uses it to help disguise himself.  [[Dean Cain]], who played [[Clark Kent]]/[[Superman]], had previously tried out for the Bills.  In a later episode, he lets it be known that the Metropolis Mammoths were playing the Bills.

The Bills are one of the favorite teams of [[ESPN]] announcer [[Chris Berman]], who picked the Bills to reach the Super Bowl nearly every year in the 1990s.  Berman often uses the catchphrase "No one circles the wagons like the Buffalo Bills!" Berman gave the induction speech for Bills owner [[Ralph Wilson]] when Wilson was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2009. The Bills were also a favorite of late [[NBC]] political commentator [[Tim Russert]], a [[South Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|South Buffalo]] native, who often referred to the Bills on his Sunday morning talk show, ''[[Meet the Press]]''.  Actor [[Nick Bakay]], a Buffalo native, is also a well-known Bills fan; he has discussed the team in segments of [[NFL Top 10]].

In an April 2011 episode of the television series ''[[30 Rock]],'' [[Alec Baldwin|Alec Baldwin's]] character [[Jack Donaghy]] discovers that, in an alternate future, he would not only be wealthier and more successful, but he would also be the owner of a "New York football team."  He later is disappointed to learn that the team is not the [[New York Giants]] or [[New York Jets]], but the Buffalo Bills.

The Bills are the team that eventually unseats the Orlando Breakers, the fictional NFL team that serves as the focus of the sitcom ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'' in later seasons, in the playoffs.

In the move [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_(film)|Wind], One of Will Parker's crew member is seen wearing a Buffalo Bills hat.

Several former Buffalo Bills players have earned a name in politics after their playing careers had ended, almost always as members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The most famous of these was quarterback [[Jack Kemp]], who was elected to Congress from Western New York almost immediately after his playing career ended and remained there for nearly three decades, serving as the Republican nominee for [[Vice President of the United States]] under [[Bob Dole]] in 1996. Kemp's backup, [[Ed Rutkowski]], served as county executive of Erie County from 1979 to 1987. Former tight end [[Jay Riemersma]], defensive tackle [[Fred Smerlas]] and defensive end [[Phil Hansen (American football)|Phil Hansen]] have all run for Congress, though all three either lost or withdrew from their respective races. Quarterback [[Jim Kelly]] and running back [[Thurman Thomas]] have also both been mentioned as potential candidates for political office, although both have declined all requests to date.
