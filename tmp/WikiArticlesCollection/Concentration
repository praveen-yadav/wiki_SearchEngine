In [[chemistry]], '''concentration''' is the abundance of a constituent divided by the total volume of a mixture. Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: [[Concentration#Mass concentration|mass concentration]], [[Concentration#Molar concentration|molar concentration]], [[Concentration#Number concentration|number concentration]], and [[Concentration#Volume concentration|volume concentration]].<ref name="goldbook">{{GoldBookRef | file = C01222 | title = concentration}}</ref> The term concentration can be applied to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently it refers to [[solute]]s and solvents in [[solution]]s. The molar (amount) concentration has variants such as [[normal concentration]] and [[osmotic concentration]].

==Qualitative description==

[[Image:Dilution-concentration simple example.jpg|frame|right|These glasses containing red dye demonstrate qualitative changes in concentration. The solutions on the left are more dilute, compared to the more concentrated solutions on the right.]]

Often in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] way, through the use of adjectives such as "dilute" for solutions of relatively low concentration and "concentrated" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To '''concentrate''' a solution, one must add more [[solution|solute]] (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of [[solvent]] (for example, water). By contrast, to '''dilute''' a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are ''fully'' [[miscible]] there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]]. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when [[supersaturation]] may occur. Instead, [[Phase (matter)#Phase separation|phase separation]] will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. The point of saturation depends on many variables such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.

==Quantitative notation==

There are four quantities that describe concentration:

===Mass concentration===
{{main|Mass concentration (chemistry)}}

The mass concentration <math>\rho_i</math> is defined as the [[mass]] of a constituent <math>m_i</math> divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:

:<math>\rho_i = \frac {m_i}{V}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is kg/m<sup>3</sup>.

===Molar concentration===
{{main|Molar concentration}}

The molar concentration <math>c_i</math> is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent <math>n_i</math> divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:

:<math>c_i = \frac {n_i}{V}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is mol/m<sup>3</sup>. However, more commonly the unit mol/L (= mol/dm<sup>3</sup>) is used.

===Number concentration===
{{main|Number concentration}}

The number concentration <math>C_i</math> is defined as the number of entities of a constituent <math>N_i</math> in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture <math>V</math>:

:<math>C_i = \frac{N_i}{V}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is 1/m<sup>3</sup>.

===Volume concentration===
{{main|Volume concentration}}

The '''volume concentration''' <math>\phi_i</math> (also called '''volume fraction''') is defined as the volume of a constituent <math>V_i</math> divided by the volume of all constituents of the mixture <math>V</math> prior to mixing:

:<math>\phi_i = \frac {V_i}{V}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>.

==Related quantities==

Several other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. Note that these should '''not''' be called concentrations.<ref name="goldbook" />

===Normality===
{{main|Normality (chemistry)}}

Normality is defined as the molar concentration <math>c_i</math> divided by an equivalence factor <math>f_\mathrm{eq}</math>. Since the definition of the equivalence factor may not be unequivocal, [[IUPAC]] and [[NIST]] discourage the use of normality.

===Molality===
{{main|Molality}}
(Not to be confused with [[Molarity]])

The molality of a solution <math>b_i</math> is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent <math>n_i</math> divided by the mass of the solvent <math>m_\mathrm{solvent}</math> ('''not''' the mass of the solution):

:<math>b_i = \frac{n_i}{m_\mathrm{solvent}}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] for molality is mol/kg.

===Mole fraction===
{{main|Mole fraction}}

The mole fraction <math>x_i</math> is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent <math>n_i</math> divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture <math>n_\mathrm{tot}</math>:

:<math>x_i = \frac {n_i}{n_\mathrm{tot}}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is mol/mol. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mole fractions.

===Mole ratio===
{{main|Mixing ratio}}

The mole ratio <math>r_i</math> is defined as the [[amount of substance|amount]] of a constituent <math>n_i</math> divided by the total amount of all ''other'' constituents in a mixture:

:<math>r_i = \frac{n_i}{n_\mathrm{tot}-n_i}.</math>

If <math>n_i</math> is much smaller than <math>n_\mathrm{tot}</math>, the mole ratio is almost identical to the mole fraction.

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is mol/mol. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mole ratios.

===Mass fraction===
{{main|Mass fraction (chemistry)}}

The mass fraction <math>w_i</math> is the fraction of one substance with mass <math>m_i</math> to the mass of the total mixture <math>m_\mathrm{tot}</math>, defined as:

:<math>w_i = \frac {m_i}{m_\mathrm{tot}}.</math>

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is kg/kg. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mass fractions.

===Mass ratio===
{{main|Mixing ratio}}

The mass ratio <math>\zeta_i</math> is defined as the mass of a constituent <math>m_i</math> divided by the total mass of all ''other'' constituents in a mixture:

:<math>\zeta_i = \frac{m_i}{m_\mathrm{tot}-m_i}.</math>

If <math>m_i</math> is much smaller than <math>m_\mathrm{tot}</math>, the mass ratio is almost identical to the mass fraction.

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] is kg/kg. However, the deprecated [[parts-per notation]] is often used to describe small mass ratios.

==Dependence on volume==
Concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion.
