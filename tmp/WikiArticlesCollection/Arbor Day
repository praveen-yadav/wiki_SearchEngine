'''Arbor Day''' (from the Latin ''arbor'', meaning tree) is a [[secular holiday|holiday]] in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant and care for [[tree]]s. It originated in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]], [[United States]] by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]]. The first Arbor Day was held in the state of [[Nebraska]] on April 10, 1872; an estimated one million trees were planted that day.<ref name=history /> Today, many countries observe a similar holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on [[climate]] and suitable planting season.

== Origins ==
Birdsey Northrop of [[Connecticut]] was responsible for globalizing it when he visited Japan in 1883 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. In that same year, the [[American Forestry Association]] made Northrop the Chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to Australia, Canada and Europe.<ref name="Arbor Day">{{Citation|title=Birdsey Grant Northrop|url=http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/forestry/urban_forestry/arborday.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref>

=== McCreight and Roosevelt ===
Beginning in 1906, [[Pennsylvania]] conservationist [[Major Israel McCreight]] of [[DuBois, Pennsylvania]], argued that President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education.<ref>M.I. McCreight, Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why: A Thirty-Four Year Moratorium on Unpublished Records (1940), Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, at p.12, Hereinafter cited “Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why”.</ref> McCreight urged President Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests.  Conservationist [[Gifford Pinchot]], Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], embraced McCreight’s recommendations and asked the President to speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, Roosevelt issued an "Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=oWgjAQAAIAAJ&dq=theodore%20roosevelt%20proclamation%20to%20school%20children%201906%201907&pg=RA4-PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States]</ref> about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in U.S. schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, “we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion.”<ref>“Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why”</ref>

=== China ===
In 1981, the fourth session of the Fifth [[National People's Congress]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] adopted the Resolution on the Unfolding of a Nationwide Voluntary Tree-planting Campaign. This resolution established the Arbor Day ({{zh|s=植树节}}) and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees as the basis for workload allocation. Moreover, those failing to do their duty are expected to make up planting requirements, provide funds equivalent to the value of labor required or pay heavy fines. Therefore, the tree-planting campaign is actually compulsory{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, or at least obligatory (that is, an obligation to the community). The "voluntary" in the title referred to the fact that the tree-planters would "volunteer" their labor.

===Netherlands===
Since conference and of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s publication ''[[World Festival of Trees]]'', and a resolution of the [[United Nations]] in 1954: "The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions"; it has been adopted by the [[Netherlands]].

Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities however plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.<ref>Boomfeestdag http://www.boomfeestdag.nl/ the organisations address is Spoorlaan 444 5038 CH TILBURG</ref>

The first official celebration will take place in [[Wellington]] in August 2012, with the planting of [[pohutukawa]] and [[Norfolk pines]] along Thorndon Esplanade{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

Born in 1855, Dr [[Leonard Cockayne]] (generally recognised as the greatest botanist who has lived, worked, and died in New Zealand) worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. Even as early as the 1920s he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on '''Arbor Day'''.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on June 5, which is also [[World Environment Day]], prior to then Arbor Day, in New Zealand, was celebrated on August 4 – which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand hence the date change.

What the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] ([[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|DOC]]) does for Arbor Day:
Many of DOC's Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, [[iwi]], volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

===Taiwan===
Arbor Day (植樹節) has been a traditional [[Holidays in Taiwan|holiday]] in the '''[[Republic of China]]''' since 1927. In 1914, the founder of the [[Nanjing Agricultural University|agricultural college at Nanking University]] suggested to the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that China should imitate the practice in the United States of Arbor Day. The holiday would be held the same day as the [[Qingming Festival]]. However, for unknown reasons, the suggestion was not made through the formal process, so nothing came from this original request. After the successful conclusion of the [[Northern Expedition]], the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals formally petitioned the [[Executive Yuan]] to establish Arbor Day to commemorate the passing of [[Sun Yat-sen|Dr. Sun Yat-sen]], the Father of Modern China. He had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life, because it would increase [[Three Principles of the People|people's livelihoods]]. The Executive Yuan approved Arbor Day in the spirit of Dr. Sun that year and has since been celebrated on March 12 for this purpose.
