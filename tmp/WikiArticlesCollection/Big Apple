'''"The Big Apple"''' is a nickname for [[New York City]]. It was first popularized in the 1920s by [[John J. Fitz Gerald]], a sports writer for the ''New York Morning Telegraph''. Its popularity since the 1970s is due to a promotional campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, known now as [[NYC & Company]].

The earliest citation for "big apple" is the 1909 book ''The Wayfarer in New York'', by [[Edward Martin]], writing: "Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city…. It inclines to think that '''the big apple''' gets a disproportionate share of the national sap" (emphasis added).<ref>{{Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = Big Applesource | journal = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = September 17, 2000 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-17-00-on-language-slurvian.html?pagewanted=2}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = The Right Word in the Right Place at the Right Time | year = 2004 | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=blcCxBWVdzgC&pg=PA23&dq=big%20apple p. 23]}}</ref> [[William Safire]] considered this the coinage, but the ''Random House Dictionary of American Slang'' considers the usage "metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term", and Popik likewise does not consider this the coinage.

In the early 1920s, "apple" was used in reference to the many racing courses in and around New York City. Apple referred to the prizes being awarded for the races—as these were important races, the rewards were substantial.

''The Big Apple'' was first popularized as a reference to New York City by John J. Fitz Gerald in a number of ''New York Morning Telegraph'' articles in the 1920s in reference to New York horse-racing. The earliest of these was a casual reference on May 3, 1921:

<blockquote>J. P. Smith, with Tippity Witchet and others of the L. T. Bauer string, is scheduled to start for "the big apple" to-morrow after a most prosperous Spring campaign at Bowie and Havre de Grace.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_may_3_1921/ First “Big Apple”: May 3, 1921].</ref></blockquote>

Fitz Gerald referred to the "big apple" frequently thereafter.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/numerous_1920s_big_apple_citations_in_the_new_york_morning_telegraph/ Numerous 1920s “Big Apple” citations in the New York Morning Telegraph].</ref> He explained his use in a February 18, 1924, column under the headline "Around the Big Apple":

<blockquote>The Big Apple. The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.

Two dusky stable hands were leading a pair of thoroughbred around the "cooling rings" of adjoining stables at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans and engaging in desultory conversation.

"Where y'all goin' from here?" queried one.

"From here we're headin' for The Big Apple," proudly replied the other.

"Well, you'd better fatten up them skinners or all you'll get from the apple will be the core," was the quick rejoinder.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_explanation_february_18_1924/ First “Big Apple” explanation: February 18, 1924]. See also the original article [http://www.barrypopik.com/images/FitzGerald1.gif image].</ref>
</blockquote>

Fitz Gerald's reference to the "dusky" stable hands suggests the term's origin may lie in [[African-American]] culture. Support for this is found in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. “Ragtime” Billy Tucker, a vaudeville/ragtime performer and writer for the ''Defender'', there used "big apple" to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context on September 16, 1922:

<blockquote>I trust your trip to 'the big apple' (New York) was a huge success and only wish that I had been able to make it with you.<ref name="linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville">[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801D&L=ADS-L&P=R9794 "Big Apple" antedating]; [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_vaudeville_ragtime_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Vaudeville/Ragtime “Big Apple” Citations].</ref></blockquote>

Tucker had earlier used "Big Apple" as a reference to a different city, Los Angeles.  This example, from May 15, 1920, is the earliest known use of "Big Apple" to refer to any city.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} <!-- huh? see the 1909 quote earlier in the article --> It is possible that the writer simply understood "Big Apple" as an appropriate nickname for any large city:

<blockquote>Dear Pal, Tony: No, Ragtime Billy Tucker hasn't dropped completely out of existence, but is still in the 'Big Apple', Los Angeles.<ref name="linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville" /></blockquote>

By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use "Big Apple" and were using it outside of a horse-racing context.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_non_horseracing_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Non-Horseracing “Big Apple” Citations].</ref> "The Big Apple" was a popular song<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_song_by_bob_emmerich/ “Big Apple” song by Bob Emmerich].</ref> and [[Big Apple (dance)|dance]]<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1930s_two_clubs_plus_song_and_dance/ “Big Apple” in the 1930s (Two clubs, plus song and dance)].</ref> in the 1930s.

By the 1960s, "the Big Apple" was known only as an old name for New York.<ref>Kurt Vonnegut, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' 265 (1969; Delta Trade Paperbacks ed. 1999) ("That's what they used to call New York").</ref> In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau (now NYC & Company, the official marketing and tourism organization for New York City),<ref>[http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=20 About NYC and Company].</ref> under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett, began promoting "the Big Apple" for the city.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_1970s_revival_charlie_gillett_and_lew_rudin/ Big Apple 1970s Revival: Charlie Gillett and Lew Rudin].</ref> It has remained popular since then.<ref name=voa>{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html|title=Words and Their Stories: Nicknames for New York City|date=2010-02-23|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2010-03-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100413182642/http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html| archivedate= 13 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Mayor [[Rudolph W.

The [[New York Mets]] have featured a "Home Run Apple" that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout [[Major League Baseball]] as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared in [[Shea Stadium]], and the original can still be seen on display at [[Citi Field]], outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citi Field now uses a new apple, one that is nearly four times the size of the original.

In ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', [[Buenos Aires]] is referred to as "B.A., Buenos Aires, Big Apple" in the song ''Eva, Beware of the City''. This reference was invented by lyricist [[Tim Rice]] and does not reflect preexisting use.
