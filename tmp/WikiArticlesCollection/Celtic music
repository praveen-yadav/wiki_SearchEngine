'''Celtic music''' is a broad grouping of [[musical genre]]s that evolved out of the [[folk music]]al traditions of the [[Celtic people]] of [[Western Europe]].<ref name=melhuish>{{cite book|last=Melhuish|first=Martin|title=Celtic Tides: Traditional Music in a New Age|year=1998|publisher=Quarry Press Inc.|location=Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55082-205-5|pages=8, 28}}</ref><ref name=alberro>{{cite journal|first=Manuel|last=Alberro|url=http://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_20/alberro_6_20.html|title=Celtic Legacy in Galicia|journal=E-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies|volume=6|pages=1005–1035|year=2005}}</ref> It refers to both orally-transmitted traditional music and recorded music and the styles vary considerably to include everything from "trad" (traditional) music to [[celtic fusion|a wide range of hybrids]]. 

''Celtic music'' means two things mainly. First, it is the music of the peoples identifying themselves as [[Celts (modern)|Celts]]. Secondly, it refers to whatever qualities may be unique to the musics of the [[Celtic Nations]]. Many notable Celtic musicians such as [[Alan Stivell]] and [[Paddy Moloney]]<ref name=melhuishChieftains>{{cite book|last=Melhuish|first=Martin|title=Celtic Tides: Traditional Music in a New Age|year=1998|publisher=Quarry Press Inc.|location=Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55082-205-5|pages=73–79 especially 77 and 79}}</ref> claim that the different Celtic musics have much in common.<ref name=melhuish/><ref name=alberro/><ref name=aubrey>{{cite book|last=Aubrey|first=Graham|title=The Ingenious Cornish - Inventions, Enterprises and Exploits: The Ethnicity Factor in Cornish Music Both at Home and Abroad|year=2011|publisher=Cornish Association of South Australia Est. 1890|location=Wallaroo Town Hall during Kernewek Lowender 2011 Biennial Seminar|pages=16}}</ref> These common melodic practices may be used <ref name=aubrey/> widely across Celtic Music: 

* Often the melodic line moves up and down the primary chords in so many songs. There are a number of possible reasons for this:
** ''Melodic variation'' can be easily introduced. Melodic variation is widely used in Celtic music, especially by the pipes and harp.
** It is easier to anticipate the direction that the melody will take, so that harmony either composed or improvised can be introduced: cliched cadences that are essential for impromptu harmony are also more easily formed.
** The relatively wider tonal intervals in some songs make it possible for stress accents within the poetic line to be more in keeping with the local Celtic accent.
* Across just one Celtic group.
* By more than one Celtic language population belonging to different Celtic groups.

These two latter usage patterns may simply be remnants of formerly widespread melodic practices.

Often, the term ''Celtic music'' is applied to the [[Folk music of Ireland|music of Ireland]] and [[music of Scotland|Scotland]] because both lands have produced well-known distinctive styles which actually have genuine commonality and clear mutual influences. The definition is further complicated by the fact that Irish independence has allowed Ireland to promote 'Celtic' music as a specifically Irish product. However, these are modern geographical references to a people who share a common Celtic ancestry and consequently, a common musical heritage.

These styles are known because of the importance of Irish and Scottish people in the English speaking world, especially in the [[United States]], where they had a profound impact on [[Music of the United States|American music]], particularly [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]].<ref>[http://www.chincoteagueculturalalliance.org/articles/article/5493371/95457.htm Chincoteagueculturalalliance.org]</ref> The [[music of Wales]], [[music of Cornwall|Cornwall]], the [[music of the Isle of Man|Isle of Man]], [[music of Brittany|Brittany]], [[music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]] ([[Spain]]) and [[music of Portugal|Portugal]] are also considered Celtic music, the tradition being particularly strong in [[Brittany]], where Celtic festivals large and small take place throughout the year, and in Wales, where the ancient [[eisteddfod]] tradition has been revived and flourishes. Additionally, the musics of ethnically Celtic peoples abroad are vibrant, especially [[Celtic music in Canada|in Canada]] and the [[Celtic music in the United States|United States]]. In Canada the provinces of Atlantic Canada are known for being a home of Celtic music, most notably on the islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island. The traditional music of Atlantic Canada is heavily influenced by the Irish, Scottish and Acadian ethnic makeup of much of the region's communities.<ref name=melhuishcb>{{cite book|last=Melhuish|first=Martin|title=Celtic Tides: Traditional Music in a New Age|year=1998|publisher=Quarry Press Inc.|location=Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55082-205-5|pages=121–152}}</ref>   In some parts of Atlantic Canada, such as Newfoundland, Celtic music is as or more popular than in the old country.  Further, some older forms of Celtic music that are rare in Scotland and Ireland today, such as practice of accompanying a fiddle with a piano, or the Gaelic spinning songs of Cape Breton remain common in the Maritimes.  Much of the music of this region is Celtic in nature, but originates in the local area and celebrates the sea, seafaring, fishing and other primary industries.

In ''Celtic Music: A Complete Guide'', June Skinner Sawyers acknowledges six [[Celtic nations|Celtic nationalities]] divided into two groups according to their linguistic heritage. The [[Q-Celtic]] nationalities are the [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Manx people]]s, while the [[P-Celtic]] groups are the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], [[Breton people|Bretons]] and [[Welsh people]]s. Musician [[Alan Stivell]] uses a similar dichotomy, between the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] (Irish/Scottish/Manx) and the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] (Breton/Welsh/Cornish) branches, which differentiate "mostly by the extended range (sometimes more than two octaves) of Irish and Scottish melodies and the closed range of Breton and Welsh melodies (often reduced to a half-octave), and by the frequent use of the pure [[pentatonic scale]] in Gaelic music."<ref>translation by Steve Winick</ref>

There is also tremendous variation between ''Celtic'' regions. Ireland, Scotland, and Brittany have living traditions of language and music, and there has been a recent major revival of interest in Wales, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] has a Celtic language revival movement to revive the Q-Celtic ''[[Gallaecian language|Gallaic language]]'' used into Roman times.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old Celtic Dictionary|url=http://oldcelticdictionary.com/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallaic.com|title=Gallaic Revival|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallaicrevivalmovement.page.tl/|title=Gallaic Revival Movement|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Wayback|url=http://gallaicrevivalmovement.spruz.com/|date=20121002063828|df=yes}}</ref> Most of the Iberian Peninsula had a [[Hispano-Celtic language|similar Celtic language]] in pre-Roman times. A [[Britonia|Brythonic language]] was used in parts of Galicia and [[Asturias]] into early Medieval times brought by Britons fleeing the Anglo-Saxon invasions via [[Brittany]].<ref name=bretonmigrations>{{cite book | last = Koch | first = John | authorlink =John T.

[[Breton people|Breton]] artist [[Alan Stivell]] was one of the earliest musicians to use the word ''Celtic'' and ''Keltia'' in his marketing materials, starting in the early 1960s as part of the worldwide folk music revival of that era<ref>Bruce Elder.

A Historical Encyclopaedia ABC-CLIO 2006 pp 1627–1628</ref> with the term quickly catching on with other artists worldwide.  Today, the genre is well established and [[Celtic fusion|incredibly diverse]].

== Forms ==
There are musical genres and styles specific to each Celtic country, due in part to the influence of individual song traditions and the characteristics of specific languages:
* [[Folk music#Celtic traditional music|Celtic traditional music]]
* [[strathspey (dance)|Strathspeys]] are specific to Highland Scotland, for example, and it has been hypothesized that they mimic the rhythms of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] language.<ref>[http://www.siliconglen.com/culture/gaelicsong.html Traditional Gaelic song and singing sean-nós]</ref>
* [[Reel (dance)|Reels]]
* [[Pibroch]]
* [[Cerdd Dant]] (string music) or ''Canu Penillion'' (verse singing) is the art of vocal improvisation over a given [[melody]] in [[Wales|Welsh]] [[music]]al tradition. It is an important competition in [[eisteddfod]]au. The singer or (small) [[choir]] sings a counter melody over a [[harp]] melody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cerdd-dant.org/english/about/|title=About Cerdd Dant |publisher=Cymdeithas Cerdd Dant Cymru|date=|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>

==Celtic fusion ==
{{main|Celtic fusion}}

The oldest musical tradition which fits under the label of Celtic fusion originated in the rural American south in the early colonial period and incorporated Scottish, Scots-Irish, Irish,Welsh, English, and African influences. Variously referred to as roots music, American folk music, or old-time music, this tradition has exerted a strong influence on all forms of American music, including country, blues, and rock and roll.<ref>Irish Folk, Trad and Blues: A Secret History" by Colin Harper (2005) covers Horslips, The Pogues, Planxty and others.</ref> In addition to its lasting effects on other genres, it marked the first modern large-scale mixing of musical traditions from multiple ethnic and religious communities within the [[Celtic diaspora (disambiguation)|Celtic diaspora]].

In the 1960s several bands put forward modern adaptations of Celtic music pulling influences from several of the Celtic nations at once to create a modern [[pan-celtic]] sound. A few of those include [[bagad]]où (Breton pipe bands), [[Fairport Convention]], [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Steeleye Span]] and [[Horslips]].  

In the 1970s [[Clannad]] made their mark initially in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional scene, and then subsequently went on to bridge the gap between traditional Celtic and [[pop music]] in the 1980s and 1990s, incorporating elements from [[New Age music|New Age]], [[smooth jazz]], and [[folk rock]]. Traces of Clannad's legacy can be heard in the music of many artists, including [[Enya]], Donna Taggart, [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]], [[The Corrs]], [[Loreena McKennitt]], [[Anúna]], [[Riverdance]] and [[U2]]. The solo music of Clannad's lead singer, [[Moya Brennan]] (often referred to as the First Lady of Celtic Music) has further enhanced this influence.

Later, beginning in 1982 with [[The Pogues]]' invention of Celtic folk-punk and [[Stockton's Wing]] blend of Irish traditional and Pop, Rock and Reggie, there has been a movement to incorporate [[Celt]]ic influences into other genres of music. Bands like [[Flogging Molly]], [[Black 47]], [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[The Young Dubliners]], [[The Tossers]] introduced a hybrid of [[Celtic rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[reggae]], [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] and other elements in the 1990s that has become popular with Irish-American youth.

Today there are Celtic-influenced sub genres of virtually every type of popular music including [[electronica]], [[Celtic rock|rock]], [[Celtic metal|metal]], [[Celtic punk|punk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[New Age music|new age]], [[latin music|Latin]], [[Andean music|Andean]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. Collectively these modern interpretations of Celtic music are sometimes referred to as [[Celtic fusion]].

== Other modern adaptations ==
Outside of America, the first deliberate attempts to create a "Pan-Celtic music" were made by the Breton [[François Jaffrennou|Taldir Jaffrennou]], having translated songs from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales into Breton between the two world wars. One of his major works was to bring "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]" (the Welsh [[national anthem]]) back in Brittany and create lyrics in Breton. Eventually this song became "''Bro goz va zadoù''" ("Old land of my fathers") and is the most widely accepted Breton anthem. In the 70s, the Breton [[Alan Cochevelou]] (future [[Alan Stivell]]) began playing a mixed repertoire from the main Celtic countries on the Celtic harp his father created.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> <br />
Probably the most successful all inclusive Celtic music composition in recent years is [[Shaun Davey]]s composition [[The Pilgrim (1983 album)|'The Pilgrim']]. This suite depicts the journey of St. Colum Cille through the Celtic nations of [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Brittany]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The suite which includes a Scottish pipe band, Irish and Welsh harpists, [[Galician gaita]]s, Irish [[uilleann pipes]], the [[bombarde]]s of [[Brittany]], two vocal soloists and a narrator is set against a background of a classical orchestra and a large choir. 

Modern music may also be termed "Celtic" because it is written and recorded in a Celtic language, regardless of musical style. Many of the Celtic languages have experienced resurgences in modern years, spurred on partly by the action of artists and musicians who have embraced them as hallmarks of identity and distinctness. In 1971, the Irish band ''[[Skara Brae (band)|Skara Brae]]'' recorded its only [[LP album|LP]] (simply called ''Skara Brae''), all songs in [[Irish language|Irish]]. In 1978 [[Runrig]] recorded an album in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. In 1992 [[Capercaillie (band)|Capercaillie]] recorded "A Prince Among Islands", the first Scottish Gaelic language record to reach the UK top 40. In 1996, a song in Breton represented France in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|41st Eurovision Song Contest]], the first time in history that France had a song without a word in French. Since about 2005, [[Oi Polloi]] (from Scotland) have recorded in Scottish Gaelic. [[Mill a h-Uile Rud]] (a [[Scottish Gaelic punk]] band from Seattle) recorded in the language in 2004.

Several contemporary bands have Welsh language songs, such as [[Ceredwen]], which fuses traditional instruments with [[trip-hop]] beats, the [[Super Furry Animals]], [[Fernhill (band)|Fernhill]], and so on (see the [[Music of Wales]] article for more Welsh and Welsh-language bands). The same phenomenon occurs in Brittany, where many singers record songs in Breton, traditional or modern (hip hop, [[Rap music|rap]], and so on.).
