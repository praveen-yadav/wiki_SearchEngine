==History==
Action Against Hunger (ACF) was established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Alfred Kastler]] served as the organization’s first chairman.

ACF initially provided assistance to [[Afghan refugees]] in [[Pakistan]], famine-stricken [[Uganda]]n communities, and [[Cambodia]]n refugees in [[Thailand]].  It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger’s Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula ([[F-100 (food)|F100]]), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat [[acute malnutrition]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Action Against Hunger – USA was established in 1985 and became the first member of what is now ACF International. ACF International currently has headquarters in five countries – France, Spain, the United States, Canada and the UK. All members of the ACF International Network agree to a charter of principles: independence, impartiality, nondiscrimination, free and direct access to victims, professionalism, and transparency.

In the short term, Action Against Hunger addresses hunger and malnutrition through feeding centers, food and supply distributions and by providing water and sanitation facilities in emergency situations. In the long term, it provides training in nutrition, water and sanitation, food security, and health care. ACF utilizes international experts and over 6000 local staff to develop programs.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Programs==

===Nutrition===
ACF sets up feeding centers to treat malnourished children. They also help control and prevent malnutrition through child-growth monitoring, nutritional surveys, and public education. Therapeutic feeding centers treat children with acute severe malnutrition through rigorous programs of medical treatment.

===Water and sanitation===
ACF provides access to safe drinking water by drilling wells, tapping springs, and installing water systems. They train local teams and communities to maintain equipment and work with the population on the importance of clean water and sanitation.

===Food security===
ACF distributes seeds and tools as well as conduct training programs in income-generating activities such as Farmer Field School (FFS), gardening, animal breeding, and food conservation.

===Health===
ACF sets up mother and child health centers to provide immunization and pre/post-natal care. Their public health programs train medical staff,  monitor and control epidemics, and rehabilitate clinics.

===Advocacy===
Action Against Hunger raises awareness about hunger and seeks to alert the international community when human rights, especially the right to food, are violated.

==Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award==
The Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award recognizes individuals who have made substantive contributions to the humanitarian field through philanthropy, public awareness, or their efforts to directly improve conditions for distressed communities.

In 2009, ACF honored the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] and its [[Director-General]], [[Jacques Diouf]],<ref>[http://www.fao.org/news/story/pt/item/47266/icode/en/ FAO Media Centre: Action against Hunger honors J. Diouf<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for their long-standing commitment to fighting hunger and poverty.

In 2008, [[Anderson Cooper]] was the first journalist to receive the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award. He was selected as the recipient for the award in 2008 for his ongoing coverage of key global issues and for bringing some of the most glaring humanitarian tragedies into focus for the American public.

In 2007, film director and Academy Award nominee [[Terry George]] was the recipient of the annual award for his long-standing humanitarian commitments, and the impact of his award winning depiction of the Rwandan Genocide in his movie, Hotel Rwanda.

The 2006 Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award recipient was [[Susan Sarandon]]. She was honored for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, an advocate for victims of hunger and HIV/AIDS, and a spokesperson for Heifer International. Documentary filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] introduced her and presented her with the award.

In 2005, the recipient of the award was the Nobel Laureate [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] in recognition of his outstanding work against hunger, malnutrition and poverty worldwide.

Past recipients of the award have included Nobel Laureate and former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] (2004), as well as the Pulitzer Prize-winning author [[Frank McCourt]] (2002), and [[Jeff Bridges]], among others.

==Campaigns and activities==

===Athletes Against Hunger===
A growing number of athletes are devoting their efforts to raising awareness and funds for Action Against Hunger.

This informal assemblage of adventurers, which was dubbed "Athletes Against Hunger", have devoted their time, resources, and hard work to bringing an end to malnutrition. They have climbed Everest, inline skated across the country and hiked the Appalachian Trail, to name a few.

===Race Against Hunger===
The Race Against Hunger is a Service Learning campaign that unites middle and high school students from all over the world in the fight against global hunger and malnutrition. The Race aims to educate American students about the causes of global hunger and inspire them to be a part of the solution.

The educational component of the Race involves an interactive program about global hunger that teachers implement in their classrooms. Recognizing the paradox of hunger in the developing world amidst an obesity epidemic in the United States, the curriculum is followed by an opportunity for students to engage in a fun and healthy activity through a “fun-run” event. Students seek sponsorships for the “fun-run”, and the proceeds raised by students directly support Action Against Hunger’s life-saving programs around the world.

In 2003, [[Zidane]] attended the Race Against Hunger organized by Action Against Hunger Spain (also known as Acción Contra el Hambre) held at the French Lyceum of Madrid. This event raised an estimated 25,000 Euros.

===Restaurants Against Hunger===
Action Against Hunger's annual Restaurants Against Hunger Campaign partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to problem of global hunger. Each year, the campaign raises vital funds and support for Action Against Hunger’s life-saving humanitarian programs.<ref>[http://www.restaurantsagainsthunger.org Love Food Give Food - Action Against Hunger<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/get-involved/restaurants-against-hunger Restaurants Against Hunger | Action Against Hunger<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Various singers have performed at the annual Restaurants Against Hunger Spring Gala including [[Kaïssa]] and Clara Lofaro.

===Love Food Give Food===
Action Against Hunger's new appeal, Love Food Give Food, asks all those who love food to get involved and raise funds to save the lives of malnourished children. As the food and drink industry’s chosen charity,  the appeal strives to bring attention to the problem of global hunger and raise over £1 million annually for this cause.

During the months of September and October, hundreds of restaurants fundraise for the Love Food Give Food appeal by adding £1 to the bill or adding 50p to a designated dish. Other restaurants, such as Carluccio’s, support the appeal year-round; Carluccio’s generously donate 50p for each Penne Giardiniera sold. 

New for 2011, Love Food Give Food are asking everyone to Host a Dinner Party for Action Against Hunger. The idea is that you sign up online, invite friends around for dinner and then ask them to make a donation to Action Against Hunger, if they liked your cooking. Several celebrity chefs are supporting the Love Food Give Food appeal by providing recipes for the website and cooking at [[Taste of London]], including [[Jun Tanaka (chef)|Jun Tanaka]], [[Cyrus Todiwala]], [[Marcus Wareing]], [[Valentine Warner]], [[Theo Randall]] and Francesco Mazzei.
