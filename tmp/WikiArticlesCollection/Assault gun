An '''assault gun''' is a [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] mounted on a motor vehicle or [[armoured warfare|armored]] [[chassis]], designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other [[infantry]] or [[fortified]] positions. The term is a literal translation of the German word "Sturmgeschütz". Germany introduced the first purpose-built assault gun, the Stug III, in the late 1930s thus establishing this category of armoured vehicles.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the [[gun]] or [[howitzer]] in a fully enclosed [[casemate]] on a [[tank]] [[chassis]]. The use of a [[casemate]] instead of a [[gun turret]] limited these weapons [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armor to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==History==

===World War II===

[[Image:Su76 nn.jpg|thumb|The Soviet [[SU-76]] was easily constructed in small factories incapable of producing proper tanks.]]

Assault guns were primarily used during [[World War II]] by the forces of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Early in the war, the [[Germans]] began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their [[infantry support weapon]]s on the bed of a [[truck]] or on obsolete [[tank]]s with the turret removed. Later in the war, both the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] introduced fully [[armoured warfare|armored]] purpose-built assault guns into their arsenals.

Early on, the Soviets built the [[KV-2]], a variant of the [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tank with a short-barreled [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|152 mm howitzer]] mounted in an oversized turret. This was not a success in battle, and was replaced with a very successful series of increasingly powerful turretless assault guns: the [[SU-76]], [[SU-122]], and the heavy [[SU-152]], which were followed by the [[ISU-122]] and [[ISU-152]] on the new [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS]] heavy tank [[chassis]].

The primary German assault gun was the [[Sturmgeschütz III]] (StuG III). Late production StuG III variants, armed with a high-velocity dual-purpose [[7.5 cm KwK 40|75mm gun]] blurred the line between assault guns and [[tank destroyer]]s and was the Wehrmacht's most-produced armored fighting vehicle, at some 9,400 examples. The Germans also built a number of other fully armored turretless assault guns, including the [[StuG IV]], [[Brummbär]] and [[Sturmtiger]]. The latter two were very heavy vehicles and were built only in small quantities.

[[Battalions]] of assault guns, usually StuG IIIs, commonly replaced the intended [[panzer]] battalion in the German [[Panzergrenadier|panzergrenadier divisions]] due to the chronic shortage of tanks, and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the [[panzer division]]s.<ref>Thomas L. Jentz (1996): Panzertruppen:
The Complete Guide to the Creation & Combat Employment of Germany's Tank Force, vol.2, 1943-1945, p.68</ref> Independent battalions were also deployed as 'stiffeners' for [[infantry]] divisions, and the StuG III's [[anti-tank]] capabilities contributed greatly to the German's ability to draw out [[World War II]] after they had lost the strategic initiative.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} However, command problems ensued, as the assault guns were considered to be [[artillery]] by the [[Wehrmacht]] and therefore the assault guns were not under the control of the Panzer unit's commanding officer, reducing unit effectiveness.{{Clarify|Independent Sturmgeschütz Abteilungen indeed were part of the artillery arm, but in Panzer- and Panzergrenadier divisions StuGs served in so called 'Panzer-Sturmgeschütz Abteilungen', i.e. 'tank battalions equipped with assault guns', under the [[Panzerwaffe]].|date=December 2012}}

[[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] forces also deployed vehicles designed for a close support role, but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with a howitzer. Among these was the M4(105), a [[M4 Sherman]] tank armed with a [[M101 howitzer|M4 105 mm howitzer]]. In addition, the Mark IV version of the [[Cromwell tank|Centaur tank]] and the Mark V and the Mark VIII versions of the [[Churchill tank]] were fitted with [[Ordnance QF 95 mm Howitzer|95&nbsp;mm howitzers]]. As the amount of German armour encountered by the Allies decreased, especially in Italy, a number of American [[tank destroyer]] units were used in the assault gun role for infantry support.

The AVRE version of the Churchill Tank was armed with a [[Mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|Spigot mortar]] that fired a {{convert|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}} [[High explosive|HE]]-filled projectile (nicknamed the ''Flying Dustbin'') {{convert|150|yd|m}}. Its task was to attack fortified positions such as [[bunker]]s at close range (see [[Hobart's Funnies]]).

=== Postwar use ===

In the post-[[World War II|WWII]] era, vehicles fitting into an "assault gun" category were developed as a light-weight, air-deployable, direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops. Current weapons were either based on [[jeep]]s or small [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at a distinct disadvantage in terms of heavy weapons. The Soviet Union and the United States were the most attracted to the idea of providing this capability to traditionally light airborne forces. Their answers to the problem were similar, with the United States developing the [[M56 Scorpion]] and the Soviet Union developing the [[ASU-57]], both essentially air-droppable light anti-tank guns.

The Soviets went on to develop an improved air-droppable assault gun, the [[ASU-85]], which served through the 1980s, while their [[SU-100]] remained in service with Communist countries, including Vietnam and Cuba, years after WW2. The US M56 and another similar vehicle, the [[Ontos|M50 Ontos]], were to be the last of the more traditional assault guns in US service. Improvised arrangements such as [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier#Weapons|M113]] personnel carriers with recoilless rifles were quickly replaced by missile carrier vehicles in the anti-tank role.

The only vehicle with the qualities of an assault gun to be fielded after the removal of the M50 and M56 from service within the US military was the [[M551 Sheridan]]. The Sheridan's gun was a low-velocity weapon suitable in the assault role, but with the addition of the [[Shillelagh missile]] could double in the anti-tank role as well. It is important, however, to remember that the Sheridan was not developed as an assault gun, but as a light reconnaissance vehicle.

Currently there appears to be a move toward wheeled vehicles fitting a "tank destroyer" or "assault gun" role, with the US testing the [[Mobile Gun System|M1128 Stryker MGS]]. The [[Centauro]] Wheeled Tank Destroyer of the [[Italian Army|Italian]] and [[Spanish Army|Spanish Armies]], the Chinese anti-tank gun PTL-02 and the French [[AMX 10 RC]] heavy armored car are also good examples. While these vehicles might be useful in a direct fire role, none were developed with this specifically in mind, reminiscent of the use of tank destroyers by the US military in the assault gun role during WWII.
