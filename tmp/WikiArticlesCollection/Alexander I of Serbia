'''Alexander I''' or '''Aleksandar Obrenović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Александар Обреновић; 14 August 1876 – 11 June 1903) was king of [[Serbia]] from 1889 to 1903 when he and his wife, Queen Draga, were [[May Overthrow|assassinated]] by a group of Army officers,<ref>{{cite book |last=Dorich |first=William |title=Kosovo |isbn=0-317-05074-5}}</ref> led by Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]].

==Accession==
[[File:Divlad Milán szerb király 1888-32.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Milan I of Serbia|Milan]], King of Serbia and his son, Alexander.]]
In 1889 Alexander's father, [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan]], unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life, proclaiming Alexander king of Serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age. His mother [[Natalie of Serbia|Natalija Obrenović]] became his regent.

In 1893, King Alexander, aged sixteen, arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age, dismissed the [[regent]]s and their government, and took the royal authority into his own hands. His action won popular support, as did his appointment of a radical ministry.

In May 1894 King Alexander arbitrarily abolished King Milan's liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869. His attitude during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)]] was one of strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].

In 1894 the young King brought his father, Milan, back to Serbia and, in 1898, appointed him commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. During that time, Milan was regarded{{By whom|date=March 2011}} as the ''de facto'' ruler of the country.

==Marriage==
[[File:Aleksandar Obrenovic.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King Alexander and Queen Draga]]
In the summer of 1900, King Alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed Madame [[Draga Mašin]], formerly a lady-in-waiting to his mother. The projected union initially aroused great opposition: he did not consult with his father, who had been on vacation in [[Karlovy Vary]] and making arrangements to secure the hand of a [[Germany|German]] princess [[Prince William of Schaumburg-Lippe#Marriage|Alexandra zu Schaumburg-Lippe]] for his son, or his [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] Dr. Vladan Đorđević, who was visiting the [[Paris]] [[World Exhibition|Universal Exhibition]] at the time of the announcement. Both immediately resigned from their respective offices and Alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Alexander's mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom. She was known to have been seen in the nearby countries, such as Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria.

Opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of [[Tsar Nicholas II]]'s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage duly took place in August 1900. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large.

== Political reconciliation ==
[[File:Obrenoviceva vila u Smederevu.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Summer residence of King Alexander in [[Smederevo]].]]
King Alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a [[classical liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] of his own initiative, introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of Serbia the system of two chambers (''[[National Assembly of Serbia|skupština]]'' and ''[[senate]]'').  This reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which, already dissatisfied with the king's marriage, became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of [[Draga Mašin|Queen Draga]], Lieutenant Nikodije, was to be proclaimed heir-presumptive to the throne.

Meanwhile, the independence of the [[senate]] and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to King Alexander. The King then suspended (March 1903) the [[constitution]] for half an hour, time enough to publish the decrees by which the old senators and councillors of state were dismissed and replaced by new ones. This arbitrary act naturally increased the dissatisfaction in the country.

==Assassination==
{{main|May Overthrow}}
The general impression was that, as much as the [[senate]] was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro]], who was married to [[Natalija Konstantinovic]], the granddaughter of [[Princess Anka Obrenovic]], an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed heir-presumptive in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless.<ref name="njeg">{{Cite web |last=Leroy |first=Pierre Olivier |url=http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php#footnotes |title=Biography of Prince Mihajlo Petrovic Njegos |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |publisher=The Njegoskij Fund Public Project |year=2004| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927034426/http://www.njegoskij.org/menu_history/subArts_2006/subArtHI_05006.php| archivedate= 27 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Apparently to prevent Queen Draga's brother being named heir-presumptive, but in reality to replace Alexander Obrenović with [[Peter I of Serbia|Peter Karađorđević]], a conspiracy was organized by a group of Army officers headed by Captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] also known as "Apis", who was in the pay of the [[Russian Empire|Russians]],<ref>C. L. Sulzberger, ''The Fall of Eagles'', p.202, Crown Publishers, New York, 1977</ref> as well as the leader of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] [[secret society]] which would assassinate [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914. Several politicians were also part of the conspiracy, and allegedly included former Prime Minister, [[Nikola Pašić]].<ref name="Sulzberger, p.202">Sulzberger, p.202</ref> The royal couple's [[The Old Palace|palace]] was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the Queen's bedroom. There is another possibility, used in a Serbian history  TV series "The End of the Obrenović Dynasty", in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret [[panic room]] hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom. The room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace, but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queen's wardrobe over it after the wedding.

The conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of June 11, 1903. King Alexander and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and, according to eyewitness accounts, thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure.<ref name="Sulzberger, p.202"/> The King was only 26 years old at the time of his death. King Alexander and Queen Draga were buried in the crypt of [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade]].
