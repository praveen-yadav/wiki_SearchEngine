In [[linguistics]], '''creaky voice''' (sometimes called '''laryngealisation''', '''pulse phonation''', '''vocal fry''', or '''glottal fry'''), is a special kind of [[phonation]]<ref>{{cite journal | author = Titze, I.

They vibrate irregularly at 20&ndash;50 pulses per second, about two octaves below the frequency of normal voicing, and the airflow through the [[glottis]] is very slow. However, although creaky voice may occur with very low pitch, as at the end of a long [[intonation unit]], it can occur with any pitch.

A slight degree of laryngealisation, occurring in some [[Korean language|Korean]] consonants for example, is called "[[stiff voice]]". The [[Danish language|Danish]] [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature ''[[stød]]'' is an example of a form of laryngealisation that has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] function. Creaky voice was reported to be prevalent in American English as spoken in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/A-Northwest-dialect-That-s-Goofy-some-say-1174476.php | title = A Northwest dialect?

Some languages, such as [[Jalapa Mazatec language|Jalapa Mazatec]], use creaky voice as a linguistically significant marker; that is, the presence or absence of creaky voice can change the meaning of a word.<ref name="AshbyMaidment2005">{{cite book | last1 = Ashby | first1 = M. | last2 = Maidment | first2 = J.
