'''Australian English''' ('''AusE''', '''AuE''', '''AusEng''', '''en-AU'''<ref><code>en-AU</code> is the [[language code]] for ''Australian English'' , as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).</ref>) is a major variety of the [[English language]] and is used throughout Australia. Although English has no official status in the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], Australian English is Australia's ''[[de facto]]'' official language and is the [[first language]] of the majority of [[Demographics of Australia|the population]].

Australian English started diverging from [[British English]] after the founding of the [[colony]] of [[New South Wales]] in 1788 and was recognised as being different from British English by 1820, arising from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] dialectal regions of the [[British Isles]] and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English.<ref name="clas.mq.edu.au">{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/history-accent-change |title=history & accent change &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

Australian English differs from other varieties of English in [[vocabulary]], [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], [[pronunciation]], [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]], [[grammar]] and [[spelling]].

==History==

The earliest form of Australian English was first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the colony of [[New South Wales]]. This very first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation. The Australian-born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of different dialects from all over the British Isles, in particular from [[Ireland]] and [[South East England]].<ref name="Moore 2008 69">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Bruce|title=Speaking our language : the story of Australian English|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-19-556577-0|page=69}}</ref>

The native-born children of the colony created the new dialect from factors present in the speech they heard around them, and provided an avenue for the expression of [[Peer pressure|peer solidarity]]. Even when new settlers arrived, this new dialect was strong enough to deflect the influence of other patterns of speech.

A large part of the convict body were of Irish origin, 25% of the total convict population. Many of these people were arrested in Ireland, and some in Great Britain. Many, if not most of the Irish convicts spoke either no English at all, or spoke it poorly and rarely. There were other significant populations of convicts from non-English speaking areas of Britain, such as the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Wales]].

Records from the early 19th century indicate the distinct dialect that had surfaced in the colonies since [[First Fleet|first settlement]] in 1788,<ref name="clas.mq.edu.au"/> with [[Peter Miller Cunningham|Peter Miller Cunningham's]] 1827 book ''Two Years in New South Wales'', describing the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native born colonists, different from that of their parents and with a strong [[London]] influence.<ref name="Moore 2008 69"/> [[Anthony Burgess]] writes that "Australian English may be thought of as a kind of fossilised Cockney of the Dickensian era."<ref>A Mouthful of Air (1992), Anthony Burgess</ref>

[[Image:Doudiet Swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Australian gold rushes]] saw many external influences adopted into the language.]]
The first of the [[Australian gold rushes]], in the 1850s, began a large wave of [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]], during which about two per cent of the population of the United Kingdom emigrated to the colonies of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=The rush that never ended : a history of Australian mining|year=1993|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=0-522-84557-6|edition=4th ed.}}</ref> According to linguist Bruce Moore, "the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the Australian accent was from south-east England."<ref name="Moore 2008 69"/>

Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been [[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin|adopted by Australian English]]—mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]]) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as ''kangaroo'', ''boomerang'', ''budgerigar'', ''wallaby'' and so on have become international. Other examples are ''[[cooee]]'' and ''hard yakka''. The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced {{IPA|/kʉː.iː/}}) which travels long distances. ''Cooee'' is also a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the [[Turrubal language|Jagera]]/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.

Also from there is the word ''bung'', from the Sydney [[pidgin]] English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), meaning "dead", with some extension to "broken" or "useless". Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The most well known example is the capital, Canberra named after a local language word meaning "meeting place".<ref>{{cite web|title=Canberra Facts and figures|url=http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/Visitor-Info/Facts-and-figures.aspx|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>

Among the changes starting in the 19th-century gold rushes was the introduction of words, spellings, terms and usages from [[North American English]]. The words imported included some later considered to be typically Australian, such as ''bonzer''.<ref name="Bell">{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Philip|last2=Bell|first2=Roger|title=Americanization and Australia|year=1998|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=Sydney|isbn=0-86840-784-4|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> This continued with the influx of American military personnel in [[World War II]] as well as film; seen in the enduring persistence of ''okay'', ''you guys'' and ''gee''.<ref name="Bell"/>

==Phonology and pronunciation==
{{Main|Australian English phonology}}
The primary way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation. It shares most similarity with other [[Southern Hemisphere]] accents, in particular [[New Zealand English]].<ref>Trudgill, Peter and Jean Hannah. (2002). ''International English: A Guide to the Varieties of Standard English'', 4th ed. London: Arnold. ISBN 0-340-80834-9, p. 4.</ref> Like most dialects of English it is distinguished primarily by its vowel [[phonology]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Harrington, J., F. Cox, and Z. Evans |title=An acoustic phonetic study of broad, general, and cultivated Australian English vowels |journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics |year=1997 |volume=17 |pages=155–84 |doi=10.1080/07268609708599550 |issue=2}}</ref>

===Vowels===

The vowels of Australian English can be divided according to length. The long vowels, which include [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s, mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels.  There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving Australian English [[vowel length|phonemic length distinction]], which is unusual amongst the various dialects of English, though not unknown elsewhere, such as in regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Mannell |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html |title=Australian English - Impressionistic Phonetic Studies |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au|date=14 August 2009|accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110706114743/http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html| archivedate= 6 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> As with General American and New Zealand English, the [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|weak-vowel merger]] is complete in Australian English: unstressed {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (sometimes written as {{IPA|/ɨ/}} or {{IPA|/ᵻ/}}) is merged into {{IPA|/ə/}} ([[schwa]]).

===Consonants===
There is little variation with respect to the sets of [[consonant]]s used in various English dialects. There are, however, variations in how these consonants are used. Australian English is no exception.

Australian English is [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]]; in other words, the {{IPA|/r/}} sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant. However, a [[Linking and intrusive R#Linking R|linking {{IPA|/r/}}]] can occur when a word that has a final <r> in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. An [[Linking and intrusive R#Intrusive R|intrusive {{IPA|/r/}}]] may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have <r> in the spelling in certain environments, namely after the long vowel {{IPA|/oː/}} and after word final {{IPA|/ə/}}.

There is some degree of allophonic variation in the [[alveolar stop]]s. As with North American English, [[Intervocalic alveolar flapping]] is a feature of Australian English: prevocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} surface as the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} after [[sonorant]]s other than {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, /m/as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. For some speakers {{IPA|/t/}} in final or in medial position is [[T glottalization|glottalised]] to [[glottal stop|{{IPA|[ʔ]}}]]. For many speakers, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} in the combinations {{IPA|/tr/}}-{{IPA|/tw/}} and {{IPA|/dr/}}-{{IPA|/dw/}} are also palatalised, thus {{IPA|/tʃr/}}-{{IPA|/tʃw/}} and {{IPA|/dʒr/}}-{{IPA|/dʒw/}}, as Australian {{IPA|/r/}} is only very slightly retroflex, the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth in the same position as for {{IPA|/w/}}; it is also somewhat rounded ("to say 'r' the way Australians do you need to say 'w' at the same time"), where older English {{IPA|/wr/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} have fallen together as {{IPA|/ʷr/}}. The [[wine–whine merger]] is complete in Australian English.

[[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] occurs after {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/s/}},  {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, . Other cases of {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}}, along with {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}}, have [[English_consonant-cluster_reductions#Yod-coalescence|coalesced]] to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} respectively for many speakers.  {{IPA|/j/}} is generally retained in other [[consonant cluster]]s.

===Pronunciation===
Differences in stress, weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between Australian English and other forms of English, which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility.

The affixes ''-ary'', ''-ery'', ''-ory'', ''-bury'', ''-berry'' and ''-mony'' (seen in words such as ''necessary, mulberry'' and ''matrimony'') can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa. Although some words like ''necessary'' are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel, older generations of Australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel.

Words ending in unstressed ''-ile'' derived from Latin adjectives ending in ''-ilis'' are pronounced with a full vowel ({{IPA|/ɑel/}}), so that ''fertile'' rhymes with ''fur tile'' rather than ''turtle''.

In addition, miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to seemingly random words. For example, the vowel in ''yoghurt'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/əʉ/}} ("long 'O'") rather than {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ("short o"). Similarly, ''vitamin'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/ɑe/}} ("long 'I'") in the first syllable, rather than {{IPA|/ɪ/}} ("short 'I'"). Despite this, ''advertisement'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/ɪ/}}. ''Brooch'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/əʉ/}} as opposed to {{IPA|/ʉː/}}, and ''Anthony'' with {{IPA|/θ/}} rather than {{IPA|/t/}}.

==Variation==
{{Main|Variation in Australian English}}
Academic research has shown that the most notable variation within Australian English is largely [[culture|sociocultural]]. This is mostly evident in phonology, which is divided into three sociocultural varieties: ''broad'', ''general'' and ''cultivated''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Mannell |url=http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html |title=Robert Mannell, "Impressionistic Studies of Australian English Phonetics" |publisher=Ling.mq.edu.au |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716090155/http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html| archivedate= 16 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

A limited range of [[Word usage|word choice]]s is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals can be inferred, if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions.

In addition, some Australians speak [[English-based creole languages|creole languages]] derived from Australian English, such as [[Australian Kriol language|Australian Kriol]], [[Torres Strait Creole]] and [[Norfuk language|Norfuk]].

===Sociocultural===
The ''broad'', ''general'' and ''cultivated'' accents form a continuum that reflects minute variations in the Australian accent. They can reflect the [[social class]], education and urban or rural background of speakers, though such indicators are not always reliable.<ref>[http://www.international.mq.edu.au/globe/default.aspx?id=244&EditionID=162 Australia's unique and evolving sound] Edition 34, 2007 (23 August 2007) – The Macquarie Globe</ref> According to linguists, the general Australian variant emerged some time before 1900.<ref>Bruce Moore (Australian Oxford Dictionary) and Felicity Cox (Macquarie University) [interviewed in]: ''Sounds of Aus'' (television documentary) 2007; director: David Swann; Writer: Lawrie Zion, Princess Pictures (broadcaster: ABC Television).</ref> Recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the broad variant, along with the near extinction of the cultivated Australian accent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Das|first=Sushi|title=Struth! Someone's nicked me Strine|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Struth-Someones-nicked-me-Strine/2005/01/28/1106850102203.html|newspaper=The Age|date=29 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Corderoy|first=Amy|title=It's all English, but vowels ain't voils|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/its-all-english-but-vowels-aint-voils-20100125-mukf.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 January 2010}}</ref> The growth and dominance of general Australian accents perhaps reflects its prominence on radio and television during the late 20th century.

[[Australian Aboriginal English]] is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use.

The ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=australian english &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=australian english defined &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].

===Regional variation===
Although Australian English is relatively homogeneous, some regional variations are notable. The dialects of English spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]], [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Torres Strait English|Torres Strait Islands]] differ slightly from each other. Differences in terms of vocabulary and phonology exist.

Most regional differences come down to word usage. For example, swimming clothes are known as ''cossies'' or ''swimmers'' in New South Wales, ''togs'' in Queensland, and ''bathers'' in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia; what is referred to as a ''stroller'' in most of Australia is called a ''pusher'' in Victoria and South Australia and usually a ''pram'' in Western Australia.<ref name="Pauline Bryant 1985">Pauline Bryant (1985): Regional variation in the Australian English lexicon, Australian Journal of Linguistics, 5:1, 55-66</ref> Preference for synonymous words also differs between states. For example, ''garbage'' (i.e. garbage bin, garbage truck) dominates over ''rubbish'' in New South Wales and Queensland, while ''rubbish'' is more popular in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia.<ref name="Pauline Bryant 1985"/> The word ''footy'' generally refers to the most popular [[Football in Australia|football code]] in the particular state or territory; that is, [[rugby league]] in New South Wales and Queensland, and [[Australian rules football]] elsewhere. Beer glasses are also [[Australian English vocabulary#Alcohol|named differently]] in different states. Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh?''.

There are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words. The extent to which the [[Phonological history of English short A#Trap–bath split|trap‑bath split]] has taken hold is one example. This phonological development is more advanced in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type than other parts of the country. Words such as ''dance'', ''advance'', ''plant'', ''graph'', ''example'' and ''answer'' are pronounced far more frequently with the older {{IPA|/æ/}} (as in ''mad'') outside of South Australia, but with the British-influenced {{IPA|/a/}} (as in ''father'') within South Australia.<ref name="Pauline Bryant 1985"/> [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalisation]] is also more common in South Australia than other states.  In Western Australian English the vowels in ''near'' and ''square'' are typically realised as centring diphthongs, whereas in the eastern states they may also be realised as monophthongs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/regional-accents |title=regional accents &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> A feature common in Victorian English is [[English-language vowel changes before historic l#Salary–celery merger|salary–celery merger]]. There is also regional variation in {{IPA|/uː/}} before {{IPA|/l/}}.

==Vocabulary==
{{Main|Australian English vocabulary}}
[[Image:Banjo Patterson.jpg|thumb|right|Bush poets such as [[Banjo Paterson]] captured the Australian vocabulary of the 19th century in their [[bush ballad]]s.]]

Australian English has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect and have been written on extensively, with the [[Macquarie Dictionary]], widely regarded as the national standard, incorporating numerous Australian terms.<ref>"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.</ref>

Internationally well-known examples of Australian terminology include ''[[outback]]'', meaning a remote, sparsely populated area, ''[[the bush]]'', meaning either a native forest or a country area in general, and ''g'day'', a greeting. ''Dinkum'', or ''fair dinkum'' means "true", or "is that true?", among other things, depending on context and inflection.<ref>[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html Frederick Ludowyk, 1998, "Aussie Words: The Dinkum Oil On Dinkum; Where Does It Come From?" (''0zWords'', Australian National Dictionary Centre)]. Access date: 5 November 2007.</ref> The derivative ''dinky-di'' means "true" or devoted: a "dinky-di Aussie" is a "true Australian".

[[Australian performance poetry|Australian poetry]], such as "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]" as well as [[Australian folk music|folk songs]] such as "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", contain many historical Australian words and phrases that are understood by Australians even though some are not in common usage today.

Australian English, in common with several British English dialects (for example, [[Cockney]], [[Scouse]], [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Geordie]]), uses the word ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]''. Many words used by Australians were at one time used in England but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there.

For example, ''creek'' in Australia, as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea; ''paddock'' in Australia means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; ''bush'' or ''scrub'' in Australia, as in North America, means a wooded area, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]).

[[Litotes]], such as "not bad", "not much" and "you're not wrong", are also used, as are [[diminutive]]s, which are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity. Some common examples are ''arvo'' (afternoon), ''barbie'' (barbecue), ''[[smoko]]'' (cigarette break), ''Aussie'' (Australian) and ''pressie'' (present/gift). This may also be done with people's names to create [[nickname]]s (other English speaking countries create [[English diminutive|similar diminutives]]). For example, "Gazza" from Gary, or "Smitty" from John Smith. The use of the suffix ''-o'' originates in Irish Gaelic{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} (Irish ''ó''), which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in Australian English.

In informal speech, incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as "sweet as" (as in "That car is sweet as."). "Full", "fully" or "heaps" may precede a word to act as an intensifier (as in "The waves at the beach were heaps good."). This was more common in regional Australia and South Australia but has been in common usage in urban Australia for decades. The suffix "-ly" is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English. For instance "real good" instead of "really good".

Australia's switch to the [[metric system]] in the 1970s changed the country's vocabulary of measurement from Imperial towards metric measures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120426100359AA40HMH |title=Is the Metric system taught and used in Australia? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2013 |work=Yahoo Answers |publisher=Yahoo |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.measurement.gov.au/measurementsystem/Pages/HistoryofMeasurementinAustralia.aspx |title=History of Measurement in Australia |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |work=web page |publisher=Australian Government National Measurement Institute |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>

===Comparison with other varieties===
Where [[American and British English differences|British and American vocabulary differs]], Australians sometimes favour an Australian English usage, as with footpath (for US sidewalk, UK pavement) or capsicum (for US bell pepper, UK sweet pepper). In other instances, it either shares a term with American English, as with [[truck]] (UK: lorry) or [[eggplant]] (UK: aubergine), or with British English, as with [[mobile phone]] (US: cell phone) or [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (US: hood).

A non-exhaustive selection of common British English terms not commonly used in Australian English include (Australian usage in brackets): artic/articulated lorry (semi-trailer); aubergine (eggplant); bank holiday (public holiday); bedsit (one-bedroom apartment); bespoke (custom); black pudding (blood sausage); bollocks (balls); cagoule (raincoat); candy floss (fairy floss); cash machine (automatic teller machine/ATM); char (tea); child-minder (babysitter); clingfilm (glad wrap/cling-wrap); courgette (zucchini); crisps (chips/potato chips); doddle (bludge); dungarees (overalls); dustbin (garbage/rubbish bin); dustcart (garbage/rubbish truck); duvet (doona); elastoplast/plaster (band-aid); estate car (station wagon); fairy cake (cupcake/patty cake); flannel ((face) washer/wash cloth); free phone (toll-free); football (soccer); gherkin (pickle); high street (main street); hoover (vacuum cleaner); ice lolly (ice block/icy pole); kitchen roll (paper towel); lavatory (toilet); lorry (truck); off-licence (bottle shop); pavement (footpath); pepper (capsicum); pillar box (mail box); plimsoll (sandshoe); pushchair/pusher (pram/stroller); saloon (sedan); sod (bastard); sweets (lollies); utility room (laundry); water closet/WC (toilet); Wellington boots (gumboots).

A non-exhaustive list of American English terms not commonly found in Australian English include: acclimate (acclimatise); aluminum (aluminium); bangs (fringe); bell pepper (capsicum); bellhop (hotel porter); broil (grill); burglarize (rob); busboy (included under the broader term of waiter/waitress; rarely, table clearer); candy (lolly); cell phone (mobile phone); cilantro (coriander); cookie (biscuit); counter-clockwise (anticlockwise); diaper (nappy); emergency brake (handbrake); faucet (tap); flashlight (torch); gasoline (petrol); hood (bonnet); jell-o (jelly); jelly (jam); math (maths); pacifier (dummy); parking lot (car park); popsicle (ice block/icy pole); railway ties (sleepers); row house (terrace house); scallion (spring onion); stickshift (manual transmission); streetcar (tram); takeout (takeaway); trash can (garbage/rubbish bin); trunk (boot); turn signal (indicator/blinker); vacation (holiday).

Terms shared by British and American English but not so commonly found in Australian English include: abroad (overseas); [[cooler]]/ice box (esky); [[pickup truck]] (ute); [[wildfire]] (bushfire).

In addition, a number of words in Australian English have different meanings to those ascribed in other varieties of English. Clothing-related examples are notable. ''Pants'' in Australian English refer to British English ''trousers'' but in British English refer to Australian English ''underpants''; ''vest'' in Australian English refers to British English ''waistcoat'' but in British English refers to Australian English ''singlet''; ''thong'' in both American and British English refers to underwear otherwise known as a ''[[G-string]]'' while in Australian English it refers to British and American English ''flip-flop''.

==Grammar==
As with American English, but unlike British English, collective nouns are almost always singular in construction, i.e. ''the government was unable to decide'' as opposed to ''the government were unable to decide''.

In common with British English, the past tense and past participles of the verbs ''learn'', ''spell'' and ''smell'' are often irregular (''learnt'', ''spelt'', ''smelt'').

As with North American varieties of English and unlike British English, the past participles ''gotten''{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and ''proven'' are commonly used in all [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s, and are not stigmatised. Also stigmatised in British English but acceptable in Australian English is ''snuck'' as the past tense of sneak.

''Shan't'' and the use of ''should'' as in ''I should be happy if...'', common in upper-register British English, are almost never encountered in Australian (or North American) English.

While prepositions before days may be omitted in American English, i.e. ''She resigned Thursday'', they must be retained in Australian English, as in British English: ''She resigned on Thursday''. Ranges of dates use ''to'', i.e. ''Monday to Friday'', as with British English, rather than ''Monday through Friday'' in American English.

''River'' generally follows the name of the river in question as in North America, i.e. ''Darling River'', rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g. ''River Thames''. Note in South Australia however, the British convention applies—for example, the ''River Murray'' or the ''River Torrens''.

When saying or writing out numbers, ''and'' is inserted before the tens and units, i.e. ''one hundred and sixty-two'', as with British practice. However Australians, like Americans, are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1200 as ''twelve hundred'', rather than ''one thousand two hundred''.

As with American English, ''on the weekend'' and ''studied medicine'' are used rather than the British ''at the weekend'' and ''read medicine''.

==Spelling, style and keyboards==<!-- [[Australian spelling]] redirects here-->
As in most English-speaking countries, there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' is used by [[University|universities]] and other organisations as a standard for Australian English spelling. The ''Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers'', the ''Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage'' and the ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' are prominent style guides.

Australian spelling is closer to [[American and British English spelling differences|British]] than [[American and British English spelling differences|American spelling]]. As with British spelling, the ''u'' is retained in words such as ''colour'', ''honour'', ''labour'' and ''favour''.  While the Macquarie Dictionary lists the ''-our'' ending and follows it with the ''-or'' ending as an acceptable variant, the latter are rarely found in usage today. Australian print media, including digital media, today strongly favour ''-our'' endings. A notable exception to this rule is the [[Australian Labor Party]], which adopted the American spelling in 1912 as a result of ''-or'' spellings' comparative popularity at that time and American influence. Consistent with British spellings, ''-re'', rather than ''-er'', is the only listed variant in Australian dictionaries in words such as ''theatre'', ''centre'' and ''manoeuvre''. Unlike British English, which is split between ''-ise'' and ''-ize'' in words such as ''organise'' and ''realise'', with ''-ize'' favoured by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and ''-ise'' listed as a variant, ''-ize'' is rare in Australian English and designated as a variant by the Macquarie Dictionary. ''Ae'' and ''oe'' are often maintained in words such as ''manoeuvre'', ''paedophilia'' and ''foetus'' (excepting those listed below), however the Macquarie dictionary lists forms with ''e'' (e.g. pedophilia, fetus) as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within Australian English towards using only ''e''. Individual words spelt differently from British spelling, according to the ''Macquarie Dictionary'', include "program" (in all contexts) as opposed to "programme", "inquire" (for all meanings)  and derivatives "inquired", "inquiring", "inquiry", "inquirer", etc. as opposed to "enquire" and derivatives, "analog" as opposed to  "analogue" (as with American English, "analog" is used in the context of information transmission and "analogue" in the sense of "something analogous to"), "livable" as opposed to "liveable", "guerilla" as opposed to "guerrilla", "yoghurt" as opposed to "yogurt", "verandah" as opposed to "veranda", "sulfur" and derivatives "sulfide", "sulfidic" and "sulfuric" as opposed to "sulphur" and derivatives, "burqa" as opposed to "burka", "pastie" (food) as opposed to "pasty", "onto"  ''or'' "on to" as opposed to "on to", "anytime" as opposed to "any time", "alright" ''or'' "all right" as opposed to "all right", and "anymore" as opposed to "any more".<ref name="Fourth Edition 2005">"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition.  The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.</ref><ref>http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au</ref><ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com</ref> Both "acknowledgement" and "acknowledgment", as well as "abridgement" and "abridgment" are used, with the shorter forms being endorsed by Australian governments.<ref>http://www.pco.act.gov.au/library/Spelling.pdf</ref> "Okay", rather than "OK", is listed as the preferred variant.<ref name="Fourth Edition 2005">"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition.  The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.</ref>

Different spellings have existed throughout Australia's history. A pamphlet entitled ''The So-Called "American Spelling"'', published in Sydney some time in the 19th century, argued that "there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the ''u'' in such words as ''honor'', ''labor'', etc."<ref name = "ljnijo">''The So Called "American Spelling." Its Consistency Examined.'' pre-1901 pamphlet, Sydney, E. J. Forbes. Quoted by Annie Potts in [http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage19/Webster's-Dictionary.html this article]</ref> The pamphlet also claimed that "the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form." What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in Australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and the Age Newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the [[Australian Labor Party]] and also in some place names such as [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]]. The ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2008/01/webster-in-australia/</ref> For a short time during the late 20th Century, [[Harry Lindgren]]'s 1969 spelling reform proposal ([[SR1|''Spelling Reform 1'' or ''SR1'']]) was popular in Australia and was adopted by the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} SR1 calls for the short {{IPA|/e/}} sound (as in ''bet'') to be spelt with E (for example ''friend→frend, head→hed''). Many general interest paperbacks were printed in SR1.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Both [[Quotation mark|single and double quotation marks]] are in use (with double quotation marks being far more common in print media), with logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation. Spaced and unspaced em-dashes remain in mainstream use, as with American and Canadian English. The DD/MM/YYYY [[Calendar date|date format]] is used with Monday{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} as the first day of the week (as with British practice), however the 12-hour clock is used almost universally (as in the United States).

There are [[British and American keyboards|two major English language keyboard layouts]], the United States layout and the United Kingdom layout. Australia universally uses the United States keyboard. As such, Pound Sterling and Euro currency symbols do not appear on Australian keyboards, which also lack [[negation|negation symbols]] and have punctuation symbols placed differently than on British keyboards.
