The '''Cold War (1947–1953)''' is the period within the [[Cold War]] from the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947 to the conclusion of the [[Korean War]] in 1953.  The [[Origins of the Cold War|Cold War began]] almost immediately following [[World War II]] and lasted through most of the 20th century.

==Creation of the Eastern Bloc==

{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}
During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union annexed several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].  Most of those territories had been ceded to it by the secret agreement portion of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name="britannicamr">Encyclopædia Britannica, ''German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact'', 2008</ref><ref name="mrtext">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed August 23, 1939</ref>   These later annexed territories include Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),<ref name="stalinswars43">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}</ref> [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}</ref><ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn">Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 ISBN 978-90-420-2225-6</ref> [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn"/> [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),<ref name="wettig20"/><ref name="senn"/> part of eastern [[Finland]] (became part of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])<ref name="ckpipe">Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, ISBN 0-7190-4201-1</ref> and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).<ref name="stalinswars55">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}</ref><ref name="shirer794">{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}</ref>

Several of the other countries it occupied that were not directly annexed into the [[USSR]] became [[Satellite state|Soviet satellite states]].  In [[East Germany]] after local election losses, a forced merger of political parties in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party ("SED")]], followed by elections in 1946 where political opponents were oppressed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}</ref> In the non-[[USSR]] annexed portion of [[Poland]], less than a third of Poland's population voted in favor of massive communist land reforms and industry nationalizations<ref>Curp, David, ''A Clean Sweep?: The Politics of Ethnic Cleansing in Western Poland, 1945–1960'', Boydell & Brewer, 2006, ISBN 1-58046-238-3, pages 66–69</ref> in a policies referendum known as "[[Polish people's referendum, 1946|3 times YES]]" (''3 razy TAK''; ''3xTAK''), whereupon a second [[electoral fraud|vote rigged]] election was held to get the desired result.<ref name="Buchanan">Tom Buchanan, ''Europe's Troubled Peace, 1945–2000: 1945–2000'', Blackwell Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0-631-22163-8, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0631221638&id=zeqdrL3Wzy8C&pg=RA1-PA84&lpg=RA1-PA84&ots=sdtzUrdhbs&dq=Polish+referendum+1946+falsified&sig=5einoBUu1HWsfCzOoauJcrxCTvg Google Print, p.84]</ref><ref name="poloniatodayhistory">[http://www.poloniatoday.com/history13.htm A brief history of Poland: Chapter 13: The Post-War Years, 1945–1990].

In [[Hungary]], when the Soviets installed a communist government, [[Mátyás Rákosi]] was appointed [[General Secretary]] of the [[Hungarian Communist Party]],<ref name="sugar375">Sugar, Peter F., Peter Hanak and Tibor Frank, ''A History of Hungary'', Indiana University Press, 1994, ISBN 0-253-20867-X, page 375-77</ref> which began one of the harshest dictatorships in Europe<ref name="granville">Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&M University Press, 2004.

In [[Bulgaria]], toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union crossed the border and created the conditions for a communist [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état]] on the following night.<ref name="wettig50">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=50}}</ref> The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the communists whom he instructed, including [[Kimon Georgiev]] (who was not a communist himself, but a member of the elitarian political organization "[[Zveno]]", working together with the communists), took full control of domestic politics<ref name="wettig50"/> in the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]].

With Soviet backing, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] assumed undisputed control over the government of Czechoslovakia in the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]], ushering in a dictatorship.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Grogin|2001|pp=134–35}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Saxonberg|2001|p=15}}</ref>  In the [[Romanian general election, 1946|Romanian general election elections of 1946]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) employed widespread intimidation tactics and electoral fraud to obtain 80 percent of the vote and, thereafter, eliminated the role of the centrist parties and forced mergers, the result of which was that, by 1948, most non-Communist politicians were either executed, in exile or in prison. In the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1945|December 1945 Albanian election]], the only effective ballot choices were those of the communist [[Democratic Front (Albania)]], led by [[Enver Hoxha]].<ref name="cook17">{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}</ref><ref name="cook17"/>  In 1946, Albania was declared the [[People's Republic of Albania]].

Initially, Stalin directed systems in the Eastern Bloc countries that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.<ref name="hardt12">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}</ref> They were economically communist and depended upon the Soviet Union for significant amounts of materials.<ref name="hardt15">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=15}}</ref>  While in the first five years following World War II, massive emigration from these states to the West occurred, restrictions implemented thereafter stopped most East-West migration, except that under limited bilateral and other agreements.<ref name="bocker209">{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=209}}</ref>

==Containment==
The immediate post-1945 period may have been the historical high point for the popularity of [[communism|communist]] ideology. The burdens the [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Union]] endured had earned it massive respect which, had it been fully exploited by [[Joseph Stalin]], had a good chance of resulting in a communist Europe. Communist parties achieved a significant popularity in such nations as [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], and the [[Republic of Mahabad]]. Communist parties had already come to power in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Yugoslavia]]. The [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] were concerned that electoral victories by communist parties in any of these countries could lead to sweeping economic and political change in [[Western Europe]].

===Morgenthau and Marshall Plans===
{{Further|Morgenthau Plan|Marshall Plan|Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948}}
Having lost 27 million people in the war, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany's capacity for another war, and pushed for such in wartime conferences. The resulting [[Morgenthau plan]] policy foresaw returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry. Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]].<ref>[[John Gimbel]] [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-3195%28197206%2987%3A2%3C242%3AOTIOTP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 "''On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy"''] Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2.

In January 1947, Truman appointed General [[George Marshall]] as Secretary of State, and enacted JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."<ref name="beschloss277">{{Harvnb|Beschloss|2003|p=277}}</ref> The directive comported with the view of  General [[Lucius D. Clay]] and the [[Joint Chief of Staff]] over growing communist influence in [[Germany]], as well as of the failure of the rest of the European economy to recover without the German industrial base on which it previously had been dependent. Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.<ref name="miller16">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}</ref> After six weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.<ref name="miller16"/> Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.<ref name="miller16"/> The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.<ref name="miller16"/>  In a June 5, 1947 speech,<ref name="marshallspeech">Marshall, George C, ''[[s:The Marshall Plan Speech|The Marshal Plan Speech]]'', June 5, 1947</ref> comporting with the [[Truman Doctrine]], Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the [[Marshall Plan]].<ref name="miller16"/>

===The Greek Civil War and the Truman Doctrine===
{{Main|Truman Doctrine|Greek Civil War}}
Both East and West regarded [[Greece]] as a nation well within the sphere of influence of Britain. Stalin had respected his agreement with [[Winston Churchill]] to not intervene, but Yugoslavia and Albania defied the USSR's advice and sent supplies during the [[Greek Civil War]] to the partisan forces of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the ELAS (National Popular Liberation Army). The UK had given aid to the royalist Greek forces and ELAS leaders who, failing to realize that there would be no Soviet aid and having boycotted the elections, were at a disadvantaged position. However, by 1947, the near-bankrupt British government could no longer maintain its massive overseas commitments. In addition to granting [[Partition of India|independence to India]] and handing back the [[Palestinian Mandate]] to the [[United Nations]], the British government decided to withdraw from both Greece and nearby Turkey. This would have left the two nations, in particular Greece, on the brink of a communist-led revolution.

Notified that British aid to Greece and Turkey would end in less than six weeks, and already hostile towards and suspicious of Soviet intentions, because of their [[Iran crisis of 1946|reluctance to withdraw from Iran]], the Truman administration decided that additional action was necessary.  With [[United States Congress|Congress]] solidly in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] hands, and with [[isolationism|isolationist]] sentiment strong among the U.S. public, Truman adopted an ideological approach. In a meeting with congressional leaders, the argument of "apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one" was used to convince them of the significance in supporting Greece and Turkey. It was to become the "[[domino theory]]". On the morning of March 12, 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appeared before Congress to ask for $400 million of aid to Greece and Turkey. Calling on congressional approval for the United States to "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures," or in short a policy of "[[containment]]", Truman articulated a presentation of the ideological struggle that became known as the "Truman Doctrine." Although based on a simplistic analysis of internal strife in Greece and Turkey, it became the single dominating influence over U.S. policy until at least the [[Vietnam War]].

Truman's speech had a tremendous effect. The anti-communist feelings that had just begun to hatch in the U.S. were given a great boost, and a silenced Congress voted overwhelmingly in approval of aid. The United States would not withdraw back to the [[Western Hemisphere]] as it had after [[World War I]]. From then on, the U.S. actively engaged any communist threats anywhere in the globe under the ostensible causes of "freedom", "democracy" and "human rights." The U.S. brandished its role as the leader of the "free world." Meanwhile, the Soviet Union brandished its position as the leader of the "progressive" and "anti-imperialist" camp.

===U.S. Military Doctrine Debate===
{{Main|Revolt of the Admirals}}

After [[World War II]], the [[General (United States)|generals]] of the newly formed [[U.S. Air Force]] propounded a new [[Military doctrine|doctrine]]: that [[strategic bombing]], particularly with [[nuclear weapon]]s, was the sole decisive element necessary to win any future war; and was therefore the sole means necessary to deter an adversary from launching a [[Pearl Harbor]] like surprise attack or war against the United States. To implement this doctrine, which the Air Force and its supporters regarded as the highest national priority, the Air Force proposed that it should be funded by the Congress to build a large fleet of U.S. based long-range strategic [[heavy bomber]]s.  The Air Force generals argued that this project should receive large amounts of funding, beginning with the [[Convair B-36|B-36 Peacemaker]] bomber.<ref>Air Force insistence on their [[monopoly]] for this strategic role also helped kill the [[P6M SeaMaster]]. Piet, Stan, and Raithel, Al. ''Martin P6M SeaMaster''. Bel Air, Maryland: Martineer Press, 2001, p. 148.</ref>

The [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] of the Navy disagreed. Pointing to the overwhelming dominance of the [[aircraft carrier]] in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]], they asked the [[United States Congress]] to fund a large fleet of "[[supercarrier]]s" and their supporting [[Carrier battle group|battle groups]], beginning with the [[USS United States (CVA-58)|USS ''United States'' (CVA-58)]]. The Navy leadership believed that wars could not be won by strategic bombing alone, with or without the use of nuclear weapons.  The Navy also maintained that to decide, at the outset of any future conflict, to initiate the widespread use of nuclear weapons—attacking the major population centers of the enemy homeland—was immoral.

===''Nazi-Soviet relations'' and ''Falsifiers of History''===

{{Main|Falsifiers of History}}
Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] also published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]<ref name="henig67"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}</ref> revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,<ref name="roberts97">{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}</ref> the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],<ref name="roberts97"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}</ref> and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}</ref>

===Berlin Blockade===
[[Image:C-54landingattemplehof.jpg|thumb|Berliners watching a C-54 land at Tempelhof Airport (1948)]]
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}
After the [[Marshall Plan]], the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased [[Reichsmark]] and massive electoral losses for communist parties in 1946, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to [[Berlin]].  On the day of the Berlin Blockade, a Soviet representative told the other occupying powers  "We are warning both you and the population of Berlin that we shall apply economic and administrative sanctions that will lead to circulation in Berlin exclusively of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone."<ref name="miller32">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=32}}</ref>

Thereafter, street and water communications were severed, rail and barge traffic was stopped and the Soviets initially stopped supplying food to the civilian population in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.<ref name="miller25">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=25–31}}</ref>  Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the other occupying powers had previously relied on Soviet good will for access to Berlin, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.<ref name="miller6">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=6–7}}</ref>

By February 1948, because of massive post-war military cuts, the entire United States army had been reduced to 552,000 men.<ref name="miller28">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=28}}</ref>  Military forces in non-Soviet Berlin sectors totaled only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.<ref name="miller33">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=33}}</ref>  Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled one and a half million men.<ref name="miller30">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=30}}</ref> The two United States regiments in Berlin would have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.<ref name="miller29">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=29}}</ref> Believing that Britain, France and the United States had little option other than to acquiesce, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany celebrated the beginning of the blockade.<ref name="miller35">{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=35}}</ref> Thereafter, a massive aerial supply campaign of food, water and other goods was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries.<ref name=mac>''MAC and the Legacy of the Berlin Airlift''</ref> The Soviets derided "the futile attempts of the Americans to save face and to maintain their untenable position in Berlin."<ref name=indiana>[http://www.indianamilitary.org/ATTERBURYAAF/History/BerlinAirlift.html ''Fifty years ago, a massive airlift into Berlin showed the Soviets that a post-WW II blockade would not work''], C.V. Glines</ref>   The success of the airlift eventually caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.

===Tito-Stalin Split===
{{Further|Tito–Stalin split}}
After disagreements between Yugoslavian leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] and the Soviet Union regarding Greece and the [[People's Republic of Albania]], a [[Tito-Stalin split]] occurred, followed by Yugoslavia being expelled from the [[Cominform]] in June 1948 and a brief failed Soviet putsch in Belgrade.<ref name="wettig156">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=156}}</ref>  The split created two separate communist forces in Europe.<ref name="wettig156"/>  A vehement campaign against "Titoism" was immediately started in the Eastern Bloc, describing agents of both the West and Tito in all places engaging in subversive activity.<ref name="wettig156"/> This resulted in the persecution of many major party cadres, including those in East Germany.<ref name="wettig157">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=157}}</ref>

===NATO===
[[File:Nato 1970.jpg|thumb|right|[[NATO]] v. the [[Warsaw Pact]]]]
The United States joined Britain, France, Canada, Denmark, Portugal, Norway, Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, Italy, and the Netherlands in 1949 to form the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the United States' first "entangling" European alliance in 170 years. West Germany, Spain, Greece, and Turkey would later join this alliance. The Eastern leaders retaliated against these steps by integrating the economies of their nations in [[Comecon]], their version of the [[Marshall Plan]]; exploding the first Soviet [[nuclear weapon|atomic device]] in 1949; signing an alliance with [[People's Republic of China]] in February 1950; and forming the [[Warsaw Pact]], Eastern Europe's counterpart to NATO, in 1955. The Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland founded this military alliance.

===NSC-68===
U.S. officials quickly moved to escalate and expand "containment." In a secret 1950 document, [[NSC-68]], they proposed to strengthen their alliance systems, quadruple defense spending, and embark on an elaborate propaganda campaign to convince the U.S. public to fight this costly cold war. Truman ordered the development of a [[hydrogen bomb]]. In early 1950, the U.S. took its first efforts to oppose communist forces in Vietnam; planned to form a West German army, and prepared proposals for a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases there.

==Chinese Civil War==
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}
Shortly after World War II, the civil war resumed in China between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) led by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. The USSR had signed a Treaty of Friendship with the Kuomintang in 1945 and disavowed support for the Chinese Communists. The outcome was closely fought, with the Communists finally prevailing with superior military tactics. Although the Nationalists had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, initially controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries, and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|long war with Japan]] and the attendant internal responsibilities. In addition, the Chinese Communists were able to fill the political vacuum left in [[Manchuria]] after Soviet forces withdrew from the area and thus gained China's prime industrial base. The Chinese Communists were able to fight their way from the north and northeast, and virtually all of [[mainland China]] was taken by the end of 1949. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Chiang Kai-shek and 600,000 Nationalist troops and 2 million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from the mainland to the island of [[Taiwan]]. In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed [[Taipei]] the temporary capital of the Republic of China (ROC) and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.

The continued hostility between the Communists on the mainland and the Nationalists on Taiwan continued throughout the Cold War. Though the United States refused to aide Chiang Kai-shek in his hope to "recover the mainland," it continued supporting the Republic of China with military supplies and expertise to prevent Taiwan from falling into PRC hands. Through the support of the Western bloc (most Western countries continued to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China), the Republic of China on Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.

==Korean War==
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiates U.S. involvement in the Korean War.]]
{{Main|Korean War}}
In early 1950, the United States made its first commitment to form a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases. Some observers (including [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]) believed that the Japanese treaty led Stalin to approve a plan to invade U.S.-supported [[South Korea]] on June 25, 1950. [[Korea]] had been divided at the end of World War II along the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones, in which a communist government was installed in the [[North Korea|North]] by the Soviets, and an elected government in the South came to power after UN-supervised elections in 1948.

In June 1950, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea.<ref name="Stokesbury1990">{{cite book |title= A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first= James L|year= 1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location= New York|isbn= 0-688-09513-5|page=14}}</ref>  Fearing that communist Korea under a Kim Il Sung dictatorship could threaten Japan  and foster other communist movements in Asia, Truman committed U.S. forces and obtained help from the [[United Nations]] to counter the North Korean invasion. The Soviets boycotted [[UN Security Council]] meetings while protesting the Council's failure to seat the [[People's Republic of China]] and, thus, did not veto the Council's approval of UN action to oppose the North Korean invasion. A joint UN force of personnel from South Korea, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[France]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]] and other countries joined to stop the invasion.<ref>Fehrenbach, T. R., ''This Kind of War: The Classic Korean War History'', Brassey's, 2001, ISBN 1-57488-334-8, page 305</ref>  After a Chinese invasion to assist the North Koreans, fighting stabilized along the 38th parallel, which had separated the Koreas. Truman faced a hostile China, a Sino-Soviet partnership, and a defense budget that had quadrupled in eighteen months.

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] was signed in July 1953 after the death of Stalin, who had been insisting that the North Koreans continue fighting.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Byrd, Peter|editor=McLean, Iain; McMillan, Alistair|encyclopedia=The concise Oxford dictionary of politics|title=Cold War (entire chapter)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xLbEHQAACAAJ&ei=E45VSJrQO4e4jgGh_oWODA|accessdate=2008-06-16|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280276-3}}</ref>  In North Korea, Kim Il-sung created a highly centralized and brutal [[dictatorship]], according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable [[cult of personality]].<ref>Oberdorfer, Don, ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'', Basic Books, 2001, ISBN 0-465-05162-6, page 10-11</ref><ref>No, Kum-Sok and  J.

==Hydrogen Bomb==
A [[hydrogen bomb]]—which produced [[nuclear fusion]] instead of [[nuclear fission]]—was first tested by the United States in November 1952 and the Soviet Union in August 1953.  Such bombs were first deployed in the 1960s.

==Culture and media==
[[File:DuckandCover.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The title screen from ''Duck and Cover''.]]

{{refimprove section|date=September 2009}}
Fear of a nuclear war spurred the production of public safety films by the [[Federal Government of the United States|United States federal government's]] [[Civil Defense]] branch that demonstrated ways on protecting oneself from a Soviet nuclear attack.  The 1951 children's film ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' is a prime example.

George Orwell's classic dystopia [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] was published in 1949. The novel explores life in an imagined future world where a totalitarian government has achieved terrifying levels of power and control. With Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell taps into the anti-communist fears that would continue to haunt so many in the West for decades to come. In a Cold War setting his descriptions could hardly fail to evoke comparison to Soviet communism and the seeming willingness of Stalin and his successors to control those within the Soviet bloc by whatever means necessary. Orwell's famous allegory of totalitarian rule, [[Animal Farm]], published in 1945, provoked similar anti-communist sentiments.

==Significant documents==
*[[Potsdam Declaration]]:  July 26, 1945. An informal statement issued by Harry S. Truman, [[Winston Churchill]], and [[Chiang Kai-Shek]], which outlined the terms for a [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Japanese surrender]].
*[[Baruch Plan]]: 1946. A proposal by the U.S. to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) to a) extend between all nations the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends; b) implement control of atomic  energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes; c) eliminate from national armaments atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and d) establish effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions. When the Soviet Union was the only member state which refused to sign, the U.S. embarked on a massive nuclear weapons testing, development, and deployment program.
*The Long Telegram and The "[[X Article]]", 1946–1947. Formally titled "''The Sources of Soviet Conduct''". The article describes the concepts that became the foundation of United States Cold War policy and was published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' in 1947. The article was an expansion of a well-circulated top secret [[State Department]] cable called the X Article and became famous for setting forth the doctrine of containment. Though the article was signed [[pseudonym]]ously by "X," it was well known at the time that the true author was [[George F. Kennan]], the deputy chief of mission of the United States to the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1946, under [[ambassador]] [[W. Averell Harriman]].
*[[NSC-68]]: April 14, 1950. A [[classified information|classified]] report written and issued by the [[United States National Security Council]]. The report outlined the [[National Security Strategy of the United States]] for that time and provided a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of the Soviet Union and of the United States from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints. NSC-68's principal thesis was that the Soviet Union intended to become the single dominant world power. The report argued that the Soviet Union had a systematic strategy aimed at the spread of communism across the entire world, and it recommended that the United States government adopt a policy of containment to stop the further spread of Soviet power. NSC-68 outlined a drastic [[foreign policy]] shift from defensive to active containment and advocated aggressive military preparedness. NSC-68 shaped government actions in the Cold War for the next 20 years and has subsequently been labeled the "blueprint" for the Cold War.
*Speech by [[James F. Byrnes]],  [[United States Secretary of State]] "''[[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]''" [[Stuttgart]] September 6, 1946.  Also known as the "''Speech of hope,''" it set the tone of future U.S. policy as it repudiated the [[Morgenthau Plan]] economic policies and gave the Germans hope for the future. The Western powers worst fear was that the poverty and hunger would drive the Germans to communism. General [[Lucius D. Clay|Lucius Clay]] stated "There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand". The speech was also seen as a stand against the Soviet Union because it stated the firm intention of the United States to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. But the heart of the message was as Byrnes stated a month later "The nub of our program was to win the German people . . . it was a battle between us and Russia over minds. . . ."
