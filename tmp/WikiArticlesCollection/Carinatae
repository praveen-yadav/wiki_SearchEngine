The '''Carinatae''' are, in [[phylogenetic taxonomy]], the last common ancestor of the Neornithes ([[modern birds]]) and [[Ichthyornis]] (an extinct seabird of the [[Cretaceous]]), and all its descendants.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cracraft |first=Joel |authorlink= |year=1986 |month= |title=The origin and early diversification of birds |journal=[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=pp. 383–399 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> Defined in this way, the group includes all modern [[bird]]s, both living and recently extinct, and a few [[Mesozoic]] forms.

==Earlier definition==
Traditionally, Carinatae were defined as all birds whose [[sternum]] (breast bone) has a [[keel (bird)|keel]] (''carina''). The keel is a strong median ridge running down the length of the sternum. This is an important area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel. [[Ratite]]s, all of whom are flightless, lack a strong keel. Thus, living birds were divided into carinates (keeled) and ratites (from ''ratis'', "raft", referring to the flatness of the sternum). 

The difficulty with this scheme [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] was that some flightless birds, without strong carinae, are descended directly from ordinary flying birds with carinae. Examples include the [[Kakapo]], a flightless [[parrot]], and the [[dodo]], a columbiform (the [[pigeon]] family). None of these birds are ratites. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenic relationship.

==Current definition==
The use of a term for keeled sternum to describe the Ichthyornis–Neornithine group turned out to be equally inapt. Various dinosaurs – apparently, remote ancestors and cousins of the Carinatae – ''do'' possess a keeled sternum. So, evidently the presence of this structure does not necessarily imply its use in [[flight]]. This sort of definitional problem is one reason why the use of physical characteristics to name taxonomic groups is now discouraged. 

The characteristics that actually are unique to the Carinatae have little to do with the sternum. Rather, carinates are unique in having, for example, a globe-shaped, convex head on the [[humerus]] and fully fused bones in the lower leg and outer arm.

They also have a pterygoid bone that articulates with the [[palatine bone|palatine]] by means of a joint. The [[vomer]] is reduced or absent.<ref>W. R. Ogilvie-Grant (1921). Guide to the gallery of birds. Part 1. British Museum. (2nd Edn)</ref>
