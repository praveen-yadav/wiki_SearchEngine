[[Image:4 vials of human cerebrospinal fluid.jpg|thumb|Vials containing human cerebrospinal fluid.]]
'''Cerebrospinal fluid''' ('''CSF''') is a clear colorless [[bodily fluid]] found in the brain and spine. It is produced in the [[choroid plexus]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. It acts as a cushion or buffer for the cortex, providing a basic mechanical and [[immunological]] protection to the brain inside the [[Human skull|skull]], and it serves a vital function in cerebral [[autoregulation]] of [[cerebral blood flow]].

The CSF occupies the [[subarachnoid space]] (the space between the [[arachnoid mater]] and the [[pia mater]]) and the [[ventricular system]] around and inside the brain and [[spinal cord]]. It constitutes the content of the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]], [[Cistern (neuroanatomy)|cisterns]], and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]] of the brain, as well as the [[central canal]] of the [[spinal cord]].

==Functions==
CSF serves four primary purposes:

#'''Buoyancy:''' The actual [[mass]] of the [[human brain]] is about 1400&nbsp;grams; however, the net [[weight]] of the brain suspended in the CSF is equivalent to a [[mass]] of 25&nbsp;grams.<ref>

#'''Protection:''' CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit. In certain situations such as [[auto accidents]] or [[sports]] injuries, the CSF cannot protect the [[Human brain|brain]] from forced contact with the [[Human skull|skull]] case, causing [[hemorrhaging]], [[brain damage]], and sometimes [[death]].<ref name="Saladin 2007 520">{{cite book

#'''Chemical stability:''' CSF flows throughout the inner [[ventricular system]] in the brain and is absorbed back into the bloodstream, rinsing the [[metabolic waste]] from the [[central nervous system]] through the [[blood–brain barrier]]. This allows for homeostatic regulation of the distribution of [[neuroendocrine]] factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high [[glycine]] [[concentration]] disrupts [[temperature]] and [[blood pressure]] control, and high CSF [[pH]] causes [[dizziness]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].<ref name="Saladin 2007 520"/> To use Davson's term, the CSF has a "sink action" by which the various substances formed in the nervous tissue during its metabolic activity diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are thus removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.<ref>Allan H. Ropper, Robert H. Brown ''Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology'' McGraw-Hill Professional; 8 edition  (March 29, 2005) Ch. 30 p. 530.</ref>
#'''Prevention of brain [[ischemia]]:''' The prevention of brain ischemia is made by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the [[Human skull|skull]]. This decreases total [[intracranial pressure]] and facilitates [[blood]] [[perfusion]].

==History==
Various comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. [[Hippocrates]] discussed "water" surrounding the brain when describing congenital [[hydrocephalus]], and [[Galen]] referred to "excremental liquid" in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose.  But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remains unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of the CSF before the brain was examined.  The modern rediscovery of CSF is now credited to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as "spirituous lymph" secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.<ref name=CSFhistory>{{Cite journal | last =Hajdu | first =Steven I. | year = 2003 | title = A Note from History: Discovery of the Cerebrospinal Fluid | journal =Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science| volume = 33, number 3 | pages = 334–6 | doi = | url = http://www.annclinlabsci.org/content/33/3/334.full.pdf | pmid = 12956452 | issue =3 }}</ref>

[[Albrecht von Haller]], a Swiss physician and physiologist, Avery Kinsey, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the "water" in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.<ref name=CSFhistory/>

[[Francois Magendie]] studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the [[pia mater]].<ref name=CSFhistory/>

[[Thomas Willis]] (noted as the discoverer of the [[circle of Willis]]) made note of the fact that the consistency of the CSF is altered in meningitis.<ref name=CSFhistory/> 

In 1891, [[W. Essex Wynter]] began treating tubercular meningitis by tapping the subarachnoid space, and [[Heinrich Quincke]] began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.<ref name=CSFhistory/> In 19th and early 20th century literature, particularly German medical literature, ''liquor cerebrospinalis'' was a term used to refer to CSF.

In 1912, [[William Mestrezat]] gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of the CSF. In 1914, [[Harvey W. Cushing]] published conclusive evidence that the CSF is secreted by the [[choroid plexus]].<ref name=CSFhistory/>

==Circulation==
[[File:NPH MRI 272 GILD.gif|thumb|MRI showing pulsation of CSF]]
CSF is produced in the brain by modified [[ependymal cells]] in the [[choroid plexus]] (approx. 50-70%) and the remainder is formed around blood vessels and along ventricular walls. It circulates from the [[lateral ventricles]] to the [[Interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|foramina of Monro]] (Interventricular foramina), [[third ventricle]], [[aqueduct of Sylvius]] (Cerebral aqueduct), [[fourth ventricle]], [[foramen of Magendie]] (Median aperture) and [[Lateral aperture|foramina of Luschka]] (Lateral apertures), [[subarachnoid space]] over brain and spinal cord. It should be noted that the CSF moves in a pulsatile manner throughout the CSF system with nearly zero net flow.  CSF is reabsorbed into venous sinus blood via arachnoid granulations.

It had been thought that CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the [[dural venous sinuses]] via the [[arachnoid granulation]]s (or villi). However, some<ref name="pmid14636163">{{cite journal |author=Zakharov A, Papaiconomou C, Djenic J, Midha R, Johnston M |title=Lymphatic CSF absorption pathways in neonatal sheep revealed by [[sub arachnoid]] injection of Microfil |journal=Neuropathol.

The flow of CSF to the nasal [[submucous plexus|submucosal]] [[Lymph|lymphatic channels]] through the [[cribriform plate]] seems to be especially important.<ref name="pmid15624320">{{cite journal |author=Johnston M |title=The importance of lymphatics in cerebrospinal fluid transport |journal=Lymphat.

==Amount and constitution==
[[File:dist csf.png|thumb|Intracranial volumetric distribution of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and brain parenchyma]]
[[File:dist vent.png|thumb|Volumetric distribution of cerebrospinal fluid]]

The CSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40&nbsp;mg/dL, depending on sampling site,<ref name="pmid4456012">{{cite journal |author=Felgenhauer K |title=Protein size and CSF composition |journal=Klin.

Since the subarachnoid space around the brain and spinal cord can contain only 135 to 150 ml, large amounts are drained primarily into the blood through [[arachnoid granulations]] in the [[superior sagittal sinus]]. Thus the CSF turns over about 3.7 times a day.<!-- <reference Ganong> --> This continuous flow into the [[venous system]] dilutes the concentration of larger, lipid-insoluble molecules penetrating the brain and CSF.<ref name="pmid10027064">{{cite journal |author=Saunders NR, Habgood MD, Dziegielewska KM |title=Barrier mechanisms in the brain, I.

When lying down, the cerebrospinal fluid as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the [[intracranial pressure]].

==Pathology and laboratory diagnosis==
[[Image:CSFposter1p.png|thumb|right|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at glance.]]
When CSF pressure is elevated, [[cerebral blood flow]] may be constricted. When disorders of CSF flow occur, they may therefore affect not only CSF movement but also craniospinal compliance and the intracranial blood flow, with subsequent neuronal and glial vulnerabilities. The venous system is also important in this equation. Infants and patients shunted as small children may have particularly unexpected relationships between pressure and ventricular size, possibly due in part to venous pressure dynamics. This may have significant treatment implications, but the underlying pathophysiology needs to be further explored.   

CSF connections with the [[lymphatic system]] have been demonstrated in several [[mammal]]ian systems. Preliminary data suggest that these CSF-lymph connections form around the time that the CSF secretory capacity of the [[choroid plexus]] is developing (in [[uterus|utero]]). There may be some relationship between CSF disorders, including [[hydrocephalus]] and impaired CSF lymphatic transport.

CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of [[neurological disease]]s.<ref name="pmid14524396">{{cite journal |author=Seehusen DA, Reeves MM, Fomin DA |title=CSF analysis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=1103–8 |year=2003 |month=September |pmid=14524396 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030915/1103.html}}</ref> It is usually obtained by a procedure called [[lumbar puncture]]. Removal of CSF during lumbar puncture can cause a severe headache after the fluid is removed, because the brain hangs on the vessels and nerve roots, and traction on them stimulates pain fibers. This pain can be relieved by intrathecal injection of sterile isotonic saline. Lumbar puncture is performed in an attempt to count the cells in the fluid and to detect the levels of protein and glucose. These parameters alone may be extremely beneficial in the diagnosis of [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] and [[central nervous system]] infections (such as [[meningitis]]). Moreover, a CSF [[Microbiological culture|culture]] examination may yield the [[microorganism]] that has caused the infection. By using more sophisticated methods, such as the detection of the [[oligoclonal bands]], an ongoing inflammatory condition (for example, [[multiple sclerosis]]) can be recognized. A [[beta-2 transferrin]] assay is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for, e.g., CSF leakage.

==Lumbar puncture==
[[Lumbar puncture]] can also be performed to measure the [[intracranial pressure]], which might be increased in certain types of [[hydrocephalus]]. However a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to [[brain herniation]] and ultimately death.

==Baricity==
This fluid has an importance in anesthesiology.  [[Baricity]] refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid. Baricity is used in [[anesthesia]] to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the [[intrathecal]] space.

==Alzheimer's disease==
A 2010 study showed analysis of CSF for three protein biomarkers can indicate the presence of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The three biomarkers are CSF amyloid beta 1-42, total CSF tau protein and P-Tau<sub>181P</sub>. In the study, the biomarker test showed good [[specificity and sensitivity|sensitivity]], identifying 90% of persons with Alzheimer's disease, but poor [[specificity and sensitivity|specificity]], as 36% of control subjects were positive for the biomarkers. The researchers suggested the low specificity may be explained by developing but not yet symptomatic disease in controls.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Diagnosis-Independent Alzheimer Disease Biomarker Signature in Cognitively Normal Elderly People |url= http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/67/8/949 |journal= Archive of Neurology  |last= De Meyer |first= Geert |date= August 2010 |pages= 949–56 |volume= 67 |pmid= 20697045 |issue= 8 |doi= 10.1001/archneurol.2010.179 |accessdate= 2010-09-08 |pmc=2963067 |display-authors= 1 |last2= Shapiro |first2= F. |last3= Vanderstichele |first3= H. |last4= Vanmechelen |first4= E. |last5= Engelborghs |first5= S. |last6= De Deyn |first6= P.
