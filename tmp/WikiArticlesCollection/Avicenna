==Circumstances==
Avicenna created an extensive corpus of works during what is commonly known as [[Islamic Golden Age|Islam's Golden Age]], in which the translations of Greco-Roman, Persian, and Indian texts were studied extensively. Greco-Roman ([[Middle Platonism|Mid-]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonic]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]) texts by the [[Al-Kindi|Kindi]] school were commented, redacted and developed substantially by Islamic intellectuals, who also built upon Persian and [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematical]] systems, [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]] and [[Ancient Iranian Medicine|medicine]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= |title=Major periods of Muslim education and learning |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-12-16|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071212112030/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-47496/education| archivedate= 12 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[Samanid dynasty]] in the eastern part of [[Persia]], [[Greater Khorasan]] and [[Central Asia]] as well as the [[Buyid dynasty]] in the western part of [[Persia]] and [[Iraq]] provided a thriving atmosphere for scholarly and cultural development. Under the Samanids, [[Bukhara]] rivaled [[Baghdad]] as a cultural capital of the Islamic world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Afary |first=Janet | authorlink=Janet Afary |title=Iran |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-12-16|location=|publisher=|url=http://p2.www.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=106324&fullArticle=true&tocId=9106324}}</ref>

The study of the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] thrived in such a scholarly atmosphere. Philosophy, [[Fiqh]] and theology ([[kalaam]]) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. [[Al-Razi]] and [[Al-Farabi]] had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of [[Balkh]], [[Khwarezm]], [[Gorgan]], [[Ray, Iran|Rey]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Hamadan]]. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. [[Aruzi Samarqandi]] describes how before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Rayhan Biruni]] (a famous scientist and astronomer), [[Abu Nasr Mansur|Abu Nasr Iraqi]] (a renowned mathematician), [[Abu Sahl Masihi]] (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician).

==Biography==

===Early life===
The only source of information for the first part of Avicenna's life is his autobiography, as written down by his student Jūzjānī. In the absence of any other sources it is impossible to be certain how much of the autobiography is accurate. It has been noted that he uses his autobiography to advance his theory of knowledge (that it was possible for an individual to acquire knowledge and understand the Aristotelian philosophical sciences without a teacher), and it has been questioned whether the order of events described was adjusted to fit more closely with the Aristotelian model; in other words, whether Avicenna described himself as studying things in the 'correct' order. However given the absence of any other evidence, Avicenna's account essentially has to be taken at face value.<ref>[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-ii Avicenna biography]</ref>

Avicenna was born c. 980 in Afšana, a village near [[Bukhara]] (in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]), the capital of the [[Samanids]], a Persian dynasty in [[Central Asia]] and [[Greater Khorasan]]. His mother, named Setareh, was from Bukhara;<ref>''"Avicenna"''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Concise Online Version, 2006 ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011433/Avicenna]); D.

His father was at the time of his son's birth the governor in one of the [[Samanid]] Nuh ibn Mansur's estates. He had his son very carefully educated at Bukhara. Ibn Sina's independent thought was served by an extraordinary intelligence and memory, which allowed him to overtake his teachers at the age of fourteen. As he said in his autobiography, there was nothing that he had not learned when he reached eighteen.

A number of different theories have been proposed regarding Avicenna's [[madhab]]. Medieval historian Ẓahīr al-dīn al-Bayhaqī (d. 1169) considered Avicenna to be a follower of the [[Brethren of Purity]].<ref name="Janssens91">{{Cite book| publisher = Leuven University Press| isbn = 978-90-6186-476-9| last = Janssens| first = Jules L.| title = An annotated bibliography on Ibn Sînâ (1970–1989): including Arabic and Persian publications and Turkish and Russian references | year = 1991 | pages=89–90}} excerpt: "<expand>...&nbsp;[Dimitri Gutas's ''Avicenna's maḏhab''] convincingly demonstrates that I.S. was a sunnî-Ḥanafî."[http://books.google.ca/books?id=3KizrKA5YJ8C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA89&dq=ibn+sina+hanafi&source=bl&ots=RWb5VAGHA4&sig=ZRBh96ucZNIraZlNQotllhxCF_k&hl=en&ei=F8WuTLm6MJDEsAPjn9GnDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=ibn%20sina%20hanafi&f=false]</ref> On the other hand, [[Dimitri Gutas]] along with Aisha Khan and Jules J.

According to his autobiography, Avicenna had memorised the entire Qur'an by the age of 10.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine|title=The Canon of Medicine (work by Avicenna)|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080528230506/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-92902/The-Canon-of-Medicine| archivedate= 28 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He learned [[Indian mathematics|Indian arithmetic]] from an [[History of India|Indian]] greengrocer, and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young.

Noone (2003), ''A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages'', p. 196, [[Blackwell Publishing]], ISBN 0-631-21673-1.</ref>

As a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' of [[Aristotle]], which he could not understand until he read [[al-Farabi]]'s commentary on the work.<ref name="Corbin1993" /> For the next year and a half, he studied [[philosophy]], in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions ([[wudu]]), then go to the [[mosque]], and continue in prayer ([[salat]]) till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the ''Metaphysics'' of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by [[Farabi]], which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.

He turned to [[medicine]] at 16, and not only learned medical theory, but also by gratuitous attendance of the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of treatment. The teenager achieved full status as a qualified physician at age 18,<ref name=Britannica/> and found that "Medicine is no hard and thorny science, like [[mathematics]] and [[metaphysics]], so I soon made great progress; I became an excellent doctor and began to treat patients, using approved remedies." The youthful physician's fame spread quickly, and he treated many patients without asking for payment.

===Adulthood===

[[File:Avicenna.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Avicenna from 1271]]

Ibn Sina's first appointment was that of physician to the [[emir]], who owed him his recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal [[library]] of the [[Samanids]], well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.

When Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The [[Samanid dynasty]] came to its end in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir|Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Dailam]] and central [[Persia]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].

Ibn Sina subsequently settled at [[Ray, Iran|Rai]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], (present day capital of Iran), the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in [[Ray, Iran|Rai]]. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamadãn where  Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in [[shaikh|sheikh]] Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.

Meanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the [[prefect]] of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamadãn; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.

===Later life and death===
[[File:Hamadan1.jpg|thumb|200px|Avicenna's tomb in [[Hamadan]], [[Iran]].]]
[[File:Avicenna Mausoleum interior.jpg|thumb|200px||The inside view of Avicenna's tomb in Hamadan, Iran.]]
[[File:Canon-Avicenna.jpg|thumb|200px|The first page of a manuscript, authored by Ibn Sina.]]

The remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn Sīnā's life were spent in the service of Abu Ja'far 'Ala Addaula, whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.

During these years he began to study [[literature|literary]] matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style.  A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.

==Avicenna philosophy==
Ibn Sīnā wrote extensively on [[early Islamic philosophy]], especially the subjects [[logic]], [[ethics]], and [[metaphysics]], including treatises named ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics''. Most of his works were written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] - which was the ''de facto'' scientific [[language]] of the time in the Middle East, and some were written in the [[Persian language]]. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Ibn Sīnā's commentaries on Aristotle often corrected the philosopher,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]].

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], due to Avicenna's successful{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} reconciliation between [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] along with [[Kalam]], Avicennism eventually became the leading school of [[Islamic philosophy]] by the 12th century, with Avicenna becoming a central authority on philosophy.<ref>Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p.&nbsp;80–81, "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]</ref>

Avicennism was also influential in [[medieval Europe]], particular his doctrines on the nature of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and his [[existence]]-[[essence]] distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in scholastic Europe. This was particularly the case in [[Paris]], where Avicennism was later [[proscribed]] in 1210. Nevertheless, his [[psychology]] and theory of knowledge influenced [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], while his metaphysics had an impact on the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm#H5 |title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980-1037) |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |date=2006-01-06 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref>

===Metaphysical doctrine===
Early Islamic philosophy and [[Islamic metaphysics]], imbued as it is with [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], distinguishes more clearly than [[Aristotelianism]] the difference between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to [[metaphysics]], owes much to [[al-Farabi]]. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.

Following al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name="Islam in Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= |title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archivedate= 22 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Avicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G. C. Anawati, Ibrahim Madkour, Sa'id Zayed (Cairo, 1975), p. 36</ref><ref>[[Nader El-Bizri]], "Avicenna and Essentialism," ''Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (2001), pp.&nbsp;753–778</ref> The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', and has no quiddity/essence (''mahiyya'') other than existence (''wujud''). Furthermore, It is 'One' (''wahid ahad'')<ref>Avicenna, ''Metaphysica of Avicenna'', trans. Parviz Morewedge (New York, 1973), p. 43.</ref> since there cannot be more than one 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without differentia (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require differentia entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. However, if no differentia distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and the same.<ref>Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)</ref>  Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus (''jins''), nor a definition (''hadd''), nor a counterpart (''nadd''), nor an opposite (''did''), and is detached (''bari''') from matter (''madda''), quality (''kayf''), quantity (''kam''), place (''ayn''), situation (''wad'''), and time (''waqt'').<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-Hidaya'', ed.

===Natural philosophy===
Ibn Sina and [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] engaged in a written debate, with Abu Rayhan Biruni mostly criticizing [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] and the [[Peripatetic school]], while Avicenna and his student Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Ma'sumi respond to Biruni's criticisms in writing. Abu Rayhan began by asking Avicenna eighteen questions, ten of which were criticisms of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On the Heavens]]''.<ref>Rafik Berjak and Muzaffar Iqbal, "Ibn Sina—Al-Biruni correspondence", ''Islam & Science'', June 2003.</ref>

===Theology===
Ibn Sīnā was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with [[Islamic theology]]. His aim was to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through [[reason]] and [[logic]].<ref name=Goodman-8-9>Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p.&nbsp;8–9, [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-513580-6.</ref> Avicenna wrote a number of treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the [[Islamic prophet]]s, whom he viewed as "inspired philosophers", and on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the [[Qur'an]], such as how Quranic [[cosmology]] corresponds to his own philosophical system.<ref>James W. Morris (1992), "The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy", in C. Butterworth (ed.), ''The Political Aspects of Islamic PhIlosophy'', Chapter 4, Cambridge [[Harvard University Press]], p.&nbsp;142–188 [159-161].</ref>

Ibn Sīnā [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized the Qur'an]] by the age of ten, and as an adult, he wrote five treatises commenting on [[sura]]s from the Qur'an. One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Qur'an in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.<ref>Jules Janssens (2004), "Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&nbsp;177–192.</ref>

===Thought experiments===
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], Avicenna wrote his famous "Floating Man" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Avicenna believed his "Floating Man" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input.  The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]].  Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.  The conceivability of this "Floating Man" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body.  Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human [[mind]] and imparts order and intelligibility to [[nature]]. However, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.  Sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal Agent Intellect.  The first knowledge of the flying person would be "I am," affirming his or her essence.  That essence could not be the body, obviously, as the flying person has no sensation.  Thus, the knowledge that "I am" is the core of a human being:  the soul exists and is self-aware.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hasse|first=Dag Nikolaus|title=Avicenna's De Anima in the Latin West|year=2000|publisher=Warburg Institute|location=London|page=81}}</ref>  Avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the [[self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[substance theory|substance]].

About 100 treatises were ascribed to Ibn Sina. Some of them are tracts of a few pages. Others are works extending through several volumes. His 14-volume ''The Canon of Medicine'' (Al-Qanoon fi al-Tibb, The Laws of Medicine) was a standard medical text in Europe and the Islamic world until the 18th century.<ref>[[Ziauddin Sardar]], [http://www.cgcu.net/imase/islam_science_philosophy.htm Science in Islamic philosophy]</ref>

===Medicine and pharmacology===
The book is known for its description of [[Infectious disease|contagious diseases]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s,<ref name=Zahoor>[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science''.<br />([[cf.]] Dr. A. Zahoor and Dr. Z. Haq (1997). [http://www.cyberistan.org/islamic/Introl1.html Quotations From Famous Historians of Science], Cyberistan.)</ref> [[quarantine]] to limit the spread of [[infectious disease]]s, and testing of medicines. Ibn Sīnā adopted, from the Greeks, the theory that epidemics are caused by pollution in the air ([[Miasma theory of disease|miasma]]).<ref>Joseph Patrick Byrne (2008). "[http://books.google.com/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA33&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A-M]". [[ABC-CLIO]]. p.33. ISBN 0-313-34102-8.</ref> It classifies and describes [[disease]]s, and outlines their assumed causes. [[Hygiene]], simple and complex medicines, and functions of parts of the body are also covered. The Canon agrees with [[Aristotle]] (and disagrees with [[Hippocrates]]) that [[tuberculosis]] was contagious, a fact which was not universally accepted in Europe until centuries later. It also describes the symptoms and complications of [[diabetes]]. Both forms of facial paralysis were described in-depth.

''The Canon of Medicine'' discussed how to effectively test new medicines:

*The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality.
*It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease.
*The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones.
*The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them.
*The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused.
*The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect.
*The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man.

An Arabic edition of the ''Canon'' appeared at Rome in 1593, and a Hebrew version at Naples in 1491. Of the Latin version there were about thirty editions, founded on the original translation by [[Gerard de Sabloneta]]. In the 15th century a commentary on the text of the ''Canon'' was composed. Other medical works translated into Latin are the ''Medicamenta Cordialia'', ''Canticum de Medicina'', and the ''Tractatus de Syrupo Acetoso''.

It was mainly accident which determined that from the 12th to the 18th century, Ibn Sīnā should be the guide of medical study in European universities, and eclipse the names of [[Rhazes]], [[Ali ibn Abbas al-Magusi|Ali ibn al-Abbas]] and [[Averroes]]. His work is not essentially different from that of his predecessor Rhazes, because he presented the doctrine of [[Galen]], and through Galen the doctrine of [[Hippocrates]], modified by the system of [[Aristotle]]. But the ''Canon'' of Ibn Sīnā is distinguished from the ''Al-Hawi'' (Continence) or ''Summary'' of Rhazes by its greater method, due perhaps to the logical studies of the former.

The work has been variously appreciated in subsequent ages, some regarding it as a treasury of wisdom, and others, like Averroes, holding it useful only as waste paper. In modern times it has been mainly of historic interest as most of its tenets have been disproved or expanded upon by scientific medicine. The vice of the book is excessive classification of bodily faculties, and over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases. It includes five books; of which the first and second discuss [[physiology]], [[pathology]] and [[hygiene]], the third and fourth deal with the methods of treating disease, and the fifth describes the composition and preparation of remedies. This last part contains some personal observations.

He is ample in the enumeration of symptoms, and is said to be inferior in practical medicine and [[surgery]]. He introduced into medical theory the ''four causes of the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] system''. Of [[natural history]] and [[botany]] he pretended to no special knowledge. Up to the year 1650, or thereabouts, the ''Canon'' was still used as a textbook in the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Montpellier]].

In the museum at [[Bukhara]], there are displays showing many of his writings, [[surgical instrument]]s from the period and paintings of patients undergoing treatment. Ibn Sīnā was interested in the effect of the [[mind]] on the [[Human body|body]], and wrote a great deal on [[psychology]], likely influencing [[Ibn Tufayl]] and [[Ibn Bajjah]]. He also introduced medical herbs.

Avicenna extended the theory of temperaments in ''The Canon of Medicine'' to encompass "[[emotion]]al aspects, mental capacity, [[moral]] attitudes, [[self-awareness]], movements and [[dream]]s." He summarized his version of the [[Humorism|four humours]] and temperaments in a table as follows:<ref name=Lutz>{{Cite book|first=Peter L.|last=Lutz|year=2002|title=The Rise of Experimental Biology: An Illustrated History|page=60|publisher=[[Humana Press]]|isbn=0-89603-835-1|oclc=47894348}}</ref>

===Physical Exercise: the Key to Health===
{{Refimprove section|please provide publication information|date=June 2010}}
'''The Canon of Medicine: Volume 1 of 5; Part 4 of 5: The Preservation of Health '''

Of Ibn Sina's Canon of Medicine which is written in 5 volumes, only the first volume has appeared in the English Language. In the first volume, Ibn Sina divides medicine into two parts as he explains it throughout the first book: the theoretical and the practical. The theoretical part consists of, but is not limited to, such things as: the causes of health and disease, the temperaments, the humours, anatomy, general physiology, the breath, psychology, discussion of causes of diseases and symptoms, the causes of illness, the classification of diseases, the pulse, the urine etc. As he himself says in the book on pg 353

{{quote|"In the first part of this book it was stated that medicine comprises two parts, one theoretical, and one practical, though both are really speculative science." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=353}}}}

'''Theoretical and Practical Medicine'''

Ibn Sina goes on to say that you do not get any benefit from just knowing how your body works, but rather the true benefit of medicine itself is in its practical aspect, since medicine is for the preservation of health.

{{quote|"That which is speculative named theory relates to the formation of opinions and the showing of the evidence upon which they are based, without reference to the mode of acting upon them. Thus this part deals with the temperaments, the humors, the drives, and with the forms, the symptoms, and the causes of disease. That which is specially named practical relates to the mode of acting upon this knowledge, and the prescription of a regimen." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=353}}}}

'''The Benefits of Exercise'''

Once the purpose of medicine has been set forth, then from pages&nbsp;377–455, Ibn Sina divides the way of achieving health as:

{{quote| "Since the regimen of maintaining health consists essentially in the regulation of: (1) exercise (2) food and (3) sleep, we may begin our discourse with the subject of exercise". {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=377}}}}

Exercise itself is divided into three main parts: The Massage (which is equivalent to massaging your muscles before you start to exercise); The Exercise itself; and lastly the Cold Bath.

Giving one of the greatest benefits of the regimen of exercise, and then explaining the extremely important and necessary need for physical exercise; Ibn Sina states:

{{quote|"Once we direct the attention towards regulating exercise as to amount and time, we shall find there is no need for such medicines as are ordinarily required for remedying diseases dependent on [abnormal] matters, or diseases of temperament consequent upon such. This is true provided the rest of the regimen is appropriate and proper." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=377}}}}

{{quote|The value of exercise includes the following (1) it hardens the organs and renders them fit for their functions (2) it results in a better absorption of food, aids assimilation, and, by increasing the innate heat, improves nutrition (3) it clears the pores of the skin (4) it removes effete substances through the lungs (5) it strengthens the physique. Vigorous exercise invigorates the muscular and nervous system." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=379}}}}

'''In what manner does Ibn Sina uses the word temperament? In saying that exercise cures diseases of temperamant'''

Ibn Sina divides temperament into that which is harmonious and that which is non-uniform. Ibn Sina says on pg&nbsp;276–277

{{quote|"In addition to the signs of the normal temperament already given, there are: Mental faculties including: vigor of imagination, intellectual power, and memory." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=276}}}}

{{quote|"In brief, there is non-uniformity of temperament among the members; or, perchance, the principal members depart from equability and come to be of contrary temperament, one deviating towards one, another to its contrary. If the components of the body are out of proportion, it is unfortunate both for talent and reasoning power." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=277}}}}

'''The Purpose of Exercise and the Dangers of its negligence'''

{{quote| Continuing on the proof to why exercise should be so beneficial Ibn Sina says "We know that this must be so when we reflect how in regard to nutriment, our health depends on the nutriment being appropriate for us and regulated in quantity and quality. For not one of the aliments which are capable of nourishing the body is converted into actual nutriment in its entirety. In every case digestion leaves something untouched, and nature takes care to have that evacuated. Nevertheless, the evacuation which nature accomplishes is not a complete one. Hence at the end of each digestion there is some superfluity left over. Should this be a frequent occurrence, repetition would lead to further aggregation until something measurable has accumulated. As a result, harmful effete substances would form and injure various parts of the body. When they undergo decomposition, putrefactive diseases arise [bacterial infections]. Should they be strong in quality, they will give rise to intemperament; and if they should increase in quantity, they would set up the symptoms of plethora which have already been described. Flowing to some member, they will result in an inflammatory mass, and their vapors will destroy the temperament of the substantial basis of the breath.

That is the reason why we must be careful to evacuate these substances. Their evacuation is usually not completely accomplished without the aid of toxic medicines, for these break up the nature of the effate substances. This can be achieved only by toxic agents, although the drinking of them is to a certain extent deleterious to our nature. As Hippocrates says: "Medicine purges and ages." More than this the discharge of superfluous humor entails the loss of a large part of the natural humidities and of the breath, which is the substance of life. All this is at the expense of the strength of the principal and the auxiliary members, and therefore they are weakened thereby. These and other things account for the difficulties incident to plethora, whether they remain behind in the body or are evacuated by it." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|pp=377–8}}}}

Just before this Ibn Sina explained how accumulation of food in our body, can cause diseases, and one way to rid us of this is strong medicines. However, as he explains; this is not the ideal way, and certainly not the long-term. Thus, to make his point very clear, and show the extreme necessity of daily exercise for health, Ibn Sina states:

{{quote|"Now exercise is that agent which most surely prevents the accumulation of these matters, and prevents plethora. The other forms of regiment assist it. It is this exercise which renews and revives the innate heat, and imparts the necessary lightness to the body, for it causes the subtle heat to be increased and daily disperses whatever effete substances have accumulated; the movements of the body help them to expel them conveying them to those parts of the body whence they can readily leave it. Hence the effete matters are not allowed to collect day after day and besides this, as we have just said, exercise causes the innate heat to flourish and keeps the joints and ligaments firm, so as to be always ready for service, and also free from injury. It renders the members able to receive nutriment, in being free from accumulated effate matters. Hence it renders the members light and the humidities attenuated, and it dilates the pores of the skin.

To forsake exercise would often incur the risk of "hectic", because the instinctive drives of the members are impaired, inasmuch as the deprivation of movement prevents the access to them of the innate breath. And this last is the real instrument of life for every one of the members." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|pp=378–9}}}}

'''Massage'''

Before you begin to exercise it is important that you massage your muscles; as Ibn Sina says on page 385:

{{quote| "Massage as a preparatory to athletics. The massage begins gently, and then becomes more vigorous as the time approaches for the exercise." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=385}}}}

'''Exercises'''

The exercises themselves are divided into 'strenuous, mild, vigorous and brisk'. On pages&nbsp;379–381; Ibn Sina states the types of exercises under each type:

{{quote| "Strenuous exercises include: wrestling contests, boxing, quick marching, running, jumping over an object higher than one foot, throwing the javelin, fencing, horsemanship, swimming. Mild exercises include: fishing, sailing, being carried on camels, swinging to and fro. Vigorous exercises include: those performed by soldiers in camp, in military sports; field running, long jumping, high jumping, polo, stone throwing, lifting heavy stones or weights, various forms of wrestling. Brisk exercises include: involves interchanging places with a partner as swiftly as possible, each jumping to and fro, either in time [to music] or irregularly." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|pp=379–81}}}}

There are certain important things to note once you start exercising, one is the amount, the other consistency; Ibn Sina states about the amount:

{{quote| "(1) the color - as long as the skin goes on becoming florid, the exercise may be continued. After it ceases to do so, the exercise must be discontinued." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=384}}}}

On being consistent with exercise Ibn Sina states (on the importance of having a regimen):

{{quote| "At the conclusion of the first day's exercise, you will know the degree of exercise allowable and when you know the amount of nourishment the person can bear, do not make any change in either on the second day. Arrange that the measure of aliment, and the amount of exercise shall not exceed that limit ascertained on the first day." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=385}}}}

On the side note those who think themselves to be elderly, and thus think of shunning exercise, Ibn Sina write a complete chapter titled "Concerning the Elderly" in the Qanun, and states the same regimen for them, as he does for others. He states on page 433

{{quote| "For if, towards the end of life, the body is still equable, it will be right to allow attempered exercises. If one part of the body should not be in a first-rate condition, then that part should not be exercised until the others have been exercised.&nbsp;...  On the other hand, if the ailment were in the feet, then the exercise should employ the upper limbs: for instance, rowing, throwing weights, lifting weights." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=433}}}}

'''Bathing in Cold Water'''

Once you have finished exercising; it is often that the person will feel tired and fatigued; to combat this problem Ibn Sina says on page 388:

{{quote| "The beneficial Effects of Baths: The benefits are (1) induction of sleep (2) dilation of pores (3) cleansing of skin (4) dispersal of the undesirable waste matters (5) maturation of abscesses (6) drawing of nutriment towards the surface of the body (7) assistance to the physiological dispersion and excretion of poisonous matters (8) prevention of diarrhea and (9) removal of fatigue effects." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=388}}}}

Most importantly you should remember:

{{quote| "A person should not go into the bath immediately after exercise. He should rest properly first." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=387}}}}

There are two more things that are important to mention on this subject:

{{quote| "Injurious effects include the fact that the heart is weakened if the person stays too long in the bath" {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=388}}}}

{{quote| "Cold Bathing should not be done after exercise except in the case of the very robust. Even then the rules which we have given should be followed. To use cold baths in the ways we have named drives the natural heat suddenly into the interior parts, and then invigorates the strength so that the person should leave the bath twice as strong as when he entered." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=390}}}}

'''Diet'''

Once Ibn Sina has laid the foundation of exercise being central to health, he names many exercises as running, swimming, weight lifting, polo, fencing, boxing, wrestling, long jumping, high jumping, etc. He also gives a diet to go along with the exercise:

{{quote|"The meal should include: (1) meat especially kid of goats; veal, and year-old lambs [this means white meat in today's terms]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} (2) wheat, which is cleaned of extraneous matter and gathered during a healthy harvest without ever being exposed to injurious influences (3) sweets (fruits) of appropriate temperament." {{harv|Avicenna|1999|p=390}}}}

Lastly, the third thing mentioned is sleep; to make sure that you do not sleep during the days, and do not stay awake during the nights. From the above reading, it is clear that Ibn Sina gave advice in his book which is still the same advice medical doctors give to their patients.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Daily Physical Exercise; and to defeat diseases such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, the prescription of a diet which contains high amounts of Whole Grains and little to no amounts of Refined Carbohydrates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Psychology===
In ''The Canon of Medicine'', Avicenna described a number of conditions, including melancholia.<ref>S Safavi-Abbasi, LBC Brasiliense, RK Workman (2007), "The fate of medical knowledge and the neurosciences during the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire", ''Neurosurgical Focus'' '''23''' (1), E13, p. 3.</ref> He described melancholia as a [[depression (mood)|depressive]] type of [[mood disorder]] in which the person may become suspicious and develop certain types of [[phobia]]s.<ref name=Amber-366>Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357-377 [366].</ref>

===Unani medicine===
{{Main|Unani medicine}}
Though the threads which comprise [[Unani]] healing can be traced all the way back to [[Galen|Galen of Pergamon]], who lived in the 2nd century AD, the basic knowledge of Unani medicine as a healing system was developed by Hakim Ibn Sina in his medical encyclopedia ''The Canon of Medicine''. The time of origin is thus dated at ''circa'' 1025 AD, when Avicenna wrote ''The Canon of Medicine'' in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], which remains a text book in the syllabus of Unani medicine in the colleges of India<ref>Indian Studies on Ibn Sina's Works by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Avicenna (Scientific and Practical International Journal of Ibn Sino International Foundation, Tashkent/Uzbekistan. 1-2; 2003: 40-42</ref> and Pakistan.

===Earth sciences===
Ibn Sīnā wrote on [[Earth science]]s such as [[geology]] in ''The Book of Healing''.<ref name=Goodfield>[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[June Goodfield]] (1965), ''The Ancestry of Science: The Discovery of Time'', p. 64, [[University of Chicago Press]] ([[cf.]] [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=319 The Contribution of Ibn Sina to the development of Earth sciences])</ref> While discussing the formation of [[mountain]]s, he explained:

{{quote|Either they are the effects of upheavals of the crust of the earth, such as might occur during a violent earthquake, or they are the effect of water, which, cutting itself a new route, has denuded the valleys, the strata being of different kinds, some soft, some hard&nbsp;... It would require a long period of time for all such changes to be accomplished, during which the mountains themselves might be somewhat diminished in size.|<ref name=Goodfield/>}}

===Philosophy of science===
In the ''Al-Burhan'' (''On Demonstration'') section of ''The Book of Healing'', Avicenna discussed the [[philosophy of science]] and described an early [[scientific method]] of [[inquiry]]. He discusses [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of "How does one acquire the first principles of a science?" He asked how a scientist would arrive at "the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a "relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty." Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide." In its place, he develops a "method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|volume=41|issue=3|date=July 2003|pages=307–327|doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>

===Logic===
An early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{cite book | title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence | publisher=Springer | author=Peter Øhrstrøm, Per Hasle | year=1995 | pages=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{citation|title=TOWARD A HISTORY OF SYLLOGISTIC AFTER AVICENNA: NOTES ON RESCHER'S STUDIES ON ARABIC MODAL LOGIC|author=TONY STREET|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|volume=11|issue=2|year=2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=209–228}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-52069-0| pages = 247–265| editors = Peter Adamson and Richard C.

===Physics===
In [[mechanics]], Ibn Sīnā, in ''The Book of Healing'', developed an elaborate theory of [[motion (physics)|motion]], in which he made a distinction between the inclination (tendency to motion) and [[force]] of a [[projectile]], and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination (''mayl'') transferred to the projectile by the thrower, and that [[projectile motion]] in a vacuum would not cease.<ref name=Espinoza>Fernando Espinoza (2005). "An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching", ''Physics Education'' '''40''' (2), p. 141.</ref> He viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as [[air resistance]].<ref>A. Sayili (1987), "Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'' '''500''' (1), p. 477 – 482:

{{quote|It was a permanent force whose effect got dissipated only as a result of external agents such as air resistance. He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion.}}</ref>

The theory of motion developed by Avicenna may have influenced Jean Buridan's theory of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]] (the ancestor of the [[inertia]] and [[momentum]] concepts).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/notes.html#48 |title=Buridan |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}</ref>

In [[optics]], Ibn Sina was among those who argued that light had a speed, observing that "if the perception of [[light]] is due to the emission of some sort of [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite.".<ref>[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.</ref> He also provided a wrong explanation of the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] described Avicenna's ("Ibn Sīnā") theory on the rainbow as follows:

{{quote|Independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer. The cloud, he thought, serves simply as the background of this thin substance, much as a quicksilver lining is placed upon the rear surface of the glass in a mirror. Ibn Sīnā would change the place not only of the bow, but also of the color formation, holding the iridescence to be merely a subjective sensation in the eye.|<ref>Carl Benjamin Boyer (1954)."Robert Grosseteste on the Rainbow", ''Osiris'' '''11''', p.&nbsp;247–258 [248].</ref>}}

In 1253, a [[Latin]] text entitled ''Speculum Tripartitum'' stated the following regarding Avicenna's theory on [[heat]]:

{{quote|Avicenna says in his book of heaven and earth, that heat is generated from motion in external things.|<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On the Fringes of the Corpus Aristotelicum: the Pseudo-Avicenna Liber Celi Et Mundi|last=Gutman|first=Oliver|journal=Early Science and Medicine|volume=2|issue=2|year=1997|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|pages=109–28|doi=10.1163/157338297X00087}}</ref>}}

===Psychology===
Avicenna's legacy in classical [[psychology]] is primarily embodied in the ''Kitab al-nafs'' parts of his ''Kitab al-shifa''' (''The Book of Healing'') and ''Kitab al-najat'' (''The Book of Deliverance''). These were known in Latin under the title [[De Anima]] (treatises "on the soul").{{dubious|date=October 2012}} The main thesis of these tracts is represented in his so-called "flying man" argument, which resonates with what was centuries later entailed by [[Descartes]]'s ''cogito'' argument (or what [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] designates as a form of an "''epoche''").<ref name="Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171">[[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000), pp.&nbsp;149–171.</ref><ref name="elbizri67-89">Nader El-Bizri, "Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl," in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed. Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003), pp.&nbsp;67–89.</ref>

Avicenna's psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the soul's individuation, but weak enough to allow for its immortality.  Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception.  Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect.  In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses.  This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience.  This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms.  The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology.

The soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter.  This process requires a concrete particular (material) to be abstracted into the universal intelligible (immaterial). The material and immaterial interact through the Active Intellect, which is a "divine light" containing the intelligible forms.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology.

===Astronomy and astrology===
The [[Muslim views on astrology|practice of judicial astrology]] was refuted by Avicenna. His reasons were due to the methods used by astrologers in judicial astrology being [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]] and also due to the principles of this type of astrology conflicting with orthodox [[Islam]]. He also cited passages from the [[Qur'an]] in order to justify his refutation of astrology on both scientific and religious grounds.<ref>[[George Saliba]] (1994), ''A History of Arabic Astronomy: Planetary Theories During the Golden Age of Islam'', p. 60, 67-69. [[New York University Press]], ISBN 0-8147-8023-7.</ref> However, Avicenna's refutation of astrology (in the treatise titled ''Resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm'') concerned only the judicial application of astrology rather than the philosophical principles of the subject and its natural influence. He stated that it was true that each planet had some influence on the earth, but his argument was the difficulty of astrologers being able to determine the exact effect of it. In essence, Avicenna did not refute astrology, but denied man's limited capacity to be able to know the precise effects of the stars on the sublunar matter. With that, he did not refute the essential dogma of astrology, but only refuted our ability to fully understand it.<ref>[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii. Mathematics and Physical Sciences'. Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition, 2011, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-viii</ref>

In [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], he criticized [[Aristotle]]'s view of the [[star]]s receiving their light from the [[Sun]]. Ibn Sīnā stated that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the [[planet]]s are also self-luminous.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The phases of venus before 1610|first=Roger|last=Ariew|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=18|issue=1|date=March 1987|pages=81–92|doi=10.1016/0039-3681(87)90012-4}}</ref> He claimed to have observed the [[Transit of Venus|transit of Venus across the Sun]] on May 24, 1032.<ref name=Goldstein/>  However, modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Some Medieval Reports of Venus and Mercury Transits|author=Goldstein, Bernard R.|journal=Centaurus|volume=14|issue=1|year=1969|pages=49–59|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|postscript=<!--None-->|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1969.tb00135.x|bibcode=1969Cent...14...49G}}</ref>  He used his transit observation to demonstrate that [[Venus]] was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in the Ptolemaic cosmology.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Sīnā: Abū ʿAlī al‐Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbdallāh ibn Sīnā|author=Sally P.

Soon after, he wrote the ''Compendium of the Almagest'', a commentary on [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''. Avicenna concluded that Venus is closer to the Earth than the Sun.<ref name=Goldstein>{{Cite journal|title=Theory and Observation in Medieval Astronomy|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=63|issue=1|date=March 1972|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|pages=39–47 [44]|doi=10.1086/350839}}</ref> In 1070, [[Juzjani, Abu Ubaid|Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani]], a pupil of Ibn Sīnā, claimed that his teacher Ibn Sīnā had solved the [[equant]] problem in the [[Ptolemaic model]].<ref>[[A.

*''Declaratio Lapis physici Avicennae filio sui Aboali''
*''Avicennae de congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum''
*''Avicennae ad Hasan Regem epistola de Re recta''

In one of these works, Ibn Sīnā discredited the theory of the [[Philosopher's stone|transmutation of substances]] commonly believed by [[alchemy|alchemists]]:

{{quote|Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.|<ref>[[Robert Briffault]] (1938). ''The Making of Humanity'', p.&nbsp;196–197.</ref>}}

Among his works on alchemy, ''Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae'' was the most influential, having influenced later [[medieval]] chemists and alchemists such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]].<ref name=Anawati/>

In another work, translated into Latin as ''De congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum'', Ibn Sina proposed a four-part classification of inorganic bodies, which was a significant improvement over the two-part classification of [[Aristotle]] (into ''orycta'' and [[metal]]s) and three-part classification of [[Galen]] (into ''terrae'', ''lapides'' and metals). The four parts of Ibn Sina's classification were: ''lapides'', [[sulfur]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and metals.<ref>{{citation|title=The Historical Background of Chemistry|first=Henry Marshall|last=Leicester|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1971|isbn=9780486610535|page=70|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aJZVQnqcwv4C&pg=PA70|quote=There was one famous Arab physician who doubted even the reality of transmutation.

==Legacy==
[[File:TajikistanP17-20Somoni-1999(2000)-donatedsb f.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Image of Avicenna on the [[Tajikistani somoni]]]]
As early as the 14th century when [[Dante Alighieri]] depicted him in Limbo alongside the virtuous non-Christian thinkers in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' such as [[Virgil]], [[Averroes]], [[Homer]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucan]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Saladin]], Avicenna has been recognized by both East and West, as one of the great figures in intellectual history.

[[George Sarton]], the author of ''The History of Science'', described Ibn Sīnā as "one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history"<ref name=Zahoor/> and called him "the most famous [[Islamic science|scientist of Islam]] and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times." He was one of the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]]'s leading writers in the field of medicine. Along with [[al-Razi|Rhazes]], [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]], and [[al-Ibadi]], Ibn Sīnā is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western [[history of medicine]] as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European [[Renaissance]]. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotilian advances in anatomical knowledge.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Musallam|first=B.|authorlink=|title=Avicenna Medicine and Biology|year=2011| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=2011-11-09|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x}}</ref> Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the ''Canon of Medicine'' (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the ''Canon'' was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, {{lang|la|''princeps medicorum''}} (prince of physicians).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Weisser|first=U.|authorlink=|title=Avicenna The influence of Avicenna on medical studies in the West|year=2011| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=2011-11-09|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-x}}</ref>

In [[Iran]], he is considered a national icon, and is often regarded as one of the greatest Persians to have ever lived. Many portraits and statues remain in Iran today. An impressive monument to the life and works of the man who is known as the "doctor of doctors" still stands outside the Bukhara museum and his portrait hangs in the Hall of the Avicenna Faculty of Medicine in the [[University of Paris]]. There is also a crater on the Moon named [[Avicenna (crater)|Avicenna]] and a plant genus ''[[Avicennia]]''. [[Bu-Ali Sina University]] in [[Hamadan]] (Iran), the ''ibn Sīnā'' Tajik State Medical University in [[Dushanbe]] (The capital of the [[Republic of Tajikistan]]), [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences]] at [[Aligarh]], [[India]], [[Avicenna School]] in [[Karachi]] and [[Avicenna Medical College]] in [[Lahore]]<ref>www.amch.edu.pk</ref> [[Pakistan]], Ibne Sina Balkh Medical School in his native province of [[Balkh]] in [[Afghanistan]], Ibni Sina Faculty Of Medicine of Ankara University [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]  and Ibn Sina Integrated School in Marawi City (Philippines) are all named in his honour.
In 1980, the former [[Soviet Union]], which then ruled his birthplace Bukhara, celebrated the thousandth anniversary of Avicenna's birth by circulating various [[commemorative stamp]]s with artistic illustrations, and by erecting a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Avicenna based on [[anthropological]] research by Soviet scholars.  Near his birthplace in Qishlak Afshona, some {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Bukhara, a training college for medical staff has been named for him. On the grounds is a museum dedicated to his life, times and work. {{OnGoogleEarth|39.994359N64.382253E}}

The Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science is awarded every two years by UNESCO and rewards individuals and groups in the field of ethics in science.The prize was named after Avicenna.The aim of the award is to promote ethical reflection on issues raised by advances in science and technology, and to raise global awareness of the importance of ethics in science.

In March 2008, it was announced that Avicenna's name would be used for new Directories of education institutions for health care professionals, worldwide. The [[Avicenna Directories]] will list universities and schools where doctors, public health practitioners, pharmacists and others, are educated. The project team stated "Why Avicenna? Avicenna&nbsp;... was&nbsp;... noted for his synthesis of knowledge from both east and west. He has had a lasting influence on the development of medicine and health sciences. The use of Avicenna's name symbolises the worldwide partnership that is needed for the promotion of health services of high quality."<ref>"Educating health professionals: the Avicenna project"  ''The Lancet'', March 2008. Volume 371 pp 966–967.</ref>

==Arabic Works==
The treatises of Ibn Sīnā influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including [[theology]], [[philology]], [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], and [[music]]. Ibn Sīnā's works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.<ref name="MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna" /> His most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', a vast philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and ''The Canon of Medicine'',<ref name="Britannica" />

Ibn Sīnā wrote at least one treatise on [[alchemy]], but several others have been falsely attributed to him. His book on animals was translated by [[Michael Scot]]. His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine, though the Metaphysics demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of Neoplatonism known as Aristotelianism in Ibn Sīnā's world; Arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that Ibn Sīnā was attempting to "re-Aristotelianise" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.

The ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio''). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied. There is also a '''حكمت مشرقيه''' (''hikmat-al-mashriqqiyya'', in Latin ''Philosophia Orientalis''), mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], the majority of which is lost in antiquity, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.

==Persian works==
[[New Persian]], the native language of Avicenna,<ref>Ibn Sina ("Avicenna") Encyclopedia of Islam. 2nd edition. Edited by P. Berman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Henrichs. Brill 2009. Accessed through Brill online: www.encislam.brill.nl (2009) Quote: "He was born in 370/980 in Afshana, his mother's home, near Bukhara. His native language was Persian."
</ref> was not a scientific language till the 10th century, however Avicenna became one of the pioneers in writing new Persian scientific language.

===Danishnama-i 'Alai===
Danishnama-i 'Alai is called "the Book of Knowledge for [Prince] 'Ala ad-Daulah". One of Avicenna's important [[Persian language|Persian]] work is the Daaneshnaame (literally: the book of knowledge) for Prince 'Ala ad-Daulah (the local [[Buyid]] ruler). The linguist aspects of the Dāneš-nāma and the originality of their Persian vocabulary are of great interest to Iranian philologists. Avicenna created new scientific vocabulary that had not existed before in the modern Persian language. The Dāneš-nāma covers such topics as logic, metaphysics, music theory and other sciences of his time.  This book has been translated into English by Parwiz Mowewedge.<ref>Avicenna, Danish Nama-i 'Alai.  trans. Parviz Morewedge as ''The Metaphysics of Avicenna'' (New York: Columbia University Pres), 1977.</ref>  The book is also important in respect to Persian scientific works.

===Andar Danesh-e-Rag===
Andar Danesh-e-Rag is called "On the science of the pulse". This book contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is a condensed synonpsis.

===Persian poetry===
Persian poetry from Ibn Sina is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as [[Nozhat al-Majales]].

==In popular culture==

===The Walking Drum===
In [[Louis L'Amour|Louis L'Amour's]] 1985 historical novel ''[[The Walking Drum]]'', Kerbouchard studies and discusses Avicenna's ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''.

===The Physician===
In his book ''[[The Physician]]'' (1988) [[Noah Gordon (novelist)|Noah Gordon]] tells the story of a young English medical apprentice who disguises himself as a Jew to learn from Avicenna, the great master of his time.

** This is a distinguished work which stands out from, and above, many of the books and articles which have ben written in this century on Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā) (A.D. 980&ndash;1037).
