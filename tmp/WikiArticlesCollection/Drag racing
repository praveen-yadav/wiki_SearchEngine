'''Drag racing''' is a competition in which specially prepared [[automobile]]s or [[motorcycle]]s compete, usually two at a time, to be first to cross a set finish line. The race follows a straight course from a [[standing start]] over a measured distance, most commonly ¼ [[mile]] ({{convert|1,320|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}), with a shorter {{convert|1,000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} for some<!--NHRA only?--> [[Top Fuel]] [[dragster (car)|dragster]]s and [[funny car]]s, while {{convert|660|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} (1/8&nbsp;mi) is also popular in some circles. Electronic timing and speed sensing systems have been used to record race results since the 1960s. The faster vehicles need a parachute to slow down, an innovation credited (indirectly) to cartoonist [[Tom Medley]].<ref>Medley's character, 'Stroker' McGurk, displayed a 'chute in a cartoon in ''Hot Rod''. ''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.32.</ref>

==Basics of drag racing==
[[Image:Pro Street Camaro at launch.JPG|thumb|Camaro at launch, with ''Altered Vision'' in the right lane. [[Wheelie|Wheelstand]] means torque has been wasted lifting the front end, rather than moving the vehicle forward.]]

Before each race (also known as a pass), each driver is allowed to perform a [[burnout (vehicle)|burnout]], which heats the driving tires and lays rubber down at the beginning of the track, improving traction. Each driver then lines up (or stages) at the starting line.
Races are started electronically by a system known as a ''Christmas tree''. The Christmas tree consists of a column of six lights for each driver/lane, one blue, then three amber, one green, and one red, connected to light beams on the track.  The first, a split blue open my mud flaps tickle me with in side the little girl   circle, is split into two halves.  When the first light beam is broken by the vehicle's front tire(s) indicate that the driver has pre-staged (approximately {{convert|7|in|mm}} from the starting line), lights the first half of the blue circle, and then staged (at the starting line), which lights up the second half of the blue circle, and also the corresponding bar in the middle of that circle.<ref>[http://www.nhra.com/basics/basics.html NHRA.com] Drag Racing Basics</ref> 
<ref>[http://www.nhra.com/story/2011/4/12/new-tree-implemented-for-visitmyrtlebeachcom-nhra-four-wide-nationals/] New Tree implemented for NHRA VisitMyrtleBeach.com Four-Wide Nationals (but the tree, with just the two middle lights, was adopted permanently by the next round in May 2011)</ref> Below the blue "staged" light are three large amber lights, a green light, and a red light.

Once the first competitor trips the staged beam, the tree is automatically activated, and the opponent will have up to seven seconds to stage or a red light and automatic timed-out disqualification occurs instantly.  Otherwise, when both drivers are staged the tree will start the race between .8 and 1.3 seconds after the race is staged, with the time randomly selected by the Autostart system, which causes the three large amber lights to illuminate, followed by the green one. There are two standard light sequences: either the three amber lights flash simultaneously, followed 0.4 seconds later by the green light (a Pro tree), or the amber lights in sequence from top to bottom, 0.5 seconds apart, followed 0.5 seconds later by the green light (a Sportsman tree, or full tree). If the front tires leaves from a stage beam (stage turn off) before the green light illuminates, the red light for that driver's lane illuminates instead, indicating disqualification (unless a more serious violation occurs). Once a driver commits a red-light foul (also known as ''redlighting''), the other driver can also commit a foul start by leaving the line too early but still win, having left later.   The green light automatically is illuminated on the opposite side of the red-lightning driver.  Should both drivers leave after the green light illuminates, the one leaving first is said to have a ''holeshot advantage''.

Except where a breakout rule is in place, the winner is the first vehicle to cross the finish line (and therefore the driver with the lowest total reaction time and elapsed time). The elapsed time is a measure of performance only; it does not necessarily determine the winner. Because elapsed time does not include reaction time and each lane is timed individually, a car with a slower elapsed time can actually win if that driver's holeshot advantage exceeds the elapsed time difference. In heads-up racing, this is known as a ''holeshot win''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhra.com/glossary.aspx|title=NHRA Glossary|publisher=NHRA|accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>  In categories where a breakout rule (some dial-in categories are this way, but Jr Dragster, Super Comp, Super Gas, Super Stock, and Stock most notably) is in effect, if a competitor is faster than their predetermined time, that competitor loses.  If both are faster than their predetermined time, the competitor closer to that time wins.  Regardless, a red light foul is worse than a breakout, except in Jr Dragster where exceeding the absolute limit is disqualification.

Several measurements are taken for each race: reaction time, elapsed time, and speed. Reaction time is the period from the green light illuminating to the vehicle leaving the starting line. Elapsed time is the period  from the vehicle leaving the starting line to crossing the finish line. Speed is measured through a [[speed trap]] covering the final {{convert|66|ft|m}} to the finish line, indicating average speed of the vehicle during the run last 66 feet.

In the standard racing format, the losing car and driver are removed from the contest, while the winner goes on to race other winners, until only one is left.

=== North America ===
The [[NHRA|National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) oversees the majority of drag racing events in North America. The next largest organization is [[Feld Entertainment]]'s [[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA) as an alternative to NHRA. Nearly all drag strips are associated with one sanctioning body or the other.

Besides NHRA and IHRA, there are niche organizations for muscle cars and nostalgia vehicles. The [[National Electric Drag Racing Association]] (NEDRA) races [[electric vehicle]]s against high performance gasoline-powered vehicles such as [[Dodge Vipers]] or classic [[muscle car]]s in 1/4 and 1/8&nbsp;mile races. The current [[electric drag racing]] record is [http://www.nedra.com/200mph_club.html] 6.940 seconds at 201.37&nbsp;mph for a quarter mile. Another niche organization is the [[VWDRC]] which run a VW-only championship with vehicles running under 7 seconds.

Prior to the founding of the NHRA and IHRA, smaller organizations sanctioned drag racing in the early years.

=== Australia ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}
The first Australian Nationals event was run in 1965 at Riverside raceway, near Melbourne. The Australian National Drag Racing Association ([[ANDRA]]) was established in 1973, and today they claim they are the "best in the world outside the United States".<ref name="andra">[http://www.andra.com.au/subpage.asp?Menu=6&Page=History Australian National Drag Racing Association] ANDRA History</ref> ANDRA sanctions races throughout Australia and throughout the year at all levels, from Junior Dragster to [[Top Fuel]].

The ANDRA Pro Series is for professional drivers and riders and includes [[Top Fuel]], Top Alcohol, [[Top Doorslammer]] (similar to the USA Pro Modified class), Pro Stock (using 400 cubic inch engines), Top Bike and Pro Stock Motorcycle.

The Rocket Allstars Racing Series is for sportsman drivers and riders and includes Competition, Super Stock, Super Compact, Competition Bike, Supercharged Outlaws, Modified, Super Sedan, Modified Bike, Super Street and Junior Dragster.

===New Zealand===
Drag racing in New Zealand started in the 1960s. The New Zealand Hot Rod Association (NZHRA) sanctioned what is believed to have been the first drag meeting at an open cut coal mine at Kopuku, south of Auckland, sometime in 1966. In April 1993 the governance of drag racing was separated from the NZHRA and the New Zealand Drag Racing Association (NZDRA) was formed.

The first New Zealand Drag Racing Nationals was held in the 1966/67 season at Kopuku, near Auckland.

Drag racing is controlled by [[Motorsport South Africa]] and all drivers are required to hold a valid Motorsport South Africa license.<ref name="msa2010">{{cite web|title=2010 MSA Drag Racing Handbook|url=http://www.tarltonrace.com/2010/2010%20MSA%20Drag%20Racing%20Rulebook.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> Drivers can compete in a number of categories including Top Eliminator, Senior Eliminator, Super Competition Eliminator, Competition Eliminator, Pro Street Bikes, Superbike Eliminator, Supersport Shootout (motorcycle), Street Modified, and Factory Stock.<ref name="msa2010"/>

==Classes==
{{cleanup-gallery}}
[[Image:Caterpiller-sponsored dragster.jpg|thumb|right|Caterpillar-sponsored dragster. Note wide slicks and high-mounted wing, to assist traction.]]

There are hundreds of classes in drag racing, each with different requirements and restrictions on things such as weight, engine size, body style, modifications, and many others. NHRA and IHRA share some of these classes, but many are solely used by one sanctioning body or the other. The NHRA boasts over 200 classes, while the IHRA has fewer. Some IHRA classes have multiple sub-classes in them to differentiate by engine components and other features. There is even a class for aspiring youngsters, [[Junior Dragster]], which typically uses an eighth-mile, also favored by VW racers.

In 1997, the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (cars) and [[Union Européenne de Motocyclisme|UEM]] (bikes) began sanctioning drag racing in Europe with a fully established European Drag Racing Championship, in cooperation (and rules compliance) with NHRA. The major European drag strips include Santa Pod Raceway in Podington, England; Alastaro Circuit, Finland; Mantorp Park, Sweden; Gardermoen Raceway, Norway and the [[Hockenheimring]] in Germany.  The major difference is the nitro-class distance, which is 300 meters at some tracks, although the NHRA and FIA are likely to discuss the distance change in the future.

[[Image:'Pain Killer' jr. dragster.JPG|thumb|''Pain Killer'' J/D. Note the driver, helmet off, is still in the car, which is under tow on the return road, headed for the pits.]]

There are currently only 5 pro classes in North America, which are:
[[File:Top Fuel.JPG|thumb|Fuel dragsters<!--identify the cars & place!-->]]
* [[Top Fuel]] Dragster (TF/D). The rail dragsters, or "diggers", are the fastest class. Among the fastest-accelerating machines in the world, these cars can cover the dragstrip in less than 3.8 ­seconds and record trap speeds over 325&nbsp;mph. Top Fuel cars are 25 feet long and weigh 2,320 pounds in race-ready trim. Methanol fuel mixed with up to 90% [[nitromethane]] is used.

 [[File:Funny Car AAA.JPG|thumb|Typical Funny Cars<!--identify the cars & place! Are these actual TF/FCs?-->]]
* Top Fuel [[Funny Car]] (TF/FC) Similar to their Top Fuel counterparts but with a shorter ­wheelbase and a carbon-fiber body that loosely resembles a production-based automobile, Funny Cars, or “floppers,” routinely run in the 4.0s and can exceed 315&nbsp;mph.
* [[Pro Modified]] (Pro Mod) Some engine restrictions, very high power. Cars can run superchargers, turbochargers, or nitrous oxide. Cars running blowers are limited to {{convert|527|cuin|L|1}} while cars with nitrous can run up to {{convert|740|cuin|L}}.

[[File:Pro Stock.JPG|thumb|A typical Pro Stock car.<!--identify the car & place!-->]]
* [[Pro Stock]] (NHRA, MMPSA) Often called “factory hot rods” because of their resemblance to production-based cars (and because they must maintain a relatively stock appearance), commonly called  "doorslammers", Pro Stockers can record quarter-mile times in the 6.4 second range, and speeds over 210&nbsp;mph. They can rev to more than 10,500 rpm and make in excess of 1,300 horsepower. NHRA engines can be no more than {{convert|500|cuin|L|adj=on}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]] while MMPSA cars can run a maximum of {{convert|820|cuin|L}} (called "Mountain Motors"). Both classes require the motors to be naturally aspirated. 
* [[Pro Stock Motorcycle|Pro Stock Bike]] (NHRA and ANDRA) These highly modified vehicles, which can run under 6.8 seconds at more than 195&nbsp;mph, feature a purpose-built tube ­chassis and a lightweight, aerodynamically enhanced replica of original bodywork.

In addition to the professional classes, these are some other popular classes:

* [[Top Alcohol Dragster]] (TA/D) Top Alcohol Dragsters resemble Top Fuelers, but have significant differences. They may use a supercharged methanol-burning engine or an injected nitromethane ­combination. They can run in the 5.1s at more than 280&nbsp;mph.

* [[Top Alcohol Funny Car]] (TA/FC). Similar in physical appearance to their nitro-burning Funny Car counterparts, Top Alcohol Funny Cars are restricted to the use of methanol fuel and have three-speed transmissions. They can run in the 5.4s at more than 265&nbsp;mph. In the IHRA, Alcohol Funny Car is the fifh pro category, replacing NHRA's Pro Stock Bike.

 [[File:Comp Eliminator.JPG|thumb|A typical Comp car.<!--identify the car & place!-->]]
* [[Competition Eliminator]] This is the NHRA class with the most variety. Each of its 88 sections is assigned an index based on what a well-built car should run, and races are handicapped according to those indexes.

* [[Outlaw Series]]

* [[Pro FWD]]

* [[Super Comp/Quick Rod]] The quickest of the heads-up Super classes (8.90 index) is composed primarily of dragsters. Most cars are capable of running well under the index but use electronic aids to run close to it without breaking out.

 [[File:Super Gas Probe.JPG|thumb|Super Gas Probe.<!--identify the car & place!-->]]
* [[Super Gas/Super Rod]] Super Gas entries, which run on a 9.90 index, are primarily full-bodied cars and street roadsters. No dragsters or altereds are permitted. As in Super Comp, competitors use electronic aids to run as close to the class standard without going under.

* [[Super Street/Hot Rod]] Racers compete on a fixed 10.90 index. All vehicles must be full-bodied cars and weigh no less than 2,800 pounds except for six-cylinder cars (2,000) and four-cylinder and rotary-powered cars (1,200). Engine and chassis modifications are virtually unlimited. [[File:Super Street Mustang.JPG|thumb|Super Street Mustang]]

 [[File:Super Stock.JPG|thumb|A typical Super Stock car<!--identify the car & place!-->]]
* [[Super Stock]] Super Stock vehicles resemble ordinary passenger cars, but are actually heavily modified. Entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower and compete on indexes. The breakout rule is enforced.

* [[Stock (drag racing class)|Stock]] Stock cars are similar to Super Stockers, but rules regarding everything from engine modifications to body alterations are much stricter. Virtually any car is eligible to compete, and entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower.

* [[Sport Compact]]

* Top Sportsman (NHRA and IHRA) Competitors in these full-bodied entries may choose their own dial for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.99 seconds. Full Tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than 200&nbsp;mph.

 [[File:Top Dragster.JPG|thumb|Blown Top Dragster<!--identify the cars & place!-->]]
* Top Dragster (NHRA and IHRA) Competitors in these open-wheel entries may choose their own dial for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.70 seconds. Full Tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than 200&nbsp;mph. Cars can run any combination of motor: blown, turbo, nitrous or just all motor,

* Top Fuel Funny Bike (high performance 5 second bikes)

* [[Nostalgia Super Stock]]

* NHRA and ANDRA [[Summit Racing]] series Super Pro, Pro, and bike.

* Junior Dragster (racers between the ages of 8 and 18 may race a half scale version of the sport's fastest car, Top Fuel Dragster. Juniors run as following: 12.90-slower for 8-9&nbsp;year olds, 10-12&nbsp;year olds at 8.90, and 13-18&nbsp;year olds 7.90 and slower at a top speed of 85&nbsp;mph).  These cars race at 1/8 mile or 1/16 mile. [[File:JRDragsterrace.JPG|thumb|Jr.Dragsters Racing]]
* NHRA new class for Juniors is JR COMP running 6.90s at a top speed of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h}} (1/8 mile or 1/16 mile).
A complete listing of all classes can be found on the respective NHRA and IHRA official websites.

In the FIA European Drag Racing Championships, a different structure of professional categories is used with Top Fuel Dragster (with a 90% nitromethane mix), Top Methanol (Alcohol) Dragster, Top Methanol (Alcohol) Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Modified running as professional championships as well as FIA specifications published for Fuel Funny Car although this does not run as a championship.

The UEM also has a different structure of professional categories with Top Fuel Bike, Super Twin Top Fuel Bike, and Pro Stock Bike contested, leaving the entire European series with a total of 8 professional categories.

To allow different cars to compete against each other, some competitions are raced on a handicap basis, with faster cars delayed on the start line enough to theoretically even things up with the slower car.  This may be based on rule differences between the cars in stock, super stock, and modified classes, or on a competitor's chosen "dial-in" in [[bracket racing]].

==Dial-in==
A "dial-in" is a time the driver estimates it will take his or her car to cross the finish line, and is generally displayed on one or more windows so the starter can adjust the starting lights on the tree accordingly. The slower car will then get a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] equal to the difference in the two dial-ins, so if both cars perform perfectly, they would cross the finish line dead even. If either car goes faster than its dial-in (called breaking out), it is disqualified regardless of who has the lower elapsed time; if both cars break out, the one who breaks out by the smallest amount wins. However, if a driver had jump-started (red light) or crossed a boundary line, both violations override any break out (except in some classes with an absolute break out rule such as Junior classes).  This eliminates any advantage from putting a slower time on the windshield to get a head start. The effect of the bracket racing rules is to place a premium on consistency of performance of the driver and car rather than on raw speed, in that victory goes to the driver able to precisely predict elapsed time, whether it is fast or slow. This in turn makes victory much less dependent on large infusions of money, and more dependent on skill. Therefore, bracket racing is popular with casual weekend racers. Many of these recreational racers will drive their vehicles to the track, race them, and then simply drive them home. As most tracks host only one NHRA national event, and a 2-3 regional events (smaller tours, car shows, et al.) annually, on most weekends these tracks host local casual and weekend racers. Organizationally, however, the tracks are run according to the rules of either the NHRA or the IHRA with regional points and a championship on the line. Even street vehicles must pass a safety inspection prior to being allowed to race.
