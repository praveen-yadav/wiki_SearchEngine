'''Caffeine''' is a bitter, white [[crystalline]] [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]] and a [[stimulant]] drug.  Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators.  It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the [[coffea arabica|coffee plant]] and the leaves of the [[camellia sinensis|tea bush]], as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the [[kola nut]]. Other sources include [[yerba maté]], [[guarana]] berries, [[ilex guayusa|guayusa]], and the [[ilex vomitoria|yaupon holly]].

In humans, caffeine acts as a [[central nervous system]] stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. It is the world's most widely consumed [[psychoactive drug]], but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. Beverages containing caffeine, such as [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[soft drink]]s, and [[energy drink]]s, enjoy great popularity. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily.<ref name="demon drink">{{cite journal | author = Lovett R |title=Coffee: The demon drink? | journal = New Scientist |issue=2518 |date=2005-09-24|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725181.700 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] as [[GRAS]] (generally recognized as safe) is that toxic doses (over 1 gram for an average adult) are much higher than typically used doses (less than 500 milligrams). Ordinary consumption can have low health risks, even when carried on for years&nbsp;– there may be a modest protective effect against some diseases, including [[Parkinson's disease]], and certain types of [[cancer]]. Some people experience [[insomnia|sleep disruption]] if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable.

Evidence of a risk to [[pregnancy]] is equivocal, but some authorities have concluded that prudent advice is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less.<ref name=MayoPreg2>{{cite web|author=Mayo Clinic staff|title=Pregnancy Nutrition: Foods to avoid during pregnancy|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pregnancy-nutrition/PR00109/NSECTIONGROUP=2|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=2012-04-15}}</ref> The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200&nbsp;mg per day in pregnant women.<ref name="ACOG policy 462 caffeine">{{cite journal | author = American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists | title = ACOG CommitteeOpinion No. 462: Moderate caffeine consumption during pregnancy | journal = Obstet Gynecol | volume = 116 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 467–8 | year = 2010 | month = August | pmid = 20664420 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181eeb2a1 | url = }}</ref> Caffeine has [[pressor]] and mild [[diuretic]] effects when administered to people who are not used to it, but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect, and studies have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary consumption contributes significantly to [[dehydration]]. With heavy use, [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart rate and [[muscle twitching]], but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine. The degree to which caffeine can produce clinically significant [[physical dependence|dependency]] and [[addiction]] remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It produces increased wakefulness, faster and clearer flow of thought, increased focus, and better general body coordination.<ref name="effects" /> The amount of caffeine needed to produce effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. Effects begin less than an hour after consumption, and a moderate dose usually wears off in about five hours.<ref name="effects" />

Four caffeine-induced disorders are recognized by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) including: caffeine intoxication, [[caffeine-induced sleep disorder]], caffeine-induced anxiety disorder and caffeine-related disorder not otherwise specified (NOS).<ref name="DSM-IV" /> The [[DSM-IV]] defines a person with caffeine-induced sleep disorder as an individual who regularly ingests high doses of caffeine sufficient to induce a significant disturbance in his or her sleep, sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.<ref name="DSM-IV" /> As of 2010 the effect of caffeine on people with [[ADHD]] is not known.<ref name=Psyc10/> However [[anecdotal evidence]] suggests that many individuals with ADHD already use caffeine to self-medicate themselves or their [[dependant]]s, and they find that it has the opposite effect to normal, such as inducing a “calm-down” effect that encourages sleep instead of making them more active and stimulated.<ref>[http://psychcentral.com/lib/2010/caffeines-effect-on-adhd-symptoms/ Caffeine on ADHD Symptoms] - retrieved 01 June 2013</ref> Some studies have however found a modest protective effect against [[Alzheimer disease]], but the evidence is inconclusive.<ref name="pmid20182026">{{cite journal |author=Santos C, Costa J, Santos J, Vaz-Carneiro A, Lunet N |title=Caffeine intake and dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J.

===Caffeine toxicity===
[[File:Main symptoms of Caffeine overdose.svg|thumb|250px|Primary symptoms of caffeine intoxication<ref name=Medline />|alt=Torso of a young man with overlaid text of main side-effects of caffeine overdose.]]
Caffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called ''caffeine intoxication'' ([[DSM-IV]] 305.90).<ref name="DSM-IV">{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |year=1994|isbn=0-89042-062-9 |author=American Psychiatric Association.}}</ref> This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g. more than 400–500&nbsp;mg at a time). The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other [[stimulant]]s: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and [[psychomotor agitation]].<ref name=Medline>{{cite web |title=Caffeine (Systemic) |publisher=MedlinePlus |date=2000-05-25 |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/202105.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070223063601/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/202105.html|archivedate=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> In cases of much larger overdoses, [[mania]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], lapses in judgment, [[disorientation]], [[disinhibition]], delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and [[rhabdomyolysis]] (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.<ref>{{cite web |title=Caffeine overdose |publisher=MedlinePlus |date=2006-04-04 |url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002579.htm |accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref><ref name=Verkhratsky>{{cite journal | author = Verkhratsky A | title = Physiology and pathophysiology of the calcium store in the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons | journal = Physiol.

===Addiction and tolerance===
{{main|Caffeine addiction}}
With repetitive use, [[physical dependence]] or [[addiction]] may occur. Also, some effects of caffeine, particularly the autonomic effects, decrease over time, a phenomenon known as a [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]]. Tolerance develops quickly to some (but not all) effects of caffeine, especially among heavy coffee and energy drink consumers.<ref>[http://www.caffeinedependence.org/caffeine_dependence.html Information about caffeine dependence].

===Withdrawal===
[[Drug withdrawal|Withdrawal]] symptoms&nbsp;– including headaches, irritability, inability to concentrate, drowsiness, insomnia, and pain in the stomach, upper body, and joints&nbsp;– may appear within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of caffeine intake, peak at roughly 48 hours, and usually last from 2 to 9 days.<ref name="pmid15448977">{{cite journal |author=Juliano LM, Griffiths RR |title=A critical review of caffeine withdrawal: empirical validation of symptoms and signs, incidence, severity, and associated features |journal=Psychopharmacology (Berl.) |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=1–29 |year=2004| url=http://neuroscience.jhu.edu/griffiths%20papers/CaffwdReview.2004.pdf|pmid=15448977 |doi=10.1007/s00213-004-2000-x}}</ref> Withdrawal headaches are experienced by 52% of people who stopped consuming caffeine for two days after an average of 235&nbsp;mg caffeine per day prior to that.<ref name="pmid1528206">{{cite journal | author = Silverman K, Evans SM, Strain EC, Griffiths RR | title = Withdrawal syndrome after the double-blind cessation of caffeine consumption | journal = N.

Peer knowledge, support and interaction may aid withdrawal.

Caffeine withdrawal is categorized as a [[mental disorder]] in the [[DSM-5]] (the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/05/31/caffeine-withdrawal-is-now-a-mental-disorder/#ixzz2VGUqUg1D |title=Caffeine Withdrawal Is Now a Mental Disorder |author=Matt Peckham |publisher=Time |date=May 31, 2013}}</ref>  Previous versions of the manual included "caffeine intoxication" but not caffeine withdrawal.

Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. This amounts to one serving of a caffeinated beverage for every person every day.<ref name="abc.net">{{cite web |title=What's your poison: caffeine |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |year=1997 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/poison/caffeine/caffeine.htm |accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>

Caffeine is found in many [[plant]] species, where it acts as a natural [[pesticide]], with high caffeine levels being observed in seedlings still developing foliage but lacking mechanical protection;<ref>{{cite journal | author = Frischknecht PM, Ulmer-Dufek J, Baumann TW |title=Purine alkaloid formation in buds and developing leaflets of Coffea arabica: Expression of an optimal defence strategy? |journal=Phytochemistry |volume=25 |pages=613–6 |year=1986 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(86)88009-8 |issue=3}}</ref> caffeine [[paralysis|paralyzes]] and kills certain [[insect]]s feeding on the plant.<ref name="insecticide">{{cite journal |author=Nathanson JA |title=Caffeine and related methylxanthines: possible naturally occurring pesticides |journal=Science |volume=226 |issue=4671 |pages=184–7 |year=1984 |pmid=6207592 |doi=10.1126/science.6207592}}</ref> High caffeine levels have also been found in the surrounding soil of coffee bean seedlings.

The disparity in experience and effects between the various natural caffeine sources could be because plant sources of caffeine also contain widely varying mixtures of other [[xanthine]] [[alkaloid]]s, including the [[cardiac]] stimulants [[theophylline]] and [[theobromine]], and other substances such as [[polyphenol]]s that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite book |author=Balentine D. A., Harbowy M. E. and Graham H. N. |title=Tea: the Plant and its Manufacture; Chemistry and Consumption of the Beverage |journal=Caffeine |year=1998|editor=G Spiller}}</ref>

One of the world's primary sources of caffeine is the coffee "bean" (which is the seed of the [[coffea|coffee plant]]), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of [[coffee bean]] and the method of preparation used;<ref name="ICO">{{cite web |title=Caffeine |publisher=International Coffee Organization |url=http://www.ico.org/caffeine.asp |accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref> even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety [[espresso]], to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of [[drip coffee]].<ref name="caffaq_roast">{{cite web |title=Coffee and Caffeine FAQ: Does dark roast coffee have less caffeine than light roast? |url=http://coffeefaq.com/site/node/15 |accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref><ref name="jeremiahspick">{{cite web |title=All About Coffee: Caffeine Level |publisher=Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Co |url=http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080318102343/http://www.jeremiahspick.com/caffeine-e-13.html|archivedate=2008-03-18|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> ''[[coffea arabica|Arabica]]'' coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the ''[[coffea canephora|robusta]]'' variety.<ref name="ICO" />

In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces a small amount of the bean's caffeine content.<ref name="caffaq_roast" /><ref name="jeremiahspick" />

Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since tea is normally brewed much weaker. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, certain types of tea may contain somewhat more caffeine than other teas.<ref name="FRI">{{cite journal | author =Hicks MB, Hsieh Y-H P, Bell LN |title=Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration |journal=Food Research International |year=1996 |volume=29 |pages=325–330 |doi=10.1016/0963-9969(96)00038-5 |issue=3–4}}</ref>

Tea contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and slightly higher levels of [[theophylline]] than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese [[green tea]], ''[[gyokuro]]'', for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like ''[[lapsang souchong]]'', which has very little.<ref name="FRI" />

[[File:No-Doz.jpg|thumb|180px|right|No-Doz 100 mg caffeine tablets]]

Caffeine is also a common ingredient of [[soft drink]]s, such as [[cola]], originally prepared from [[kola nut]]s. Soft drinks typically contain about 10 to 50 milligrams of caffeine per serving. By contrast, [[energy drink]]s, such as [[Red Bull]], can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of [[decaffeination]] or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring [[slow-release]] [[excipient]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bempong DK, Houghton PJ, Steadman K |year=1993 |title=The xanthine content of guarana and its preparations |journal=Int J Pharmacog |issn=0925-1618 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=175–181 |doi=10.3109/13880209309082937}}</ref>

[[Chocolate]] derived from cocoa beans contains a small amount of caffeine.

The two amide groups of caffeine exist predominately as [[zwitterion]]ic [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance structures]] where the nitrogen and carbon atoms are double bonded to each other so that both of these nitrogen atoms are essentially planar (in sp<sup>2</sup> [[orbital hybridization]]). The fused ring system therefore contains a total of ten [[pi bond|pi electrons]] and hence according to [[Hückel's rule]] is [[aromaticity|aromatic]].{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

Caffeine is synthesized in plants from the [[purine]] [[nucleotide]]s [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], [[guanosine monophosphate|GMP]], and [[Inosinic acid|IMP]].

==Pharmacology==
Inside the body caffeine acts through several mechanisms, but its most important effect is to counteract a substance called [[adenosine]] that naturally circulates at high levels throughout the body, and especially in the nervous system. In the brain, adenosine plays a generally protective role, part of which is to reduce neural activity levels&nbsp;– for example, there is some evidence that adenosine helps to induce [[torpor]] in animals that seasonally hibernate.<ref name="pmid21795527">{{cite journal |author=Jinka TR, Tøien Ø, Drew KL |title=Season primes the brain in an arctic hibernator to facilitate entrance into torpor mediated by adenosine A(1) receptors |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=31 |issue=30 |pages=10752–8 |year=2011 |pmid=21795527 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1240-11.2011 |pmc=3325781}}</ref>

===Mechanism of action===
[[File:Caffeine and adenosine.svg|thumb|250px|Caffeine's primary mechanism of action is as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine]] receptors in the brain|alt=Two skeletal formulas: left&nbsp;– caffeine, right&nbsp;– adenosine.]] [[Adenosine]] acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. "Largely as a consequence of its blockade of [[adenosine]] receptors, caffeine also has profound effects on most of the other major neurotransmitters, including dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and, in high doses, on norepinephrine",<ref>http://worldofcaffeine.com/caffeine-and-neurotransmitters/</ref> and to a small extent [[epinephrine]], [[glutamate]], and [[cortisol]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  At high doses, exceeding 500 milligrams, caffeine inhibits [[GABA]] neurotransmission.  [[GABA]] reduction explains why caffeine increases anxiety, insomnia, rapid heart and respiration rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Because caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of [[adenosine receptor]]s (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a [[competitive inhibitor]].<ref name="pmid15095008">{{cite journal |author=Fisone G, Borgkvist A, Usiello A |title=Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=61 |issue=7–8 |pages=857–72 |year=2004 |pmid=15095008 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3269-3}}</ref>

Adenosine is found in every part of the body, because it plays a role in the fundamental [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) related energy producing mechanism and is also needed for [[RNA synthesis]], but it has additional functions in the brain. The evidence indicates that brain adenosine acts to protect the brain by suppressing neural activity and by increasing blood flow via receptors located on vascular smooth muscle.<ref name="Latini" /> Brain adenosine levels are increased by various types of metabolic stress, including [[Hypoxia (medical)|lack of oxygen]] and [[ischemia|interruption of blood flow]]. There is evidence that adenosine functions as a synaptically released [[neurotransmitter]] in some parts of the brain; however, stress-related adenosine increases appear to be produced mainly by extracellular metabolism of ATP. Unlike most neurotransmitters, adenosine does not seem to be packaged into vesicles that are released in a voltage-controlled manner, but the possibility of such a mechanism has not been fully ruled out.<ref name="Latini">{{cite journal |author=Latini S, Pedata F |title=Adenosine in the central nervous system: release mechanisms and extracellular concentrations |journal=J. Neurochem. |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=463–84 |year=2001 |pmid=11701750 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00607.x}}</ref>

Several classes of adenosine receptors have been described, with different anatomical distributions. A<sub>1</sub> receptors are widely distributed, and act to inhibit calcium uptake. A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are heavily concentrated in the basal ganglia, an area that plays a critical role in behavior control, but can be found in other parts of the brain as well, in lower densities. There is evidence that A <sub>2A</sub> receptors interact with the [[dopamine]] system, which is involved in reward and arousal. (A<sub>2A</sub> receptors can also be found on arterial walls and blood cell membranes.)<ref name=Basheer/>

Beyond its general neuroprotective effects, there are reasons to believe that adenosine may be more specifically involved in control of the sleep–wake cycle. [[Robert McCarley]] and his colleagues have argued that accumulation of adenosine may be a primary cause of the sensation of sleepiness that follows prolonged mental activity, and that the effects may be mediated both by inhibition of wake-promoting neurons via A<sub>1</sub> receptors, and activation of sleep-promoting neurons via indirect effects on A<sub>2A</sub> receptors.<ref name=Basheer>{{cite journal |author=Basheer R, Strecker RE, Thakkar MM, McCarley RW |title=Adenosine and sleep-wake regulation |journal=Prog.

====Caffeine metabolites====
Metabolites of caffeine also contribute to caffeine's effects. [[Paraxanthine]] is responsible for an increase in the [[lipolysis]] process, which releases [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]] into the blood to be used as a source of fuel by the muscles. [[Theobromine]] is a [[vasodilation|vasodilator]] that increases the amount of oxygen and nutrient flow to the brain and muscles. [[Theophylline]] acts as a smooth [[muscle relaxant]] that chiefly affects [[bronchiole]]s and acts as a [[chronotropic|chronotrope]] and [[inotrope]] that increases heart rate and force of contraction.<ref>{{cite book | author =Dews PB  |title=Caffeine: Perspectives from Recent Research |publisher=Berlin: Springer-Valerag |year=1984|isbn=978-0-387-13532-8}}</ref>

The [[biological half-life]] of caffeine&nbsp;– the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of the total amount of caffeine&nbsp;– varies widely among individuals according to such factors as age, liver function, pregnancy, some concurrent medications, and the level of [[enzyme]]s in the [[liver]] needed for caffeine metabolism. It can also be significantly altered by drugs or hormonal states. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life has been measured with a range of results. Some measures get 4.9 hours,<ref name="half-life" /> and others are at around 6 hours.<ref name="half-life2">{{cite journal |author=Hammami, M. M., Al-Gaai, E. A., Alvi, S., & Hammami, M.

==Detection in biological fluids==
Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2–10&nbsp;mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12–36&nbsp;mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40–400&nbsp;mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15&nbsp;mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.<ref>{{cite book | author  = Baselt R |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=236–9 |isbn=0-931890-08-X}}</ref>

Extraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce decaffeinated coffee and caffeine, is an important industrial process and can be performed using a number of solvents. [[Benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[trichloroethylene]], and [[dichloromethane]] have all been used over the years but for reasons of safety, environmental impact, cost, and flavor, they have been superseded by the following main methods:
* '''Water extraction:''' Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through [[Activated carbon|activated charcoal]], which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.<ref name="Decaffeination">{{cite web | author = Senese F  |title=How is coffee decaffeinated? |publisher=General Chemistry Online |date=2005-09-20 |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/decaffeinating-coffee.shtml |accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>
* '''Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction:''' [[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: CO<sub>2</sub> is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1 °C and pressures above 73 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. Under these conditions, CO<sub>2</sub> is in a "[[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]]" [[Phase (matter)|state]]: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97–99% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO<sub>2</sub> is then sprayed with high pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by [[Activated carbon|charcoal]] [[adsorption]] (as above) or by [[distillation]], [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], or [[reverse osmosis]].<ref name="Decaffeination" />
* '''Extraction by organic solvents:''' Certain organic solvents such as [[ethyl acetate]] present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.<ref name=Decaffeination/>

"Decaffeinated" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases — some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85&nbsp;mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.<ref name="pmid17132260">{{cite journal | author = McCusker RR, Fuehrlein B, Goldberger BA, Gold MS, Cone EJ | title = Caffeine content of decaffeinated coffee | journal = J Anal Toxicol | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 611–3 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 17132260 | doi = 10.1093/jat/30.8.611 | laysummary = http://news.ufl.edu/2006/10/10/decaf/ | laysource =University of Florida News }}</ref>

Use of the [[kola nut]], like the coffee berry and tea leaf, appears to have ancient origins.

The earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an [[Maya civilization|ancient Mayan]] pot dated to 600 BCE. In the New World, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called ''xocolatl'', often seasoned with [[vanilla]], [[chile pepper]], and [[achiote]]. ''Xocolatl'' was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], and cocoa beans were often used as currency.{{citation needed |date=October 2011}}

''Xocolatl'' was introduced to [[Europe]] by the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], and became a popular beverage by 1700.

===Discovery===
[[File:Pierre Joseph Pelletier.jpg|thumb|150px|Pierre Joseph Pelletier]]
In 1819, the German chemist [[Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge]] isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it ''"Kaffebase"'' (i.e., a [[base (chemistry)|base]] that exists in coffee).<ref>{{cite book |last=Runge |first=Friedlieb Ferdinand |title=Neueste phytochemische Entdeckungen zur Begründung einer wissenschaftlichen Phytochemie |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KLg5AAAAcAAJ&pg=P146 |year=1820 |publisher=G. Reimer |location=Berlin |pages=144–159|trans_title=Latest phytochemical discoveries for the founding of a scientific phytochemistry}}</ref> In 1821, caffeine was isolated both by French chemist [[Pierre Jean Robiquet]] and by another pair of French chemists, [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier|Pierre-Joseph Pelletier]] and [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]], according to Swedish chemist [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] in his yearly journal. Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1825 |title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |volume=4 |page=180 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XJI8AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA180|language=German|trans_title=Annual report on the progress of the physical sciences by Jacob Berzelius |last=Berzelius |first=Jöns Jakob}}  From page 180:  "Caféin ist eine Materie im Kaffee, die zu gleicher Zeit, 1821, von Robiquet und Pelletier und Caventou entdekt wurde, von denen aber keine etwas darüber im Drucke bekannt machte."  (Caffeine is a material in coffee, which was discovered at the same time, 1821, by Robiquet and [by] Pelletier and Caventou, by whom however nothing was made known about it in the press.)</ref>  However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating:<ref>{{cite book |title=Jahres-Bericht über die Fortschritte der physischen Wissenschaften von Jacob Berzelius |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iGs1AAAAcAAJ&pg=P270 |volume=7 |year=1828 |language=German |page=270 |author1 = Berzelius |first1 = Jöns Jacob}}</ref> "However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his ''Phytochemical Discoveries'', 1820, pages 146–147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name ''Caffeebase'' a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris." According to Runge, he did this at the behest of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].<ref>In 1819, Runge was invited to show Goethe how belladonna caused dilation of the pupil, which Runge did, using a cat as an experimental subject.  Goethe was so impressed with the demonstration that:  "Nachdem Goethe mir seine größte Zufriedenheit sowol über die Erzählung des durch scheinbaren schwarzen Staar Geretteten, wie auch über das andere ausgesprochen, übergab er mir noch eine Schachtel mit Kaffeebohnen, die ein Grieche ihm als etwas Vorzügliches gesandt. "Auch diese können sie zu Ihren Untersuchungen brauchen," sagte Goethe.  Er hattte recht; denn bald darauf entdeckte ich darin das, wegen seines großen Stickstoffgehaltes so berühmt gewordene Coffein."  (After Goethe had expressed to me his greatest satisfaction regarding the account of the man [whom I'd] rescued [from serving in Napoleon's army] by apparent "black star" [i.e., amaurosis, blindness] as well as the other, he handed me a carton of coffee beans, which a Greek had sent him as a delicacy.  "You can also use these in your investigations," said Goethe.  He was right; for soon thereafter I discovered therein caffeine, which became so famous on account of its high nitrogen content.)<br>
This account appeared in Runge's book ''Hauswirtschaftlichen Briefen'' (Domestic Letters [i.e., personal correspondence]) of 1866.  It was reprinted in:  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe with F.W. von Biedermann, ed., ''Goethes Gespräche'', vol. 10:  ''Nachträge, 1755-1832'' (Leipzig, (Germany):  F.W. v.

Pelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form ''Caféine'' from the French word for coffee: ''café'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pelletier |first=Pierre Joseph |authorlink=Pierre Joseph Pelletier |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire de Médecine |title=Cafeine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rFw_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA35 |accessdate=2011-03-03 |language=French |year= 1822 |publisher=Béchet Jeune |volume=4 |location=Paris |pages=35–36}}</ref> It corroborates Berzelius's account:

The bans on coffee have often had religious, economic, or political reasons rather than being based on concerns for the well-being of the population.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Religion ==
Some [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Church of God (Restoration)]] adherents, and [[Christian Scientists]] do not consume caffeine.{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: "With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided."<ref>{{cite book |title=Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual: Religion 324 and 325 |publisher=LDS Church |location=Salt Lake City |year=2001 |page=209 |url=http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/dc-in/dc-in-081.htm}}</ref>

[[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] generally also abstain from caffeine, as it is alleged to cloud the mind and over-stimulate the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year.{{citation needed |date=September 2011}}

People who refrain from consuming caffeine, for religious or other reasons, may instead use a [[coffee substitute|substitute]] that performs a culturally similar role to coffee.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Caffeinated beverages are widely consumed by Muslims today; in the 16th century, some Muslim authorities made unsuccessful attempts to ban them as forbidden "intoxicating beverages" under [[Islamic dietary laws]].<ref name="Campo2009">{{cite book|author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&pg=PA154|accessdate=1 November 2012|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8|pages=154–}}</ref><ref name="Brown2011">{{cite book|author=Daniel W.
