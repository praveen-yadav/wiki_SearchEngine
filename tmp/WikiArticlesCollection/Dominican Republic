The western third of the island is occupied by the nation of [[Haiti]], making Hispaniola one of two Caribbean islands, along with [[Saint Martin]], that are shared by two countries. Both by area and population, the Dominican Republic is the second largest Caribbean nation (after [[Cuba]]), with {{convert|48445|km2}} and an estimated 10 million people, one million of which live in the capital city, [[Santo Domingo]].<ref name=embassy>{{cite web |url=http://www.domrep.org/gen_info.html |title=Embassy of the Dominican Republic, in the United States |accessdate=February 27, 2009}}</ref><ref name=conapofa>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511103811/http://www.conapofa.gov.do/__estimaciones_y_proyecciones/Estimacionesyproyecciones2008.zip|title=Estimaciones y Proyecciones de la Población Dominicana por Regiones, Provincias, Municipios y Distritos Municipales, 2008 |accessdate=December 25, 2008}} Context: [http://web.archive.org/web/20110808193423/http://www.conapofa.gov.do/estimaciones.asp Estimaciones; Población en Tiempo Real]</ref>

[[Taíno people|Taínos]] inhabited what is now the Dominican Republic since the 7th century. [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island in 1492, and it became the site of the [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|first permanent]] [[European colonization of the Americas|European settlement]] in the Americas, namely Santo Domingo, the country's capital and Spain's first capital in the [[New World]]. After three centuries of Spanish rule, with French and Haitian interludes, the country became independent in 1821. The ruler, [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], intended that the Dominican Republic be part of the nation of [[Gran Colombia]], but he was quickly removed by the Haitian government and "Dominican" slave revolts. Victorious in the [[Dominican War of Independence]] in 1844, Dominicans experienced mostly [[civil war|internal strife]], and also a brief return to Spanish rule, over the next 72 years. The United States occupation of 1916–1924, and a subsequent calm and prosperous six-year period under [[Horacio Vásquez|Horacio Vásquez Lajara]], were followed by the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]] until 1961. The civil war of 1965, the country's last, was ended by [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1965–1966)|a U.S.-led intervention]], and was followed by the authoritarian rule of [[Joaquín Balaguer]], 1966–1978. Since then, the Dominican Republic has moved toward [[representative democracy]],<ref name="CIADemo"/> and has been led by [[Leonel Fernández]] for most of the time after 1996.  [[Danilo Medina]], the Dominican Republic's current president, succeeded Fernández in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent ex-president [[Hipolito Mejia]] .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/20/dominican-republic-elections-2012_n_1531057.html |work=Huffington Post | title=Dominican Republic Elections: Ex-President Hipolito Mejia Challenges Danilo Medina|author=Fox, Ben and Lopez, Ezequiel Abiu|date=May 20, 2012}}</ref>

== Name and symbols ==
For most of its history (up to independence) the colony was known as Santo Domingo,<ref name=firstcolony/> the name of its present capital, and its patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]]. The residents were called "Dominicanos" (Dominicans), which is the adjective form of "Domingo", and the revolutionaries named their newly independent country "La República Dominicana". At present, the Dominican Republic is one of two nations worldwide (along with the Central African Republic) with only a [[demonym]]-based name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/list2.htm |title=Alphabetical List of Countries |publisher=Internet World Statistics }} For example, the French Republic is generally known as France, but the Dominican Republic has no such equivalent, although the name "Quisqueya" is used sometimes. The Czech Republic is also known as Czechia.</ref> In the national anthem of the Dominican Republic ([[Himno Nacional Dominicano|Himno Nacional]]) the term 'Dominican' never appears. The author of its lyrics [[Emilio Prud'Homme]] consistently uses the poetic term ''[[Quisqueyano]]s'', that is, "Quisqueyans". The word "Quisqueya" is a derivative from a native tongue of the Taino Indians which means, "Mother of all Lands."  It is often used in songs as another name for the country.

The name of the country is regularly shortened to "the D.R."<ref name=Kraft>{{cite news |title=Paradise On The Beach Resorst Are Beautiful In Caribbean's Punta Cana, But Poverty Is Outside The Gates |author= |first=Randy |last=Kraft |authorlink= |authorlink2= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-08-27/entertainment/3318706_1_punta-cana-caribbean-sea-white-beach |format= |agency= |newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=August 27, 2000 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate= |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IgYqdHQG |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |deadurl= |ref=}}</ref>

Some of the important symbols include the [[flag of the Dominican Republic|flag]], [[Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic|the coat of arms]], and the national anthem, titled ''[[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|Himno Nacional]]''. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternate interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |title=Ejército Nacional de la República Dominicana – Bandera Nacional |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=Spanish}}</ref> In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible is said to represent the truth and the light. The Gold Cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, "Dios, Patria, Libertad" (meaning "God, Fatherland, Liberty"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, "República Dominicana" (meaning "Dominican Republic"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.

The [[Floral emblem|national flower]] is the [[Pereskia quisqueyana|Bayahibe Rose]] and the [[national tree]] is the [[Swietenia mahagoni|West Indian Mahogany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.listindiario.com/la-vida/2011/7/16/196080/La-rosa-de-Bayahibe-nuestra-flor-nacional |title=La rosa de Bayahíbe, nuestra flor nacional|author=López, Yaniris |work=Listin Diario |date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The national bird is the ''Cigua Palmera'' or [[Palmchat]] ("Dulus dominicus").<ref name=depaul>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo,30016,html |title=El jardín Botánico Nacional :: Salud :: DiarioDigitalRD.com – Noticias Republica Dominicana |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |last=Pérez |first=Faustino |work=DiarioDigitalRD.com |language=Spanish}}</ref>

[[File:Alcazar de Colon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alcázar de Colón|Alcázar of Colón]], located in Santo Domingo, is the oldest [[Viceroy|Viceregal]] residence in all of the Americas.]]
Santo Domingo's population saw a spectacular increase during the 18th century, as it rose from some 6,000 in 1737 to about 125,000 in 1790. Approximately, this was composed of 40,000 white landowners, 25,000 black or mulatto freedmen, and 60,000 slaves.<ref name=firstcolony/>

After its conquest of the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca Empire|Incas]], Spain neglected its Caribbean holdings. French [[buccaneer]]s settled in western Hispaniola, and by the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Spain ceded the (now Haitian) area to France. France created a wealthy colony Saint-Domingue there, with a population – at the end of the 18th century – 90% enslaved and overall four times as numerous (500,000 vs 125,000) as the Spanish area (now Dominican).<ref name=firstcolony>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic – The first colony |accessdate=June 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

France came to own the island in 1795, when by the [[Peace of Basel]] Spain ceded Santo Domingo as a consequence of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. At the time, Saint-Domingue's slaves, led by [[Toussaint Louverture]], were in revolt against France. In 1801 they captured Santo Domingo, thus controlling the entire island; but in 1802 an army sent by [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] captured Toussaint Louverture and sent him to France as prisoner. However, Toussaint Louverture's lieutenants, and [[yellow fever]], succeeded in expelling the French again from Saint-Domingue, which in 1804 the rebels made independent as the Republic of Haiti. Eastwards, France continued to rule Spanish Santo Domingo.

In 1805, Haitian troops of general [[Henri Christophe]] invaded Santo Domingo and sacked the towns of Santiago de los Caballeros and [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Moca]], killing most of their residents and helping to lay the foundation for two centuries of animosity between the two countries.

=== Haitian occupation ===
In 1808, following [[Peninsular War|Napoleon's invasion of Spain]], the ''[[Criollo (people)|criollos]]'' of Santo Domingo revolted against French rule and, with the aid of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] (Spain's ally) and Haiti,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/4.htm |title=Dominican Republic – Haiti and Santo Domingo |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref> returned Santo Domingo to [[España Boba|Spanish control]].<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117380/Dominican-Republic|title= Dominican Republic|accessdate=June 20, 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>

[[File:Juan pablo duarte diez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Juan Pablo Duarte]] is widely considered the architect of the Dominican Republic and the country's [[independence]] from [[Haiti]]an rule in 1844.]]

After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821. He requested the new state's admission to [[Simón Bolívar]]'s republic of [[Gran Colombia]], but Haitian forces, led by [[Jean Pierre Boyer|Jean-Pierre Boyer]], invaded just nine weeks later, in February 1822.<ref name="guitar">{{cite web |last = Guitar |first = Lynne |title = History of the Dominican Republic |publisher = Hola.com |url = http://www.hispaniola.com/dominican_republic/info/history.php |accessdate =May 29, 2007}}</ref>

As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. They also nationalized most private property, including all the property of landowners who had left in the wake of the invasion; much [[Catholic Church|Church]] property; as well as all property belonging to the former rulers, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]]. Boyer also placed more emphasis on [[cash crop]]s grown on large plantations, reformed the tax system, and allowed foreign trade. The new system was widely opposed by Dominican farmers, although it produced a boom in sugar and coffee production. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid, and had to "forage and sack" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a "heavy tribute" on the Dominican people.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}} Many whites fled Santo Domingo for [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]] (both still under Spanish rule), [[Venezuela]], and elsewhere. In the end the economy faltered and taxation became more onerous. Rebellions occurred even by Dominican freedmen, while Dominicans and Haitians worked together to oust Boyer from power. Anti-Haitian movements of several kinds – pro-independence, pro-Spanish, pro-French, pro-British, pro-United States – gathered force following the overthrow of Boyer in 1843.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}}

=== Independence ===
{{See also|Dominican War of Independence}}
[[File:Trinitarios.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[La Trinitaria]] was the organizer of the formation and independence of the Dominican Republic.]]
In 1838 [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name="pons">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| authorlink =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 1-55876-191-8}}</ref>{{rp|p147–149}} [[Matías Ramón Mella]] and [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent Republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Encarta"/>

The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Threatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions occurring in 1844, 1845–49, 1849–55, and 1855–56.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}}

Meanwhile, archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and Báez the United States.

In 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to colonial status, the only Latin American country to do so. His ostensible aim was to protect the nation from another Haitian annexation.<ref name=Sagas>{{cite web| last=Sagas| first=Ernesto| title=An Apparent Contradiction? – Popular Perceptions of Haiti and the Foreign Policy of the Dominican Republic| work=Sixth Annual Conference of the Haitian Studies Association, Boston, Massachusetts| publisher=[[Webster University]]| date=October 14–15, 1994| url=http://www.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti/misctopic/dominican/conception.htm| accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref> But opponents launched the [[Dominican Restoration War|War of Restoration]] in 1863, led by [[Santiago Rodríguez (Massago)|Santiago Rodríguez]], [[Benito Monción]], and [[Gregorio Luperón]], among others.

Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and Báez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General [[Ulises Heureaux]].<ref name=countrystudies>{{cite web |title=Dominican Republic – Ulises Heureaux, 1882–99 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/8.htm |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}</ref>

"Lilís", as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, "a consummate dissembler", who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular.<ref name=countrystudies/><ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Lester D.|title=The Banana Wars|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0-8420-5047-7|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xc1RBfZd3pcC&pg=PA20|year=2002}}</ref> In 1899 he was assassinated.

=== 20th century===
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by [[caudillo]]s in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.<ref name=cs9>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/9.htm |title=Dominican Republic – Renewed conflict, 1899–1916 |accessdate=October 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[Panama Canal]], as the canal was already under construction. He made a small [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|military intervention]] to ward off the European powers, proclaimed his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and in 1905 obtained Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, then the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic, and assumed responsibility for said debt.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=cs9/>

After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux)<ref name=countrystudies/> was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his Cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former [[Secretary of War]] Desiderio Arias maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<ref name="congress">{{cite web| title=Dominican Republic: Occupation by the United States, 1916–1924| work=Country Studies| publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division| url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Ocupacion-1916.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] during the 1916 occupation]]
Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Rear Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by Dominicans. [[United States Navy|U.S. naval]] officers had to fill some cabinet posts, as Dominicans refused to serve in the administration. Censorship and limits on public speech were imposed. The guerrilla war against the U.S. forces was met with a vigorous, often brutal response.<ref name="congress"/>

But the occupation regime, which kept most Dominican laws and institutions, largely pacified the country, revived the economy, reduced the Dominican debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.<ref name="congress"/>

Opposition to the occupation continued, however, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President [[Warren G. Harding]] (1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked to end the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. U.S. government ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.<ref name="congress"/>

The victor was former president (1902–03) [[Horacio Vásquez|Horacio Vásquez Lajara]], who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, and the last U.S. forces left in September. Vásquez gave the country six years of good government, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a peaceful atmosphere.<ref name="congress"/><ref name=locdr11>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/11.htm |title=Dominican Republic – The era of Trujillo| work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

[[File:PartidodeTrujillo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Poster of [[Rafael Trujillo]], representing the [[Dominican Party]].]]
In February 1930, when Vásquez attempted to win another term, opponents rebelled, in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]], by which the latter remained 'neutral' in face of the rebellion. Vásquez resigned. Trujillo then stood for election himself, and in May was elected president virtually unopposed, after a violent campaign against his opponents.<ref name=locdr11/>

There was considerable economic growth during Trujillo's long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935, and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.<ref name=Encarta/>

This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. Trujillo renamed [[Santo Domingo]] to "Ciudad Trujillo" (Trujillo City),<ref name=Encarta/> the nation's – and the Caribbean's – highest mountain ''[[Pico Duarte|La Pelona Grande]]'' (Spanish for: The Great Bald) to "Pico Trujillo" (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak), and many towns and a province.

The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Minerva was an aspiring lawyer who was extremely opposed to Trujillo's dictatorship since Trujillo had begun to make rude sexual advances towards her. The sisters have received many honors posthumously, and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to [[Hermanas Mirabal Province|Provincia Hermanas Mirabal]] (Mirabal Sisters Province). The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Under the PRD presidents, the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of relative freedom and basic human rights.

Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986, and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96--> The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996.<ref name="CIADemo"/>

Fernández oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.<ref name=coha/>

In 2000 the PRD's [[Hipólito Mejía]] won the election. This was a time of economic troubles.<ref name=coha/> Mejía was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004.

Leonel Fernández of the PLD was elected president. He was re-elected in 2008.<ref name=ussdnote/> Fernández and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, such as the construction of the [[Santo Domingo Metro|Metro Railway]] ("El Metro"). On the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.<ref name=coha/>

[[Danilo Medina]] of the PLD was elected president in 2012. He campaigned on a platform of investing more in social programs and education and less in infrastructure.

{{Main|Geography of the Dominican Republic}}
{{See also|Hydroelectricity and dams in the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Dr-map.gif|thumb|left|Map of the Dominican Republic]]

The Dominican Republic is situated on the eastern part of the second-largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]], [[Hispaniola]]. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km²|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name=embassy/> and {{convert|48730|km²|0|abbr=on}} (by the U.S. CIA),<ref name="CIADemo"/> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The country's capital and greatest metropolitan area, [[Santo Domingo]], is located on the southern coast. The country lies between latitudes [[17th parallel north|17°]] and [[20th parallel north|20°N]], and longitudes [[68th meridian west|68°]] and [[72nd meridian west|72°W]].

There are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that are part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0|}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.

The country's mainland has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''Cordillera Septentrional'' ("Northern Mountain Range"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the Samaná Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic – indeed, in the whole of the West Indies – is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' ("Central Mountain Range"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are found the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level), La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|0|ft|0|disp=or}}) and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges. The more northerly of the two is the ''Sierra de Neiba'', while in the south the ''Sierra de Bahoruco'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' ("Eastern Mountain Range"), ''Sierra Martín García'', ''Sierra de Yamasá'' and ''Sierra de Samaná''.

Between the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the city of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and most of the farming areas in the nation. Rather less productive is the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera. Still more arid is the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land in the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.

[[File:DomRep Bacardi Insel.jpg|left|thumb|Cayo Levantado in [[Samana Bay]] is one of the many cays in the D.R.]]

The ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' ("Caribbean Coastal Plain") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' ("Azua Plain"), a very dry region in [[Azua Province]].

A few other small coastal plains are in the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.

[[File:07-05-11LagoEnriquilloDR.jpg|thumb|South shore of Lake Enriquillo, looking northward to the Sierra de Neiba]]

Four major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the [[Vega Real]] and empties into Samaná Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.

There are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rincón or Cabral, with [[freshwater]], and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with [[brackish water]].

[[Bajos de Haina]], {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} west of Santo Domingo, was included on the [[Blacksmith Institute]]'s list of the world's 10 most polluted places, released in October 2006, due to [[lead poisoning]] by a [[battery recycling]] smelter closed in 1999. Cleanup of the site began in 2008, but children continue to be born with high lead levels, causing [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], impaired physical growth and [[kidney]] failure.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pina | first = Diógenes | title = Hell in 'God's Paradise' | agency = [[Inter Press Service|Inter Press Service News Agency]] | date= January 26, 2007 | url = http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36323 | accessdate =June 4, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Robles | first = Francis | title = Pollution sickens children in Dominican Republic | work = The Miami Herald | date= March 13, 2007 | url = http://www.miamiherald.com/949/story/39816.html | accessdate =May 29, 2007 }}</ref>

Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946 it suffered a magnitude 8.1 earthquake off the northeast coast. This triggered a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. The wave was also recorded at Daytona Beach, Florida and Atlantic City, New Jersey. The area remains at risk. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems, and are mapping risk in low-lying areas.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Hurr-georges-19980922-g8vis.gif|thumb|[[Hurricane Georges]] making landfall in the Dominican Republic]]
The climate of the Dominican Republic is mostly [[tropical climate|tropical]]. The annual average temperature is {{convert|25|C|F}}. At higher elevations, the temperature averages {{convert|18|C|F|1}} while near sea level the average temperature is {{convert|28|C|F|1}}. Low temperatures of {{convert|0|C|F}} are possible in the mountains while high temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F}} are possible in protected valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the year, while August is the hottest month. Some snowflakes can fall in rare occasions on the top of the Pico Duarte.<ref name="DRcli"/>

The [[wet season]] along the northern coast lasts from November through January. Elsewhere, the wet season stretches from May through November, with May being the wettest month. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|1500|mm|in|1}} countrywide, with individual locations in the Valle de Neiba seeing averages as low as {{convert|350|mm|in|1}} while the Cordillera Oriental averages {{convert|2740|mm|in|1}}. The driest part of the country lies in the west. [[Tropical cyclones]] strike the country every couple of years, with 65% of the impacts along the southern coast. Hurricanes are most likely between August and October.<ref name="DRcli">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/19.htm|title=Dominican Republic – Climate|author=[[United States Library of Congress]]|publisher=Country Studies US|date=May 24, 2007|accessdate=October 27, 2009}}</ref> The last time a category 5 hurricane struck the country was [[Hurricane David]] in 1979.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

== Government and politics ==
[[File:National Palace Dominican Republic1.jpg|thumb|National Palace in Santo Domingo]]
{{Main|Government of the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic is a [[representative democracy]] or [[Democracy|democratic republic]],<ref name="CIADemo"/><ref name=embassy/><ref name=ussdnote/> with three branches of power: executive, [[Legislature|legislative]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]]. The [[President of the Dominican Republic]] heads the executive branch and executes laws passed by the [[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Congress]], appoints the Cabinet, and is commander in chief of the [[Military of the Dominican Republic|armed forces]]. The president and vice-president run for office on the same ticket and are elected by direct vote for 4-year terms. The national legislature is bicameral, composed of a [[Senate of the Dominican Republic|Senate]], which has 32 members, and the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic|Chamber of Deputies]], with 178 members.<ref name=ussdnote/> Judicial authority rests with the [[Government of the Dominican Republic#Judicial branch|Supreme Court of Justice]]'s 16 members. They are appointed by a council composed of the President, the leaders of both houses of Congress, the President of the Supreme Court, and an opposition or non–governing-party member. The Court "alone hears actions against the president, designated members of his Cabinet, and members of Congress when the legislature is in session."<ref name=ussdnote/>

The president appoints the governors of the 31 provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124 municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo). They are elected at the same time as congressional representatives.<ref name=ussdnote/>

The Dominican Republic has a multi-party political system. Elections were held every two years, alternating between the [[Elections in the Dominican Republic|Presidential elections]], which are held in years evenly divisible by four, and the Congressional and municipal elections, which are held in even-numbered years not divisible by four. "International observers have found that presidential and congressional elections since 1996 have been generally free and fair."<ref name=ussdnote/> The Central Elections Board (JCE) of 9 members supervises elections, and its decisions are unappealable.<ref name=ussdnote/> {{Citation needed span|Starting from 2016, elections will be held jointly, after a constitutional reform.|date=July 2013}}

There are [[List of political parties in the Dominican Republic|many political parties]] and [[advocacy group]]s and, new on the scene, [[Non-governmental organization|civil organizations]]. The three major parties are the conservative [[Social Christian Reformist Party]] (Spanish: Partido Reformista Social Cristiano [PRSC]), in power 1966–78 and 1986–96; the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Dominicano [PRD]), in power in 1963, 1978–86, and 2000–04; and the [[centrism|centrist]] [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[reformist]] [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (Spanish: Partido de la Liberación Dominicana [PLD]), in power 1996–2000 and since 2004.

The [[Dominican Republic presidential election, 2008|presidential elections of 2008]] were held on May 16, 2008, with incumbent Leonel Fernández winning with 53% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Election propels Dominican president to third term |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/17/us-dominican-election-idUSN1638429020080517 |first=Tom |last=Brown |work=Reuters|date=May 17, 2008}}</ref> He defeated Miguel Vargas Maldonado, of the PRD, who achieved a 40.48% share of the vote. Amable Aristy, of the PRSC, achieved 4.59% of the vote. Other minority candidates, which includes former Attorney General [[Guillermo Moreno]] from the [[Movement for Independence, Unity and Change]] (Movimiento Independencia, Unidad y Cambio [MIUCA]) and PRSC former presidential candidate and defector Eduardo Estrella obtained less than 1% of the vote.

===Military===<!--this section needs a rewrite; it was pasted from the source-->
{{Main|Military of the Dominican Republic}}
[[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Congress]] authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. However, approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The Commander in Chief of the military is the President. The principal missions are to defend the nation and protect the territorial integrity of the country. The army, larger than the other services combined with approximately 20,000 active duty personnel, consists of six infantry [[brigade]]s, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. In the Caribbean, only Cuba has a larger military force.<ref name=ussdnote/>

The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The Secretary of the Armed Forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). Additionally, the armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).<ref name=ussdnote/>

The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces, but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.<ref name=ussdnote/>

== Provinces and municipalities ==
{{Main|Provinces of the Dominican Republic|Municipalities of the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic is divided into 31 [[Provinces of the Dominican Republic|provinces]]. Santo Domingo, the capital, is designated [[Distrito Nacional]] (National District). The provinces are divided into municipalities (''[[municipio]]s''; singular ''municipio''). They are the second-level political and [[Administrative division|administrative subdivisions]] of the country.

The Dominican Republic is primarily dependent on natural resources and government services. Although the service sector has recently overtaken agriculture as the leading employer of Dominicans (due principally to growth in tourism and [[Free Trade Zones]]), agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place, behind mining, in terms of export earnings. The service sector in general has experienced growth in recent years, as has construction. Free Trade Zone earnings and tourism are the fastest-growing export sectors. Real estate tourism alone accounted for $1.5 billion in earnings for 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/economy/2007/7/19/24747/Dominican-real-estate-tourism-boom-US15-billion-in-2007-US30-billion |title=Dominican real estate tourism boom: US$1.5 billion in 2007, US$3.0 billion in 3 years |accessdate=June 10, 2008 |publisher=Dominican Today |date=July 19, 2007}}</ref> [[Remittances]] from Dominicans living abroad amounted to nearly $3.2 billion in 2007.<ref name=ussdnote/>

Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation until 2002, after which the economy entered a [[recession]].<ref name=ussdnote/>

[[File:SantiagoCitySkyline2.jpg|thumb|La Trinitaria in Santiago de Los Caballeros is an area of increasing development.]]

This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest [[commercial bank]] in the country, [[Banco Intercontinental|Baninter]], linked to a major incident of fraud valued at $3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%. All defendants, including the star of the trial, Ramon Baez Figueroa, were convicted. One subpoena was not delivered because the United States denied extradition.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

According to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked No. 71 in the world for resource availability, No. 79 for human development, and No. 14 in the world for resource mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.

The country has a noted problem of child labor in its coffee, rice, sugarcane, and tomato industries.<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/2011TVPRA.pdf List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor].

=== Currency ===
The [[Dominican peso]] (DOP, or RD$<ref name=XE/>) is the national currency, although United States dollars (USD) and euros (EUR) are also accepted at most tourist sites. The dollar is implicated in almost all [[commercial transaction]]s of the Dominican Republic; such [[dollarization]] is common in high inflation economies. Americans traveling to the Dominican Republic have a very good exchange rate. The exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, liberalized by 1985, stood at 2.70 pesos per dollar in August 1986,<ref name=pons/>{{rp|p417, 428}} 14.00 pesos in 1993, and 16.00 pesos in 2000.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Playa Bavaro.JPG|left|thumb||A beach in [[Punta Cana]]]]
Tourism is fueling the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The country is the most popular tourist destination in the Caribbean. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, and the Moon Palace Resort in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.<!--2009?--> [[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in the nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]] and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the Country that he or she lives in.

=== Communications ===
{{Main|Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic has a well-developed telecommunications infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and [[landline]] services. [[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service and most recently, the Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service, offered by [[Orange S.A.|Orange]]. The reported speeds are from 256 kbit/s / 128 kbit/s for residential services, up to 5 Mbit/s / 1 Mbit/s for residential service. For commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').

The largest telecommunications company is [[Claro República Dominicana|Claro]] – part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[América Móvil]] – which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services. Indotel reports that as of June 5, 2009 there are more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP.<ref name=LD2009-06-05/> Indotel reports 6,807,831 prepaid and just under a million (994,027) post-pay (under-contract) cell user accounts. For fixed phone lines (non-cell) it reports 678,901 dedicated lines in use for residential services. For business lines it reports 266,341. For public phones/services it reports 13,639. As of the second quarter of 2008, there are no more analog lines in the trunk services by local providers. Indotel reports 2,439,997 Internet users in the country for the end of March 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110226134642/http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option,com_docman/task,cat_view/gid,110/Itemid,757|title=Indicadores Telefonicos 2009 |accessdate=June 5, 2009 |work=Indotel}}</ref>

In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a "gender perspective" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government.<ref>[http://elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=175919 Indotel garantiza igualdad de género en proyectos tecnológicos realiza en todo el país]. elnuevodiario.com.do.

=== Electricity ===
{{Main|Electricity sector in the Dominican Republic}}
Electric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fernández.<ref name=coha>{{cite web |url=http://www.coha.org/2004/10/president-leonel-fernandez-friend-or-foe-of-reform |title=Council On Hemispheric Affairs COHA |accessdate=October 4, 2004 |work=Leonel Fernández}}</ref> The recent investment in a "Santo Domingo-Santiago Electrical Highway" to carry 345&nbsp;kW power,<ref name=DT2009-04-29/> with reduced losses in transmission, is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.

During the Trujillo regime, electrical service was introduced to many cities; still, almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and so most do not pay or just pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.<ref name=DT2006-06-01/>

Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 [[volt]]s alternating at 60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]; electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the country has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure. The situation improved somewhat after 2006.<ref>[http://www.cdeee.gov.do/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=791:edesur-agrega-3500-familias-a-24-horas-de-luz&catid=6:noticias&Itemid=2 EDESUR agrega 3,500 familias a 24 Horas de Luz].

=== Transportation ===
{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic has Latin America's third best transportation infrastructure. The country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo towards the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternate routes ([[DR-4]]). In addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the [[DR-28]] (Jarabacoa – Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza – Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nation-wide program to pave these and other commonly used routes.

The [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages and currently on hold.

===Bus Service===
There are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina Técnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA); and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federación Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opción (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas, such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.

There are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Turísticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.

===Santo Domingo Metro===
[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|300px|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]
The Dominican government has put effort towards providing efficient public transportation with the construction of the [[Santo Domingo Metro]], the first mass transit system in the country, and second in the Caribbean and Central American nations, after the [[Tren Urbano]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. On February 27, 2008 president Leonel Fernández tested the system for the first time and free service was offered thereafter several times. Commercial service started on January 30, 2009. Several additional lines are currently being planned, and the metro is currently the largest in the Caribbean region by length and number of stations.

====Line 1====
Line 1 of the Santo Domingo Metro currently runs from Villa Mella, in the Santo Domingo Norte area, to the UASD University. Running through Maximo Gomez Ave. for most of its run.

====Line 2====
Line 2 of the Santo Domingo Metro is running in a "abridged" version, from the intersection of John F. Kennedy Ave. & Luperon Ave. to Francisco del Rosario Sanchez Ave. (Puente de la 17). It connects to Line 1 at the Juan Pablo Duarte station on Maximo Gomez Ave.

===Casta discrimination===
{{Main|Casta}}

During colonial times, Spain created a [[Casta|system of racial stratification]], as the Spaniards were concerned with keeping Spanish and other white lineage as the most desirable. Its effects have since persisted not only in the Dominican Republic, but also throughout the rest of [[Latin America]]. Through competition and fear because of the Dominican Republic's identification with its European heritage rather than the nation's African heritage as well as its neighbor the nation of [[Haiti]], the [[Rafael Trujillo]] regime was explicitly [[antihaitianismo]]. Trujillo used racial persecution and nationalistic fervor against Haitians and Blacks in general.<ref name="Wucker"/><ref name="Shadow">{{cite web |last=McLaughlin |first=John J. |title=The shadow of Trujillo |work=VIEWPOINT – racism fuels political violence in Dominican Republic |work=National Catholic Reporter |month=September | year=2006 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-151974298.html|accessdate=December 22, 2007}}</ref> In doing so, Trujillo himself a mulatto went out of his way to hide his African heritage to further his racist ideologies without fear of racial backlash. In October 2007, a U.N. envoy found that there is rampant racism and discrimination against blacks throughout every sector and segment of Dominican society, especially towards Haitians in particular.<ref name="UN News Centre"/>

According to Silvio Torres-Saillant of the [[City University of New York|CUNY]] Dominican Studies Institute, stated up to 90% of the contemporary Dominican population is made of [[Mulattos]] and Blacks.<ref name="CUNY">{{cite journal |last=Torres-Saillant |first=Silvio |title=The Tribulations of Blackness: Stages in Dominican Racial Identity |journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=25|issue=3|pages=126–146 | year=1998 |doi=10.2307/2634170|jstor=2634170}}</ref> However, most Dominicans do not self-identify as black, and thus have not gained power in proportion to their numbers, in contrast to people of sub-Saharan African ancestry in other countries. Torres-Saillant writes: 
<blockquote>"...&nbsp;no other country in the hemisphere exhibits greater indeterminacy regarding the population's sense of racial identity. To the bewilderment of outside observers, [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominicans]] have traditionally failed to flaunt their blackness as a collective banner to advance economic, cultural or political causes."<ref name="CUNY"/></blockquote>

A variety of terms are used to represent the range of skin tones among residents, such as ''moreno/a'' (brown), ''canelo/a'' (red/brown) ["cinnamon"], ''indio/a'' (Indian), ''blanco/a oscuro/a'' (dark white), and ''trigueño/a'' (literally "wheat colored", or olive skin).<ref name="kiiniiburasalaam">{{cite web |last=Salaam |first=Kiini Ibura |title=There's No Racism Here? – A Black Woman in the Dominican Republic |work=Eyeball Literary Magazine |publisher=ChickenBones: A Journal |year=2000 |url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/kiiniiburasalaam2.htm |accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref> Ramona Hernández, director of the Dominican Studies Institute at [[City College of New York]] asserts that the terms were originally a defense against racism: 
<blockquote>"During the Trujillo regime, people who were dark skinned were rejected, so they created their own mechanism to fight it." She went on to explain, "When you ask, 'What are you?' they don't give you the answer you want&nbsp;... saying we don't want to deal with our blackness is simply what you want to hear."<ref name=miamiherald>{{cite web |last=Robles |first=Frances |title=Black Denial |work=A Rising Voice: Afro-Latin Americans |publisher=The Miami Herald |date=June 13, 2007 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part2/index.html |accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Population Genetics ===
[[File:Missione del Guaricano-Bambina con la nonna.jpg|thumb|Child with grandmother in Santo Domingo]]
Genetic studies of MtDNA, which assesses the direct-line maternal ancestors, found in a 21st -century study that the Dominican Republic's population racial admixture is primarily [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] and [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African]], but there is also a noticeable [[Taíno people|Taíno]] element in the population.<ref name="Guitar"/> Although it was found out that the Dominican Republic overall DNA admixture is multiracial with a significant amount of Taíno DNA which is consistent with both the historical background of the nation but, being that Dominicans range from full Whites to full Blacks to Mulattoes, these genetic findings are not assigned to the whole nation's population. Therefore, it does not suggest that Dominicans in general have Taíno DNA, but rather may or may not have it.

Research published in 2010 showed that 70% of Dominicans have some African genes in their [[mtdna|maternal line]], whereas 15% of Dominicans have Taíno ancestry. According to recent [[Genealogical DNA test|MtDNA]] tests, the average Dominican is approximately 58.1% Caucasian, 35.2% African, and 6.4% Indigenous Amerindian overall.<ref name="Caribbean Business">{{cite web|title=UPR professor: Taíno genes in D.R. |publisher=Caribbean Business |date=June 17, 2010 |url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=44379&ct_id=1 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110510012412/http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=44379&ct_id=1 |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>http://oi46.tinypic.com/jl2efa.jpg</ref>

The nation has two patroness saints: ''Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia'' (Our Lady Of High Grace) and ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' (Our Lady Of Mercy).

The Catholic Church began to lose popularity in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, of priests, and of support programs. During the same time, the Protestant [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement began to gain support. Religious tension between Catholics and Protestants in the country has been rare.

There has always been religious freedom throughout the entire country. Not until the 1950s were restrictions placed upon churches by Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was even put into place, with his assassination.

During World War II, a group of Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of [[Sosúa]]. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.<ref>{{cite web |last=Haggerty |first=Richard |title=Dominican Republic – Religion |work=Dominican Republic: A Country Study |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |year= 1989 |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/33.htm |accessdate=May 21, 2006}}</ref>

The population of the Dominican Republic is entirely [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking; its local [[dialect]] is called [[Dominican Spanish]], it closely resembles [[Canarian Spanish]], and has influences from African languages and borrowed vocabularies from the Arawak language. Schools are based on a Spanish educational model,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20120316174208/http://www.see.gob.do/documentosminerd/Desarrollo%20Curricular/guia-didac-inicial.pdf Guía Didáctica.

ISBN 978-99934-43-26-1</ref> with English being taught as a secondary language in most private schools, it is also being taught in public school as well. [[Haitian Creole]] is spoken by the population of Haitian descent. There is a community of about 8,000 speakers of [[Samaná English]] in the [[Samaná Peninsula]]. They are the descendants of formerly enslaved African Americans who arrived in the nineteenth century.<ref>Ethnologue, [http://www.ethnologue.org/show_country.asp?name=DO Languages of Dominican Republic]</ref> Tourism, American pop culture, the influence of [[Dominican American]]s, and the country's economic ties with the United States motivate other Dominicans to learn English.

=== 20th-Century Immigration ===
{{Main|Japanese settlement in the Dominican Republic}}

{{Main|History of the Jews in the Dominican Republic}}

In the 20th century, many [[Arab]]s (primarily from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]), Japanese, and, to a lesser degree, [[Koreans]] settled in the country as agricultural laborers and merchants. The Chinese companies found business in telecom, mining and railroads. The current Chinese Dominican population totals [[Asian Latin American|50,000]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The [[Arab]] community is rising at an increasing rate. Estimates are at 3,400.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Japanese immigrants, who mostly work in the business districts and markets, are at an estimate of 1,900 living in the country.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The Korean presence is minor but evident, at a population of 500.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Antigua]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Montserrat]], [[Tortola]], [[St. Croix]], [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], and [[Guadeloupe]]. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks, and settled mainly in the cities of [[San Pedro de Macoris]] and [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]]. Historically, from the mid-1800s until about 1940, Puerto Rican, and to a lesser extant, Cuban immigrants, were fleeing for the Dominican Republic in droves, facing a poor economy and social unrest in their respective home countries. Many Puerto Rican immigants setteled in [[Higuey]], and quickly assimilated. Before and during World War II, 800 Jewish refugees moved to the Dominican Republic.<ref>{{cite news | title=CCNY Jewish Studies Class to Visit Dominican Village that Provided Refuge to European Jews During World War II | publisher=City College of New York | url =http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/pr/Sosua-Jewish-Studies.cfm |accessdate =May 22, 2007 }}</ref>

A large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain much-needed medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status.

=== Emigration ===
{{Main|Dominican American}}
{{Main|Dominican Republic immigration to Puerto Rico}}

The first of three, late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961, after the assassination of dictator Trujillo,<ref name=Wilderotter/> due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies, and political uncertainty in general. In 1965, the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain US visas.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Morrison, Thomas K. and Sinkin, Richard|jstor=2546161|title=International Migration in the Dominican Republic|journal=International Migration Review|volume= 16|issue=4, Special Issue: International Migration and Development |date=Winter, 1982|pages=819–836|doi=10.2307/2546161}}</ref> From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals. In the early 1980s, underemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to a third wave of emigration from the island nation. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learner.org/channel/libraries/socialstudies/9_12/weir/background.html|publisher=Annenberg Foundation |title=Migration Trends in Six Latin American Countries}}</ref> In 2006, there were approximately 1.3 million people of Dominican descent in the US, counting both native- and foreign-born.<ref name=s0201/> There is also a growing [[Dominican Republic immigration to Puerto Rico|Dominican immigration to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico]], with nearly 70,000 Dominicans residing in the commonwealth nation.

{{Main|Culture of the Dominican Republic}}
{{See also|List of Dominican Republic films}}

The culture and people of the Dominican Republic are a mixture of the cultures of the Spaniard colonists, African slaves, and Taíno natives. European, African and Taíno cultural elements are most prominent in food, family structure, religion and music. Many Arawak/Taíno names and words are used in daily conversation and for many foods native to the Dominican Republic.<ref name="CIADemo"/>

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}

Dominican cuisine is predominantly Spanish, Taíno, and African. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries, but many of the names of dishes are different. One breakfast dish consists of eggs and ''[[Mangú (dish)|mangú]]'' (mashed, boiled plantain). For heartier versions, ''mangú'' is accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically) and/or cheese. Similarly to Spain, lunch is generally the largest and most important meal of the day. Lunch usually consists of rice, meat (such as chicken, beef, pork, or fish), beans, and a side portion of salad. "La Bandera" (literally "The Flag") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.

Meals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods are ''[[chicharrón]]'', ''[[Cassava|yuca]]'', ''[[Tapioca|casabe]]'', ''[[Cuban pastry|pastelitos]]''<!--really?--> ([[empanada]]s), ''[[Sweet potato|batata]]'', [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], ''[[Pasteles|pasteles en hoja]]'', ''[[chimichurris]]'', ''[[tostones]]''. Some treats Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Rice pudding|arroz con leche]]'' (or ''arroz con dulce''), ''bizcocho dominicano'' (lit. Dominican cake), ''[[habichuelas con dulce]]'', [[flan]], ''[[Snow cone|frío frío]]'' (snow cones), [[dulce de leche]], and ''caña'' ([[sugarcane]]). The beverages Dominicans enjoy include ''[[Morir Soñando]]'', [[rum]], beer, ''[[Mama Juana]]'', ''batida'' (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), ''[[Mauby|mabí]]'', coffee, and ''[[chaca (dessert)|chaca]]'' (also called ''maiz caqueao/casqueado'', ''maiz con dulce'' and ''maiz con leche''), the last item being only found in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of the Dominican Republic}}

Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the creation of the musical style called ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'',<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|376–7}} a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the ''[[tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]]'' and ''[[güira]]''. Its [[Syncopation|syncopated beats]] use [[Latin percussion]], [[brass instruments]], bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominicans groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron "Los Reyes del Merengue", Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well-known merengue performers include [[Johnny Ventura]], singer/songwriter [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chichí Peralta]]. Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists, among them Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos, residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida have contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|378}}
[[File:Juan Luis Guerra en Acceso Total (6).jpg|thumb|Dominican singer [[Juan Luis Guerra]] in concert, 2010]]
[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness", or "bitter music", or blues music), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.

[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.

[[Dominican rock]] is also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.

Particularly among the young, hip-hop/rap has been growing in popularity in recent years. Also known as ''Rap del Patio'' ("backyard rap"), Dominican rap is created by Dominican crews and solo artists. Originating in the early 2000s with crews such as [[Charles Family]], successful rappers such as [[Lapiz Conciente]], [[Vakero]], [[Toxic Crow]], and [[R-1 (singer)|R-1]] emerged. The youth have embraced the music, sometimes over merengue, merengue típico, bachata, as well as [[salsa music|salsa]], and, most recently, [[reggaeton]]. Dominican rap differs from reggaeton in the fact that Dominican rap does not use the traditional [[Dem bow|Dem Bow]] rhythm frequently used in reggaeton, instead using more hip hop-influenced beats.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

== Education ==
Primary education is officially free and compulsory for children between the ages of 3 and 17, although those who live in isolated areas have limited access to schooling. Primary schooling is followed by a two-year intermediate school and a four-year secondary course, after which a diploma called the ''bachillerato'' (high school diploma) is awarded. Relatively few lower-income students succeed in reaching this level, due to financial hardships and limitation due to location. Most of the wealthier students attend private schools, which are frequently sponsored by religious institutions. Some public and private vocational schools are available, particularly in the field of agriculture, but this too reaches only a tiny percentage of the population.<ref name=Britannica/>
