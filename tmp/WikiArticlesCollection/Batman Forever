'''''Batman Forever''''' is a 1995 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and produced by [[Tim Burton]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. It is the third installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Val Kilmer]] replacing [[Michael Keaton]] as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Also stars [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Chris O'Donnell]]. The plot focuses on Batman trying to stop [[Two-Face]] and the [[Riddler]] in their villainous scheme to drain information from all the brains in [[Gotham City]]. He gains allegiance from a love interest—psychiatrist [[Chase Meridian|Dr. Chase Meridian]]—and a young, orphaned circus acrobat named [[Dick Grayson]], who becomes his sidekick [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

The film's tone was different from the previous installments, becoming more [[family-friendly]] since [[Warner Bros.]] considered that the previous film, ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), underperformed at the box office due to its violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films, and drew inspiration directly from the Batman comic book seen in the 1940s/early 1950s, and the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s television series]]. The budget of the film was an estimated $100,000,000. Production was troubled, with many actors considered for the main roles. Filming locations include [[Alcatraz Island]], [[San Francisco]], [[California|CA]] and the [[Manhattan Bridge]] in [[New York City]], [[New York|NY]].<ref name="imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112462/</ref>

The film was released on June 16, 1995.  ''Batman Forever'' received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the cinematography, visuals and art direction but noting that it was [[Camp (style)|campier]] and more bombastic than previous installments. The film had success with audiences, out-grossing ''Batman Returns'' with over $336 million worldwide and becoming the sixth-highest grossing film worldwide of 1995. It made $52,784,433 in the United States for its opening weekend (June 22, 1995) on 2842 screens.<ref name="imdb.com"/>

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
In [[Gotham City]], [[Batman]] ([[Val Kilmer]]) stops a hostage situation in a bank caused by [[Two-Face]] ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), the alter ego of the disfigured former [[district attorney]], Harvey Dent. Unfortunately, Two-Face escapes. Edward Nygma ([[Jim Carrey]]), a researcher at [[Wayne Enterprises]], develops a device to beam television directly to a person's brain; Bruce Wayne (with whom Edward is obsessed) rejects the invention, noting that it "raises too many questions", and Edward angrily resigns from his position after killing his supervisor. After meeting psychiatrist [[Dr. Chase Meridian]] ([[Nicole Kidman]]), Bruce invites her to a charity circus event. There, Two-Face and his henchmen storm the event in an attempt to discover Batman's secret identity, and in the process murder ''The Flying Graysons'', a family of acrobats. The youngest member, Dick ([[Chris O'Donnell]]), survives and throws Two-Face's bomb into the river.

Bruce assumes responsibility for Dick and allows him to stay at [[Wayne Manor]]. Dick then declares his intention to kill Two-Face and avenge his family's murder, and when he discovers Bruce's secret identity as Batman, he insists on becoming his partner, "[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]". Meanwhile, Edward becomes a criminal known as the "[[Riddler]]", the master of puzzles and quizzes and forms an alliance with Two-Face. Using his invention that Bruce had rejected earlier, Edward can read and control people's minds, and steal their [[intelligence quotient]]. At a business party, Edward discovers Bruce's secret identity. Two-Face then attacks the party and nearly kills Batman, but Robin arrives just in time to save his life. However, Two-Face and the Riddler later converge into Wayne Manor. The Riddler enters the [[Batcave]] and destroys most of the equipment, and he and Two-Face kidnap Chase, while leaving Bruce another riddle.

After solving the last riddle, Batman and Robin locate the Riddler's lair, Claw Island, where both are separated upon reaching the island. Robin then encounters Two-Face and manages to beat him to the ground; realizing that he does not have it in him to commit murder, Robin helps the villain back up. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Meanwhile, Batman manages to make his way into the Riddler's lair, where Robin and Chase are revealed as hostages, bound, gagged with duct tape and held over a watery chasm, giving Batman a choice of saving just one hostage. Batman finds a way to save both hostages, and manages to destroy the brainwave-collecting device, driving the Riddler into a [[mental breakdown]] in the process. During the battle, Two-Face falls to his death. The Riddler is finally sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], and Chase is asked to consult on his case. Edward Nygma offers to reveal the identity of Batman to her, but he thinks himself Batman. Chase then meets Bruce Wayne outside and tells him his secret is safe. Batman and Robin then continue to protect Gotham City from crime.

===Development===
Even though ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was a financial success, Warner Bros. felt the film should have made more money and decided to make the film series more mainstream. [[Tim Burton]], who had directed the two previous installments, was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer and signed [[Joel Schumacher]] as director.<ref name=Russo>{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html | title = ''Batman 3'' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = October 1, 1993 | accessdate = 2008-08-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080921055255/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html| archivedate= September 21, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> After approving Schumacher as director, Burton met with Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, who agreed with him that "the key element to Batman is his duality.

The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be "lighte[ne]d down". Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. The studio rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a [[prequel]], though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's past. He hired [[Akiva Goldsman]], whom he previously had worked for on ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', to write the second draft of script.<ref name=shadowbat/>

Production went on [[wikt:fast track|fast track]] with [[Rene Russo]] cast as [[Dr. Chase Meridian]].

[[Robin Wright]], [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] and [[Linda Hamilton]] were in competition for Dr. Chase Meridian, with Wright appearing as the favorable choice. [[Nicole Kidman]] was eventually cast.

===Filming===
Filming started in September 1994.<ref name=Russo/> Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a "force" and felt Ling could "advance on it". Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be in any way connected to the previous films, and instead was to be inspired by the images from the ''Batman'' comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a "city with personality", with more statues, as well as various amounts of [[neon]].

Schumacher had problems filming with Kilmer, whom he described as "childish and impossible", reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher during two weeks after the director told him to stop behaving in a rude way.<ref name=Val>{{cite news | author = Rebecca Ascher-Walsh | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292752,00.html | title = Psycho Kilmer |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = May 31, 1995 | accessdate = 2008-11-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081201081414/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292752,00.html| archivedate= December 01 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: "Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I'm tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don't work with them again."<ref>{{cite news| author = Benjamin Svetkey | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293237,00.html | title = Holy Happy Set! |newspaper= Entertainment Weekly| date = July 12, 1996 | accessdate = 2008-08-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080907051616/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293237,00.html| archivedate= September 07 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Design and effects===

[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] designed the [[prosthetic makeup]]. [[John Dykstra]], [[Andrew Adamson]] and [[Jim Rygiel]] served as [[visual effects supervisor]]s, with [[Pacific Data Images]] also contributing to visual effects work. PDI provided a computer-generated Batman for complicated stunts.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9njZ482OYfwC|title=Understanding motion capture for computer animation and video games|first=Alberto|last=Menache|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|year=1999|page=49|ISBN=0-12-490630-3}}</ref> For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together.

===Music===
{{further|Batman Forever (score)|Batman Forever (soundtrack)}}
[[Elliot Goldenthal]] was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written, whereas most composers are hired during production. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from [[Danny Elfman]], and requested an original composition.<ref>{{cite video | title = Scoring Forever: The Music of Batman Forever | format = DVD publisher =Warner Bros.|year=2005}}</ref>

The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s [[Batman (album)|soundtrack]] to the 1989 ''Batman'' film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie, the rest are allegedly 'inspired by' ''Batman Forever'' – a curious claim, since most, if not all, of the tracks were recorded before the film was even released. Hit singles from the soundtrack include "[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me]]" by [[U2]] and "[[Kiss from a Rose]]" by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. "Kiss from a Rose" (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]] (both songs also included in the film), [[Method Man]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Michael Hutchence]] (of INXS), [[PJ Harvey]], and [[Massive Attack]], was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more "pop".

==Deleted scenes==
''Batman Forever'' went through a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the movie's original length was closer to two hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous ''Batman'' films were given special edition DVD releases on the same day as the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/opinion_scissorpuppy_forever.html | title = Batman Forever – What Could Be: A Guide to the Batman Forever Cutting Room Floor | work = Batman-On-Film.com | accessdate = 2008-12-18}}</ref>

Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film, others scenes had footage removed. These included:

* The escape of Two-Face from Arkham Asylum. [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]] had another scene filmed here in the role of Doctor Burton, but his role was reduced to a cameo in the final film. He discovers Two-Face's escape, encountering his psychologist hanged in Two-Face's cell with "The Bat Must Die" written in blood on the wall. This was supposed to be the film's opening scene, but producers decided this was far too dark for a family audience. This scene appears in a rough edit on the special edition DVD. Segments of the scene also appears in the music video for [[U2]]'s "[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me]]".
* The construction of NygmaTech was more in-depth. There were scenes shot that appear in publicity stills of Edward Nygma with a hard hat helping with the construction of his headquarters on Claw Island. This scene does not appear on the new special edition release but is shown in the sticker album published by Merlin Collections.
* Sugar and Spice, played by [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Debi Mazar]], try out the Riddler's device during the montage when it goes on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic adaptation but not in the final film.
* When Two-Face addresses the crowd from the helicopter in the opening action scene, the speech was truncated and several lines that appeared in the Theatrical Trailer were removed, including the line "If the Bat wants to play, we'll play!". Also this sequence contained an extended fight scene between Two-Face and Batman, where they both struggle for control of the helicopter. In this scene, Two-Face accuses Batman of being "a killer too", a direct continuity reference to the first two Batman films in which Batman killed the Joker, the Penguin and several of their respective goons. Two-face then manages to escape by the parachute, after Batman realizes he has locked the steering wheel into position. This sequence is included in rough form on the DVD/Blu-ray release. 
* Several of the Riddler's scenes were also truncated, including the scene where he fails to punch a security guard out. The guard is then brutally beaten, presumably to death. Other scene in the Wayne Manor raid sequence was longer, featuring Bruce and Chase fighting Two-Face and his thugs. The scene involving Chase Meridian on the couch originally included a longer ending where the Riddler injects her with a green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door and the fight scene between Two-Face and Robin on Claw Island was originally longer.
* One scene featured a local Gotham talk show with Chase Meridian as a guest, talking about Batman.
* One sequence came directly after the casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up at the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.
* One scene featured a little conversation with Dick and Bruce in the gym of the manor. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.
* There was originally a scene of Alfred and Bruce examining the NygmaTech "Box".
* An extended scene established Bruce in the Batcave shortly after having discussed with Dick then that this would have saved his life after the battle with Two-Face in the subway system under construction. In this scene he is appreciated as the GNN news (Bruce watching in the Batcomputer) attacking Batman and Two-Face after the battle in the Subway and after that Bruce talking to Alfred turns into the dilemma of continuing to be Batman and try a normal life with Chase. Like the deleted Helicopter fight sequence, this scene also makes reference to Batman himself being "a killer", and in the original production screenplay, this scene was to contain footage from [[Batman Returns]], specifically taken from the rooftop fight scene with Catwoman. This would explain why in the theatrical version Bruce turns off all the systems and else in the Batcave telling Dick he's gives up being Batman. This scene appears in a rough form on the Special Edition DVD. 
* The most well-known deleted scene involved further backstory to the film. It involved Bruce waking up after being shot in the head by Two-Face, temporarily wiping a part of his memory; he has forgotten his origin and life as the Dark Knight. Alfred takes him to the Batcave, which has been destroyed by the Riddler. They stand on the platform where the [[Batmobile]] was, and Alfred says, "Funny they did not know about the cave beneath the cave." The platform then rotates downward to another level where the [[sonar]]-modification equipment is kept, from the special [[Batsuit]] to the hi-tech weaponry. Bruce then discovers the cavern where he first saw the image that inspired him to become Batman – a giant bat. Inside he finds his father's Red Diary. It reminds him of the injustices committed against his family, and of how, in his small way, he felt responsible and helpless. The giant bat then appears and Bruce raises his arms and the shot shows that they are one. Bruce now remembers who he is and goes with Alfred to solve the riddles left throughout the film. Screenwriter [[Akiva Goldsman]] admitted the scene was very theatrical on the special edition DVD and felt it would have made a difference to the final cut. The bat was designed and created by [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]], who was in charge of the make-up of Two-Face. This scene appears in a rough form on the special edition DVD and is briefly mentioned in the comic adaptation.
* The original ending was similar in style to the previous Batman films, which had involved a scene with Alfred in the limousine, the camera tracking upward through the Gotham cityscape, followed by a rooftop shot involving a silhouetted hero (Batman in the original, Catwoman in ''[[Batman Returns]]''') facing the Bat Signal. When Alfred drives Doctor Chase Meridian back to Gotham she asks him "Does it ever end?" Alfred replies, "No, Doctor Meridian, not in this lifetime..." The [[Bat-Signal]] shines on the night sky and Batman is standing on a pillar looking ahead. Robin then comes into shot and joins his new partner. They both leap off the pillar, towards the camera. A rough edit of the first half of the scene appears on the special edition DVD, but not in its entirety. The sequence with Batman and Robin at the end of this scene is not to be confused with a commercial for the video game, whose appears in a teaser trailer for the video game, which is on the VHS release of this film, released in the UK on December 3, 1995.

[[Peter Travers]] said "''Batman Forever'' still gets in its licks. There's no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises."

[[Six Flags Great Adventure]] theme park re-themed their "Axis Chemical" arena, home of the Batman stunt show, to resemble "Batman Forever", and the new show featured props from the film. Because of the mostly negative critical reaction however, the stunt arena was changed back to its original version after the season.
