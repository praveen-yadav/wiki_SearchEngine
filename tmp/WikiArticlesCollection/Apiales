The '''Apiales''' are an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s. The [[Family (biology)|families]], given at right, are those recognized in the [[APG III system]].<ref name=APGIII2009/> This is typical of the newer [[Biological classification|classifications]], though there is some slight variation, and in particular the Torriceliaceae may be divided.<ref name="plunkett2004">Gregory M. Plunkett, Gregory T. Chandler, Porter P. Lowry, Steven M. Pinney, and Taylor S. Sprenkle (2004). "Recent advances in understanding Apiales and a revised classification". ''South African Journal of Botany'' '''70'''(3):371-381.</ref>

Under this definition, well-known members include [[carrot]]s, [[celery]], [[parsley]], and [[ivy]].

The order Apiales is placed within the [[asterid]] group of [[eudicots]] as circumscribed by the APG III system.<ref name=APGIII2009/> Within the asterids, Apiales belongs to an [[Taxonomic rank|unranked]] group called the [[campanulids]],<ref name="winkworth2008">Richard C. Winkworth, Johannes Lundberg, and Michael J. Donoghue (2008). "Toward a resolution of Campanulid phylogeny, with special reference to the placement of Dipsacales". ''Taxon'' '''57'''(1):53-65.</ref> and within the campanulids, it belongs to a [[clade]] known in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] as [[Apiidae]].<ref name="cantino2007">{{citation | author = Philip D.

The [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscriptions]] of some of the families have changed. In 2009, one of the subfamilies of Araliaceae was shown to be [[polyphyletic]].<ref name="nicolas2009">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2009.06.010}}</ref>

==History==
The present understanding of the Apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of [[DNA sequences]] by [[phylogenetic]] methods.<ref name="gregory2004">{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1095-8339.2003.00247.x}}</ref>

Under the [[Cronquist system]], only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The [[Pittosporaceae]] were placed within the [[Rosales]], and many of the other forms within the family [[Cornaceae]]. [[Pennantia]] was in the family [[Icacinaceae]].
