The area totals 151&nbsp;km² (about 0.9 times the size of [[Washington, DC]]) and comprises 16 inhabited and more than 20 uninhabited islands; includes the islands of [[Tortola]], [[Anegada]], [[Virgin Gorda]] and [[Jost van Dyke]]. There are no bodies of water on the land.
There are no land boundaries. There is 80&nbsp;km of coastline. Maritime claims include {{convert|3|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}} of territorial sea and exclusive a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}} fishing zone. It has a tropical, humid climate, with temperatures moderated by trade winds. Its terrain consists of coral islands, and is relatively flat. It has volcanic islands and is steep and hilly. Its lowest point is the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its highest point is [[Mount Sage]] at {{convert|521|m|ft}} above sea level. Its natural resources are negligible. In terms of land use, it is 20% arable land, 6.67% permanent crops and 73.33% other as of a 2005 figure. Its natural hazards consist of hurricanes and tropical storms from July to October.
