A '''call centre''' or '''call center''' is a centralised office used for the purpose of receiving or transmitting a large volume of requests by [[telephone]].  An inbound call centre is operated by a [[company]] to administer incoming product support or information inquiries from consumers.  Outbound call centers are operated for [[telemarketing]], solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection and [[market research]]. In addition to a call centre, collective handling of [[Letter (message)|letter]], [[fax]], [[live support software]], and [[e-mail]] at one location is known as a '''contact centre'''.

A call centre is operated through an extensive open workspace for [[Customer representative|call centre agents]], with work stations that include a computer for each agent, a [[telephone]] set/[[Headphones|headset]] connected to a [[telecom switch]], and one or more supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or networked with additional centres, often linked to a corporate [[computer network]], including [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[microcomputer]]s and [[local area network|LANs]]. Increasingly, the voice and data pathways into the centre are linked through a set of new technologies called [[computer telephony integration]] (CTI).

A '''contact centre''', also known as customer interaction centre is a central point of any organization from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centres, valuable information about company are routed to appropriate people, contacts to be tracked and data to be gathered. It is generally a part of company’s customer relationship management (CRM). Today, customers contact companies by telephone, email, online chat, fax, and [[instant message]].

==Technology==
Call centre technology is subject to improvements and innovations. Some of these technologies include [[speech recognition]] software to allow computers to handle first level of [[customer support]], [[text mining]] and [[natural language processing]] to allow better customer handling, agent training by automatic mining of [[best practices]] from past interactions, [[support automation]] and many other technologies to improve agent productivity and [[customer satisfaction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lvs004.googlepages.com/callcenters.pdf|author=L Venkata Subramaniam|format=PDF|title=Call Centers of the Future|publisher=i.t. magazine|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-05-29|pages=48–51}}</ref> Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7035699/description.html|title=US Patent 7035699 - Qualified and targeted lead selection and delivery system|date=2006-04-25|publisher=Patent Storm|accessdate=2008-05-29}}</ref> both for inbound and outbound campaigns, whereby inbound calls are intended to quickly land with the appropriate agent to handle the task, whilst minimizing wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in, as well as for outbound calls, where lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors and past performance and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.
The concept of the [[Universal Queue]] standardizes the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email whilst the concept of a [[Virtual queue]] provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.[[File:Aspect Tel-set telephone call centre.jpg|thumb|A typical call centre telephone. Note: no handset, phone is for headset use only.]]

'''Premise-based Call Centre Technology'''
Historically, call centres have been built on [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] equipment that is owned and hosted by the call centre operator. The PBX might provide functions such as [[Automatic Call Distribution]], [[Interactive Voice Response]], and [[skills-based routing]]. The call centre operator would be responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and necessary software upgrades as released by the vendor.

'''Virtual Call Centre Technology'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/kapq5p85xnhrwe5b/|author=M. Popovic and V. Kovacevic|title=An Approach to Internet-Based Virtual Call Center Implementation|publisher=University of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia}}</ref>
With the advent of the [[Software as a service]] technology delivery model, the virtual call centre has emerged. In a virtual call centre model, the call centres operator does not own, operate or host the equipment that the call centre runs on. Instead, they subscribe to a service for a monthly or annual fee with a service provider that hosts the call centre telephony equipment in their own data centre. Such a vendor may host many call centres on their equipment. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional [[PSTN]] telephone lines, or over [[Voice over IP]]. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premise. The vendor's telephony equipment then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.

Virtual Call Centre Technology allows people to work from home, instead of in a traditional, centralised, call centre location, which increasingly allows people with physical or other disabilities that prevent them from leaving the house, to work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nticentral.org/about/articles/nnyt03012006.shtm|author=David S. Joachim|title=Computer Technology Opens a World of Work to Disabled People |publisher=New York Times}}</ref> [[File:Predictive dialer end campaign prompt.jpg|thumb|A predictive dialing system running out of phone numbers.]]

'''Cloud Computing for Call Centres'''
Cloud computing for call centres extends cloud computing to [[Software as a service]], or hosted, on-demand call centres by providing application programming interfaces (APIs) on the call centre cloud computing platform that allow call centre functionality to be integrated with cloud-based [[Customer relationship management]], such as [[Salesforce.com]] or [[Oracle CRM]] and leads management and other applications.

The APIs typically provide programmatic access to two key groups of features in the call centre platform:

Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) APIs provide developers with access to basic telephony controls and sophisticated call handling on the call centre platform from a separate application.

Configuration APIs provide programmatic control of administrative functions of the call centre platform which are typically accessed by a human administrator through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Dynamics ==
Calls may be ''inbound'' or ''outbound''. Inbound calls are made by consumers, for example to obtain information, report a malfunction, or ask for help. In contrast, outbound calls are made by agents to consumers, usually for sales purposes ([[telemarketing]]). One can combine inbound and outbound campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3700/is_199611/ai_n8743570|title=Setting up for integrated inbound/outbound telemarketing|publisher=[[BNET]]|author=Freeman, Laura M|coauthors=Whitfield, Hilary C|accessdate=2008-06-05 | year=1996}}</ref>

Call centre staff are often organised into a multi-tier support system for more efficient handling of calls.  The first tier consists of operators, who initially answer calls and provide general information. If a caller requires more assistance, the call is forwarded to the second tier (in the appropriate department depending on the nature of the call). In some cases, there are three or more tiers of support staff. Typically the third tier of support is formed of product engineers/developers or highly skilled technical support staff for the product.

Some critics of call centres argue that the work atmosphere in such an environment is dehumanising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/2005/04/SE0504NU02.htm|title=Working conditions and health in Swedish call centres|publisher=[[European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions]]|date=2005-06-05}}</ref> Others point to the low rates of pay and restrictive working practices of some employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Industry=Call_Center/Hourly_Rate|title=Hourly Rate Survey Report for Industry: Call Center|publisher=[[PayScale]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/lau/lacs/94-2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Advice regarding call centre working practices|publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> There has been much controversy over such things as restricting the amount of time that an employee can spend in the toilet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/toiletbreaks/index.htm|title=Hazards 81 extended briefing: Toilet breaks: Give us a break!|publisher=[[Hazards (magazine)|Hazards]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> Call centres have also been the subject of complaints by callers who find the staff often do not have enough skill or authority to resolve problems,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=873|title=Tone-deaf to customer complaints, Dell opens yet another call center in India|date=2006-01-30|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|author=Shaw, Russell|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> while the staff sometimes appear apathetic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4738804.stm|title=Abuse rattles Indian call centre staff|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-02-22|author=Ahmed, Zubair|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> Other research illustrates how call center workers develop ways to counter or resist this environment by integrating local cultural sensibilities or embracing a vision of a new life.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pal|first=Mahuya|coauthors=Buzzanell, Patrice|title=Breaking the Myth of Indian Call Centers: A Postcolonial Analysis of Resistance|journal=Communication Monographs|year=2013|volume=80|issue=2|page=199}}</ref>

Telephone calls are easily monitored, and the close monitoring of call centre staff is widespread.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.callcentrehelper.com/call_centre_monitoring.htm|title=Call Centre Monitoring|work=Management|publisher=callcentrehelper.com|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> This has the benefit<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.callcentermagazine.com/shared/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=12803684|title=The Call Center Answer Team reaches out to the industry for to crack a tough nut|work=Q&A: How Many Calls Should I Monitor|publisher=callcentermagazine.com|date=2003-07-30|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> of helping the company to plan the workload and time of its employees. However it has also been argued that such close monitoring breaches the human right to privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acewh.dal.ca/eng/reports/moving6.pdf|format=PDF|title=Who’s on the Line? Women in Call Centres Project|publisher=[[Health Canada]]|work=Atlantic Centre of Excellence for Women's Health|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> Most call centres provide electronic reports that outline performance metrics, quarterly highlights and other information about the calls made and received.

== Varieties ==
Some variations <ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6z7661eJIjAC&printsec=frontcover&q=|author=Raik Stolletz|title=Performance Analysis and Optimization of Inbound Call Centers|publisher=Springer-Verlag | isbn=978-3-540-00812-5|year=2003}}</ref> of call centre models are listed below:

*''Contact centre'' – Supports interaction with customers over a variety of media, including but not necessarily limited to [[telephony]],  [[e-mail]] and internet [[Online chat|chat]]. A contact centre is usually an inbound service only.
*''Inbound call centre'' - Exclusively or predominantly handles inbound calls (calls initiated by the customer).
*''Outbound call centre'' - One in which call centre agents make outbound calls to customers or sales leads.
*''Blended call centre'' - Combining automatic call distribution for incoming calls with predictive dialling for outbound calls, it makes more efficient use of agent time as each type of agent (inbound or outbound) can handle the overflow of the other.
*''Telephone answering service'' - A more personalised version of the call centre, where agents get to know more about their customers and their callers; and therefore look after calls just as if based in their customers office.

== Criticism and performance ==
{{Criticism section|date=November 2010}}
Criticisms of call centres generally follow a number of common themes, from both callers and call centre staff. From callers, common criticisms include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/google_login.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116171027921802238.html%3Fmod%3Dgooglenews_wsj |title=If You Want to Scream, Press... - Preview |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref>
* Operators working from a script
* Non-expert operators (call screening)
* Incompetent or untrained operators incapable of processing customers' requests effectively<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol2no24.html |title=nationalcallcenters |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref>
* Obsequious behavior by operators (e.g., relentless use of "sir," "ma'am" and "I'd be more than happy to assist you")
* Overseas location, with language and accent problems
* Touch tone menu systems and automated queuing systems
* Excessive waiting times to be connected to an operator
* Complaints that departments of companies do not engage in communication with one another
* Deceit over location of call centre
* Requiring the caller to repeat the same information multiple times

Common criticisms from staff include:<ref>[http://extranet.ieseg.fr/appli/creasites2/sites/ORB522E/Taylor%20and%20Bain.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>
* Close scrutiny by management (e.g. frequent random call monitoring)
* Low compensation (pay and bonuses)
* Restrictive working practices (some operators are required to follow a pre-written script)
* High stress: a common problem associated with front-end jobs where employees deal directly with customers
* Repetitive job task
* Poor working conditions (e.g. poor facilities, poor maintenance and cleaning, cramped working conditions, management interference, lack of privacy and noisy)
* Impaired vision and hearing problems
* Rude and abusive customers
The net-net of these concerns is that call centres as a business process exhibit levels of variability. The experience a customer gets and the results a company achieves on a given call are almost totally dependent on the quality of the agent answering that call.<ref>Fleming, J., Coffman, C., Harter, J. (2005) Manage Your Human Sigma, Harvard Business Review</ref> Call centres are beginning to address this by using [[Agent-assisted Automation]] to standardise the process all agents use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcallcenters.org/pubs/In_Queue/vol3no12.html#How_to_Win_a_No-Win_Situation |title=NACC |publisher=Nationalcallcenters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}</ref> Anton and Phelps have provided a detailed HOWTO to conduct the performance evaluation of the business,<ref name=hccc>{{cite web

== Outsourced bureau contact centres ==
Outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a "pay per use" model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients thereby supporting a very cost effective model especially for low volumes of calls.

Bureau contact centres provide an opportunity for:
* Pilot schemes - perform test of concept for new models for communications, sales or customer services before investing in staff and infrastructure.
* Flexible solutions for SMEs - small or medium-size enterprises can benefit from a flexible service that can evolve with the business.
* Best of breed systems/technology - clients can benefit from considerable investment into communications technology, receiving benefits without having to invest in large capital expenditure projects.

== Unionization ==
Unions in [[North America]] have made some effort to gain members from this sector,<ref>{{cite book  | coauthors = Pradeep Kumar, Christopher Robert Schenk  | title = Paths to Union Renewal  | publisher = Broadview Press  | year=  2006  | isbn = 1-55193-058-7  | author = ed. by Pradeep Kumar ... }}</ref> including the [[Communications Workers of America]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwa-union.org/news/entry/Improving_Call_Center_Jobs_a_Top_Priority_for_CWA_Customer_Service_Activist/|title=Improving Call Center Jobs a Top Priority for CWA Customer Service |publisher=Communicattion Workers of America|accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> and the [[United Steelworkers]]. In [[Australia]], the [[National Union of Workers]] represents unionised workers; their activities form part of the Australian labour movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workers.labor.net.au/90/news22_call.html|title=Call Centre Union Busters Get Wake-Up Call|publisher=Workers Online|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> In [[Europe]], Uni Global Union of [[Switzerland]] is involved in assisting unionisation in this realm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniglobalunion.org/uniindep.nsf/callcentres?openpage|title=Uni Global Union's call centre organising campaigns|publisher=Uni Global Union|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>

== Mathematical theory ==
[[Queueing theory]] is a branch of mathematics in which models of queueing systems have been developed. A call centre can be seen as a queuing network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~koole/ccmath/book.pdf |title=Call Center Mathematics &#124; A scientific method for understanding and improving contact centers by Ger Koole |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cs.vu.nl/obp/callcenters/overview.pdf Queueing Models of Call Centers: An Introduction Ger Koole]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> The models can be applied to answer queueing questions for call centres.  The most widespread queueing model used is the [[Erlang unit|Erlang C Formula]].

Call centre operations have been supported by mathematical models beyond queueing, with [[operations research]], which considers a wide range of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimisation problems]].

==Media portrayals==
Indian call centres have been the focus of two documentary films, the 2005 film ''[[Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night]]'' and the 2006 film ''[[Bombay Calling]]''. An Indian call centre is also the suject of the 2006 film ''[[Outsourced (film)]]'' and a key location in the 2008 film, ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''.
