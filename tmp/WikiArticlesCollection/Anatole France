'''Anatole France''' ({{IPA-fr|anatɔl fʁɑ̃s|pron}}; born '''François-Anatole Thibault''',<ref name=wikifrance/> {{IPA-fr|frɑ̃swa anatɔl tibo|}}; 16 April 1844 – 12 October 1924) was a French poet, journalist, and novelist. He was born in [[Paris]], and died in [[Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire]]. He was a successful novelist, with several best-sellers. Ironic and skeptical, he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters. He was a member of the ''[[Académie française]]'', and won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in recognition of his literary achievements. 

France is also widely believed<ref>{{cite web |title=Marcel Proust: A Life, by Edmund White,|url=http://tenpagesormore.blogspot.com/2010/07/3-marcel-proust-life-by-edmund-white-pp.html}}</ref> to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol Bergotte in Marcel Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''.

==Early years==
The son of a bookseller, France spent most of his life around books. France was a [[bibliophile]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://benonsensical.com/blog/tag/famous-bibliophiles|title=Anatole France|work=benonsensical|date=24 July 2010}}</ref> His father's bookstore, called the ''Librairie France,'' specialized in books and papers on the [[French Revolution]] and was frequented by many notable writers and scholars of the day.<ref name=wikifrance>[[w:fr:Anatole France]]</ref> Anatole France studied at the ''[[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]]'', a private Catholic school, and after graduation he helped his father by working in his bookstore. After several years he secured the position of cataloguer at Bacheline-Deflorenne and at Lemerre. In 1876 he was appointed librarian for the French Senate.

==Literary career==
Anatole France began his career as a poet and a journalist. In 1869, ''Le Parnasse Contemporain'' published one of his poems, ''La Part de Madeleine''. In 1875, he sat on the committee which was in charge of the third ''Parnasse Contemporain'' compilation. As a journalist, from 1867, he wrote many articles and notices. He became famous with the novel ''Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard'' (1881). Its protagonist, skeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, embodied France's own personality. The novel was praised for its elegant prose and won him a prize from the Académie française. [[File:Anatole France house, Villa Said.jpg|thumb|left|140px|France's home, 5 Villa Said, 1894-1924]]
In ''La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque'' (1893) Anatole France ridiculed belief in the occult; and in ''Les Opinions de Jerome Coignard'' (1893), France captured the atmosphere of the ''[[fin de siècle]]''.
France was elected to the ''Académie française'' in 1896.

France took an important part in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]. He signed [[Émile Zola]]'s manifesto supporting [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish army officer who had been falsely convicted of [[espionage]]. France wrote about the affair in his 1901 novel ''Monsieur Bergeret''.

France's later works include ''[[Penguin Island (novel)|L'Île des Pingouins]]'' (1908) which satirizes human nature by depicting the transformation of penguins into humans – after the animals have been baptized by mistake by the nearsighted Abbot Mael. ''[[The Gods Are Athirst|Les dieux ont soif]]'' (1912) is a novel, set in Paris during the [[French Revolution]], about a true-believing follower of [[Robespierre]] and his contribution to the bloody events of the [[Reign of Terror]] of 1793-94. It is a wake-up call against political and ideological fanaticism and explores various other philosophical approaches to the events of the time. ''La Revolte des Anges'' (1914) is often considered France's most profound novel. It tells the story of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Arcade falls in love, joins the revolutionary movement of angels, and towards the end realizes that the overthrow of God is meaningless unless "in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy [[Demiurge|Ialdabaoth]]."

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. He died in 1924 and is buried in the [[Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery]] near Paris.

On 31 May 1922,  France's entire works were put on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (Prohibited Books Index) of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/indexlibrorum.html |title= Modern History Sourcebook: Index librorum prohibitorum, 1557–1966 (Index of Prohibited Books) |first= Paul |last= Halsall |date= May l, 1998 |publisher= [[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]] ([[Fordham University]]) }}</ref> He regarded this as a "distinction".<ref>''Current Opinion'', September 1922, p. 295.</ref> This Index was abolished in 1966.

==Private life==
In 1877, Anatole France married Valérie Guérin de Sauville, a granddaughter of [[Jean-Urbain Guérin]] a [[miniaturist]] who painted Louis XVI,<ref name="Leduc2004">{{cite book|author=Edouard Leduc|title=Anatole France avant l'oubli|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lRpAHOLmpF4C&pg=PA222|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Editions Publibook|isbn=978-2-7483-0397-1|pages=222–}}</ref> with whom he had a daughter, Suzanne, in 1881 (dec. 1918). France's relations with women were always turbulent, and in 1888 he began a relationship with [[Léontine Lippmann|Madame Arman de Caillavet]], who conducted a celebrated literary salon of the [[Third Republic of France|Third Republic]]; the affair lasted until shortly before her death in 1910. <ref name="Leduc2004">{{cite book|author=Edouard Leduc|title=Anatole France avant l'oubli|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lRpAHOLmpF4C&pg=PA222|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Editions Publibook|isbn=978-2-7483-0397-1|pages=219}}</ref> After his divorce in 1893, he had many liaisons, notably with Mme. Gagey, who committed suicide in 1911. France married again in 1920, Emma Laprévotte.<ref name=Lahy-Hollebecque>Lahy-Hollebecque, M. (1924). ''Anatole France et la femme''.

==Reputation==
After his death in 1924 France was the object of written attacks, including a particularly venomous one from the Nazi [[Collaborationism|collaborator]], [[Pierre Drieu la Rochelle]], and detractors decided he was a vulgar and derivative writer. An admirer, the English writer [[George Orwell]], defended him however and declared that he remained very readable, and that "it is unquestionable that he was attacked partly from political motives. The clerics and reactionaries hated him in just the same way as they hated Zola. [France] had lost no opportunity of poking fun at the Church. He was everything that the clerics and revanchists, the people who afterwards sucked the blacking off Hitler's boots, most detested." <ref>Orwell, Collected Works, I Have Tried to Tell the Truth, p.262</ref>
