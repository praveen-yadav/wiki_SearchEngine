'''Dynamics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δυναμικός'' - ''dynamikos'' "powerful", from  ''δύναμις'' - ''dynamis'' "[[power (disambiguation)|power]]") may refer to:

==Physics and engineering==

* [[Dynamics (mechanics)]],
** [[Aerodynamics]], the study of gases in motion
** [[Analytical dynamics]], the motion of bodies as induced by external forces
** Anomalous dynamics ([[Random walk#Anomalous diffusion]]), the stochastic motion of objects with [[mean squared displacement]] (''MSD'') that deviates from the relation for normal dynamics, ''MSD''~''t'', where ''t'' is the time the process is seen; anomalous dynamics are either faster than normal dynamics (''MSD''>''t'') or slower (''MSD''<''t'')
** [[Brownian dynamics]], the occurrence of Langevin dynamics in the motion of particles in solution (e.g. a grain in water, as was first seen by Brown); its famous property is: ''MSD''~''t'', where ''MSD'' is the mean squared displacement, and ''t'' is the time the process is seen
** [[File dynamics]], stochastic motion of particles in a channel
** [[Flight dynamics]], the science of aircraft and spacecraft design
** [[Fluid dynamics]] or ''hydrodynamics'', the study of fluid flow
*** [[Computational fluid dynamics]], a way of studying fluid dynamics using numerical methods
** [[Fractional dynamics]], studies the dynamics with integrations and differentiations of fractional orders (in physics, economics, and related fields)
** [[Molecular dynamics]], the study of motion on the molecular level
** Normal dynamics, is a stochastic motion having a Gaussian probability density function in position with variance ''MSD'' that follows, ''MSD''~''t'', where ''MSD'' is the mean squared displacement of the process, and ''t'' is the time the process is seen (normal dynamics and [[Brownian dynamics]] are very similar; the term used depends on the field)
** [[Langevin dynamics]], a mathematical model for stochastic dynamics; used in modeling molecules, yet also the stock market and other systems 
** [[Quantum chromodynamics]], a theory of the strong interaction (color force)
** [[Quantum electrodynamics]], a description of how matter and light interact
** [[Relativistic dynamics]], a combination of relativistic and quantum concepts
** Single file dynamics (also termed [[file dynamics]]), the diffusion of particles in a channel
** [[Stellar dynamics]], a description of the collective motion of stars
** [[System dynamics]], the study of the behavior of complex systems
** [[Thermodynamics]], the study of the relationships between heat and mechanical energy
