The '''Coleoptera''' {{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|iː|ˈ|ɒ|p|t|ər|ə}} [[Taxonomic rank|order]] of [[insect]]s is commonly called '''beetles'''. The word "coleoptera" is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κολεός}}, ''koleos'', meaning "sheath"; and {{lang|grc|πτερόν}}, ''pteron'', meaning "wing", thus "sheathed wing", because most beetles have two pairs of wings, the front pair, the "[[Elytron|elytra]]", being hardened and thickened into a sheath-like, or shell-like, protection for the rear pair, and for the rear part of the beetle's body. The superficial consistency of most beetles' [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], in particular their possession of elytra, has long suggested that the Coleoptera are [[Monophyly|monophyletic]], but growing evidence indicates this is unjustified, there being arguments, for example, in favour of allocating the current [[Taxonomic rank|suborder]] [[Adephaga]] their own order, or very likely even more than one.<ref name=whiting>{{cite journal|author=Whiting, Michael F. |year=2002|title=Phylogeny of the holometabolous insect orders: molecular evidence|journal=[[Zoologica Scripta]]|volume=31|issue=1|pages=3–15|doi=10.1046/j.0300-3256.2001.00093.x}}</ref>

The Coleoptera include more [[species]] than any other order, constituting almost 25% of all known types of animal life-forms.<ref name=insenc>[[#refPowell|Powell (2009)]]</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Species Diversity in Space and Time|author=Rosenzweig, Michael L. |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521499521|year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hunt, T. et al. |title=A Comprehensive Phylogeny of Beetles Reveals the Evolutionary Origins of a Superradiation |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5858 |pages=1913–1916 |year=2007 |pmid=18096805 |doi=10.1126/science.1146954 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1913H }}</ref> About 40% of all described insect species are beetles (about 400,000 species<ref>Hammond, P.

The diversity of beetles is very wide. They are found in all major habitats, except marine and the [[polar region]]s. They have many classes of [[ecosystem|ecological]] effects; particular species are adapted to practically every kind of diet. Some are nonspecialist detritus feeders, breaking down animal and plant debris; [[Dermestidae|some]] feed on particular kinds of [[carrion]] such as flesh or  hide; some feed on wastes such as [[Scarabaeinae|dung]]; some feed on [[fungus|fungi]], some on particular species of plants, others on a wide range of plants. Some are generalist pollen, [[Flower chafer|flower and fruit eaters]].  [[Carabidae|Some]] are predatory, usually on other [[invertebrate]]s; some are [[parasites]] or [[parasitoids]]. Many of the predatory species are important controls of agricultural pests. For example, beetles in the family [[Coccinellidae]] ("ladybirds" or "ladybugs") consume [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[thrips]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.

Conversely, beetles are prey of various invertebrates and vertebrates, including insects, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The Coleoptera are not generally serious pests, but they include agricultural and industrial pests, such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]] ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'', the [[boll weevil]] ''Anthonomus grandis'', the [[red flour beetle]] ''Tribolium castaneum'', and the mungbean or cowpea beetle ''[[Callosobruchus maculatus]]''. Also included is the [[death-watch beetle]], the larvae of which can cause serious structural damage to buildings by boring into the timbers.

Species in the Coleoptera have a hard [[exoskeleton]], particularly on their forewings ([[elytron|elytra]], singular elytron). These elytra distinguish beetles from most other insect species, except for the [[Dermaptera]]. The [[elytron|hemelytra]] of [[Heteroptera]] have a slight resemblance, but are not the same and their function is largely different.

Like all armoured insects, beetles' exoskeletons comprise numerous plates called [[sclerite]]s, some fused, and some separated by thin sutures. This combines armored defenses with maintaining flexibility. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is superficially uniform, but specific organs and [[appendage]]s may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order, and even more so between the suborders (such as [[Adephaga]]) that currently seem increasingly to be separate orders in their own right. All insects' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, and the  Coleoptera are no exception. Their internal morphology and physiology also resemble those of other insects.

Beetles are [[Endopterygota|endopterygotes]]; they undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], a [[biological process]] by which an animal physically [[developmental biology|develops]] after a birth or hatching, undergoing a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in its [[Human body|body]] structure. Males may fight for females in various ways, and such species tend to display marked [[sexual dimorphism]].

==Distribution and diversity==
Beetles are by far the largest order of insects, with 350,000–400,000 species in four suborders ([[Adephaga]], [[Archostemata]], [[Myxophaga]], and [[Polyphaga]]), making up about 40% of all insect species described, and about 30% of all animals. Though classification at the family level is a bit unstable, about 500  families and subfamilies are recognized.<ref name=insenc/><ref name="Gilliott">{{cite book|last=Gilliott|first=Cedric|title=Entomology|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|date=August 1995|edition=2|isbn=0-306-44967-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DrTKxvZq_IcC&pg=PA96|page=96}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|21594053}}</ref> One of the first proposed estimates of the total number of beetle species on the planet is based on field data rather than on catalog numbers. The technique used for this original estimate, possibly as many as 12 million species, was criticized, and was later revised, with estimates of 850,000–4,000,000 species proposed. Some 70–95% of all beetle species, depending on the estimate, remain undescribed. The beetle fauna is not equally well known in all parts of the world. For example, the known beetle diversity of Australia is estimated at 23,000 species in 3265 genera and 121 families. This is slightly lower than reported for North America, a land mass of similar size with 25,160 species in 3526 genera and 129 families. While other predictions show there could be as many as 28,000 species in North America, including those currently undescribed, a realistic estimate of the little-studied Australian beetle fauna's true diversity could vary from 80,000 to 100,000.<ref name="Foottit 09">{{cite book|title=Insect biodiversity: science and society|author=Foottit, Robert G.|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=1-4051-5142-0|coauthor=Adler, Peter Holdridge |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LBZHpYY2_8gC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>

Coleoptera are found in nearly all natural habitats, including freshwater and marine habitats, everywhere  vegetative foliage is found, from trees and their bark to flowers, leaves, and underground near roots- even inside plants in galls, in every plant tissue, including dead or decaying ones.<ref name="Gullan">{{cite book|last=Gullan|first=P.J.|coauthors=Cranston, P.S. |title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S7yGZasJ7nEC&printsec=frontcover|publisher=Wiley, John & Sons, Incorporated|location=Oxford|date=March 22, 2010|edition=4|isbn=1-4443-3036-5}}</ref>

==External morphology==
[[File:Fiddler beetle morphology diagram.svg|300px|thumb|right|The morphology of a beetle, with a [[fiddler beetle]] as an example species]]Beetles are generally characterized by a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] and hard forewings ([[elytron|elytra]]). The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates, called [[sclerite]]s, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and [[appendage]]s may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.<ref name=insenc/>


===Head===
{{multiple image

| footer = Head morphology
| image1 = Scarabaeus viettei head.jpg
| alt1 =
| caption1 = ''Scarabaeus viettei'' (syn. ''Madateuchus viettei'', Scarabaeidae) showing a "shovel head" adaptation
| image2 =  Cephalota circumdata circumdata front.jpg
| alt2 =
| caption2 =  Head of ''[[Cephalota circumdata]]'', showing the [[compound eye]]s and [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]]
}}
The head, having mouthparts projecting forward or sometimes downturned, is usually heavily [[Sclerotin|sclerotized]] and varies in size.<ref name="Gilliott"/> The eyes are [[compound eye|compound]] and may display remarkable adaptability, as in the case of [[whirligig beetle]]s (family Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Other species also have divided eyes – some [[longhorn beetle]]s (family Cerambycidae) and weevils – while many have eyes that are notched to some degree. A few beetle genera also possess [[ocellus|ocelli]], which are small, simple eyes usually situated farther back on the head (on the [[Vertex (anatomy)|vertex]]).

Beetles' [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are primarily organs of smell, but may also be used to feel a beetle's environment physically. They may also be used in some families during mating, or among a few beetles for defence. Antennae vary greatly in form within the Coleoptera, but are often similar within any given family. In some cases, males and females of the same species will have different antennal forms. Antennae may be [[Wiktionary:clavate|clavate]] ([[Wiktionary:flabellate|flabellate]] and [[Wiktionary:lamellate|lamellate]] are subforms of clavate, or clubbed antennae), [[Wiktionary:filiform|filiform]], [[Wiktionary:geniculate|geniculate]], [[Wiktionary:moniliform|moniliform]], [[Wiktionary:pectinate|pectinate]], or [[Wiktionary:serrate|serrate]].

Beetles have [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] similar to those of [[grasshopper]]s. Of these parts, the most commonly known are probably the [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]], which appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see [[#Defence|defence]], below). Two pairs of finger-like [[appendage]]s, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with the males' enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.<ref name="Gilliott"/>

===Thorax===
The thorax is [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] into the two discernible parts, the pro- and pterathorax. The pterathorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separate in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax.<ref name=insenc/> When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle "section" is a hard plate called the [[pronotum]], which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's [[insect wing|wings]]. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.

[[File:Acilius sulcatus.gemeiner furchenschwimmer.jpg|thumb|''[[Acilius sulcatus]]'', a diving beetle showing hind legs adapted for life in water]]

===Extremities===
The multisegmented [[arthropod leg|legs]] end in two to five small segments called tarsi. Like many other insect orders, beetles bear claws, usually one pair, on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs may be variously modified and adapted for other uses. Among aquatic families – [[Dytiscidae]], [[Haliplidae]], many species of [[Hydrophilidae]] and others – the legs, most notably the last pair, are modified for swimming and often bear rows of long hairs to aid this purpose. Other beetles have [[fossorial]] legs that are widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and [[clown beetle]]s (family [[Histeridae]]). The hind legs of some beetles, such as [[flea beetle]]s (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), are enlarged and designed for jumping.

===Wings===
The elytra are connected to the pterathorax, so named because it is where the wings are connected (''pteron'' meaning "wing" in Greek).<ref name=insenc/> The elytra are not used for [[insect flight|flight]], but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of [[insect wing|wings]] (''alae''). They must be raised to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (''jugum'') of the membrane at the base of each wing  is a characteristic feature.<ref name="Carpenter">{{cite book |title=Insects, their structure and life |first=George Herbert |last=Carpenter |year=1899}}</ref> In some beetles, the ability to fly has been lost. These include some [[ground beetle]]s (family Carabidae) and some "true weevils" (family [[Curculionidae]]), but also desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, with the best known example being the [[glowworm|glow-worms]] of the family [[Phengodidae]], in which the females are [[Larviform female|larviform]] throughout their lives.

===Abdomen===
The [[abdomen]] is the section behind the metathorax, made up of a series of rings, each with a hole for breathing and respiration, called a spiracle, composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less scelortized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, [[Mordellidae]]) have articulating sternal lobes.<ref name="american">{{cite book|author=Ivie, Michael A. |title=American Beetles: Polyphaga: Scarabaeoidea through Curculionoidea|volume=2|series=[[American Beetles]]|editor=Ross H. Arnett & Michael Charles Thomas|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8493-0954-0}}</ref>

==Internal morphology==
[[File:Internal morphology of Coleoptera.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|A diagram showing the general internal anatomy of beetles]]

===Digestive system===
The [[digestive system]] of beetles is primarily based on plants, upon which they, for the most part, feed, with mostly the anterior [[midgut]] performing digestion, although in predatory species (for example [[Carabidae]]), most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In [[Elateridae]] species, the predatory larvae defecate enzymes on their prey, with digestion being extraorally.<ref name=insenc/> The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow [[pharynx]], a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed [[gizzard]]. After is the midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of [[cecum]], with a hindgut, with varying lengths. Typically, four to six [[Malpighian tubule]]s occur.<ref name="Gilliott"/>

===Nervous system===
The [[nervous system]] in beetles contains all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and seven or eight abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that in which all the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.<ref name=insenc/>

===Respiratory system===
Like most insects, beetles inhale [[oxygen]] and exhale [[carbon dioxide]] via a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]]. Air enters the body through [[Spiracle#Arthropods|spiracle]]s, and circulates within the haemocoel in a system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]] and tracheoles, through the walls of which the relevant gases can diffuse appropriately.<ref name=insenc/>

Diving beetles, such as the [[Dytiscidae]], carry a bubble of air with them when they dive.<ref name=insenc/> Such a bubble may be contained under the elytra or against the body by specialized [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] hairs. The bubble covers at least some of the spiracles, thereby permitting the oxygen to enter the tracheae.

The function of the bubble is not so much as to contain a store of air, to act as a [[Gill#Physical gills|physical gill]]. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmidt-Nielsen|first=Knut|title=Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Af7IwQWJoCMC&pg=PA55|edition=5th|date=January 15, 1997|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-57098-0|page=55|chapter=Insect Respiration}}</ref>

===Circulatory system===
Like other insects, beetles have [[open circulatory system]]s, based on [[hemolymph]] rather than blood.  Also as in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart is attached to the dorsal wall of the [[circulatory system#Nonhuman|hemocoel]]. It has paired inlets or ''ostia'' at intervals down its length, and circulates the hemolymph from the main cavity of the haemocoel and out through the anterior cavity in the head.

===Specialized organs===
Different glands specialize for different pheromones produced for finding mates. Pheromones from species of [[Rutelinea]] are produced from [[epithelium|epithelial cell]]s lining the inner surface of the apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of [[Melolonthinae]] are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. [[Dermestidae|Dermestid]]s produce [[ester]]s, and species of [[Elateridae]] produce [[aldehyde|fatty acid-derived aldehyde]]s and [[acetate]]s.<ref name=insenc/> For means of finding a mate also, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to biosynthetically produce light, or [[bioluminescence]]. The light produce is highly efficient, as it is produced by oxidation of [[Firefly luciferin|luciferin]] by enzymes ([[luciferase]]s) in the presence of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and oxygen, producing [[oxyluciferin]], carbon dioxide, and light.<ref name=insenc/>

A notable number of species have developed special glands to produce chemicals for deterring predators (see [[Beetle#Defense and predation|Defense and predation]]). The [[ground beetle]]'s (of Carabidae) defensive glands, located at the posterior, produce a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[phenol]]s, [[quinone]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s released from an opening at the end of the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, ''[[Anthia]]'' and ''[[Thermophilum]]'' – Thermophilum generally included within ''[[Anthia]]'') employ the same chemicals as ants: [[formic acid]].<ref name="Evans">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]]</ref> [[Bombardier beetle]]s have well-developed, like other carabid beetles, pygidial glands that empty from the lateral edges of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers. The first holds [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], with the second holding just hydrogen peroxide plus [[catalase]]s. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, forming temperatures of around {{convert|100|C|F}}, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + quinone, with the O<sub>2</sub> propelling the excretion.<ref name=insenc/>

[[Tympanal organ]]s or hearing organs, which is a membrane (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are described in two families.<ref name="Scoble">{{cite book |last1=Scoble|first1=MJ |title=The Lepidoptera: Form, function, and diversity. |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1}}</ref> Several species of the genus ''[[Cicindela]]'' (Cicindelidae) have ears on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the subfamily [[Dynastinae]] ([[Scarabaeidae]]) have ears just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. The ears of both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation. Though beetles constitute a large order and live in a variety of [[Ecological niche|niche]]s, examples of hearing are surprisingly lacking amongst species, though likely most simply remain undiscovered.<ref name=insenc/>

==Reproduction and development==
Beetles are members of the [[Order (biology)|superorder]] [[Endopterygota]], and accordingly most of them undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], the [[larva]], the [[pupa]], and the [[imago]] or adult. The larvae are commonly called [[Larva|grubs]] and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final [[instar]]. Going beyond "complete metamorphosis", however, some beetles, such as typical members of the families [[Meloidae]] and [[Rhipiphoridae]], undergo [[hypermetamorphosis]] in which the first instar takes the form of a [[triungulin]].

===Mating===
[[File:Punctate Flower Chafer.jpg|thumb|[[Punctate flower chafer]]s (''Neorrhina punctata'', Scarabaeidae) mating]]
Beetles may display extremely intricate behavior when mating. Pheromone communication is likely to be important in the location of a mate.

Different species use different chemicals for their pheromones. Some scarab beetles (for example, [[Rutelinae]]) utilize pheromones derived from [[fatty acid synthesis]], while other scarab beetles use [[amino acid]]s and terpenoid compounds (for example, [[Melolonthinae]]). Another way species of Coleoptera find mates is the use of biosynthesized light, or [[bioluminescence]]. This special form of a mating call is confined to [[Firefly|fireflies]] (Lampyridae) by the use of abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in complex dialogue before mating, identifying different species by differences in duration, flight patterns, composition, and intensity.<ref name=insenc/>

Before mating, males and females may engage in various forms of behavior. They may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In some species (for example, Meloidae), the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his antennae on her head, palps, and antennae. In the genus ''Eupompha'' of said family, the male draws the antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all if they do not perform the precopulatory ritual.<ref name=insenc/>

Conflict can play a part in the mating rituals of species such as [[burying beetle]]s (genus ''Nicrophorus''), where conflicts between males and females rage until only one of each is left, thus ensuring reproduction by the strongest and fittest. Many male beetles are territorial and will fiercely defend their small patches of territory from intruding males. In such species, the males may often have horns on their heads and/or thoraces, making their overall body lengths greater than those of the females, unlike most insects. Pairing is generally quick, but in some cases will last for several hours. During pairing, [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]]s are transferred to the female to [[fertilization|fertilize]] the egg.<ref name="Gilliott"/>

===Lifecycle===
[[File:Life cycle of stag beetle.svg|thumb|300px|left|The lifecycle of the [[stag beetle]] includes three [[instar]]s.]]

====Egg====
A single female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime. Eggs are usually laid according to the substrate on which the [[larva]]e will feed upon hatching. Among others, they can be laid loose in the substrate (for example, flour beetle), laid in clumps on leaves (for example, [[Colorado potato beetle]]), individually attached (for example, mungbean beetle and other seed borers), or buried in the medium (for example, carrot weevil).

Parental care varies between species, ranging from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf to certain [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], which construct underground structures complete with a supply of dung to house and feed their young.<ref name=insenc/> Other beetles are [[Attelabidae|leaf roller]]s, biting sections of leaves to cause them to curl inwards, then laying their eggs, thus protected, inside.<ref name=insenc/>

====Larva====
[[File:Curl grub.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Scarabaeoidea|scarabaeiform]] larva known as a curl grub]]
The [[larva]] is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle [[Biological life cycle|lifecycle]]. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most [[Buprestidae]] and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae are highly varied amongst species, with well-developed and sclerotized heads, and have distinguishable thoracic and abdominal segments (usually the tenth, though sometimes the eighth or ninth).<ref name="Gilliott"/>

Beetle larvae can be differentiated from other insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, the presence of chewing mouthparts, and [[spiracle]]s along the sides of their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles whose larvae are somewhat flattened and are highly mobile are the ground beetles, some rove beetles, and others; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the [[click beetle]] (Elateridae) and [[darkling beetle]] (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the families of the [[Scarabaeoidea]] have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, but more commonly known as grubs.

All beetle larvae go through several [[instar]]s, which are the developmental stages between each [[ecdysis|moult]]. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the [[planidium]]) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as [[hypermetamorphosis]]; examples include the [[blister beetle]]s (family Meloidae) and some rove beetles, particularly those of the genus ''[[Aleochara]]''.

====Pupa====
As with all endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these [[pupa]]e emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or [[imago]]s. Adults have extremely variable lifespans, from weeks to years, depending on the species. In some species, the pupa may go through all four forms during its development, called hypermetamorphosis (for example, [[Meloidae]]). Pupae always have no mandibles (are adecticous). In most, the appendages are not attached to the pupae, or they are exarate; with most being obtect in form.<ref name="Gilliott"/>

==Behavior==

===Locomotion===
[[File:Photinus pyralis Firefly 2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Photinus pyralis]]'', firefly, in flight]]
Aquatic beetles use several techniques for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Beetles of the family Dytiscidae hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain a layer of air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind [[Arthropod leg|coxa]]e (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention,<ref>{{Cite book|year=2001|chapter=Haliplidae|pages=138–143|author=Arnett, R. H., Jr. and Thomas, M. C. |title=[[American Beetles]], Volume 1|publisher=[[CRC Press]], [[Boca Raton, Florida]]|isbn=0-8493-1925-0}}</ref> while [[whirligig beetle]]s simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.

The elytra allow beetles and weevils to both fly and move through confined spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before take off. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles attached to the wing base; as long as the tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In day-flying species (for example, [[Buprestidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]]), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins.<ref name=insenc/>

===Communication===
Beetles have a variety of ways to communicate, some of which include a sophisticated chemical language through the use of [[pheromone]]s. From the host tree, [[mountain pine beetle]]s have many forms of communication. They can emit both an aggregative pheromone and an anti-aggregative pheromone. The aggregative pheromone attracts other beetles to the tree, and the anti-aggregative pheromone neutralizes the aggregative pheromone. This helps to avoid the harmful effects of having too many beetles on one tree competing for resources. The mountain pine beetle can also [[stridulate]] to communicate, or rub body parts together to create sound, having a "scraper" on their abdomens that they rub against a grooved surface on the underside of their left wing cover to create a sound that is not audible to humans. Once the female beetles have arrived on a suitable pine tree host, they begin to stridulate and produce aggregative pheromones to attract other unmated males and females. New females arrive and do the same as they land and bore into the tree. As the males arrive, they enter the galleries that the females have tunneled, and begin to stridulate to let the females know they have arrived, and to also warn others that the female in that gallery is taken. At this point, the female stops producing aggregative pheromones and starts producing anti-aggregative pheromone to deter more beetles from coming.<ref name="Beetle love">{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/v-g/dpp-mpb/sec2/dpp-mpb2b.aspx|title=Mountain Pine Beetle – Beetle Love|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

Since species of Coleoptera use environmental stimuli to communicate, they are affected by the climate. [[Microclimate]]s, such as wind or temperature, can disturb the use of pheromones; wind would blow the pheromones while they travel through the air. Stridulating can be interrupted when the stimulus is vibrated by something else.<ref name="Beetle love"/>

===Parental care===
[[File:Scarabaeus laticollis.jpg|upright|thumb|right|A dung beetle rolling dung]]
Among insects, parental care is very uncommon, only found in a few species. Some beetles also display this unique social behavior.<ref name=insenc/> One theory states parental care is necessary for the survival of the larvae, protecting them from adverse environmental conditions and predators. One species, a rover beetle (''[[Bledius spectabilis]]'') displays both causes for parental care: physical and biotic environmental factors. Said species lives in [[salt marsh]]es, so the eggs and/or larvae are endangered by the rising [[tide]]. The maternal beetle will patrol the eggs and larvae and apply the appropriate burrowing behavior to keep them from flooding and from [[asphyxiation|asphyxiating]]. Another advantage is that the mother protects the eggs and larvae from the predatory carabid beetle ''[[Dicheirotrichus gustavi]]'' and from the [[parasitism|parasitoid]] wasp ''[[Barycnemis blediator]]''. Up to 15% of larvae are killed by this parasitoid wasp, being only protected by maternal beetles in their dens.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wyatt, T. D. and Foster, W. A.|year=1989|title=Parental care in the subsocial intertidal beetle, ''Bledius spectabilis'', in relation to parasitism by the ichneumonid wasp, ''Barycnemis blediator''|journal=[[Behaviour (journal)|Behaviour]]|volume=110|issue=1–4|pages=76–92|jstor=4534785|doi=10.1163/156853989X00394}}</ref>

Some species of [[dung beetle]] also display a form of parental care. Dung beetles collect animal feces, or "dung", from which their name is derived, and roll it into a ball, sometimes being up to 50 times their own weight; albeit sometimes it is also used to store food. Usually it is the male that rolls the ball, with the female hitch-hiking or simply following behind. In some cases the male and the female roll together. When a spot with soft soil is found, they stop and bury the dung ball. They will then [[mating|mate]] underground. After the mating, one or both of them will prepare the brooding ball. When the ball is finished, the female lays eggs inside it, a form of [[mass provisioning]]. Some species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hanski|first1=Ilkka|last2=Yves|first2=Cambefort| title=Dung Beetle Ecology|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1991|pages=626–672|isbn=0-691-08739-3}}</ref>

===Feeding===
Besides being abundant and varied, beetles are able to exploit the wide diversity of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. [[Ground beetle]]s and [[rove beetle]]s (family Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and will catch and consume many other [[arthropod]]s and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/eng/biol3.htm|title=feeding|author=Lobanov, A.L. |year=2002|work=Beetle Biology And Ecology|publisher=Beetles (Coleoptera) and Coleopterologist|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

Decaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species. This can range from [[Feces|dung]], which is consumed by [[coprophagous]] species (such as certain [[dung beetle|scarab beetle]]s of the family Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by [[necrophagous]] species (such as the [[carrion beetle]]s of the family Silphidae). Some of the beetles found within [[Feces|dung]] and carrion are in fact predatory. These include the [[clown beetle]]s, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects.

==Ecology==

===Defense and predation===
[[File:Pegesimallus sp robberfly.jpg|thumb|Beetles may be preyed upon by other insects such as [[Asilidae|robber flies]]]]

Beetles and their larvae have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or [[parasitoid]]s. These include [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]], toxicity, and active defense. [[Camouflage]] involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the [[leaf beetle]]s (family Chrysomelidae) or [[weevil]]s. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate.<ref name="Evans126">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]], p. 126</ref> The giant African longhorn beetle (''Petrognatha gigas'') resembles the moss and bark of the tree it feeds on. Another defense that often uses color or shape to deceive potential enemies is [[mimicry]]. A number of [[longhorn beetle]]s (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to [[wasp]]s, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. This defense is an example of [[Mimicry|Batesian mimicry]] and, together with other forms of mimicry and [[camouflage]] occurs widely in other beetle families, such as the [[Scarabaeidae]]. Beetles may combine their color mimicry with behavioral mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many beetle species, including [[Coccinellidae|ladybirds]], [[blister beetle]]s, and [[Lycidae|lycid beetles]] can secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or even poisonous. These same species often exhibit [[aposematism]], where bright or contrasting color patterns warn away potential predators, and there are, not surprisingly, a great many beetles and other insects that [[mimicry|mimic]] these chemically protected species.<ref name="Evans"/>

[[File:Gemeiner Widderbock 4483.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Clytus arietis]]'' ([[Longhorn beetle|Cerambycidae]]), a wasp mimic]]
Chemical defense is another important defense found amongst species of Coleoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors. Others may utilize behaviors that would be done when releasing noxious chemicals (for example, [[Tenebrionidae]]). Chemical defense may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection from a wide range of microbes, and repellents. Some species release chemicals in the form of a spray with surprising accuracy, such as [[ground beetle]]s (Carabidae), may spray chemicals from their abdomen to repel predators. Some species take advantage of the plants from which they feed, and sequester the chemicals from the plant that would protect it and incorporate into their own defense. African carabid beetles (for example, ''Anthia'' and ''Thermophilum'') employ the same chemicals used by ants, while [[Bombardier beetle]]s have a their own unique separate gland, spraying potential predators from far distances.<ref name="Evans126"/>

Large [[ground beetle]]s and longhorn beetles may defend themselves using strong [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]] and/or spines or horns to forcibly persuade a predator to seek out easier prey.<ref name="Evans126"/> Many species have large protrusions from their thorax and head such as the [[Rhinoceros beetle]], which can be used to defended themselves from predators. Many species of weevil that feed out in the open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a "drop-off reflex". Even further, some will combine it with [[thanatosis]], which they will close up their legs, antennae, mandibles, etc. and use their cryptic coloration to blend in with the background. Species with varied coloration do not do this as they can not camaflouge.<ref name="insenc199">[[#refPowell|Powell (2009)]], p. 199</ref>

===Parasitism===
Over 1000 species of beetles are known to be either parasitic, predatory, or commensals in the nests of ants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/compendium/coleop~1.html|title=Coleoptera|author=Meyer, John R.|date=March 8, 2005|publisher=Department of Entomology, NC State University|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref> Technically, many species of beetles and their larvae could be considered to be ectoparasites, because they feed on plants and some live inside the bark or wood of trees, but such relationships are generally regarded as herbivory (plant eating) rather than parasitism.

A few species of beetles are actually ectoparasitic on mammals. One such species, ''[[Platypsyllus castoris]]'', parasitises beavers ([[Beaver|''Castor'']] spp.). This beetle lives as a parasite both as a larva and as an adult, feeding on epidermal tissue and possibly on skin secretions and wound exudates. They are strikingly flattened dorsoventrally, no doubt as an adaptation for slipping between the beavers' hairs. They also are wingless and eyeless, as are many other ectoparasites.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stewart B. Peck|year=2006|title=Distribution and biology of the ectoparasitic beaver beetle ''Platypsyllus castoris'' Ritsema in North America (Coleoptera: Leiodidae: Platypsyllinae)|journal=[[Insecta Mundi]]|volume=20|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1107&context=insectamundi|issue=1–2|pages=85–94}}</ref>

Other parasitic beetles include those that are kleptoparasites of other invertebrates, such as the [[small hive beetle]] (''Aethina tumida'') that infests [[honey bee]] hives. The larvae tunnel through comb towards stored honey or pollen, damaging or destroying cappings and comb in the process. Larvae defecate in honey and the honey becomes discolored from the feces, which causes fermentation and a frothiness in the honey; the honey develops a characteristic odor of decaying oranges. Damage and fermentation cause honey to run out of combs, destroying large amounts of it both in hives and sometimes also in honey extracting rooms. Heavy infestations cause bees to abscond; though the beetle is only a minor pest in Africa, beekeepers in other regions have reported the rapid collapse of even strong colonies.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/apido:2004010|author=Neumann, P. and Elzen, P.

===Pollination===
Beetle-pollinated flowers are usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to decaying organic material. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators.<ref name="Gullan"/> Beetles may be particularly important in some parts of the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and [[southern California]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jones, G.

===Mutualism===
[[File:Ambrosia beetle life cycle.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|
1: The adult beetle burrows hole into wood and lays eggs, carrying fungal spores in its [[mycangia]].<br>
2: The larva feeds on the fungus, which digest the wood, removing toxins: they mutually benefit.<br>
3: The larva pupates and then [[Pupa#Emergence|eclose]]s.]]

Amongst most orders of insects, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] is not common, but some examples occur in species of Coleoptera, such as the [[ambrosia beetle]], the [[Ambrosia fungi|ambrosia fungus]], and probably bacteria. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal [[symbiont]]. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome its host tree defenses and to provide nutrition for their larvae.<ref name="Malloch">Malloch, D. and Blackwell, M.

A large number of important fossil sites worldwide contain beetles from the Cretaceous. Most are located in Europe and Asia and belong to the temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous. A few of the fossil sites mentioned in the chapter Jurassic also shed some light on the early Cretaceous beetle fauna (for example, the Yixian formation in Liaoning, North China).<ref name="liaoning"/> Further important sites from the Lower Cretaceous include the Crato fossil beds in the Araripe basin in the [[Ceará]], North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation, with the latter was situated near the paleoequator, or the position of the earth's equator in the geologic past as defined for a specific geologic period. In Spain, important sites are located near [[Serra del Montsec|Montsec]] and [[Las Hoyas]]. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, [[South Gippsland]], Victoria, are noteworthy. Important fossil sites from the Upper Cretaceous include [[Kzyl-Dzhar]] in South [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Arkagala]] in Russia.<ref name="evo"/>

[[File:Phylogenetic chart of Coleoptera.svg|upright|thumb|left|The phylogenetic growth of three different trophic levels in Coleoptera by number of genera]]

===Evolution===
The oldest known insect that resembles species of Coleoptera date back to the [[Permian|Lower Permian]] (270 mya), though they instead have 13-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e, [[elytra]] with more fully developed venation and more irregular longitudinal ribbing, and an abdomen and [[ovipositor]] extending beyond the apex of the elytra. <!--incomplete sentence,not sure how to fixThe oldest true beetle, that is having features that include 11-segmented antennae, regular longitudinal ribbing on the elytra, and having [[genitalia]] that are internal.<ref name="insenc186">[[#refPowell|Powell (2009)]], p. 186</ref>--> At the end of the Permian, the biggest mass extinction in history took place, collectively called the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] (P-Tr): 30% of all insect species became extinct; however, it is the only mass extinction of insects in Earth's history until today.<ref name="evo"/>

Due to the P-Tr extinction, the fossil record of insects only includes beetles from the [[Triassic|Lower Triassic]] ({{Ma|220}}). Around this time, during the Late Triassic, [[mycetophagous]], or fungus-feeding species (e.g. [[Cupedidae]]) appear in the fossil record. In the stages of the Upper Triassic, representatives of the [[algophagous]], or algae-feeding species (e.g. [[Triaplidae]] and [[Hydrophilidae]]) begin to appear, as well as predatory water beetles. The first primitive weevils appear (e.g. [[Obrienidae]]), as well as the first representatives of the rove beetles (e.g. [[Staphylinidae]]), which show no marked difference in morphology compared to recent species.<ref name="evo"/>

During the Jurassic ({{Ma|210|145}}), a dramatic increase in the known diversity of family-level Coleoptera occurred,<ref name="evo"/> including the development and growth of carnivorous and herbivorous species. Species of the superfamily [[Chrysomeloidea]] are believed to have developed around the same time, which include a wide array of plant hosts ranging from [[cycad]]s and [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s, to [[Flowering plants|angiosperm]]s.<ref name="insenc186">[[#refPowell|Powell (2009)]], p. 186</ref> Close to the Upper Jurassic, the portion of the [[Cupedidae]] decreased, but at the same time the diversity of the early plant-eating, or phytophagous species increased. Most of the recent phytophagous species of Coleoptera feed on flowering plants or angiosperms. The increase in diversity of the angiosperms is also believed to have influenced the diversity of the phytophagous species, which doubled during the Middle Jurassic.

The [[Cretaceous]] included the initiation of the most recent round of southern landmass fragmentation, via the opening of the southern Atlantic ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant.<ref name="insenc186"/> During the Cretaceous, the diversity of Cupedidae and [[Archostemata]] decreased considerably.

Between the [[Paleogene]] and the [[Neogene]] is when today's beetles developed. During this time, the continents began to be located closer to where they are today. Around {{Ma|5}}, the land bridge between South America and North America was formed, and the fauna exchange between Asia and North America started. Though many recent genera and species already existed during the [[Miocene]], their distribution differed considerably from today's.<ref name="evo"/>

===Phylogeny===
The suborders diverged in the Permian and [[Triassic]]. Their [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] relationship is uncertain, with the most popular hypothesis being that [[Polyphaga]] and [[Myxophaga]] are most closely related, with [[Adephaga]] as the [[sister group]] to those two, and [[Archostemata]] as sister to the other three collectively.<ref name="insenc186"/><ref name="Beutel">{{cite journal|title=Phylogenetic relationships of the suborders of Coleoptera (Insecta)|journal=[[Cladistics (journal)|Cladistics]]|first=R.|last=Beutel|coauthors=Haas, F. |volume=16|pages=103–141|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00350.x|year=2000}}</ref> Although six other competing hypotheses are noted, the other most widely discussed one has Myxophaga as the sister group of all remaining beetles rather than just of Polyphaga.<ref name="Kukalová">{{cite journal|title=Evolution of the hind wing in Coleoptera|journal=[[Canadian Entomologist]]|year=1993|last=Kukalová-Peck|first=J.|coauthors=Lawrence, J.

===Taxonomy===
About 450,000 species of beetles occur – representing about 40% of all known insects. Such a large number of species poses special problems for [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification]], with some families consisting of thousands of species and needing further division into subfamilies and tribes. This immense number of species allegedly led evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to quip, when some theologians asked him what could be inferred about the mind of the Creator from the works of His Creation, that God displayed "an inordinate fondness for beetles".<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson|Hutchinson, G.

* The [[Polyphaga]] are the largest suborder, containing more than 300,000 described species in more than 170 families, including [[rove beetle]]s (Staphylinidae), scarab beetles ([[Scarabaeidae]]), [[blister beetle]]s (Meloidae), [[stag beetle]]s (Lucanidae) and true weevils ([[Curculionidae]]). These beetles can be identified by the presence of cervical [[sclerite]]s (hardened parts of the head used as points of attachment for muscles) absent in the other suborders.
* The [[Adephaga]] contain about 10 families of largely predatory beetles, includes [[ground beetle]]s (Carabidae), [[Dytiscidae]] and [[whirligig beetle]]s (Gyrinidae). In these beetles, the [[testes]] are tubular and the first abdominal sternum (a plate of the [[exoskeleton]]) is divided by the hind [[Arthropod leg|coxae]] (the basal joints of the beetle's legs).
* The [[Archostemata]] contain four families of mainly wood-eating beetles, including [[reticulated beetle]]s (Cupedidae) and the [[telephone-pole beetle]].
* The [[Myxophaga]] contain about 100 described species in four families, mostly very small, including [[Hydroscaphidae]] and the genus ''[[Sphaerius]]''.

===Beetles as pests===
[[File:Cotton boll weevil.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cotton boll weevil]]]]
About three-fourths of beetle species are phytophagous in both the larval and adult stages, living in or on plants, wood, fungi, and a variety of stored products, including cereals, tobacco, and dried fruits. Because many of these plants are important for agriculture, forestry, and the household, beetles can be considered pests.<ref name="Gilliott"/> Some of these species cause significant damage, such as the [[boll weevil]], which feeds on cotton buds and flowers. The boll weevil crossed the [[Rio Grande]] near [[Brownsville, Texas]], to enter the United States from [[Mexico]] around 1892,<ref name="msstate"/> and had reached southeastern [[Alabama]] by 1915. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the US, traveling {{convert|40|to-|160|mi|-1}} per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. [[Mississippi State University]] has estimated, since the boll weevil entered the United States, it has cost cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.<ref name="msstate">{{cite web|url=http://www.bollweevil.ext.msstate.edu/webpage_history.htm|work=Economic impacts of the boll weevil|title=History of the Boll Weevil in the United States|author=Mississippi State University|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080512023346/http://www.bollweevil.ext.msstate.edu/webpage_history.htm|archivedate=May 12, 2008}}</ref> Many other species also have done extensive damage to plant populations, such as the [[bark beetle]] and [[elm leaf beetle]]. The bark beetle and elm leaf beetle, among other species, have been known to nest in [[elm]] trees. Bark beetles in particular carry [[Dutch elm disease]] as they move from infected breeding sites to feed on healthy elm trees. The spread of Dutch elm disease by the beetle has led to the devastation of elm trees in many parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], notably in Europe and North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cisr.ucr.edu/elm_leaf_beetle.html|title=Elm Leaf Beetle|publisher=University of California|date=May 11, 2011|accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Potato beetle larvae.jpg|thumb|Larvae of the [[Colorado potato beetle]], ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'']]
Situations in which a species has developed immunity to pesticides are worse, as in the case of the [[Colorado potato beetle]], ''Leptinotarsa decemlineata'', which is a notorious pest of potato plants. Crops are destroyed and the beetle can only be treated by employing expensive [[pesticide]]s, to many of which it has begun to develop [[pesticide resistance|resistance]]. Suitable hosts can include a number of plants from the potato family ([[Solanaceae]]), such as [[nightshade]], tomato, [[eggplant]] and [[capsicum]], as well as potatoes. The Colorado potato beetle has developed resistance to all major insecticide classes, although not every population is resistant to every chemical.<ref>{{cite journal|author=A. Alyokhin, M. Baker, D.

Pests do not only affect agriculture, but can also even affect houses, such as the [[death watch beetle]]. The death watch beetle, ''Xestobium rufovillosum'' (family [[Anobiidae]]), is of considerable importance as a pest of older wooden buildings in Great Britain. It attacks [[hardwood]]s such as [[oak]] and [[chestnut]], always where some fungal decay has taken or is taking place. The actual introduction of the pest into buildings is thought to take place at the time of construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/preservation/training/pests/watch.htm|title=Pests – Death watch beelte| publisher=University of Oxford|work=Conservation and collective care|year=2005|accessdate=July 17, 2011|author=Adcock, Edward| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110710144935/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/preservation/training/pests/watch.htm| archivedate= July 10, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Other pest include the coconut hispine beetle, ''[[Brontispa longissima]]'', which feeds on young [[leaves]] and damages [[seedlings]] and mature [[coconut]] [[Palm tree|palms]].

===Beetles as beneficial resources===
[[File:Lady-beetle-close-up.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Coccinella septempunctata]]'', a beneficial beetle]]
Beetles are not only pests, but can also be beneficial, usually by controlling the populations of pests. One of the best, and widely known, examples are the [[ladybug]]s or ladybirds (family [[Coccinellidae]]). Both the larvae and adults are found feeding on [[aphid]] colonies. Other ladybugs feed on [[scale insect]]s and [[mealybug]]s. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on  small [[caterpillar]]s, young [[plant bug]]s, or [[honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] and [[nectar]].<ref name="BBC news">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/3715120.stm|title='Deadly ladybird' sighted in UK|date=October 5, 2004|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> [[Ground beetle]]s (family Carabidae) are common [[predator]]s of many different insects and other arthropods, including fly eggs, caterpillars, wireworms, and others.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kromp, B. |year=1999|title=Carabid beetles in sustainable agriculture: a review on pest control efficacy, cultivation aspects and enhancement|journal=[[Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment]]|volume=74|issue=1–3|pages=187–228|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00037-7}}</ref>

[[Dung beetles]] (Scarabidae) have been successfully used to reduce the populations of pestilent flies and parasitic worms that breed in cattle dung. The beetles make the dung unavailable to breeding pests by quickly rolling and burying it in the soil, with the added effect of improving soil fertility, tilth, and nutrient cycling. The [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] (1965–1985), led by Dr. [[George Bornemissza]] of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization]], introduced species of dung beetle to Australia from South Africa and Europe, and effectively reduced the bush fly (''[[Musca vetustissima]]'') population by 90%.

Dung beetles play a remarkable role in agriculture. By burying and consuming dung, they improve nutrient recycling and soil structure.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Brown, Jacqueline; Scholtz, Clarke H.; Janeau, Jean-Louis; Grellier, Seraphine and Podwojewski, Pascal |year=2010|title=Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) can improve soil hydrological properties|journal=[[Applied Soil Ecology]]|volume=46|issue=1|pages=9–16|doi=10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.05.010}}</ref> They also protect livestock, such as cattle, by removing dung, which, if left, could provide habitat for [[pest (animal)|pests]] such as [[fly|flies]]. Therefore, many countries have [[Biological pest control|introduced]] the creatures for the benefit of [[animal husbandry]]. In [[developing countries]], the beetle is especially important as an adjunct for improving standards of hygiene. The [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] reports that dung beetles save the United States cattle industry an estimated US$380 million annually through burying above-ground livestock feces.<ref>{{cite journal|author=John E.

Some beetles help in a professional setting, doing things that people can not; those of the family [[Dermestidae]] are often used in [[taxidermy]] and preparation of scientific specimens to clean bones of remaining soft tissue. The beetle larvae are used to clean skulls because they do a thorough job of cleaning, and do not leave the tool marks that taxidermists' tools do. Another benefit is, with no traces of meat remaining and no emulsified fats in the bones, the trophy will not develop the unpleasant dead odor. Using the beetle larvae means that all cartilage is removed along with the flesh, leaving the bones spotless.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Huffman, Jane E. and Wallace, John R. |year=2012|title=Wildlife Forensics: Methods and Applications|volume=6|series=Developments in Forensic Science|edition=2nd|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=9781119954293|chapter=Forensic entomology and wildlife|author=Tomberlin, Jeffery K. and Sanford, Michelle R. |pages=81–107|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EstjD_GgFvQC&pg=PT123 }}</ref>

Many beetles were prominent in ancient cultures.<ref>Cambefort, Yves. [http://www.insects.org/ced1/beetles_rel_sym.html Beetles as religious symbols]. insects.org</ref> Of these, the most prominent might be the dung beetle in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Several species of dung beetle, most notably the species ''[[Scarabaeus sacer]]'' (often referred to as the ''sacred scarab''), enjoyed a sacred status among the ancient Egyptians.<ref name="egyptian">{{cite book|title=Beetles|publisher=Michelle Bison|author=Zabludoff, Marc|year=2008|location=Malaysia|pages=14–17|isbn=978-0-7614-2532-8}}</ref> Popular interpretation in modern academia theorizes the hieroglyphic image of the beetle represents a [[Egyptian language|triliteral phonetic]] that Egyptologists transliterate as ''xpr'' or ḫpr and translate as "to come into being", "to become", or "to transform". The derivative term ''xprw'' or ḫpr(w) is variously translated as "form", "transformation", "happening", "mode of being", or "what has come into being", depending on the context. It may have existential, fictional, or ontologic significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/bestiary/insects.htm|title=Ancient Egyptian bestiary: Insects |date = January 2002| accessdate=July 19, 2011|author=Dollinger, André}}</ref>

The scarab was linked to [[Khepri]] ("he who has come into being"), the god of the rising [[sun]]. The ancients believed the dung beetle was only male in gender, and reproduced by depositing [[semen]] into a dung ball. The supposed self-creation of the beetle resembles that of Khepri, who created himself out of nothing. Moreover, the dung ball rolled by a dung beetle resembles the sun. [[Plutarch]] wrote: {{Quotation|The race of beetles has no female, but all the males eject their sperm into a round pellet of material which they roll up by pushing it from the opposite side, just as the sun seems to turn the heavens in the direction opposite to its own course, which is from west to east.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/E.html#ref373 "Isis and Osiris"], ''Moralia'', in volume V of the [[Loeb Classical Library]] edition, 1936, now in the public domain. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.</ref>}}

The ancient Egyptians believed Khepri renewed the sun every day before rolling it above the horizon, then carried it through the other world after sunset, only to renew it, again, the next day. Some [[New Kingdom]] royal tombs exhibit a threefold image of the sun god, with the beetle as symbol of the morning sun. The astronomical ceiling in the tomb of [[Ramses VI]] portrays the nightly "death" and "rebirth" of the sun as being swallowed by [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky, and re-emerging from her womb as Khepri.<ref name="egyptian"/>

Excavations of ancient Egyptian sites have yielded images of the scarab in bone, [[ivory]], stone, [[Egyptian faience]], and precious metals, dating from the Sixth Dynasty and up to the period of Roman rule. They are generally small, bored to allow stringing on a necklace, and the base bears a brief inscription or [[cartouche]]. Some have been used as [[Impression seal|seal]]s. [[Pharaoh]]s sometimes commissioned the manufacture of larger images with lengthy inscriptions, such as the [[The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign|commemorative scarab]] of Queen [[Tiye]]. Massive sculptures of scarabs can be seen at [[Luxor Temple]], at the Serapeum in Alexandria (see [[Serapis]]) and elsewhere in Egypt.

The scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-about-egypt.com/egyptian-symbols.html|title=Egyptian Symbols|publisher=All-About-Egypt|year=2006|accessdate=July 19, 2011|author=Morales-Correa, Ben}}</ref> Scarabs, generally, though not always, were cut from green stone, and placed on the chest of the deceased. Perhaps the most famous example of such "heart scarabs" is the yellow-green [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] scarab found among the entombed provisions of [[Tutankhamen]]. It was carved from a large piece of [[Libyan desert glass]]. The purpose of the "heart scarab" was to ensure the heart would not bear witness against the deceased at judgement in the Afterlife. Other possibilities are suggested by the "transformation spells" of the ''Coffin Texts'', which affirm that the soul of the deceased may transform (''xpr'') into a human being, a god, or a bird and reappear in the world of the living.

In contrast to funerary contexts, some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for [[scaraboid seal|seal]]s of varying types. The best-known of these are the Judean [[LMLK seal]]s (eight of 21 designs contained scarab beetles), which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of [[Hezekiah]]. The scarab remains an item of popular interest due to modern fascination with the art and beliefs of ancient Egypt. Scarab beads in semiprecious stones or glazed ceramics can be purchased at most bead shops, while at Luxor Temple, a massive ancient scarab has been roped off to discourage visitors from rubbing the base of the statue "for luck".

===Beetles in modern cultures===
Beetles still play roles in modern culture. One example is in [[insect fighting]] for entertainment and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. Enthusiasts collect and raise various species of insects for fighting. Among beetles, the most popular are large species of [[stag beetle]]s, [[rhinoceros beetle]]s, [[Japanese rhinoceros beetle|''kabutomushi'']], and [[Goliathus|goliath beetles]].

The study of beetles is called coleopterology (from Coleoptera, see above, and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''), and its practitioners are [[list of coleopterists|coleopterists]]. Coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles. Among these is The Coleopterists Society, an [[international organization]] based in the United States. Such organizations may have both professionals and amateurs interested in beetles as members. Research in this field is often published in [[scientific journal|peer-reviewed journals]] specific to the field of coleopterology, though journals dealing with general entomology also publish many papers on various aspects of beetle biology. Some of the journals specific to beetle research are:
* ''[[The Coleopterist]]'' (United Kingdom beetle fauna)
* ''The Coleopterists Bulletin'' (published by The Coleopterists Society)
* ''[[Elytron (journal)|Elytron]]'' (published by the European Association of Coleopterology)
