'''Beechcraft Corporation''' is an American manufacturer of [[general aviation]] and [[military]] aircraft, ranging from light single-engined aircraft to twin-engined turboprop transports, and military trainers. A division of [[Raytheon]] from 1980, and later a brand of [[Hawker Beechcraft]] after 2006, Beechcraft has been an independent company since February 2013.<ref name="Niles19Feb13">{{Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebbiz/news/Beechcraft_Emerges_Bankruptcy_208191-1.html|title = Beechcraft Corporation Emerges From Bankruptcy |accessdate = 19 February 2013|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = 19 February 2013| work = AVweb}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:beech.bonanza.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|1978 [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Beech Bonanza F33C]]]]

Beech Aircraft Company was founded in [[Wichita, Kansas]], in 1932 by [[Walter Herschel Beech|Walter Beech]] and his wife [[Olive Ann Beech|Ann Mellor Beech]]. The company began operations in an idle [[Cessna]] factory. With designer Ted Wells, they developed the first aircraft under the Beechcraft name, the classic [[Beechcraft Staggerwing|Model 17 Staggerwing]], which first flew in November 1932. Over 750 Staggerwings were built, with 270 manufactured for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Beechcraft was not Beech's first company, as he had previously formed [[Travel Air]] in 1924 and the design numbers used at Beechcraft followed the sequence started at Travel Air, and were then continued at Curtiss-Wright, after Travel Air had been absorbed into the much larger company in 1929. Beech became President of the Curtiss-Wright's airplane division and VP of sales, but became dissatisfied with being so far removed from aircraft production and quit to form Beechcraft, using the original Travel Air facilities and employing many of the same people. Model numbers prior to 11/11000 were built under the Travel Air name, while Curtiss-Wright built the CW-12, 14, 15 and 16 as well as previous successful Travel Air models (mostly the model 4).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Beech_Aircraft_Corporation_ad_Model_17_"Staggerwing"_1937.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for Model 17 "Staggerwing" 1937]]In 1942 Beech won its first [[Army-Navy "E" Award]] production award and became one of the elite five percent of war contracting firms in the country to win five straight awards for production efficiency, mostly for the production of the [[Beechcraft Model 18]] which remains in widespread use worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Beechcraft ranked 69th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref> 

After the war, the Staggerwing was replaced by the revolutionary [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] with a distinctive [[V-tail]]. Perhaps the best known Beech aircraft, the single-engined Bonanza has been manufactured in various models since 1947.<ref name="PL"/> The Bonanza has had the longest production run of any airplane, past or present, in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amtonline.com/article/article.jsp?siteSection=1&id=3901 |title=Hawker Beechcraft Corporation Celebrates Beechcraft 75th Anniversary, American Management Technology |date=8 July 2008}}</ref> Other important Beech aircraft are the [[Beechcraft King Air|King Air]]/[[Beechcraft Super King Air|Super King Air]] line of twin-engined turboprops, in production since 1964,<ref name="PL">[http://www.hawkerbeechcraft.com/service_support/pubs/docs/nontechnical/serializationList.pdf Hawker Beechcraft production lists, 1945 â€“ present] retrieved 29 November 2008.</ref> the [[Beechcraft Baron|Baron]], a twin-engined variant of the Bonanza, and the Beechcraft Model 18, originally a business transport and commuter airliner from the late 1930s through the 1960s, which remains in active service as a cargo transport.

In 1950, Olive Ann Beech was installed as president and CEO of the company, after the sudden death of her husband from a heart attack on 29 November of that year. She continued as CEO until Beech was purchased by [[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] on 8 February 1980. Ted Wells had been replaced as Chief Engineer by Herbert Rawdon, who remained at the post until his retirement in the early 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1994, Raytheon merged Beechcraft with the Hawker product line it had acquired in 1993 from [[British Aerospace]], forming [[Raytheon Aircraft Company]]. In 2002, the Beechcraft brand was revived to again designate the Wichita-produced aircraft. In 2006, Raytheon sold Raytheon Aircraft to [[Hawker Beechcraft]]. Since its inception Beechcraft has resided in [[Wichita, Kansas]], also the home of chief competitor [[Cessna]], the birthplace of [[Learjet]] and of [[Stearman Aircraft|Stearman]], whose trainers were used in large numbers during WW2.

The entry into bankruptcy of [[Hawker Beechcraft]] on 3 May 2012 ended with its emergence on 16 February 2013 as a new entity, Beechcraft Corporation, with the Hawker Beechcraft name being retired. The new and much smaller company will produce the King Air line of aircraft as well as the T-6 and AT-6 military trainer/attack aircraft and the piston-powered single-engined Bonanza and twin-engined Baron aircraft. The jet line was discontinued, but the new company will continue to support the aircraft already produced with parts, plus engineering and airworthiness documentation.<ref name="Niles19Feb13" /><ref name="Pew03May12">{{Cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/hawker_beechcraft_bankruptcy_restructuring_wichita_court_debt_layoff_206639-1.html|title = Bankruptcy For Hawker Beechcraft |accessdate = 19 February 2013|last = Pew|first = Glenn|date = 3 May 2012| work = AVweb}}</ref>

By October 2013 the company, now financially turned around, was up for sale.<ref name="Niles17Oct13">{{cite news|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Beechcraft-For-Sale-Report220802-1.html|title = Title of Article|accessdate = 18 October 2013|last = Niles|first = Russ|date = 17 October 2013| work = AVweb}}</ref>
