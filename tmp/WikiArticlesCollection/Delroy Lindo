'''Delroy George Lindo''' (born November 18, 1952) is an [[England|English]] actor, [[theatre director]]. Lindo has been nominated for the [[Tony Award|Tony]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/awardperson.asp?id=79450 IBDB Person Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Screen Actors Guild Award|Screen Actors Guild]] awards and has won a [[Satellite Award]]. He is perhaps best known for his roles as West Indian Archie in Spike Lee's ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm X]]'', Catlett in ''[[Get Shorty]]'', Arthur Rose in ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', Detective Castlebeck in ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' and Woody Carmichael in the Spike Lee film ''[[Crooklyn]]''. He is currently known for having starred as Alderman Ronin Gibbons in the ''[[The Chicago Code]]''.

==Early life==
Lindo was born in [[Eltham]], south-east [[London]], the son of [[Jamaica]]n [[British Jamaican|immigrant parents]], and was brought up in nearby [[Lewisham]]. His mother was a [[nurse]] and his father worked in various jobs.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_57/ai_97997635 Are these the 5 best actors in America? - under rated - Entertainment - Don Cheadle, Delroy Lindo, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Ving Rhames And Jeffrey Wright | Ebony | Find Articles at BNET.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a [[teenager]], he and his mother moved to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], and when he was sixteen,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/26/1085461828735.html It's not just cricket - Film - www.theage.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> they moved to [[San Francisco]], where Lindo would graduate from the [[American Conservatory Theater]].

==Career==
Lindo's movie debut came in 1976 with the British comedy ''[[Find the Lady (1976 film)|Find The Lady]]'', followed by two other roles in films such as that of an Army [[Sergeant]] in ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' (1979). He then quit screen acting for 10 years to concentrate on theatre production. In 1982 he debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[["Master Harold"...and the Boys]]'' directed by the play's author [[Athol Fugard]]. By 1988 Lindo had earned a [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination for his portrayal of Herald Loomis in ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.

It was director [[Spike Lee]] who provided the boost Lindo's career needed, even though he had turned down a role in ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' to act alongside [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Joan Chen]] in the cult science fiction movie ''[[The Blood of Heroes|Salute of the Jugger]]'' (1990). Lee cast him as Woody Carmichael in the drama ''[[Crooklyn]]'' (1994). Other films in which he has starring roles are [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'', ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' and ''Soul of the Game'' (1996) as the baseball player [[Satchel Paige]]. Many of the character actor's roles alternate between treacherous bad guys and trustworthy professionals. He continues to work in television and was most recently seen on the short-lived NBC drama ''[[Kidnapped (2006 TV series)|Kidnapped]]''.

He also guest-starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode "[[Brawl in the Family]]", playing a character named Gabriel that appears very similar to his character in ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]'' (where [[Dan Hedaya]] played the angel Gabriel, and Lindo's boss). Homer believes Gabriel is an angel, which he repeatedly denies.

Lindo also had a small role in the 1995 [[gorilla]]-action film [[Congo (film)|Congo]] playing the corrupt Captain Wanta. Wanta, a brusque man with a "big mouth" fond of [[sesame]] [[cake]], must be bribed with "more" money ([[United States Dollar|USD]] 50,000) in exchange for the release of the main characters, their truck, the gorilla Amy and ten military escorts to the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]]-[[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] border.  Though Lindo's performance has achieved [[internet meme]] status he was actually uncredited in the role.<ref>IMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112715/fullcredits#cast</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GWGouymBxk</ref>

In the fall of 2008 Lindo revisited [[August Wilson]]'s play ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]'', this time directing a production of the play at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]] in [[Berkeley, California]]; once more in 2010, he played the role of elderly seer Bynum in [[David Lan]]'s production at the [[Young Vic Theatre]] in London. Lindo's association with Berkeley Rep began in 2007 when he directed [[Tanya Barfield]]'s play ''The Blue Door''.
