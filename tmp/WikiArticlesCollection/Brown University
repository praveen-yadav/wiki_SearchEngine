'''Brown University''' (formally '''Brown University in Providence in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''') is an American [[Private university|private]] [[Ivy League]] [[Doctoral university|research university]] located in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]. Founded in 1764 prior to [[American independence]] from the [[British Empire]] as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'', Brown is the third oldest institution of higher education in [[New England]] and [[Colonial Colleges|seventh oldest]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0180 |title=Encyclopedia Brunoniana &#124; Bicentennial celebration |publisher=Brown University |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref>  The university consists of [[The College of Brown University|The College]], [[Graduate School of Brown University|Graduate School]], [[Alpert Medical School]], the [[Brown University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]], and the Brown University School of Public Health. Brown's international programs are organized through the [[Watson Institute for International Studies]].

Brown was the first college in the nation to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Get to Know Us: Our History |publisher= Brown University Admission Office}}</ref> Brown accepts 8.9% of undergraduate applicants, placing it among the world's most selective universities.<ref>[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/brown-university-3401 Brown University | Best College | US News]. Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.</ref> The New Curriculum, instituted in 1969, eliminated distribution requirements and allows any course to be taken on a satisfactory/no credit basis. In addition, there are no pluses or minuses in the letter grading system. The school has the oldest undergraduate [[engineering]] program in the Ivy League (1847). [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]], Brown's women's college, merged with the university in 1971. While Brown is considered a small research university with 713 full-time faculty and 1,947 graduate students, five of its professors and two of its alumni have been honored as [[Nobel Laureates]]. The faculty added 100 new professors in the past 10 years under the Boldly Brown campaign.

Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are Social Sciences (42%), Humanities (26%), Life Sciences (17%), and the Physical Sciences (14%).<ref name="brown.edu">http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/QuickReference09-10.pdf</ref> Brown's main campus is located on [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] on the [[East Side of Providence]].

{{Main|History of Brown University}}

===Founding===
[[File:James Manning head by Cosmo Alexander.JPG|thumb|First Brown President and Delegate to the [[Congress of the Confederation]] [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]]. Detail from an oil painting by [[Cosmo Alexander]], 1770; in University Hall, Brown University, Providence, R.I.]]
Brown owes its founding to the support of learning among a [[Baptist]] Church association but in 1762, the Baptist Minister [[Morgan Edwards]] was at first ridiculed for suggesting the founding of a college. In his ''Materials for a History of the Baptists in Rhode Island'', Edwards wrote:"The first mover [Edwards, himself] for it [a Baptist college] in 1762 was laughed at as a projector of a thing impracticable. Nay, many of the Baptists themselves discouraged the design (prophesying evil to the churches in case it should take place) from an unhappy prejudice against learning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/education/founding.html |title=Education for Everybody: Brown's Innovation and Influence in Collegiate Education |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref> Nonetheless, Edwards joined several others as an original fellow or trustee for the chartering of the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'' (the former name for Brown University), the first Baptist college in the original [[thirteen colonies]], and now one of the [[Ivy League]] universities.<ref>[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Corporation/downloads/charter-of-brown-university.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

In 1763, The Reverend [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], a [[Baptist]] minister, and an alumnus of the [[Princeton University|College of New Jersey]] (predecessor to today's [[Princeton University]]), was sent to Rhode Island by the Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches in order to found the college.<ref>{{cite web

At the same time, local [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], led by the theologist [[Ezra Stiles]], were working toward a similar end. The inaugural board meeting of the Corporation of the College in the English [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Colony of Rhode Island & Providence Plantations]] was held in the [[Old Colony House]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. Former [[List of colonial governors of Rhode Island|colonial governors of Rhode Island]] [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] and [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]], as well as the Reverend [[Isaac Backus]] and the Reverend [[Samuel Stillman]], were among those who played an instrumental role in Brown's foundation and later became American revolutionaries. On 3 March 1764, a charter was filed to create the College in [[Warren, Rhode Island]], reflecting the work of both Stiles and Manning. The college gained its [http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/education/charter.html charter] by grant of [[King George III]].
[[File:BrownUniversity-UniversityHall1795.jpg|thumb|left|This copper-plate engraving from 1795 is the first known image of Brown. The original campus was a single academic building that was later named [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]].]]
The charter had more than sixty signatories, including the brothers [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John]], [[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas]] and [[Moses Brown|Moses]] of the [[Chad Brown (minister)|Brown]] family, who would later inspire the College's modern name following a gift bestowed by [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.]] The college's mission, the charter stated, was to prepare students "for discharging the Offices of Life with usefulness & reputation" by providing instruction "in the Vernacular and Learned Languages, and in the liberal Arts and Sciences."<ref>{{cite book
|author=Brunson, Walter C.
|title=The History of Brown University, 1764â1914
|year=1972
|page=500 }}</ref>  The charter required that the makeup of the board of 36 trustees include, 22 [[Baptists]], five [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]], four [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and five [[Church of England|Church of England members]], and by 12 Fellows, of whom eight, including the President, should be Baptists "and the rest indifferently of any or all denominations." It specified that "into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience." One of the Baptist founders, [[John Gano]], had also been the founding minister of the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]]. The [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] remarks that "At the time it was framed the charter was considered extraordinarily [[liberalism|liberal]]" and that "the government has always been largely non-sectarian in spirit."<ref>"[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PRE_PYR/PROVIDENCE.html Providence]."

James Manning was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765. His tenure lasted until 1791. During his presidency, the College moved to its present location on [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] in the East Side of Providence in 1770 and construction of the first building, the College Edifice, began. This building was renamed University Hall in 1823.
[[File:Manning Hall, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island - 20091108.jpg|thumb|Hope College (left) was built in 1822, while Manning Hall (right) was built in 1834.]]
The Brown family&nbsp;â [[Nicholas Brown (Brown University)|Nicholas Sr.]], [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John]], Joseph, and [[Moses Brown|Moses]],â were instrumental in the move to Providence, funding and organizing much of the construction of the new buildings on the former [[Chad Brown (minister)|Rev. Chad Brown]] farm. The family's connection with the college was strong: Joseph Brown became a professor of Physics at the University, and John Brown served as treasurer from 1775 to 1796. In 1804, a year after John Brown's death, the University was renamed Brown University in honor of John's nephew, [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.]], who was a member of the class of 1786 and in 1804 contributed $5,000 toward an endowed professorship. In 1904, the [[John Carter Brown Library]] was opened as a research center on Americas based on the libraries of [[John Carter Brown]] and his son John Nicholas Brown.  The Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and made a small part of its wealth in businesses related to the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The family itself was divided on the issue. John Brown had unapologetically defended slavery, while Moses Brown and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent [[abolitionism|abolitionists]]. In recognition of this complex history, under President [[Ruth Simmons]], the University established the University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= Howell, Ricardo |year= 2001 |month= July |url= http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |title= Slavery, the Brown Family of Providence and Brown University |publisher= Brown University News Service |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080409001105/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Info/Slavery.html |archivedate= 9 April 2008 }}</ref>

Brown began to admit women when it established a [[Women's College in Brown University]] in 1891, which was later named [[Pembroke College in Brown University]]. "The College" (the undergraduate school) merged with Pembroke College in 1971 and became co-educational.

The language of the Brown University charter has long been interpreted by the university as discouraging the founding of a [[business school]] or [[law school]]. Brown continues to be one of only two Ivy League colleges with neither a business school nor a law school (the other being Princeton). Nevertheless, Brown recently developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid.<ref>{{cite web |author= Brown's website |year= 2012 |month= May |url= http://www.brown.edu/ce/adult/iebrown-mba/ |title= IE Brown Executive MBA |publisher= Brown University News Service |archiveurl= http://www.brown.edu/ce/adult/iebrown-mba/ |archivedate= 9 May 2012 }}</ref> In this partnership, Brown provides the traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business related subjects.

===American Revolution===

[[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]], Chief Justice and [[Governor]] of the ''English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations'', was a Delegate to the [[Albany Congress|Colonial Congress in Albany]] in 1754 and to the [[Continental Congress]] from 1774 to 1776. He was a signatory to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on behalf of the state of Rhode Island. He also served as the first chancellor of Brown from 1764 to 1785. His house is a minor historical site, located just off the main green at Brown.

In 1781, allied American and French armies under the command of General [[George Washington]] and the [[Comte de Rochambeau]], who led troops sent by King [[Louis XVI of France]], embarked on a {{convert|600|mi|km|sing=on}} [[Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route|march]] from Rhode Island to [[Virginia]], where they fought and defeated British forces sent by King [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on the [[Yorktown, Virginia]] peninsula. The victory ended the major battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Prior to the march, Brown University served as an encampment site for French troops, and the College Edifice, now University Hall, was turned into a military hospital.<ref>{{cite web

Other founders of Brown who played significant roles in the American revolutionary effort included [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]] in the [[Gaspee Affair]], Chief Justice Dr. [[Joshua Babcock]] as major general in the state militia and [[William Ellery]] as a signatory to the Declaration of Independence.

[[James Mitchell Varnum]], who graduated with honors in Brown's first graduating class of 1769, served as one of General George Washington's [[Continental Army]] Brigadier Generals and later as Major General in command of the entire [[Rhode Island militia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varnumcontinentals.org/about.htm |title=General James Mitchell Varnum House Armory History |publisher=Varnum Continentals |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> [[David Howell (jurist)|David Howell]], who graduated with an A.M. in the same year as General Varnum, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785.

In 1786, President James Manning was elected and served as representative for Rhode Island to the seventh session of the [[Congress of the Confederation|United States in Congress Assembled]], held in [[New York]]. In that capacity, he served on the Grand Committee, which proposed fundamental amendments to the Articles of Confederation and presaged the [[Constitution of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1587 |title=Proposed Amendments to the Articles of Confederation |publisher=Teachingamericanhistory.org |date=1 January 1980 |accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref>

===New curriculum===
In 1850, Brown President [[Francis Wayland]] wrote: "The various courses should be so arranged that, insofar as practicable, every student might study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose."<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> In 1969, the adoption of the New Curriculum marked a milestone in the University's institutional history and is seen as a significant step towards realizing Wayland's vision. The [[curriculum]] was the result of a paper written by [[Ira Magaziner]] and Elliot Maxwell entitled "Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University."<ref>{{cite web

The group was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]], and sought ways to improve education for students at Brown. The philosophy they formed sought to "put students at the center of their education" and to "teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts."<ref name="bdh_newcurr">{{cite news

The paper made a number of suggestions for improving education at Brown, including a new kind of [[interdisciplinary]] freshman course that would introduce new modes of inquiry and bring faculty from different fields together. Their goal was to transform the survey course, which traditionally sought to cover a large amount of basic material, into specialized courses that would introduce the important modes of inquiry used in different disciplines.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

Following a student rally in support of reform, President Ray Heffner appointed the Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy with the task of developing specific reforms. These reforms, known as the Maeder Report (after the chair of the committee), were then brought to the faculty for a vote. On 7 May 1969, following a marathon meeting with 260 faculty members present, the New Curriculum was passed. Its key features included the following:<ref name="bdh_newcurr" />
* Modes of Thought courses aimed at first-year students
* Interdisciplinary University courses
* Students could elect to take any course Satisfactory/No Credit
* Distribution requirements were dropped
* The University simplified grades to ABC/No Credit, eliminating pluses, minuses and D's. Furthermore, "No Credit" would not appear on external transcripts.

Except for the Modes of Thought courses, a key component of the reforms which have been discontinued, these elements of the New Curriculum are still in place.

Additionally, due to the school's proximity and close partnership with the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD), Brown students have the opportunity to take up to four courses at RISD and have the credit count towards a Brown degree. Likewise, RISD students can also take courses at Brown. Since the two campuses are effectively adjacent to each other, the two institutions often partner to provide both student bodies with services (such as the local Brown/RISD after-hours and downtown transportation shuttles).<ref>{{cite web

As recently as 2006, there has been some debate on reintroducing plus/minus grading to the curriculum. Advocates argue that adding pluses and minuses would reduce [[grade inflation]] and allow professors to give more specific grades,<ref>{{cite web

Founded in 1764, The College is the oldest school of Brown University. Nearly 6,000 undergraduate students are currently enrolled in the college, and approximately 80 concentrations (majors) are offered. Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are Social Sciences (42%), Humanities (26%), Life Sciences (17%), and the Physical Sciences (14%).<ref name="brown.edu"/> The concentrations with the greatest number of students are Biology, History, and International Relations.<ref>[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/annrep/2005%20PDF/TABLE11_2005.pdf Undergraduate Concentrations Completed: Selected Years]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> Brown is one of the few schools in the United States with an undergraduate concentration (major) in [[Egyptology]]. Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the existing standard programs do not fit their interests.

35% of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60% within 5 years, and 80% within 10 years.<ref name="admit-facts">{{cite web|author=Brown University |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/factsandfigures.html |title=Brown University Office of Admission facts and figures |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> For the Class of 1998, 75% of all graduates enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program since graduating from Brown.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Institutional_Research/documents/UndergraduateOutcomes2008.pdf</ref> The most degrees acquired were a Master's (35%) in any field, a Medical (28%), Doctoral (22%), or a Law (14%) degree, in highest order.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> There are not many who pursued the Ph.D compared to a Master's (for instance, business), or a Medical degree.

===Graduate School===
{{Main|Brown University Graduate School}}
Established in 1887, The Graduate School currently has around 2,000 students studying over 50 disciplines. 20 different [[master's degrees]] are offered as well as [[Ph.D.]] degrees in over 40 subjects ranging from [[applied mathematics]] to [[public policy]].

===Alpert Medical School===
{{Main|Alpert Medical School}}
[[File:Brown Alpert Medical School Med-Ed Building.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Med-Ed Building: The new home of Brown Alpert Medical School]]
The University's medical program started in 1811, but the school was suspended by President Wayland in 1827 after the program's faculty declined to live on campus (a new requirement under Wayland). In 1975, the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://med.brown.edu/timeline/ |title=History of the Brown Medical School |publisher=Med.brown.edu |date= |accessdate=6 June 2012}}</ref> In January 2007, self-made entrepreneur Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School on behalf of the Warren Alpert Foundation, tying [[Sidney Frank]] for the largest single monetary contribution ever made to the University. In recognition of the gift, the faculty of Brown University approved changing the name of the Brown Medical School to The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. It is currently ranked 29th among U.S. medical schools in research and 28th in primary care according to [[US News and World Report]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/med |title=Best Medical Schools&nbsp;â Graduate Schools&nbsp;â Education&nbsp;â US News and World Report |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> Admissions to Alpert is one of the most competitive in the nation, with only less than 2% of those applying through the Standard Route accepted in 2008 (5,902 applications for 94 spots).

The medical school is known for its eight-year [[Program in Liberal Medical Education]] (PLME), which was started in 1984 and is one of the most selective programs in the nation. Each year, approximately 60 high school students matriculate into the PLME out of an applicant pool of about 1,600. Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from [[Providence College]], [[Rhode Island College]], the [[University of Rhode Island]], and [[Tougaloo College]]. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via [[AMCAS]] like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers combined degree programs leading to the M.D./[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], M.D./[[Master of Public Health|M.P.H.]] and M.D./[[Master of Public Policy|M.P.P.]] degrees.

===School of Engineering===
{{main|Brown University School of Engineering}}
Brown has the oldest engineering program in the Ivy League. In 1916, multiple Departments of Engineering were consolidated into the Division of Engineering. As part of a broader growth initiative, in 2010, the Division of Engineering was authorized to begin operating as the School of Engineering.

===Research centers and institutes===

====Marine Biological Laboratory====
{{Main|Marine Biological Laboratory}}

The [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] (MBL) is an independent research institution established in 1882 at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The laboratory is linked to 54 current or past [[Nobel Laureates]] at its research or teaching faculty. Since 2005, the MBL and Brown University have collaborated in a Ph.D.-awarding Graduate Program in Biological and Environmental Sciences, which brings together faculty from both institutions. In 2010, the joint program was extended to include more professors participating in the partnership. The current faculty includes those from the Ecosystems Center, the Bay Paul Center, the Program in Cellular Dynamics, and the Marine Resources Center.

====Watson Institute for International Studies====
{{Main|Watson Institute for International Studies}}
[[File:BrownUniversity-WatsonInstitute.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Watson Institute for International Studies|Watson Institute]]]]
The Watson Institute for International Studies, usually referred to as the Watson Institute, is a center for the analysis of international issues at Brown University. Its original benefactor was [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]], former [[Ambassador to the Soviet Union]] and president of [[IBM]].

====Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women====
{{Main|Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women}}
The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, was established at Brown in 1981 as a research center on gender. It was named in honor of Pembroke College (Brown University), a decade after its merger with Brown University, and to recognize the history of women's efforts to gain access to higher education. Along with its numerous academic programs, including its sponsorship of post-doctoral research fellowships, the undergraduate concentration in [[Gender]] and [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] Studies, and the annual Pembroke Seminar, the Pembroke Center also organizes a number of programs throughout the year to recognize the historical achievements of women. Leading historian and social scientist [[Joan Wallach Scott]] was founding director of the Center. The Pembroke Center is affiliated with the [[Sarah Doyle Women's Center]].

====Computing====
Several projects of note involving hypertext and other forms of electronic text have been developed at Brown, including [[FRESS]], [[Brown University Interactive Language]] (BRUIN), [[Hypertext Editing System]], and [[Women Writers Project]]. In addition, the Computer Science department at Brown is home to [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|The CAVE]]. This project is a complete [[virtual reality]] room, one of few in the world, and is used for everything from three-dimensional drawing classes to tours of the [[circulatory system]] for medical students.
In 2000, a group of students from the university's Technology House converted the south side of the Sciences Library into a giant video display which allowed bystanders to play [[Tetris]], the largest of its kind ever in the Western Hemisphere. Constructed from 11 custom-built circuit boards, a 12-story data network, a [[personal computer]] running [[Linux]], a radio-frequency video game controller, and over 10,000 Christmas lights, the project was named La Bastille and could be seen for several miles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bastilleweb.techhouse.org/ |title=La Bastille: A Tech House Art Installation |publisher=Bastilleweb.techhouse.org |date=14 April 2000 |accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' ranked Brown 15th among national universities in its 2012 edition (published in August 2012). Undergraduates make up a larger proportion of the student body at Brown than at any of the other Ivy League universities, leading some Brown administrators to question the fairness of the ranking in light of the University's focus on undergraduate education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/campus-news/brown-holds-steady-at-no-15-in-annual-u-s-news-rankings-1.1676814 |title=Brown holds steady at No. 15 in annual U.S. News rankings |work=The Brown Daily Herald |date= |accessdate=5 October 2011}}</ref>

Brown ranked 5th in the country in [[Newsweek]]/[[The Daily Beast]]'s "America's Brainiac Schools". The rankings are calculated based on the number of prestigious scholarships, adjusted for population size, won by students, including [[Rhodes Scholarship]]s, [[Truman Scholarship]]s, [[Marshall Scholarship]]s, [[Gates Scholarship]]s (since 2001), and the number of students receiving [[Fulbright scholarship]]s (since 1993). Also factored in are scores on admissions tests, admission rates, and the proportion of students in the top 10% of their graduating high school class.

Brown is [[need-blind]] for all domestic applicants. Brown's [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]] policy eliminates loans for all students whose family incomes are under $100,000, as well as all parental contributions for families whose incomes fall under $60,000.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/education/25brown.html Brown Ends Tuition for Lower-Income Students]</ref> For these purposes, income is calculated by summing the adjusted gross income plus all untaxed income. In 2012, the program awarded need-based scholarships worth around $90 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Financial Aid Facts|url=http://brown.edu/about/facts/financial-aid|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref>

According to the university, Brown seeks diverse applicants from "all walks of life, backgrounds, interests, and cultural heritages" but has "no quotas of any kind".<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown University |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/appforms/secure/qanda.html |title=Brown Q&A 10/2009 |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>

There is no official designation of different campus areas from the University, but the institution's buildings can be roughly categorized as follows.

===Main campus===
{{further|List of Brown University buildings}}
[[File:BrownUniversity-UniversityHall.jpg|thumb|Built in 1770, [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] is the oldest building on Brown's campus.]]

Brown's main campus is located on College Hill, in the East Side, across the Providence River from downtown Providence. This is the where the University was relocated in 1770 after it was first established in [[Warren, Rhode Island]], in 1764. The main campus consists of 235 buildings and covers {{convert|143|acre|km2}}. A salient feature of Brown's campus is that many of the academic departments reside in smaller, Victorian-era houses that the University has acquired over the years from the surrounding neighborhood.

The main campus area can be subdivided further into the inner, traditional campus greens and the outer neighborhood. The two greens, the ''Main Green'' and ''Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle'' (formerly "Lincoln Field"), are large grass fields perpendicular to each other. These two areas contain many of the larger and more traditional academic and dormitory buildings, including University Hall (1770). This part of the main campus is enclosed by brick and rod iron fence, with the [[Van Wickle Gates]] serving as the prominent entrance on College Street. It is this area that is featured in most publications and photographs of Brown's campus.

Outside of the gates, but still considered part of the main campus, are other University buildings and libraries that have been built at Brown over the centuries. This includes the [[List of Brown University buildings#Wriston Quadrangle|Wriston Quad]] to the south of the Main Green; the John Hay Library and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library directly across the street from the Van Wickle Gates; and the [[Sciences Library (Brown University)|Sciences Library]] and Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Center for Information Technology (CIT) adjacent to the Soldiers Memorial Gate. Because this area is not confined by the gates, Brown has been able to acquire larger plots of land and construct much larger buildings as the University has expanded.

Adjacent to Brown's main campus, and further down the Hill to the west by the Providence River, is the campus of the [[Rhode Island School of Design]]. [[Thayer Street]], which runs through Brown's campus, is a commercial district that hosts many restaurants and shops popular with students and faculty from Brown and RISD.

===Pembroke Campus===
[[File:BrownUniversity-AndrewsHall.jpg|thumb|Andrews Hall on the Pembroke Campus]]

When [[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]] merged with Brown in 1971, the campus was absorbed as part of Brown's overall campus. For the most part, the campus is made up of dormitories, although notable exceptions include: Alumnae Hall, which houses a dance floor and a small University-run diner known as The Gate; Smith-Buonano hall, the gymnasium of Pembroke College that was later renovated to contain a common room, classrooms, and a lecture hall; and Pembroke Hall, the original classroom building for Pembroke College and now home to the Cogut Center for the Humanities and the [[Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women]]. Furthermore, the campus has its own dining hall, Verney-Woolley Dining Hall, the second of Brown's main dining halls. Somewhere between 25 and 30% of the incoming Freshman class lives on Pembroke, though there are also many upperclassmen.

===The Walk and surrounding area===
The Brown Walk connects Pembroke Campus to the main campus.  It's a newer green space, extending north from Waterman Street.  It is bordered by the building at 155 Angell St. (home to the Africana Studies Department and the Rites and Reason Theatre) and the UEL (Urban Environmental Lab, a.k.a. The Center for Environmental Studies, also facing Angell St) among other things.  Between Pembroke Campus and Main Campus, next to the Brown Bookstore, the Granoff Center for the Creative Arts opened in January 2011. Intended renovations will allow pedestrians to see the Ruth Simmons Quadrangle (Lincoln Field) from outside of Granoff.

===East Campus===
The '''East Campus''' was originally the main campus location of Brown's former neighbor [[Bryant College]]. Brown purchased Bryant's East Side campus in 1969 for $5.0 million when the latter school was moving to a new location. This added {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of land and additional 26 buildings adjacent to the main campus area. The area was officially designated East Campus in 1971.

===Other areas===
On the East Side:
Also on the Hill, but further to the south and away from the main campus area, is [[Wickenden Street]], another commercial district offering restaurants and shops. [[Brown Stadium]], built in 1925 and home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus.  Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus.

Elsewhere in Providence:
More recently, Brown has expanded into the Jewelry District, located in southern downtown Providence, by acquiring and renovating five buildings to serve as administrative and research facilities.

Outside of Providence:
Brown also owns a {{convert|376|acre|km2|sing=on}} property, the Mount Hope Grant, in [[Bristol, Rhode Island|Bristol]], which is the setting of the [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]]'s Collection Research Center.

===John Hay Library===
{{Main|John Hay Library}}
[[File:BrownUniversity-JohnHayLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[John Hay Library]]]]
The John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus. It was named for [[John Hay]] (class of 1858, private secretary to [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Secretary of State under two Presidents) at the request of his friend [[Andrew Carnegie]], who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=J0080 |title=From Martha Mitchell's '&#39;Encyclopedia Brunoniana'&#39;: John Hay Library |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> Constructed with [[Vermont]] white [[marble]] in an [[English Renaissance]] style, the library was dedicated on 10 November 1910 and had an estimated collection of 300,000 volumes.<ref>{{cite book

The [[Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women]] manages the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archives, both rich resources for feminist scholars.

===John Carter Brown Library===
[[File:brown university john carter brown lib.JPG|thumb|left|The [[John Carter Brown Library]]]]
{{Main|John Carter Brown Library}}
The John Carter Brown Library, founded in 1846, is administered separately from the University, but has been located on the Main Green of the campus since 1904. It is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas before 1825. It houses a very large percentage of the titles published before that date about the discovery, settlement, history, and natural history of the New World. The "JCB", as it is known, publishes ''Bibliotheca Americana'', the main bibliography in the field. Typical of its noteworthy holdings is the best preserved of the seven surviving copies of [[Bay Psalm Book]], the first extant book printed in British North America. There is also a very fine Shakespeare [[First Folio]], added to the collection by John Carter Brown's widow (a Shakespeare enthusiast) on the grounds that it includes ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play set in the New World. The JCB holdings comprise more than 50,000 early titles and about 16,000 modern books, as well as prints, manuscripts, maps, and other items in the library's specialty. The JCB occupies a [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style building designed by [[Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge]]. The 1904 edifice was expanded in 1990 by architects Hartman-Cox of Washington, D.C.

===Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology===
{{Main|Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology}}
[[File:Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Providence RI.jpg|thumb|Manning Hall, Home to the [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]]]]

The exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, RI.  The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology, and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.

===Boldly Brown===
Under President Ruth Simmons, the University has launched Boldly Brown: The Campaign for Academic Enrichment. This campaign consists of re-evaluating the existing curriculum and raising money for greater academic ambition. The money will be used for academic programs, research, new facilities, biology and medicine, students who need financial assistance, and expanding the faculty and staff. In June 2009, it was announced that the campaign had met its goal 19 months ahead of target, with record levels of giving despite the global economic crises of the fiscal year. The total sum raised currently stands at over US$1.5 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boldly.brown.edu/priorities/index.html |title=Boldly Brown web site |publisher=Boldly.brown.edu |date= |accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref>

===Athletics===

[[File:Harvard crimsons v brown 2009.JPG|thumb|Brown vs. [[Harvard University|Harvard]], September 2009]]
Brown is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Ivy League]] athletic conference. It sponsors 37 [[varsity team|varsity]] intercollegiate teams. Its athletic programs have been featured in the College Sports Honor Roll as one of the top 20 athletic programs in the country according to U.S. News & World Report. Brown Women's Rowing Team has won 6 national titles in the last 12 years, the Men's Rowing Team perennially finishes in the top 5 in the nation and swept the [[Eastern Sprints]] in 2009. Brown Football's reemergence, and its surge in northeast college popularity generally, is credited to its historic 1976 Ivy League championship team, which was Brown's first Ivy League Football Champions. The 1976 "Magnificent Andersons," so named for its coach, John Anderson, was 8â1, tying it with Yale, which the 1976 Brown team defeated head to head that year, and included an ABC Sports televised football game, defeating Harvard 16â14. Since the 1976 football championship season, Brown Football has won three Ivy League championships under the most successful coach in its history, Phil Estes: 1999, 2005, and 2008.  Brown's Men's Soccer program is consistently ranked in the top 25 and has won 18 Ivy League titles overall, including 8 of the last 12. Recent graduates play professionally in Major League Soccer and overseas. The Men's Lacrosse team also has a long and storied history, and more recently the program has again attained national rankings and exposure. In 2007, Brown won its first Ivy League baseball championship in school history. Brown's Varsity Equestrian team won the Ivy League Championships for the past two years in a row, and has consistently performed extremely well within the team's zone and region.<ref>U.S. News & World Report. (18 March 2002). "[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/sports/rankings/honor.htm College Sports: Honor Roll]." ''U.S. News & World Report''</ref> Brown also features several competitive intercollegiate club sports, including [[Sailing]], [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]], and Women's Rugby teams. In 2005, the Men's Club Ultimate Frisbee team, [[Brownian Motion (Ultimate)|Brownian Motion]], won the National Championships.

===Student organizations===
{{See also|Category:Brown University organizations}}

There are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, provides first-year students the opportunity to become acquainted with the wide range of organizations.

====Residential and Greek Societies====
[[File:BrownUniversity-MarcyHouse.jpg|thumb|upright|A fraternity house in Wriston Quadrangle]]
12.7% of Brown students are in [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities or sororities]]. There are 12 residential Greek houses: six all-male fraternities ([[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Delta Tau]], [[Delta Phi]], [[Theta Delta Chi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Phi Kappa Psi]]), four sororities ([[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and, as of March 2013, [[Kappa Delta]]), one co-ed fraternity (Zeta Delta Xi), and one co-ed literary society ([[Alpha Delta Phi#The Society|Alpha Delta Phi]]). All recognized Greek letter organizations live on-campus in University-owned dorm housing. All ten Greek houses are overseen by the Greek Council and are located on Wriston Quadrangle.

An alternative to fraternity life at Brown are the program houses, which are organized around various themes. As with Greek houses, the existing residents of each house take applications from students, usually at the start of the Spring semester. Examples of program houses include: [[St. Anthony Hall]] (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado [[French language|French]]/[[Hispanic]] House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and [[Interfaith]] House.

Currently, there are three student cooperative houses at Brown. Two of the houses, Watermyn and Finlandia on Waterman Street, are owned by the [[Brown Association for Cooperative Housing]] (BACH), an independent non-profit corporation owned and operated by house members. The third co-op, West House, is located in a Brown-owned house on Brown Street. All three houses also run a vegetarian food co-op for residents and non-residents.

====Secret Societies====
Secret societies at Brown originated as literary clubs in the mid-18th century, and primarily existed to organize debates among their members. One early literary club was the Pronouncing Society, which disbanded in the mid-1770s.<ref>{{cite book

==Traditions==
{{Main|Brown University traditions}}
Though the early history of Brown as a men's school includes a number of unusual [[hazing]] traditions, the University's present-day traditions tend to be non-violent while maintaining the spirit of zaniness.<ref>Poulson, Dan. (1 March 2002). "[http://web.archive.org/web/20030424194931/http://www.browndailyherald.com/post/stories.asp?ID=84 Investigating the death of campus traditions]." ''The Brown Daily Herald''</ref>

===Van Wickle Gates===
[[File:ScannedImage-11.JPG|thumb|Front view of the [[Van Wickle Gates]]]]
{{Main|Van Wickle Gates}}
The Van Wickle Gates, dedicated on 18 June 1901, have a pair of center gates and a smaller gate on each side. The side gates remain open throughout the year, while the center gates remain closed except for two occasions each year. At the beginning of the academic year, the center gates open inward to admit students during Convocation. At the end of the second semester, the gates open outward for the Commencement Day procession.<ref>Mitchell, Martha. (1993). "[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=V0020 Van Wickle Gates]." ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''</ref> A traditional superstition is that students who pass through the gates for a second time before graduation do not graduate. The [[Brown University Band]] famously flouts this tradition by marching in the yearly commencement procession. Undergraduate members, however, walk through the gates backwards, thereby avoiding the hex.

===Josiah S. Carberry===
{{Main|Josiah S. Carberry}}
One of Brown's most notable traditions is keeping alive the spirit and accomplishments of [[Josiah S. Carberry]], the fictional Professor of Psychoceramics (the equally fictional study of [[crank (person)|cracked pots]]), who was born on a University Hall billboard in 1929. He is the namesake of "Josiah's", a University-run campus eatery. "Josiah" is also the name of the University's electronic library catalog.

According to Martha Mitchell's ''[[Encyclopedia Brunoniana]]'', "On Friday, May 13, 1955, an anonymous gift of $101.01 was received by the University from Professor Carberry to establish the Josiah S. Carberry Fund in memory of his 'future late wife.' A condition of the gift was that, henceforth, every Friday the 13th would be designated 'Carberry Day,' and on that day friends of the University would deposit their loose change in brown jugs to augment the fund, which is used to purchase 'such books as Professor Carberry might or might not approve of.'"<ref name="EB">Mitchell, Martha. (1993). "[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0070 Carberry, Josiah S.]." ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''</ref> Students have followed this tradition ever since, and the fund currently has over $10,000 in it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/browntraditions.html |title=Brown Admission: Brown Traditions}}</ref>

Mitchell writes, "Professor Carberry has been the subject of articles in a number of periodicals, including ''The New York Times'', which proclaimed him 'The World's Greatest Traveler' on the front page of its Sunday travel section in 1974, and in ''Yankee'' magazine, where he was 'The Absent-Bodied Professor' in 1975. A recent honor which came to Professor Carberry was the award to him of an [[Ig Nobel Prize]] at the First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony in 1991. At this event sponsored by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] and the ''[[Journal of Irreproducible Results]]'', Carberry, the 1991 Ig Nobel Interdisciplinary Research Prize laureate, was cited as 'bold explorer and eclectic seeker of knowledge, for his pioneering work in the field of psychoceramics, the study of cracked pots.'"<ref name="EB" />

===Spring Weekend===
{{Main|Brown University traditions#Spring_Weekend|l1=Spring Weekend}}
Starting in 1950, Brown replaced the traditional Junior Week and Junior Prom, which were discontinued during World War II, with Spring Weekend, which featured athletic contests and dances. Concerts featuring invited performers began in 1960, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[U2]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[James Brown]] and [[Snoop Dogg]].<ref>Mitchell, Martha. (1993).

===Alma Mater===
{{Main|Brown University Alma Mater}}
The "Alma Mater" was written by James Andrews DeWolf (Class of 1861) in 1860, who named it "Old Brown" and set it to the tune of "[[1822 in music|Araby's Daughter]]" (which was later known as "[[Samuel Woodworth|The Old Oaken Bucket]]"). The song was renamed "Alma Mater", after the [[incipit]], in 1869.<ref>Mitchell, Martha. (1993). "[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=A0170 Alma Mater]." ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana''</ref> It is sung and played after varsity athletic victories and at formal events such as Convocation and Commencement.
