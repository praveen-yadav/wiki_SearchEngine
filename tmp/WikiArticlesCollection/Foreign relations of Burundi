{{Politics of Burundi}}
[[Burundi]]'s relations with its neighbours have often been affected by security concerns. Hundreds of thousands of Burundian [[refugee]]s have at various times crossed to neighboring [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians are in neighboring countries as a result of the ongoing civil war. Most of them, more than 340,000 since 1993, are in Tanzania. Some Burundian rebel groups have used neighboring countries as bases for insurgent activities. The 1993 embargo placed on Burundi by regional states hurt diplomatic relations with its neighbors; relations have improved since the 1999 suspension of these sanctions.

Burundi is a member of various international and regional organizations, including the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[African Development Bank]] and the [[Francophonie]]. Burundi is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]). The Swedish [[Minister for Integration and Gender Equality]], [[Nyamko Sabuni]], was born in Burundi.

===Rwanda===
Burundi and [[Rwanda]] dispute sections of border on the [[Akanyaru River|Akanyaru]] and the [[Kagera River|Kagera]]/[[Nyabarongo River|Nyabarongo]] rivers, which have changed course since the 1960s, when the boundary was delimited; cross-border conflicts among [[Tutsi]], [[Hutu]], other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces persist in the Great Lakes region.
