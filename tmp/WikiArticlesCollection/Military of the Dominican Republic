The '''Military of the [[Dominican Republic]]''' or '''Fuerzas Armadas de la República Dominicana''' consists of approximately 44,000 active duty personnel, about 60 percent of which are utilized for non-military operations, including security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, toll security, forestry workers and other state enterprises, and personal security for ministers, congressmen, etc. The [[president]] is the [[commander in chief]] for the military. The primary missions are to defend the nation and protect the territorial integrity of the country. The [[Dominican Army|Army]], twice as large as the other services combined with about 24,000 active duty personnel, consists of six [[infantry]] brigades, a combat support brigade, an air cavalry squadron and a combat service support brigade; the [[Dominican Air Force|Air Force]] operates two main bases, one in southern region near [[Santo Domingo]] and one in the northern region of the country, the air force operates approximately 40 aircraft including helicopters; and the [[Dominican Navy|Navy]] maintains three aging vessels which were donated from the United States, around 25 patrol crafts and interceptor boats and two helicopters. The [[Dominican Republic]]'s military is second in size to [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Cuba's]] in the [[Caribbean]]. There is a counter-terrorist group formed by members of the three branches. This group is highly trained in counter-terrorism missions. The armed forces participate fully in counter-[[illegal drug trade]] efforts, for this task there is a taskforce known as DEPROSER 24/7 (DEfender, PROteger y SERvir). They also are active in efforts to control [[contraband]] and [[illegal immigration]] from [[Haiti]] to the Dominican Republic and from the Dominican Republic to the [[United States]] (via illegal transportation of Dominicans to [[Puerto Rico]]).
