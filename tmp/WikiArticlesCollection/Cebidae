The '''Cebidae''' is one of the five [[family (biology)|families]] of [[New World monkeys]] now recognised. It includes the [[capuchin monkey]]s and [[squirrel monkey]]s.<ref name=SAP/> These species are found throughout tropical and subtropical [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]].

==Characteristics==
Cebid monkeys are [[arboreal]] animals that only rarely travel on the ground. They are generally small monkeys, ranging in size <!--from the [[Pygmy Marmoset]], with a head-body length of 17 to 19 cm, and a weight of 120 to 190 grams,--> up to that of the [[Brown Capuchin]], with a body length of 33 to 56&nbsp;cm, and a weight of 2.5 to 3.9 kilograms. They are somewhat variable in form and coloration, but all have the wide, flat, noses typical of New World Monkeys. They are different from marmosets as they have additional molar tooth and a prehensile tail. <ref>{{cite book|title=Organic Evolution|year=1921|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|url=http://archive.org/stream/organicevolutio01lullgoog#page/n5/mode/2up|chapter=77}}</ref>   

They are [[omnivore|omnivorous]], mostly eating fruit and insects, although the proportions of these foods vary greatly between species. They have the [[dentition|dental formula]]:{{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.2-3|lower=2.1.3.2-3}}

Females give birth to one or two young after a [[gestation]] period of between 130 and 170 days, depending on species. They are social animals, living in groups of between five and forty individuals, with the smaller species typically forming larger groups. They are generally [[Diurnality|diurnal]] in habit.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Janson, C.H. & Rylands, A.B.|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|pages= 342â€“361|isbn= 0-87196-871-1}}</ref>

==Classification==
Previously, New World monkeys were divided between [[Callitrichidae]] and this family. For a few recent years, [[marmoset]]s, [[tamarin]]s, and [[lion tamarin]]s were placed as a subfamily (Callitrichinae) in Cebidae, while moving other genera from Cebidae into the families [[Aotidae]], [[Pitheciidae]] and [[Atelidae]].<ref name=msw3/> The most recent classification of New World monkeys again splits the callitrichids off, leaving only the capuchins and squirrel monkeys in this family.<ref name=SAP/>
