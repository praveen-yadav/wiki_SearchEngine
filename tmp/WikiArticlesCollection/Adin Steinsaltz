Rabbi '''Adin Steinsaltz''' (Hebrew: עדין שטיינזלץ) or '''Adin Even Yisrael''' (Hebrew: עדין אבן ישראל) (born 1937) is a teacher, philosopher, social critic, and spiritual mentor, who has been hailed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as a "once-in-a-millennium scholar".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966474,00.html|title=Giving The Talmud to the Jews|author=[[Richard N.

Beginning in 1989, Steinsaltz published several tractates in Hebrew and English of the Babylonian (Bavli) Talmud in an English-Hebrew edition. The first volume of a new English-Hebrew edition, the Koren Talmud Bavli, was released in May, 2012, with five tractates in print by May, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/april-27-2012/rabbi-adin-steinsaltz/10847/|title=Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz|author=[[Bob Abernethy]]|work=Religion & Ethics | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1937 to secular parents, Steinsaltz studied [[mathematics]],<ref name=tanya>Steinsaltz, Adin; Shneur Zalman (of Lyady).

Following graduation, he established several experimental schools after an unsuccessful attempt to start a neo-[[Hassidic]] community in the [[Negev desert]],<ref name="Newsweek"/> and, at the age of 23, became [[Israel]]’s youngest school principal.<ref name=tanya/>

In 1965, he founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications and began his monumental work on the Talmud, including translation into Hebrew, English, Russian, and various other languages. The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud include translation from the original [[Aramaic]] and a comprehensive commentary. Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew edition of the entire Babylonian Talmud in November 2010, at which time [[,Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] became the publisher of all of his works, including the Talmud. While not without criticism (e.g. by [[Jacob Neusner|Neusner]], 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States and the world. Over 2 million volumes of the Steinsaltz Talmud have been distributed to date. The out-of-print [[Random House]] publication of ''[[The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition]]'' is widely regarded as the most accurate and least redacted of any English language edition and is sought after on that basis by scholars and collectors. Controversial Talmud passages previously obscured, omitted entirely or confined to footnotes in English translations like the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud, receive full exposition in the Steinsaltz Talmud. [[Random House]] halted publication of the Steinsaltz Talmud after less than one-third of the English translation had been published.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} 

The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud have opened up the world of Talmud study to thousands of people outside the walls of the traditional yeshiva, including women, who traditionally were not taught Talmud. Regarding the access that his work provides, Rabbi Steinsaltz says:

:“I never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings.”

Rabbi Steinsaltz's classic work of [[Kabbalah]], ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose'', was first published in 1980 and now appears in eight languages. In all, Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including Talmud, [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[sociology]], historical biography, and philosophy. Many of these works have been translated into English by his close personal friend, now deceased, Yehuda Hanegbi. All are published by [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} 

In the summer of 1989, a group of rabbis including [[Elazar Shach]] placed a ban on three of Steinsaltz's books.<ref>Davar - 4/08/1989 - pg. 3 - Noach Zvuluny (Can be read online here :http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article3071_19890804.asp)</ref> 

Continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Steinsaltz established a network of schools and educational institutions in Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has served as scholar in residence at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington, D.C. and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His honorary degrees include doctorates from [[Yeshiva University]], [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Bar Ilan University]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Florida International University]]. Steinsaltz is also [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Hesder]] [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]]. 

Being a follower of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] of [[Chabad-Lubavitch]], he went to help Jews in the [[Soviet Union]] assisting Chabad's ''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'' (propagators) network. Deeply involved in the future of the Jews in the former Soviet Union, Steinsaltz serves as the region's ''Duchovny Ravin'' (Spiritual Rabbi), a historic Russian title which indicates that he is the spiritual mentor of Russian Jewry. In this capacity, Steinsaltz travelled to Russia and the Republics once each month from his home in Jerusalem. During his time in the former Soviet Union he founded the Jewish University, both in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]]. The Jewish University is the first degree-granting institution of Jewish studies in the former [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/hpeumr.htm| title=Jewish University in Moscow|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> 

Steinsaltz has taken a cautious approach to interfaith dialogues. During a visit of a delegation of Roman Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in Manhattan in January 2004, he said that “you do not have to raise over-expectations of a meeting as it doesn't signify in itself a breakthrough, however, the opportunity for cardinals and rabbis to speak face to face is valuable. It's part of a process in which we can talk to each other in a friendly way,'' Rabbi Steinsaltz said.”,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/20/nyregion/in-upper-manhattan-talmudic-scholars-look-up-and-find-cardinals-among-the-rabbis.html?scp=1&sq=In%20Upper%20Manhattan,%20Talmudic%20Scholars%20Look%20Up%20and%20Find%20Cardinals%20Among%20the%20Rabbis&st=cse| title=In Upper Manhattan, Talmudic Scholars Look Up and Find Cardinals Among the Rabbis| author= Daniel J. Wakin and Laurie Goodstein| date=20 January 2004| newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref> and called for “a theological dialogue that asks the tough questions, such as whether Catholicism allows for Jews to enter eternal paradise.”<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/6156/| title=

Steinsaltz and his wife live in Jerusalem, and have three children and more than ten grandchildren. His son, Rabbi Menachem Even-Israel, is the Director of Educational Programs at the Steinsaltz Center in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem.

==Head of the new Sanhedrin==
{{Main|2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin}}
Rabbi Steinsaltz accepted the position as Nasi (President) of the [[2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Matthew|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=53086| date=1 March 2007|title=Steinsaltz addresses event for revived Sanhedrin|periodical=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref> In 2008 he resigned from this position due to differences of opinion.<ref>{{cite news| author=Sue Fishkoff| title=Steinsaltz completes Talmud translation with Global Day of Jewish Learning| newspaper=JTA | url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/10/31/2741473/worldwide-day-of-learning-marks-completion-of-steinsaltz-talmud| date=31 October 2010|accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>

==As a speaker==
Steinsaltz is a popular University and radio commentator. He has been invited to speak at the [[Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies]] at [[Yale University]] in 1979. In Jerusalem, he gives evening seminars, which according to Newsweek usually last till 2 in the morning, and have attracted prominent politicians as the former Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] and former [[Finance Minister]] [[Pinhas Sapir]].<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite news| url=http://www.steinsaltz.org/learning.php?pg=In_the_News&articleId=1384| newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|author=Kenneth L. Woodward and Milan L. Kubic|title=Israel's Mystical Rabbi|date=26 May 1980}}</ref>

==Awards and critical reception==
Rabbi Steinsaltz has received many awards and prizes, among them the [[Israel Prize]] for Jewish studies in 1988.<ref name=prize>{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site – Recipients in 1988 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashmag/Tashnab_Tashmag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashmach}}</ref>

On 9 February 2012, Steinsaltz was honored by Israeli President Shimon Peres with Israel's first President's Prize for his scholarship in Talmud.<ref name=president>{{Cite news| title = Kissinger, others honored by Israeli president | url = http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/02/09/3091592/kissenger-others-honored-by-israeli-president| newspaper=JTA |accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>

However not all reception of Steinsaltz' studies have been wholly positive. In the relatively calm academic world [[Jacob Neusner]]'s combatively titled ''How Adin Steinsaltz Misrepresents the Talmud. Four False Propositions from his "Reference Guide."'' (1998) displays strong disagreement.<ref>"So to orient Steinsaltz to the discourse he manifestly has missed, I call to his attention the following works in ... of book reviews and criticism I have published over the past forty years: Judaic Law from Jesus to the Mishnah. ..."</ref>
