'''Badminton''' is a [[List of racquet sports|racquet sport]] played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court divided by a net. Players score points by striking a [[shuttlecock]] with their racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor, or if a fault has been called by either the umpire or service judge or, in their absence, the offending player, at any time during the rally.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Boga|first=Steve|title=Badminton|publisher=Paw Prints|year=2008|isbn=1439504784|accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref>

The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered (or, mainly in uncompetitive games, plastic) projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently than the balls used in most racquet sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher [[drag (physics)|drag]], causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to other racquet sports. Because shuttlecock flight is affected by wind, competitive badminton is played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.

Since 1992, badminton has been an [[Olympic sports|Olympic sport]] with five [[competition|events]]: men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles, and mixed doubles, in which each pair consists of a man and a woman. At high levels of play, especially in singles, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, explosive strength, speed and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good [[motor coordination]] and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grice|first=Tony|title=

==History and development==
[[File:Battledore - Youthful Sports.png|thumb|left|Game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]] in 1804]]
[[File:Battledore-and-shuttlecock.jpg|right|thumb|280px|''Battledore and Shuttlecock''. ''1854, from the [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] Archive''<ref>Cartoon taken from the [http://john-leech-archive.org.uk John Leech Archive] which gave the artist as John Leech and the date as 1854.</ref>]]

The beginnings of badminton can be traced to the mid-1800s in [[British India]], where it was created by British military officers stationed there.<ref name=Guillain47/> Early photographs show Englishmen adding a net to the traditional English game of [[battledore and shuttlecock]]. The sport is related to [[ball badminton]], which originated in [[Tamil Nadu]], and is similar to [[Hanetsuki]] which originated in Japan. Being particularly popular in the British garrison town Poona (now [[Pune]]), the game also came to be known as ''Poona''.<ref name=Guillain47>{{Cite book|last=Guillain|first=Jean-Yves|title=Badminton: An Illustrated History|publisher=Publibook|date=2004-09-02|isbn=2-7483-0572-8|accessdate=2009-01-25|page=47}}</ref><ref name=OFB195>{{Cite book|last=Connors|first=M|coauthors=Dupuis, D.

This game was taken by retired officers back to England where it developed and rules were set out.

Although it appears clear that [[Badminton House]], [[Gloucestershire]], owned by the [[Duke of Beaufort]], has given its name to the sports, it is unclear when and why the name was adopted. As early as 1860, [[Isaac Spratt]], a London toy dealer, published a booklet, ''Badminton Battledore – a new game'', but unfortunately no copy has survived.<ref name=Adams>Bernard Adams, [http://www.worldbadminton.com/text/history.txt The Badminton Story], BBC Books, 1980, ISB 0563164654</ref> An 1863 article in ''The Cornhill Magazine'' describes badminton as "battledore and shuttlecock played with sides, across a string suspended some five feet from the ground".<ref name=OED>"Badminton" etymology entry at the online [[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref> This early use has cast doubt on the origin through expatriates in India, though it is known that it was popular there in the 1870s and that the first rules were drawn up in Poonah in 1873.<ref name=Adams/><ref name=OED/> Another source cites that it was in 1877 at [[Karachi]] in (British) India, where the first attempt was made to form a set of rules.<ref>{{cite book|title=Better Badminton for All|year=1982|publisher=Pelham Books|isbn=978-0-7207-1438-8|author=Jake Downey, Jason Charles Downey|page=13}}</ref>

As early as 1875, veterans returning from India started a club in [[Folkestone]]. Until 1887, the sport was played in England under the rules that prevailed in British India. The Bath Badminton Club standardized the rules and made the game applicable to English ideas. J.H.E. Hart drew up revised basic regulations in 1887 and, with Bagnel Wild, again in 1890.<ref name=Adams/> In 1893, the Badminton Association of England published the first set of rules according to these regulations, similar to today's rules, and officially launched badminton in a house called "Dunbar" at 6 Waverley Grove, [[Portsmouth]], England on September 13 of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbadminton.com/newsite/History/index.html|title=History of Badminton: Founding of the BAE and Codification of the Rules|publisher=WorldBadminton.com}}</ref> They also started the [[All England Open Badminton Championships]], the first badminton competition in the world, in 1899.

The International Badminton Federation (IBF) (now known as [[Badminton World Federation]]) was established in 1934 with Canada, Denmark, England, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, and Wales as its founding members. India joined as an affiliate in 1936. The BWF now governs international badminton and develops the sport globally.

While initiated in England, competitive men's badminton in Europe has traditionally been dominated by Denmark. Asian nations, however, have been the most dominant ones worldwide. China, Indonesia, South Korea, and Malaysia along with Denmark are among the nations that have consistently produced world-class players in the past few decades, with China being the greatest force in both men's and women's competition in recent years.

==Rules==
The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication, ''Laws of Badminton''.<ref name=laws>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=14915|title=Laws of Badminton|publisher=Badminton World Federation}}</ref>

===Playing court dimensions===
[[File:Badminton court 3d.svg|right|thumb|400px|Badminton court, [[isometric projection|isometric]] view]]
The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play, although badminton rules  permit a court to be marked for singles only.<ref name=laws/>  The doubles court is wider than the singles court, but both are of same length. The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.

The full width of the court is 6.1&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft), and in singles this width is reduced to 5.18&nbsp;metres (17&nbsp;ft). The full length of the court is 13.4&nbsp;metres (44&nbsp;ft). The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court, by a short service line at a distance of 1.98&nbsp;metres (6&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;inch) from the net, and by the outer side and back boundaries. In doubles, the service court is also marked by a long service line, which is 0.76&nbsp;metres (2&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;inch) from the back boundary.

The net is 1.55&nbsp;metres (5&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;inch) high at the edges and 1.524&nbsp;metres (5&nbsp;ft) high in the centre. The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines, even when singles is played.

The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton. Nonetheless, a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve.

===Equipment rules===
Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks. Badminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed:

<blockquote>
; 3.1 : To test a shuttlecock, hit a full underhand stroke which makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line. The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the side lines.

; 3.2 : A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than 530&nbsp;mm and not more than 990&nbsp;mm short of the other back boundary line.</blockquote>

===Scoring system and service===
[[Image:Badminton court legal bounds.svg|thumb|239px|The legal bounds of a badminton court during various stages of a rally for singles and doubles games.]]
{{Main|Scoring system development of badminton}}

====Serving====
Each game is played to 21 points, with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served <ref name=laws/> (this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to 15 points). A match is the best of three games.

At the start of the rally, the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite ''service courts'' (see [[#Playing court dimensions|court dimensions]]). The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receiver's service court. This is similar to [[tennis]], except that a badminton serve must be hit below waist height and with the racquet shaft pointing downwards, the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton, the players stand inside their service courts unlike tennis.

When the serving side loses a rally, the serve immediately passes to their opponent(s) (this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a "second serve").

In singles, the server stands in their right service court when their score is even, and in her/his left service court when her/his score is odd.

In doubles, if the serving side wins a rally, the same player continues to serve, but he/she changes service courts so that she/he serves to a different opponent each time. If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even, the player in the right service court serves; if odd, the player in the left service court serves. The players' service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally, not by where they were standing at the end of the rally. A consequence of this system is that, each time a side regains the service, the server will be the player who did ''not'' serve last time.

====Scoring====
When the server serves, the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents' court or it will count as a fault.

If the score reaches 20-all, then the game continues until one side gains a two point lead (such as 24–22), up to a maximum of 30 points (30–29 is a winning score).

At the start of a match, the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first. Alternatively, a coin may be tossed, with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first, or choosing which end of the court to occupy, and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice.

In subsequent games, the winners of the previous game serve first. Matches are best out of three: a player or pair must win two games (of 21 points each) to win the match. For the first rally of any doubles game, the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives. The players change ends at the start of the second game; if the match reaches a third game, they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading player's or pair's score reaches 11 points.

The server and receiver must remain within their service courts, without touching the boundary lines, until the server strikes the shuttlecock. The other two players may stand wherever they wish, so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver.

====Lets====
If a let is called, the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score. Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on court (having been hit there by players on an adjacent court) or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let.

If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered, a let shall be called; yet, if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock, he shall be judged to have been ready.

==Equipment==
[[File:Heads of badminton raquets.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Badminton [[racquet]]s]]

===Rackets===
Badminton [[Racket (sports equipment)|racket]]s are lightweight, with top quality racquets weighing between 70 and 95&nbsp;grams (2.4 to 3.3 ounces) not including grip or strings.<ref name=oqgysc>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/ |title=Badminton Central Guide to choosing Badminton Equipment|first=Kwun|date=2005-02-28|publisher=BadmintonCentral.com|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070311234023/http://www.badmintoncentral.com/badminton-central/content/view/91/26/|archivedate=2007-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|title=SL-70|publisher=Karakal|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071016051147/http://www.karakal.com/index.php/8/product/72/sl-70/|archivedate=2007-10-16}}</ref> They are composed of many different materials ranging from [[carbon fiber composite|carbon fibre composite]] ([[graphite reinforced plastic]]) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. [[carbon fiber|Carbon fibre]] has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent [[kinetic energy]] transfer. Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite, racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium. Earlier still, racquets were made of wood. Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel, but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market, because of their excessive mass and cost. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as [[fullerene]] and [[carbon nanotubes]] are added to rackets giving them greater durability.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape. Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players. The traditional oval head shape is still available, but an [[wikt:isometric|isometric]] head shape is increasingly common in new racquets.

===Strings===
Badminton strings are thin, high performing strings in the range of about 0.62 to 0.73&nbsp;mm thickness. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings. String tension is normally in the range of 80 to 160&nbsp;[[newton (unit)|N]] (18 to 36 [[pound-force|lbf]]). Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals, typically between 80 and 110 N (18 and 25&nbsp;lbf). Professionals string between about 110 and 160 N (25 and 36&nbsp;lbf). Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack. Ashaway Micropower is actually 0.7mm but Yonex BG-66 is about 0.72mm. 

It is often argued that high string tensions improve control, whereas low string tensions increase power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |title=String tension relating to power and control|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071028080241/http://www.prospeed.com.my/String.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning, such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power. This is in fact incorrect, for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately. An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player:<ref name="oqgysc"/> the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet, the higher the tension for maximum power. Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis, nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other. The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment.

===Grip===
The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of his racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer.

Players may choose between a variety of grip materials. The most common choices are [[polyurethane|PU]] synthetic grips or towelling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his/her grip more frequently.

There are two main types of grip: ''replacement'' grips and ''overgrips''. Replacement grips are thicker, and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Overgrips are thinner (less than 1&nbsp;mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Towelling grips are always replacement grips. Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.
[[File:Shuttlecocks Yonex Aerosensa 20.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Shuttlecock]]s with feathers]]
[[File:ShuttlecockPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A shuttlecock with a plastic skirt]]

===Shuttlecock===
{{Main|Shuttlecock}}
A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to ''shuttle''; also called a ''birdie'') is a high-drag [[projectile]], with an open [[Cone (geometry)|conical shape]]: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping [[feathers]] embedded into a rounded cork base. The [[Cork (material)|cork]] is covered with thin [[leather]] or synthetic material.

[[Nylon (material)|Synthetic]] shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base, and a plastic skirt.

===Shoes===
Badminton [[Athletic shoe|shoes]] are lightweight with soles of [[rubber]] or similar high-grip, non-marking materials.

Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little [[support (structure)|lateral support]]. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe's support fails, and the player's ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person's centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is more than just a safety concern: proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court.

==Strokes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
[[File:GGOpen Setiadi.jpg|right|thumb|A player flies high at the Golden Gate Badminton Club (GGBC) in Menlo Park, 2006]]

===Forehand and backhand===
Badminton offers a wide variety of basic strokes, and players require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively. All strokes can be played either ''forehand'' or ''backhand''. A player's forehand side is the same side as their playing hand: for a right-handed player, the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side. Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading (like hitting with the palm), whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading (like hitting with the knuckles). Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action, and vice versa.

In the forecourt and midcourt, most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side; but in the rear court, players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands, often preferring to play a ''round-the-head'' forehand overhead (a forehand "on the backhand side") rather than attempt a backhand overhead. Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages. First, the player must turn their back to their opponents, restricting their view of them and the court. Second, backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands: the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint, which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand. The ''backhand clear'' is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game, since precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court. For the same reason, ''backhand smashes'' tend to be weak.

===Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player===
[[File:BadmintonService.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A player does a forehand service, 2009, Philadelphia.]]
The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an opponent is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. '''In the forecourt''', a high shuttlecock will be met with a ''net kill'', hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation. '''In the midcourt''', a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful ''smash'', also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic ''jump smashes'', where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. '''In the rearcourt''', players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This ''overhead'' hitting allows them to play smashes, ''clears'' (hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents' court), and dropshots (hitting the shuttlecock so that it falls softly downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the shuttlecock has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.
[[File:BadmintonJumpSmash.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A player prepares for a vertical jump smash]]

===Vertical position of the shuttlecock===
'''When the shuttlecock is well below net height''', players have no choice but to hit upwards. ''Lifts'', where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents' court, can be played from all parts of the court. If a player does not lift, his only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net: in the forecourt this is called a ''netshot''; in the midcourt or rearcourt, it is often called a ''push'' or ''block''.

'''When the shuttlecock is near to net height''', players can hit ''drives'', which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents' rear midcourt and rearcourt. Pushes may also be hit flatter, placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt. Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt, and are most often used in doubles: they are an attempt to regain the attack, rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes. After a successful drive or push, the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock.

===Other factors===
'''When defending against a smash''', players have three basic options: lift, block, or drive. In singles, a block to the net is the most common reply. In doubles, a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing; blocks and drives are counter-attacking strokes, but may be intercepted by the smasher's partner. Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides, because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body. Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend.

'''The service''' is restricted by [[#Laws of the game|the Laws]] and presents its own array of stroke choices. Unlike in tennis, the server's racket must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net. The server can choose a ''low serve'' into the forecourt (like a push), or a lift to the back of the service court, or a flat ''drive serve''. Lifted serves may be either ''high serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court, or ''flick serves'', where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner.

===Deception===
Once players have mastered these basic strokes, they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court, powerfully and softly as required. Beyond the basics, however, badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage. Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible, the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent, so that either he is tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played, or he is forced to delay his movement until he actually sees the shuttle's direction. "Deception" in badminton is often used in both of these senses. When a player is genuinely deceived, he will often lose the point immediately because he cannot change his direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock. Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early, but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay his movement slightly. Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious, an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit, anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage.

''Slicing'' and using a ''shortened hitting action'' are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt ''sliced dropshot'' will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock. A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit, in order to make the shuttlecock spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create ''spinning netshots'' (also called ''tumbling netshots''), in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning netshot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots are especially important for high level singles players.

The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes, thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment. For example, a singles player may hold his racquet ready for a netshot, but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when she or he notices the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played. A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground. This makes the opponent's task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger, obvious swing. A short hitting action is not only useful for deception: it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when he has no time for a big arm swing. A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges. The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques, and is often described as ''finger power''. Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes, such as net kills, with less than a {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} racquet swing.

It is also possible to reverse this style of deception, by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke. In general, this latter style of deception is more common in the rearcourt (for example, dropshots disguised as smashes), whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt (for example, lifts disguised as netshots).

Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions. Players may also use ''double motion'', where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction. Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction. The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke cross court, or vice versa. ''Triple motion'' is also possible, but this is very rare in actual play. An alternative to double motion is to use a ''racquet head fake'', where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit. This produces a smaller change in direction, but does not require as much time.

==Strategy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
To win in badminton, players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations. These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns. Often rallies finish with a smash, but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes. For example, a netshot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock, which gives an opportunity to smash. If the netshot is tight and tumbling, then the opponent's lift will not reach the back of the court, which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return.

Deception is also important. Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical, and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke. If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke, he may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change his body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock.

===Doubles===
Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack, smashing downwards when possible. Whenever possible, a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rearcourt, and his partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift. If the rearcourt attacker plays a dropshot, his partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply. If a pair cannot hit downwards, they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack. If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock, then they must defend: they will adopt a side-by-side position in the rear midcourt, to cover the full width of their court against the opponents' smashes. In doubles, players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes.

At high levels of play, the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play. The straight low serve is used most frequently, in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately. Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively.

At high levels of play, doubles rallies are extremely fast. Men's doubles is the most aggressive form of badminton, with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes.

===Singles===
The singles court is narrower than the doubles court, but the same length. Since one person needs to cover the entire court, singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible; this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court. Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots. Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up his effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return. Moreover, frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a player's energy is at a premium. However, players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings, and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies.   

In singles, players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve. Low serves are also used frequently, either forehand or backhand. Drive serves are rare.

At high levels of play, singles demands extraordinary fitness. Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring, unlike the all-out aggression of doubles.

===Mixed doubles===
In mixed doubles, both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back. This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger, and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful. As a result, mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play. Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position, by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front. In order to protect against this danger, mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |title=Badminton Strategies and Tactics for the Novice and Recreational Player|last=Kumekawa|first=Eugene|publisher=BadmintonPlanet |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070126195758/http://www.badmintonplanet.com/cgi-bin/playbetter/strategies.html |archivedate = 2007-01-26}}</ref>

At high levels of play, the formations will generally be more flexible: the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the back-court, and will happily do so if required. When the opportunity arises, however, the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position, with the woman in front and men in the back.

==Governing bodies==
The Badminton World Federation (BWF) is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport. Five regional confederations are associated with the BWF:
* Asia: [[Badminton Asia Confederation]] (BAC)
* Africa: [[Badminton Confederation of Africa]] (BCA)
* Americas: [[Badminton Pan Am]] (North America and South America belong to the same confederation; BPA)
* Europe: [[Badminton Europe]] (BE)
* Oceania: [[Badminton Oceania]] (BO)

==Competitions==
[[File:Badminton men's doubles.jpg|thumb|340px|A men's doubles match. The blue lines are those for the badminton court. The other coloured lines denote uses for other sports – such complexity being common in multi-use sports halls.]]

The BWF organizes several international competitions, including the [[Thomas Cup]], the premier men's international team event first held in [[1949 Thomas Cup|1948–1949]], and the [[Uber Cup]], the women's equivalent first held in [[1957 Uber Cup|1956–1957]]. The competitions take place once every two years. More than 50 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals. The final tournament involves 12 teams, following an increase from eight teams in 2004.

The [[Sudirman Cup]], a gender-mixed international team event held once every two years, began in 1989. Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country. To win the tournament, a country must perform well across all five disciplines (men's doubles and singles, women's doubles and singles, and mixed doubles). Like [[association football]] (soccer), it features a promotion and relegation system in every level.

Badminton was a demonstration event in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. It became an official [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympic]] sport at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]] in [[Badminton at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and its gold medals now generally rate as the sport's most coveted prizes for individual players.

In the [[BWF World Championships]], first held in [[1977 IBF World Championships|1977]], currently only the highest ranked 64 players in the world, and a maximum of four from each country, can participate in any category. In both the Olympic and BWF World competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they sometimes result in excluding elite world level players from the strongest badminton nations. The Thomas, Uber, and Sudirman Cups, the Olympics, and the BWF World (and [[BWF World Junior Championships|World Junior Championships]]), are all categorized as level one tournaments.

At the start of 2007, the BWF  introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one: the [[BWF Super Series]]. This level two tournament series, a tour for the world's elite players,  stages twelve open tournaments around the world with 32 players (half the previous limit). The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Final held at the year end. Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable [[All England Open Badminton Championships|All-England Championships]], first held in 1900, which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/23/sports/EU_SPT_BAD_Super_Series.php|title=Badminton federation announces 12-event series |date=2006-09-23|agency=The Associated Press|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref>

Level three tournaments consist of [[BWF Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix|Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event]]. Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments. These include the regional competitions in Asia ([[Badminton Asia Championships]]) and Europe ([[European Badminton Championships]]), which produce the world's best players as well as the [[Pan Am Badminton Championships|Pan America Badminton Championships]].

The level four tournaments, known as International Challenge, International Series and Future Series, encourage participation by junior players.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalbadminton.org/archivescontent.asp?pageid={4B7714F9-45C1-4199-B1B7-5B62C57FAE1A} |title=New Tournament Structure|date=2006-07-20|publisher=IBF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929134044/http://www.internationalbadminton.org/archivescontent.asp?pageid={4B7714F9-45C1-4199-B1B7-5B62C57FAE1A} |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref>

==Comparisons with other racquet sports==   
{{Original research|section|date=May 2010}}
Badminton is frequently compared to tennis. The following is a list of uncontentious comparisons:
* In badminton a match consist of 3 games and each game is played up to 21 points.  In tennis a match consist of 6 games and each game is played up to 4 points.  If both team are tied for "game point", they must play until one team achieves a two point advantage.  However, the maximum point that a badminton game can go up to is 30 points. In tennis, if we assume both players are scoring "deuces", then there is no maximum point, as the game must continue until a player receives a two point advantage to be declared the winner. 
* In tennis, the ball may bounce once before the player hits it; in badminton, the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor.
* In tennis, the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of his service games (at advanced level & onwards); a ''break'' of service, where the server loses the game, is of major importance in a match. In badminton a server has far less advantage, and is unlikely to score an 'ace' (unreturnable serve).
* In tennis, the server is allowed two attempts to make a correct serve; in badminton, the server is allowed only one attempt.
* The tennis court is larger than the badminton court.
* Tennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets, 10–12&nbsp;ounces (approximately 284–340&nbsp;grams) versus 2–3 ounces (70–105&nbsp;grams).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tennis.about.com/od/tennisracquetsfaq/f/faqracquets43.htm|title=What is the ideal weight for a tennis racquet?|publisher=About.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |title=The contribution of technology on badminton rackets|publisher=Prospeed |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011150444/http://prospeed.com.my/choosing.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-11}}</ref> Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks, 57&nbsp;grams versus 5&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/ShefiuAzeez.shtml|title=Mass of a Tennis Ball|year=2000|last=Azeez|first=Shefiu|publisher=Hypertextbook}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/physics/jrIS/Files/McCreary.pdf|title=A Study of the Motion of a Free Falling Shuttlecock|format=PDF|last=M.

===Comparisons of speed and athletic requirements===
Statistics such as the smash speed, above, prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racket sports projectile, the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels: a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve. Badminton's claim as the fastest racquet sport might also be based on reaction time requirements, but arguably [[table tennis]] requires even faster reaction times.

While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding, such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games. No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during game play.

===Comparisons of technique===
Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially. The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton rackets allow badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players; in tennis the wrist is normally held stable, and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury. For the same reasons, badminton players can generate power from a short racket swing: for some strokes such as net kills, an elite player's swing may be less than {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}}. For strokes that require more power, a longer swing will typically be used, but the badminton racket swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing.

It is often asserted that power in badminton strokes comes mainly from the wrist. This is a misconception and may be criticised for two reasons. First, it is strictly speaking a [[category error]]: the wrist is a joint, not a muscle; the forearm muscles control its movement. Second, wrist movements are weak when compared to forearm or upper arm movements. Badminton [[biomechanics]] have not been the subject of extensive scientific study, but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation, and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home5/PG02259480/badminton_smash.pdf|title=An Analysis of the Biomechanics of Arm Movement During a Badminton Smash|last=Kim|first=Wangdo|date=2002-10-01|publisher=Nanyang Technological University}}</ref> Modern coaching resources such as the ''Badminton England Technique DVD'' reflect these ideas by emphasising forearm rotation rather than wrist movements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/text.asp?section=0001000100070007|title=Badminton Technique DVD|publisher=Badminton England}}</ref>

===Distinctive characteristics of the shuttlecock===
The shuttlecock differs greatly from the balls used in most other [[racquet sport]]s.

====Aerodynamic drag and stability====
The feathers impart substantial drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance. The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable: regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork-first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.

One consequence of the shuttlecock's drag is that it requires considerable skill to hit it the full length of the court, which is not the case for most racquet sports. The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted (''lobbed'') shuttlecock: the [[parabola]] of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises. With very high serves, the shuttlecock may even fall vertically.

====Spin====
Balls may be spun to alter their bounce (for example, topspin and backspin in tennis), and players may slice the ball (strike it with an angled racket face) to produce such spin; but, since the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce, this does not apply to badminton.

Slicing the shuttlecock so that it spins, however, does have applications, and some are particular to badminton. (See [[#Basic Strokes|Basic strokes]] for an explanation of technical terms.)
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the player's racket or body movement. This is used to deceive opponents.
* Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path (as seen from above), and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path. This can be used to create dropshots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net.
* When playing a netshot, slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a ''spinning netshot'' or ''tumbling netshot''. The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation.

Due to the way that its feathers overlap, a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry. The spin is in a counter-clockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock. This natural spin affects certain strokes: a tumbling netshot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left, rather than from left to right.<ref>The Spin Doctor, Power & Precision Magazine, July 2006</ref>
