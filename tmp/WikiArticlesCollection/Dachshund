The '''dachshund''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|d|æ|k|s|ən|d}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|d|ɑː|k|s|h|ʊ|n|t}} {{Respell|DAHKS|huunt}} or {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|d|ɑː|k|s|ən|t}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dachshund?show=0&t=1325077948 |title=Dachshund - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>) is a short-legged, long-bodied [[dog breed]] belonging to the [[hound]] family. The standard size dachshund was bred to [[Macrosmatic|scent]], [[hunting|chase]], and flush out [[badger]]s and other [[burrow]]-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund was developed to hunt smaller prey such as [[rabbit]]s. In the [[American West]] they have also been used to hunt [[prairie dogs]]. Today, they are bred for [[conformation show]]s and as family pets. Some dachshunds participate in [[earthdog trial]]s. According to the AKC, the dachshund continues to remain one of the top 10 dog breeds in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics|url=http://www.akc.org/reg/dogreg_stats.cfm|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>

==Origin of the name==
[[Image:Dachshunds.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A standard long-haired dachshund (left) and miniature smooth-haired dachshund (right)]]
The name "dachshund" is of [[German language|German]] [[word origin|origin]] and literally means "badger dog", from ''Dachs'' ("[[badger]]") and ''Hund'' ("dog"). The pronunciation varies widely in [[English language|English]]: variations of the first and second [[syllable]]s include {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|k|s|-}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|k|s|-}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|ʃ|-}} and {{IPAc-en|-|h|ʊ|n|t}}, {{IPAc-en|-|h|ʊ|n|d}}, {{IPAc-en|-|ən|d}}. Although "dachshund" is a German word, in modern German they are more commonly known by the name '''''Dackel''''' or, among hunters, '''''Teckel'''''. The German word is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈdakshʊnt|}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dachshund|publisher=Duden |url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Dachshund |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>

Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed '''wiener dog''' or '''sausage dog'''.

==Classification==
While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, there are some who consider this classification to be arguable,<ref>{{cite web|title=Dachshund Dogs & Puppies – Miniature & Standard Dachshunds |url=http://www.dogpage.us/dachshund-dogs.php |work=Dogpage.us |accessdate=2009-06-16}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> speculating that it arose from the fact that the word ''Hund'' is similar to the English word ''hound''.  Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance that are similar to that of the [[terrier]] group of dogs.<ref name="Nicholas">{{cite book | last = Nicholas | first = Anna | title = Dachshund | publisher = TFH Publications | location = Neptune City | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-86622-158-1 | page = 10}}</ref> An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from scent hounds, such as [[bloodhound]]s, pointers, [[Basset Hound]]s, or even [[Bruno Jura Hound]]s; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the [[terrier]], or "earth dog", group.<ref name="Nicholas"/> In the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (World Canine Federation), or FCI, the dachshund is actually in its own group, Group 4, which is the dachshund group.<ref>{{cite web|title= Fédération Cynologique Internationale  Group 4 "Dachshund Group" |url=http://old.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&file=group4 |work=Fédération Cynologique Internationale|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Part of the controversy is because the dachshund is the only certifiable breed of dog to hunt both above and below ground.<ref name="AKC">{{cite web|title= American Kennel Club Dachshund Breed Information |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dachshund/ |work=American Kennel Club|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref><ref name="AHR"/>

==Characteristics==

===Appearance===

A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular, with short, stubby legs. Its front paws are unusually large and paddle-shaped, for extreme digging. Long coated dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. It has skin that is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. The dachshund has a deep chest that provides increased lung capacity for stamina when hunting prey underground. Its [[snout]] is long with an increased nose area that absorbs odors.<ref name="AHR">{{cite web|title= A Brief History of the Breed |url=http://www.almosthomerescue.org/about_dach/history.htm |work=AlmostHomeRescue.org |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

There are three types of dachshund, which can  be classified by their coats: short-haired, called "smooth"; long-haired; and wire-haired.<ref name="gkpnso">{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dachshund/index.cfm |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>

====Size====
 
Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature,<ref name="gkpnso"/> and ''kaninchen'' (German for "rabbit"). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom, but is recognized by all of the clubs within the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|Fédération Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation)]] (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fédération Cynologique Internationale Official Website |url=http://www.fci.be/default.aspx |work=Fédération Cynologique Internationale |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size, frequently referred to as "tweenies," not an official classification.<ref>http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/dachshund</ref>

A full-grown standard dachshund averages {{convert|16|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|lb|abbr=on}}, while the miniature variety normally weighs less than {{convert|12|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="gkpnso"/> The kaninchen weighs {{convert|8|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|11|lb|abbr=on}}. According to kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well.<ref name="gkpnso"/> While many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, such as the American Kennel Club, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs, such as in Germany, even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight.<ref>{{cite book |title=For the Love of Dachshunds| last=Hutchinson |first=Robert  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=BrownTrout Publishers |location= |isbn=1-56313-903-0 |page=112 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=i_XAakNgDJwC&pg=PA14 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

[[H. L. Mencken]] said that "A dachshund is a half-dog high and a dog-and-a-half long,"<ref>{{cite web|title=Quote Daddy |url=http://www.quotesdaddy.com/quote/609465/Henry+Louis+Mencken/dachshund-a-half-a-dog-high-and-a-dog-and-a-half |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> although they have been referred to as "two dogs long".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dachshund Poetry |work=QuotesDaddy.com |url=http://members.tripod.com/~mcox_2/type.html |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> This characteristic has led them to be quite a recognizable breed, and they are featured in many a joke and cartoon, particularly ''[[The Far Side]]'' by [[Gary Larson]].<ref name="Larson">{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Gary | title = Wiener Dog Art: A Far Side Collection | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8362-1865-5}}</ref>

====Coat and color====
[[Image:Silver Dapple Smooth Haired Miniature Dachshund.jpg|thumb|Black and tan dapple smooth-haired miniature dachshund with one blue eye and one brown eye]]
[[File:Miniature Daschund.png|thumb|Solid black 8-week-old dachshund]]Dachshunds exhibit three coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), long hair, and wire-hair.<ref name="gkpnso"/> Wirehaired is the least commonly seen coat in the US (it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.<ref name="gkpnso"/>

Dachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns. They can be single-colored, single-colored with spots ("dappled"-called "[[Merle (coat colour in dogs)|merle]]" in other dog breeds), and single-colored with tan points plus any pattern. Dachshunds also come in [[piebald]]. The dominant color is red, the most common along with black and tan. Two-colored dogs can be black, wild boar, chocolate, fawn, with tan "points", or markings over the eyes, ears, paws, and tail, of tan or cream. A two-colored dachshund would be called by its dominant color first followed by the point color, such as "black and tan" or "chocolate and cream". Other patterns include piebald, in which a white pattern is imposed upon the base color or any other pattern, and a lighter "boar" red.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dachshund.org/Colors/breed_colors_patterns.html |title=Dachshund Colors and Patterns  |publisher=The Dachshund Magazine Online |accessdate=July 2, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070407182354/http://www.dachshund.org/Colors/breed_colors_patterns.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 7, 2007}}</ref> The reds range from coppers to deep rusts, with or without somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back, face and ear edges, lending much character and an almost burnished appearance; this is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as a "stag" or an "overlay" or "sable". True sable is a dachshund with each single hair banded with three colors: light at the base of the hair, red in the middle, black at the end. An additional striking coat marking is the brindle pattern. "Brindle" refers to dark stripes over a solid background—usually red. If a dachshund is brindled on a dark coat and has tan points, it will have brindling on the tan points only. Even one single, lone stripe of brindle is a brindle. If a dachshund has one single spot of dapple, it is a dapple.
[[Image:Wire-haired Dachshund R 01.JPG|thumb|right|Wire-haired dachshund]]
Solid black and solid chocolate dachshunds occur, and even though dogs with such coloration are often considered handsome, the colors are nonstandard, that is, the dogs are frowned upon in the conformation ring in the US and Canada. Chocolate is commonly confused with dilute red. Additionally, according to the conformation judges of the Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) the piebald pattern is nonstandard. However, the piebald dachshund can still be shown. The only disqualifying fault in Dachshunds is knuckling over. While some judges choose to dismiss a dog of color, many choose to judge them and those who are actually judging the dog will look past the cosmetic color of a dog and judge the conformation of the dog first. There were several piebald dachshunds that became AKC Champions in 2008. All things being equal between the dogs in the ring, the traditional colors which are listed in the Official AKC Standard (governed by DCA) should be visibly listed.
[[File:Dachshundincoat.jpg|thumb|left|Dachshund in coat]]
[[File:Black and Tan Dachshund - Sept 2013.jpg|thumbnail|Four month old black and tan male miniature dachshund puppy ]]
[[File:BurrowingDachshunds.JPG|thumb|left|Dachshunds burrowing in a bed]] Dogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording "double-dapple" from the standard in 2007 and now strictly use the wording "dapple" as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.

Breeders may also breed a piebald dapple brindle; and although dogs with this coloring are increasingly popular due to their unique markings, they are not considered standard and are not allowed to show.

====Eye color====
Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, or green eyes; however, kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better. They can also have eyes of two different colors; however, this is only found in dapple and double dapple dachshunds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dachshund.org/article_double_dapple.html |title=The Double Dapple |publisher=The Dachshund Magazine Online |accessdate=June 25, 2007}}</ref> Dachshunds can have a blue and a brown eye. Blue eyes, partially blue eyes, or a blue eye and a brown eye are called "wall" coloring, and are considered a non-desirable trait in kennel club standards. Dappled eyes are also possible.

[[Wall-eye]] is permissible according to DCA standards. Piebald-patterned dachshunds will never have blue in their eyes, unless the dapple pattern is present.

<blockquote>Being the owner of dachshunds, to me a book on dog discipline becomes a volume of inspired humor.  Every sentence is a riot. Some day, if I ever get a chance, I shall write a book, or warning, on the character and temperament of the dachshund and why he can't be trained and shouldn't be.

Like many dogs if left alone too frequently, some dachshunds are prone to [[Separation_anxiety_in_dogs|separation anxiety]] and may chew objects in the house to relieve stress. They rank 49th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs|Intelligence of Dogs]]'', being of average working and obedience intelligence.

Dachshunds are burrowers by nature and are likely to burrow in blankets and other items around the house, when bored or tired.

Dachshunds can be difficult to housebreak, and patience and consistency is often needed in this endeavor.<ref name=paws/><ref name=CDR/><ref>{{cite web|title=Things You Need To Know about Adopting a Dachshund! |url=http://www.dachshund-dca.org/faq.html#faq|work=Nebraska Dachshund Rescue |accessdate = 2009-11-19}}</ref><ref name=NDR>{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://www.nebraskadachshundrescue.org/facts.htm |work=Dachshund Club of America |accessdate = 2009-07-25}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}[Things You Need To Know about Adopting a Dachshund, Nebraska Dachshund Rescue]</ref>

According to the American Kennel Club's breed standards, "the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dachshund/index.cfm |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=May 14, 2007}}</ref> Their temperament and body language give the impression that they do not know or care about their relatively small size. Like many small hunting dogs, they will challenge a larger dog. Indulged dachshunds may become snappy or extremely obstinate.<ref name=paws/><ref name=CDR/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burkesbackyard.com.au/1999/archives/25/roadtests/dog_breeds/dachshunds |title=Dachshunds |publisher=Burke's Backyard with Don Burke |accessdate=May 14, 2007}}</ref>

Many dachshunds do not like unfamiliar people, and many will growl or bark at them.<ref name=Stall/><ref>{{cite web|title= Disposition and temperament|url=http://www.dachworld.com/dispositiontemperament.htm|work=Dachworld.com |accessdate = 2009-07-26}}</ref> Although the dachshund is generally an energetic dog, some are sedate. This dog's behavior is such that it is not the dog for everyone. A bored, untrained dachshund will become destructive.<ref name=Stall/> If raised improperly and not socialized at a young age, dachshunds can become aggressive or fearful.<ref name=paws/> They require a caring, loving owner who understands their need for entertainment and exercise.

Dachshunds may not be the best pets for small children. Like any dog, dachshunds need a proper introduction at a young age. Well trained Dachshunds and well behaved children usually get along fine. Otherwise, they may be aggressive and bite an unfamiliar child, especially one that moves quickly around them or teases them.<ref name=paws/><ref name=ADR/><ref name=CDR/> However, many Dachshunds are very tolerant and loyal to children within their family, but these children should be mindful of the vulnerability of the breed's back.

A 2008 [[University of Pennsylvania]] study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that dogs of smaller breeds were more likely to be "genetically predisposed towards aggressive behaviour". Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Andrew|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1032531/Why-sausage-dogs-really-just-legged-fiends.html |title=Why Sausage dogs are really just four-legged fiends |publisher=Daily Mail, UK |date=2008-07-07 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Dobson|first=Roger|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2254479/Sausage-dogs-are-the-most-aggressive-dogs.html |title=Sausage dogs are the most aggressive dogs |publisher=Daily Telegraph, UK|date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref>

The breed is known to have spinal problems, especially [[Degenerative disc disease|intervertebral disk disease]] (IVDD), due in part to an extremely long [[vertebral column|spinal column]] and short rib cage.<ref>V.

Treatment consists of combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like carprofen and meloxicam), or chronic pain medications, like [[tramadol]].

In some double dapples, there are varying degrees of vision and hearing loss, including reduced or absent eyes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parizo|first=Angie|url=http://www.starlightkennel.com/Dapple.html |title=Double Dapple Warnings|accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> Not all double dapples have problems with their eyes and/or ears, which may include degrees of hearing loss, full deafness, malformed ears, congenital eye defects, reduced or absent eyes, partial or full blindness, or varying degrees of both vision and hearing problems; but heightened problems can occur due to the genetic process in which two dapple genes cross, particularly in certain breeding lines. Dapple genes, which are dominant genes, are considered "dilution" genes, meaning whatever color the dog would have originally carried is lightened, or diluted, randomly; two dominant "dilution" genes can cancel each other out, or "cross", removing all color and producing a white recessive gene, essentially a white mutation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherlysdachshunds.com/genes.html |title=Recessive and Dominant Genes|work=Weatherly's Miniature Dachshunds| accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> When this happens genetically within the eyes or ears, this white mutation can be lethal to their development, causing hearing or vision problems.

Other dachshund health problems include hereditary [[epilepsy]],<ref name="dummies231">{{cite book|last=Adamson|first=Eve |title=Dachshunds for Dummies |publisher=For Dummies |year=2007 |edition=2nd |page=231 |isbn=0-470-22968-3}}</ref> [[granulomatous meningoencephalitis]], dental issues, [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[thyroid]] problems,<ref name="dummies231"/> various [[allergy|allergies]]<ref name="dummies232">{{cite book|last=Adamson|first=Eve |title=Dachshunds for Dummies |publisher=For Dummies |year=2007 |edition=2nd |page=232 |isbn=0-470-22968-3}}</ref> and [[atopy|atopies]], and various eye conditions including [[cataract]]s, [[glaucoma]], [[progressive retinal atrophy]],<ref name="dummies231"/> corneal ulcers, nonucerative corneal disease, [[sudden acquired retinal degeneration]], and [[cherry eye]]. Dachshunds are also 2.5 times more likely than other breeds of dogs to develop [[patent ductus arteriosus]], a congenital heart defect. Dilute color dogs (Blue, Isabella, and Cream) are very susceptible to [[Canine follicular dysplasia#Color dilution alopecia|Color Dilution Alopecia]], a skin disorder that can result in hair loss and extreme sensitivity to sun. Since the occurrence and severity of these health problems is largely hereditary, breeders are working to eliminate these.

==History==
[[Image:olddachshund.jpg|thumb|Old-style dachshund showing the longer legs.]]
[[File:Deiker Jagdbare Tiere 1093210.jpg|thumb|Illustration of dachshund baying a [[European badger]]]]
Some writers and dachshund experts<ref name="Sheilds">{{cite book|editor-last= Shields |editor-first= George O. |title= The American Book of the Dog |last= Loeffler |first= William |chapter=Dachshunds | pages= 217–239 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=14JCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA217 |publisher= Cassell and Co |location= University of California |year= 1891}}</ref> have theorized that the early roots of the dachshund go back to [[ancient Egypt]], where engravings were made featuring short-legged hunting dogs.<ref>M. Zedda, P. Manca, V. Chisu, S. Gadau, G. Lepore, A. Genovese, V. Farina (2006) "Ancient Pompeian Dogs – Morphological and Morphometric Evidence for Different Canine Populations, Anatomia, Histologia, Embryologia", ''Journal of Veterinary Medicine'' Series C 35 (5), 319-324.</ref> Recent discoveries by the [[American University in Cairo]] of [[animal mummies|mummified]] dachshund-like dogs from ancient Egyptian burial urns may lend credibility to this theory. In its modern incarnation, the dachshund is a creation of German [[Dog breeding|breeders]] and includes elements of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], and [[England|English]] hounds and [[terrier]]s. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who was particularly enamored of the breed.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dachshund in Politics |url=http://home.pacbell.net/jcreitz/Andouille_Dachshund_Page6.html |work=Andouille Dachshund History Pages|accessdate=2009-11-19}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> They were originally bred for hunting badgers by trailing scent.

The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the "'''Dachs Kriecher'''" ("badger crawler") or "'''Dachs Krieger'''" ("badger warrior"), came from books written in the early 18th century.<ref>Der vollkommene teutsche Jäger (The Complete German Hunter), Johann Friedrich von Flemming, 1719–1724, Leipzig.</ref> Prior to that, there exist references to "badger dogs" and "hole dogs", but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between {{convert|30|and|40|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and [[badger-baiting]], dachshunds were also commonly used for [[rabbit]] and [[fox]] hunting, for locating wounded [[deer]], and in packs were known to hunt game as large as [[Wild Boar|wild boar]] and as fierce as the [[wolverine]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
[[Image:Adolf Eberle Dackelfamilie.jpg|thumb|right|''Die Dackelfamilie mit Jäger und Magd'' (The Dachshund family with Hunter and maid) by [[Adolf Eberle]]]]
There are huge differences of opinion as to when dachshunds were specifically bred for their purpose of badger hunting, as the American Kennel Club states the dachshund was bred in the 15th century, while the Dachshund Club of America states that foresters bred the dogs in the 18th or 19th century.

Double-dapple dachshunds, which are prone to eye disease, blindness, or hearing problems, are generally believed to have been introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog. In the case of the ears, this is to keep grass seeds, dirt, and other matter from entering the [[ear canal]]. The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow.<ref name="AHR"/>
The smooth-haired dachshund, the oldest style, may be a cross between the [[German Shorthaired Pointer]], a [[Pinscher]], and a Bracke (a type of [[bloodhound]]), or to have been produced by crossing a short [[Bruno Jura Hound]] with a pinscher.<ref name="DCA">{{cite web|title=History and Development |url=http://www.dachshund-dca.org/faq.html#development |work=Dachshund Club of America |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Others believe it was a cross from a miniature French pointer and a pinscher; others claim that is was developed from the [[bloodhound|St. Hubert Hound]], also a bloodhound, in the 18th century,<ref name="5star">{{cite web|title=Dachshund Dog Breed Origins |url=http://www.5stardog.com/dog-breeds-dachshund.asp |work=5StarDog |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> and still others believe that they were descended from [[Basset Hound]]s, based upon their scent abilities and general appearance.<ref name="Sheilds"/>

The exact origins of the dachshund are therefore unknown. According to William Loeffler, from '' The American Book of the Dog (1891)'', in the chapter on Dachshunds: "The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed."<ref name="Sheilds"/> What can be agreed on, however, is that the short-haired dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties.

There are two theories about how the standard longhair dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth Dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced longhair offspring, and the longhair dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard longhair dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the [[German Spaniel|German Stoberhund]], and the smooth-haired dachshund.<ref name="DCA" />

The wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the [[Schnauzer]], the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier]], the [[German Wirehaired Pointer]], or perhaps the [[Scottish Terrier]].<ref name="DCA" /><ref name="Critter">{{cite web|title=Dachshund Breed Resources |url=http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |work=FurryCritterNetwork |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

==Symbol of Germany==
[[File:Waldi, Olympic logo 1972.png|thumb|[[Waldi]], the mascot of the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Summer Olympic Games]]]]

Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany. [[Political cartoon]]ists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Political Cartoon for War Bonds |url=http://dachshundlove.blogspot.com/search/label/history |publisher=The New York Times |date=April 5, 1943 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> During [[World War I]] the dachshunds' popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association and there are even anecdotes such as a Dachshund being stoned to death on the high street of [[Berkhamsted]], [[England]] at this time because of its association with the enemy {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. As a result they were often called "liberty hounds" by their owners similar to "liberty cabbage" becoming a term for sauerkraut.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Sort of Life |last=Green |first=Graham |pages=49–49 |url=http://richardshepherd.net/2006/ClaudiasSunangel.html}}</ref> The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during [[World War II]], though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] were known for keeping dachshunds.

Due to the association of the breed with Germany, the dachshund was chosen to be the first official [[mascot]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, with the name [[Waldi]].<ref name="higher">{{cite web |url=http://www.swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php |title=Meet the Mascots: Waldi (Munich 1972) |author=Whelliston, Kyle |date=2008-07-08 |work= |publisher=Swifter Higher |accessdate=2010-01-07}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>

==Sports==
[[Image:Dachshund 8574.jpg|thumb|A wire-haired dachshund running]]
Some people train and enter their dachshund to compete in [[dachshund racing|dachshund races]], such as the [[Wiener Nationals]]. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees, including races in [[Buda, Texas]]; [[Davis, California]]; [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; [[Los Alamitos, California]]; [[Findlay, Ohio]]; [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]; [[Kansas City, Kansas]]; [[Palo Alto, California]]; and [[Shakopee, Minnesota]]. There is also an annual dachshund run in [[Kennywood]], located in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], called the Wiener 100, and in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] called the Dachshund Dash.

Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes "wiener racing", as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is [[earthdog trial]]s, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate an artificial bait or live but caged and protected rats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Earthdog Den Trials |publisher=Canada's Guide to Dogs |url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/clubs/earthdog.htm |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>

==''Dackel'' versus ''Teckel''==
In Germany, dachshunds are widely called ''Dackel'' (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as ''Teckel''. There are [[kennel]]s which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called ''jagdliche Leistungszucht'' ("hunting performance breed"), as opposed to breeding family dogs. Therefore it is sometimes believed that ''Teckel'' is either a name for the hunting breed or a mark for passing the test for a trained hunting dog (called "VGP", "Verband-Gebrauchsprüfung") in Germany. It is not.<ref name="dtk">[http://www.dtk1888.de/fragen.html FAQ of the German Teckelclub on the naming issue] (in German)</ref>
