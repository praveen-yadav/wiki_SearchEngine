[[Image:Sedition Act (1798).png|thumb|250px|upright|Text of the Sedition Act]]

The '''Alien and Sedition Acts''' were four bills that were passed by the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] in the [[5th United States Congress]] and signed into law by President [[John Adams]] in 1798 in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and during an undeclared naval war with France, later known as the [[Quasi-War]]. The [[Naturalization Act of 1798|Naturalization Act]] was repealed in 1802. The acts increased the residency requirement for American citizenship from five to fourteen years, and allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens which were considered "dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States". They also restricted speech which was critical of the federal government. Authored by the Federalists, the laws were designed under the guise of national security but were regarded as an attempt to silence and weaken the Democratic-Republican Party. The acts were met with wide spread disapproval among Democrat-Republicans and ultimately helped their victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]] when [[Thomas Jefferson]] became President. The Sedition Act and the Alien Friends Act were allowed to expire in 1800 and 1801, respectively. The Alien Enemies Act remains in effect as 50 USC Sections 21–24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-3|title=Alien Enemies|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>

==History==

Opposition to Federalists among [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] reached new heights at this time since the Democratic-Republicans had supported France. Some appeared to desire an event similar to the French Revolution to come to the United States to overthrow the government.<ref>''[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html Letter to William Smith], November 13, 1787''</ref> When Democratic-Republicans in some states refused to enforce federal laws, such as the [[Whiskey tax]], and threatened to rebel, Federalists threatened to send the army to force them to capitulate.<ref name="Knott p48">Knott. "Alexander Hamilton and the Persistence of Myth". p48</ref> As the unrest sweeping Europe was bleeding over into the United States, calls for secession reached unparalleled heights, and the fledgling nation seemed ready to rip itself apart.<ref name="Knott p48"/> Some of this was seen by Federalists as having been caused by French and French-sympathizing immigrants.<ref name="Knott p48"/> The acts were thus meant to guard against this perceived threat of anarchy. 

Democratic-Republicans denounced them, though they did use them after the 1800 election against Federalists.<ref name="Chernow, Ron 2004. p668">Chernow, Ron. "Alexander Hamilton". 2004. p668. Penguin Press.</ref> They became a major political issue in the elections of 1798 and 1800. They were very controversial in their own day, as they remain to the present day. Opposition to them resulted in the highly controversial [[Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions]], authored by [[James Madison]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].

*[[James Thomson Callender]], a Scottish citizen, had been expelled from Great Britain for his political writings. Living first in Philadelphia, then seeking refuge close in Virginia, he wrote a book entitled ''The Prospect Before Us'' (read and approved by Vice President Jefferson before publication) in which he called the Adams administration a "continual tempest of malignant passions" and the President a "repulsive pedant, a gross hypocrite and an unprincipled oppressor". Callender, already residing in Virginia and writing for the ''Richmond Examiner'', was indicted under the Sedition Act. Callender was convicted, fined $200 and sentenced to nine months in jail.<ref>Miller, John C. ''Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts'' (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) pp. 211-220.</ref> 

*[[Matthew Lyon]], born in Ireland, was a Democratic-Republican congressman from Vermont. He was indicted under the Sedition Act for an essay he had written in the ''Vermont Journal'' accusing the administration of "ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice". While awaiting trial, Lyon commenced publication of ''Lyon's Republican Magazine'', subtitled "The Scourge of Aristocracy". At trial, he was fined $1,000 and sentenced to four months in prison. After his release, he returned to Congress.<ref>{{cite book|author=Foner, Eric|title=Give Me Liberty!|pages=282–283|year=2008|publisher=W.W.

The Alien Act and the Sedition Act were different acts.

==Effect of the acts==
The Democratic-Republicans used the Alien and Sedition Acts as an important issue in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 election]]. Thomas Jefferson, upon assuming the Presidency, pardoned those still serving sentences under the Sedition Act,<ref>Miller, John C. Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) p. 231.</ref> though he also used the acts to prosecute several of his own critics before the acts expired.<ref name="Chernow, Ron 2004. p668"/><ref>Mott, Frank L., ''Jefferson and the Press'' (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press 1943), p. 37.</ref> It has been said that the Alien Acts were aimed at [[Albert Gallatin]]; and the Sedition Act aimed at Benjamin Bache's ''Aurora''.<ref>[http://www.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods33.html What States Rights Really Mean by Thomas E. Woods, Jr. LewRockwell.com.]</ref><ref>[http://www.historictrials.freeservers.com/seditionacts/info1.htm The Alien & Sedition Act Trials<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While government authorities prepared lists of aliens for deportation, many aliens fled the country during the debate over the Alien and Sedition Acts, and Adams never signed a deportation order.<ref>Miller, John C. ''Crisis in Freedom: The Alien and Sedition Acts'' (New York: Little Brown and Company 1951) p. 187-193.</ref> 

The Alien and Sedition Acts were, however, never appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], whose right of [[Judicial review (law)|judicial review]] was not established until ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' in 1803. Subsequent mentions in Supreme Court opinions beginning in the mid-20th century have assumed that the Sedition Act would today be found unconstitutional.<ref>In the seminal free speech case of ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'', the Court declared, "Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history." 376 U.S. 254, 276 (1964). In a [[concurring opinion]] in ''Watts v. United States'', which involved an alleged threat against President [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[William O. Douglas]] noted, "The Alien and Sedition Laws constituted one of our sorriest chapters; and I had thought we had done with them forever ... Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution."</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=394&invol=705}}</ref> 

Jefferson and [[James Madison]] also secretly drafted the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] denouncing the federal legislation, though many other state legislatures strongly opposed these resolutions.<ref>[[s:Portal:Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions|Portal:Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]]</ref><ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Though the resolutions followed the "[[interposition]]" approach of [[James Madison]], Jefferson advocated [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]] and at one point drafted a threat for Kentucky to [[Secession in the United States|secede]].<ref>Jefferson's draft said: "where powers are assumed [by the federal government] which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non fœderis) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits." See [http://www.constitution.org/cons/kent1798.htm Jefferson's draft of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798].</ref> Jefferson's biographer [[Dumas Malone]] argued that this might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time.<ref>Chernow, Ron. "Alexander Hamilton". 2004. p586. Penguin Press.</ref>  In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold," the Alien and Sedition Acts would "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood." Historian Ron Chernow says of this "he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president." Jefferson "thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution."<ref name="Chernow, Ron 2004. p587">Chernow, Ron. "Alexander Hamilton". 2004. p587. Penguin Press.</ref> Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves.<ref name="Chernow, Ron 2004. p587"/>  Historian [[Garry Wills]] argued "Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure"<ref>Wills, Gary. "James Madison". p49</ref> The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was "deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion".<ref name="Chernow, Ron 2004. p587"/> George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", they would "dissolve the union or produce coercion".<ref name="Chernow, Ron 2004. p587"/>  The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond.<ref name="Knott p48"/> Future president [[James Garfield]], at the close of the Civil War, said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution "contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits".<ref name="Knott p48"/>
