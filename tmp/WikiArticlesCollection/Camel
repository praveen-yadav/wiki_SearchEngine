A '''camel''' is an [[even-toed ungulate]] within the genus '''''Camelus''''', bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. The two surviving species of camel are the [[dromedary]], or one-humped camel (C. dromedarius), which inhabits the [[Middle East]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]; and the [[Bactrian camel|bactrian]], or two-humped camel (C. bactrianus), which inhabits [[Central Asia]]. Both species have been domesticated; they provide [[camel milk|milk]], meat, [[camel hair|hair]] for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are [[working animal]]s with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

The term "camel" is derived via Latin and Greek (''camelus'' and ''kamēlos'' respectively) from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''gāmāl'', which has later been transferred to a verb root meaning to bear or carry (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''jamala'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The New Oxford American Dictionary|edition=2nd|title=camel|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | last = Herper | first = Douglas | title = camel | work = Online Etymology Dictionary | accessdate = 28 November 2012| url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=camel}}</ref> The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] meaning of the word ''gāmāl'' is derived from the verb root g.m.l, meaning (1) stopping, weaning, going without; or (2) repaying in kind. This refers to its ability to go without food or water, as well as the increased ability of service the animal provides when being properly cared for.

"Camel" is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family [[Camelid]]ae: the two true camels: the dromedary and bactrian, and the four [[South America]]n camelids: the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] are called "New World camels", while the [[guanaco]] and [[vicuña]] are called "South American camels".<ref name=wordnik>{{cite encyclopedia | publisher = wordnik | title = llama | encyclopedia = Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | url = http://www.wordnik.com/words/llama }}</ref><ref name=bornstein10>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1751-0147-52-S1-S17 | issn = 1751-0147 | volume = 52 | issue = Suppl 1 | page = S17 | last = Bornstein | first = Set | title = Important ectoparasites of Alpaca (Vicugna pacos) | journal = Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.actavetscand.com/content/52/S1/S17 }}</ref>

===Ecological and behavioral adaptations===
Camels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly believed. The humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue: concentrating [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies, helping camels survive in hot climates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Jocelyn |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jan/05-20-things-you-didnt-know-about-fat |title=20 Things You Didn't Know About...

Camels are able to withstand changes in [[body temperature]] and water consumption that would kill most other animals.

Camels' [[immune system]] differs from those of other mammals. Normally, the Y-shaped [[antibody]] molecules consist of two heavy (or long) chains along the length of the Y, and two light (or short) chains at each tip of the Y. Camels, in addition to these, also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains, a trait that makes them smaller and more durable. These "heavy-chain-only" antibodies, discovered in 1993, are thought to have developed 50&nbsp;million years ago, after camelids split from ruminants and pigs.<!--according to biochemist Serge Muyldermans--><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koenig |first1=R. |title=VETERINARY MEDICINE: 'Camelized' Antibodies Make Waves |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5855 |page=1373 |year=2007 |pmid=18048665 |doi=10.1126/science.318.5855.1373}}</ref>

By at least 1200 BC, the first camel saddles had appeared, and [[Bactrian camels]] could be ridden. The first saddle was positioned to the back of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500–100 BC, Bactrian camels attained military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC, the military Arabian saddle appeared, which improved the saddle design again slightly.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Fagan|editor-first=Brian M|editor-link = Brian M.

When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders to slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy, but to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized and offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the enemy's horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel, and cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By this stratagem he hoped to make Croesus's horse useless to him, the horse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The two armies then joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses, seeing and smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off; and so it came to pass that all Croesus's hopes withered away.}}</ref><ref name=historygroup-nz>{{cite web | publisher = History Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage | title = Cameliers and camels at war | work = New Zealand History online | accessdate = 5 December 2012 | date = 30 August 2009 | url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/camel-corps }}</ref>

===Religion===

====Islam====
Camel meat is [[halal]] for [[Islam|Muslims]]. However, according to some [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic schools of thought]], a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it. Consequently, these schools hold that Muslims must perform ''[[wudhu]]'' (ablution) before the next time they [[Salat|pray]] after eating camel meat.<ref name="purification">{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/001.sat.html#001.0184|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716145540/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/001.sat.html#001.0184|archivedate=16 July 2011|series=Partial Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 1|work=Purification (Kitab Al-Taharah)|title=Book 1, Number 0184|publisher= Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|accessdate=25 December|quote=Narrated Al-Bara' ibn Azib: The Messenger of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) was asked about performing ablution after eating the flesh of the camel. He replied: Perform ablution, after eating it. He was asked about performing ablution after eating meat. He replied: Do not perform ablution after eating it. He was asked about saying prayer in places where the camels lie down. He replied: Do not offer prayer in places where the camels lie down. These are the places of Satan. He was asked about saying prayer in the sheepfolds. He replied: You may offer prayer in such places; these are the places of blessing.}}</ref>

Also, some Islamic schools of thought consider it ''[[haraam]]'' for a Muslim to perform ''[[salat]]'' in places where camels lie, as it is said to be a dwelling place of ''[[shaytan]]''.<ref name="purification"/>

A small population of introduced camels, dromedaries and Bactrians, wandered through [[Southwest United States]] after having been imported in the 1800s as part of the [[U.S. Camel Corps]] experiment. When the project ended, they were used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released. Twenty-five U.S. camels were bought and imported to Canada during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref name=mantz06/>
