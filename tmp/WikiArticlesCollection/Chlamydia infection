'''Chlamydia infection''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], χλαμύδα meaning "cloak") is a common [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] in humans caused by the bacterium ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''. The term ''Chlamydia infection'' can also refer to infection caused by any [[species]] belonging to the bacterial [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Chlamydiaceae]]''. ''C. trachomatis'' is found only in humans.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chlamydiae.com/docs/Chlamydiales/diagram/taxondiag.htm|title= www.chlamydiae.com (professional) - Taxonomy diagram|accessdate=2007-10-27 |work=}}</ref> Chlamydia is a major infectious cause of human [[genital]] and [[eye disease]].
Chlamydia infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide; it is estimated that about 1 million individuals in the [[United States]] are infected with chlamydia.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/Chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm Chlamydia fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]</ref>

''C. trachomatis'' is naturally found living only inside human cells. Chlamydia can be transmitted during [[vaginal intercourse|vaginal]], [[anal sex|anal]], or [[oral sex]], and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal [[childbirth]]. Between half and three-quarters of all women who have a chlamydia infection of the cervix ([[cervicitis]]) have no symptoms and do not know that they are infected. In men, infection of the urethra ([[urethritis]]) is usually symptomatic, causing a white discharge from the penis with or without pain on urinating ([[dysuria]]). Occasionally, the condition spreads to the upper genital tract in women (causing [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]) or to the [[epididymis]] in men (causing [[epididymitis]]). Chlamydia infection can be effectively cured with antibiotics. If left untreated, chlamydial infections can cause serious reproductive and other health problems with both short-term and long-term consequences.

Chlamydia [[conjunctivitis]] or [[trachoma]] is a common cause of [[blindness]] worldwide. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that it accounted for 15% of blindness cases in 1995, but only 3.6% in 2002.<ref name="WHO1995">{{cite journal |author=Thylefors B, Négrel AD, Pararajasegaram R, Dadzie KY |title=Global data on blindness |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=115–21 |year=1995 |pmid=7704921 |doi= |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/bulletin/1995/Vol73-No1/bulletin_1995_73(1)_115-121.pdf |pmc=2486591}}</ref><ref name="WHO2002">{{cite journal |author=Resnikoff S, Pascolini D, Etya'ale D ''et al.'' |title=Global data on visual impairment in the year 2002 |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=82 |issue=11 |pages=844–851 |year=2004 |pmid=15640920 |doi= |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/11/en/844.pdf |pmc=2623053}}</ref><ref name="NatRevMicrobiol">{{cite journal |author=Belland R, Ojcius D, Byrne G |title=Chlamydia |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=530–1 |year=2004 |pmid=15248311 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro931}}</ref>

[[Image:SOA-Chlamydia-trachomatis-female.jpg|thumb|Chlamydial [[cervicitis]] in a female patient characterized by [[mucopurulent]] [[cervix|cervical]] discharge, [[erythema]], and [[inflammation]].]]
[[Image:SOA-Chlamydia-trachomatis-male.jpg|thumb|Male patients may develop a white, cloudy or watery discharge (shown) from the tip of the [[penis]].]]

====Women====
Chlamydial infection of the neck of the womb ([[cervicitis]]) is a sexually transmitted infection which is [[asymptomatic]] for about 50-70% of women infected with the disease. The infection can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Of those who have an asymptomatic infection that is not detected by their doctor, approximately half will develop [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID), a generic term for infection of the [[uterus]], [[fallopian tubes]], and/or [[ovaries]]. PID can cause scarring inside the [[reproductive organ]]s, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic [[pelvis|pelvic]] pain, difficulty becoming [[pregnancy|pregnant]], [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic (tubal) pregnancy]], and other dangerous complications of pregnancy.

Chlamydia is known as the "Silent Epidemic" because in women, it may not cause any [[symptom]]s in 70–80% of cases,<ref name="NHS Chlamydia page">[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Chlamydia/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Chlamydia page]</ref> and can linger for months or years before being discovered. Symptoms that may occur include unusual [[vagina]]l bleeding or discharge, pain in the abdomen, painful [[sexual intercourse]] ([[dyspareunia]]), [[fever]], [[Dysuria|painful urination]] or the urge to urinate more frequently than usual ([[urinary urgency]]).

====Men====
In men, chlamydia shows symptoms of infectious [[urethritis]] ([[inflammation]] of the [[urethra]]) in about 50% of cases.<ref name="NHS Chlamydia page"/> Symptoms that may occur include: a painful or burning sensation when urinating, an unusual discharge from the [[penis]], swollen or tender [[testicle]]s, or fever. Discharge, or the purulent exudate, is generally less viscous and lighter in color than for [[gonorrhea]]. If left untreated, it is possible for chlamydia in men to spread to the testicles causing [[epididymitis]], which in rare cases can cause [[infertility|sterility]] if not treated within 6 to 8 weeks. Chlamydia is also a potential cause of [[prostatitis]] in men, although the exact relevance in prostatitis is difficult to ascertain due to possible contamination from urethritis.<ref name="urology">{{cite journal |author=Wagenlehner FM, Naber KG, Weidner W |title=Chlamydial infections and prostatitis in men |journal=BJU Int. |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=687–90 |year=2006 |pmid=16536754 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06007.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1464-4096&date=2006&volume=97&issue=4&spage=687}}</ref>

===Eye disease===
{{Main|Trachoma}}
[[Image:SOA-conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|Conjunctivitis due to chlamydia.]]
Chlamydia conjunctivitis or trachoma was once the most important cause of blindness worldwide, but its role diminished from 15% of blindness cases by trachoma in 1995 to 3.6% in 2002.<ref name="WHO1995"/><ref name="WHO2002"/> The infection can be spread from eye to eye by fingers, shared towels or cloths, coughing and sneezing and eye-seeking flies.<ref name="LancetTrachoma">{{cite journal |author=Mabey DC, Solomon AW, Foster A |title=Trachoma |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9379 |pages=223–9 |year=2003 |pmid=12885486 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13914-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)13914-1}}</ref> Newborns can also develop chlamydia eye infection through [[childbirth]] (see below).

===Rheumatological conditions===
Chlamydia may also cause [[reactive arthritis|reactive arthritis (reiter's syndrome)]] - the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis and urethritis (inflammation of the urethra) - especially in young men. About 15,000 men develop reactive arthritis due to chlamydia infection each year in the U.S., and about 5,000 are permanently affected by it. It can occur in both sexes, though is more common in men.

===Perinatal infections===
As many as half of all [[infant]]s born to mothers with chlamydia will be born with the disease. Chlamydia can affect infants by causing spontaneous abortion; [[premature birth]]; [[conjunctivitis]], which may lead to [[blindness]]; and [[pneumonia]]. Conjunctivitis due to chlamydia typically occurs one week after birth (compared with chemical causes (within hours) or gonorrhea (2–5 days)).

===Other conditions===
Chlamydia trachomatis is also the cause of [[lymphogranuloma venereum]], an infection of the [[lymph nodes]] and [[lymphatics]]. It usually presents with [[genital ulcer]]ation and [[Lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph nodes]] in the [[groin]], but it may also manifest as [[proctitis]] (inflammation of the [[rectum]]), [[fever]] or swollen lymph nodes in other regions of the body.<ref name="proctitis">{{cite journal |author=Williams D, Churchill D |title=Ulcerative proctitis in men who have sex with men: an emerging outbreak |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7533 |pages=99–100 |year=2006 |pmid=16410585 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7533.99 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16410585 |pmc=1326936}}</ref>

==Transmission==
Chlamydia can be transmitted during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Chlamydia can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal childbirth.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm</ref>

== Pathophysiology ==
''Chlamydiae'' have the ability to establish long-term associations with host cells. When an infected host cell is starved for various nutrients such as [[amino acid]]s (for example, [[tryptophan]]),<ref name="pmid17724071">{{cite journal |author=Leonhardt RM, Lee SJ, Kavathas PB, Cresswell P |title=Severe Tryptophan Starvation Blocks Onset of Conventional Persistence and Reduces Reactivation of Chlamydia trachomatis |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=5105–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17724071 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00668-07 |pmc=2168275}}</ref> [[iron]], or [[vitamin]]s, this has a negative consequence for ''Chlamydiae'' since the organism is dependent on the host cell for these nutrients. Long-term cohort studies indicate that approximately 50% of those infected clear within a year, 80% within two years, and 90% within three years.<ref name=Fairley2007>{{cite journal | last1 = Fairley et al. | year = 2007 | title = "Doctor, How Long Has My Chlamydia Been There?" Answer:"... Years" | journal = Sexually Transmitted Diseases | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 727–8 | doi = 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e31812dfb6e | url = http://www.stdjournal.com/pt/re/std/fulltext.00007435-200709000-00018.htm | pmid = 17717486 | first1 = CK | last2 = Gurrin | first2 = L | last3 = Walker | first3 = J | last4 = Hocking | first4 = JS}}</ref>

The starved chlamydiae enter a persistent growth state wherein they stop cell division and become morphologically aberrant by increasing in size.<ref name="pmid16338585">{{cite journal |author=Mpiga P, Ravaoarinoro M |title=Chlamydia trachomatis persistence: an update |journal=Microbiol. Res. |volume=161 |issue=1 |pages=9–19 |year=2006 |pmid=16338585 |doi=10.1016/j.micres.2005.04.004}}</ref> Persistent organisms remain viable as they are capable of returning to a normal growth state once conditions in the host cell improve.

There is much debate as to whether persistence has ''[[in vivo]]'' relevance. Many believe that persistent chlamydiae are the cause of chronic chlamydial diseases. Some antibiotics such as β-lactams can also induce a persistent-like growth state, which can contribute to the chronicity of chlamydial diseases.

==Screening==
For sexually active women who are not pregnant, screening is recommended in those under 25 and others at risk of infection.<ref name="AmFamPhys">Meyers D, Wolff T, Gregory K. ''et al.'' [http://www.aafp.org/afp/20080315/819.html USPSTF Recommendations for STI Screening]" ''Am Fam Physician'' 2008;77(6) 819-824.</ref> Risk factors include a history of chlamydial or other sexually transmitted infection, new or multiple sexual partners, and inconsistent [[condom]] use.<ref name="USPSTF">{{cite journal |author=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force |title=Screening for chlamydial infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement |journal=Ann Intern Med |volume=147 |issue=2 |pages=128–34 |year=2007 |pmid=17576996 |doi= |url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf07/chlamydia/chlamydiars.htm}}</ref> For pregnant women, guidelines vary: screening women with age or other risk factors is recommended by the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) (which recommends screening women under 25) and the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (which recommends screening women aged 25 or younger). The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends screening all at risk, while the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend universal screening of pregnant women.<ref name="AmFamPhys"/> The USPSTF acknowledges that in some communities there may be other risk factors for infection, such as ethnicity.<ref name="AmFamPhys"/> Evidence-based recommendations for screening initiation, intervals and termination are currently not possible.<ref name="AmFamPhys"/> There is no universal agreement on screening men for chlamydia.{{Why?|date=December 2010}}

In England and Wales the NHS aims to

#Prevent and control chlamydia infection through early detection and treatment of asymptomatic infection;
#Reduce onward transmission to sexual partners;
#Prevent the consequences of untreated infection;
#Test at least 25 percent of the sexually active under 25 population annually.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chlamydiascreening.nhs.uk/ps/data/data_tables.html|title=National Chlamydia Screening Programme Data tables|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:ChlamydiaTrachomatisEinschlusskörperchen.jpg|thumb|''Chlamydia trachomatis'' inclusion bodies (brown) in a McCoy cell culture.]]
The diagnosis of genital chlamydial infections evolved rapidly from the 1990s through 2006. [[Nucleic acid amplification test]]s (NAAT), such as [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and the DNA [[strand displacement amplification]] (SDA) now are the mainstays. NAAT for chlamydia may be performed on swab specimens [[sampling (medicine)|sampled]] from the cervix (women) or urethra (men), on self-collected vaginal swabs, or on voided urine.<ref>Gaydos CA et al (2004). Comparison of three nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens.  ''J Clin Microbio'' '''42'''(7):3041-3045. {{doi|10.1128/JCM.42.7.3041-3045.2004}}</ref> NAAT has been estimated to have a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of approximately 90% and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of approximately 99%, regardless of sampling from a cervical swab or by urine specimen.<ref name=Haugland2010>{{cite doi|10.1186/1472-6874-10-9}}</ref> In women seeking an STI clinic and a urine test is [[negative test|negative]], a subsequent cervical swab has been estimated to be positive in approximately 2% of the time.<ref name=Haugland2010/>

At present, the NAATs have regulatory approval only for testing urogenital specimens, although rapidly evolving research indicates that they may give reliable results on rectal specimens.

Because of improved test accuracy, ease of specimen management, convenience in specimen management, and ease of screening sexually active men and women, the NAATs have largely replaced culture, the historic [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for chlamydia diagnosis, and the non-amplified probe tests. The latter test is relatively insensitive, successfully detecting only 60–80% of infections in asymptomatic women, and often giving falsely positive results. Culture remains useful in selected circumstances and is currently the only assay approved for testing non-genital specimens.

==Treatment==
''C. trachomatis'' infection can be effectively cured with [[antibiotic]]s once it is detected. Current guidelines recommend [[azithromycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[erythromycin]], or [[ofloxacin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=David N. Gilbert ...

An option for treating partners of patients ([[index case]]s) diagnosed with chlamydia or [[gonorrhea]] is ''[[patient-delivered partner therapy]]'' (PDT or PDPT), which is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner.<ref name=EPTFinalReport2006>[http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf Expedited Partner Therapy in the Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (2 February 2006)] U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE.

Globally, as of 2010, sexually transmitted chlamydia affects approximately 215&nbsp;million people (3.1% of the population).<ref name=LancetEpi2012/> It is more common in women (3.8%) than men (2.5%).<ref name=LancetEpi2012>{{cite journal|last=Vos|first=T|title=Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2163–96|pmid=23245607|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61729-2}}</ref> In that year it resulted in about 1,200 deaths down from 1,500 in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.|journal=Lancet|date=2012 Dec 15|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095-128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0}}</ref>

Chlamydia causes more than 250,000 cases of epididymitis in the U.S. each year. Chlamydia causes 250,000 to 500,000 cases of PID every year in the United States. Women infected with chlamydia are up to five times more likely to become infected with HIV, if exposed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm#complications |title=STD Facts - Chlamydia |accessdate=2007-10-26 |format= |work=}}</ref>

== Evolution ==
Recent [[phylogenetic]] studies have revealed that ''Chlamydia'' likely shares a [[common ancestor]] with [[cyanobacteria]], the group containing the [[endosymbiont]] ancestor to the [[chloroplasts]] of modern [[plants]], hence, ''Chlamydia'' retains unusual plant-like traits, both [[genetics|genetically]] and [[physiology|physiologically]]. In particular, the [[enzyme]] [[L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase]], which is related to [[lysine]] production in plants, is also linked with the construction of chlamydia's [[cell wall]]. The genetic encoding for the enzymes is remarkably similar in plants, cyanobacteria, and ''Chlamydia'', demonstrating a close common ancestry.<ref name="pmid17093042">{{cite journal |author=McCoy AJ, Adams NE, Hudson AO, Gilvarg C, Leustek T, Maurelli AT |title=L,L-diaminopimelate aminotransferase, a trans-kingdom enzyme shared by Chlamydia and plants for synthesis of diaminopimelate/lysine |journal=Proc.
