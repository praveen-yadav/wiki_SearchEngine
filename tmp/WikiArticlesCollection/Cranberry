'''Cranberries''' are a group of [[evergreen]] [[dwarf shrub]]s or trailing vines in the [[subgenus]] '''''Oxycoccus''''' of the genus ''[[Vaccinium]]''. In some methods of classification, ''Oxycoccus'' is regarded as a [[genus]] in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymf.bbg.org/profile_species_tech.asp?id=412|publisher=Brooklyn Botanic Garden|title=''Vaccinium oxycoccos'': Small Cranberry, Technical Page|author=Steven Clemants}}</ref> They can be found in [[acid]]ic [[bog]]s throughout the cooler regions of the [[northern hemisphere]].

Cranberries are low, creeping shrubs or vines up to {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} long and {{Convert|5|to|20|cm|0}} in height;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cranberryinstitute.org/about_cranberry.htm |title=About Cranberries |publisher=Cranberry Institute |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref> they have slender, wiry stems that are not thickly woody and have small [[evergreen]] leaves. The [[flower]]s are dark pink, with very distinct ''reflexed'' [[petal]]s, leaving the [[Gynoecium|style]] and [[stamen]]s fully exposed and pointing forward. They are pollinated by [[bee]]s. The fruit is a [[berry]] that is larger than the leaves of the plant; it is initially white, but turns a deep red when fully ripe. It is edible, with an acidic taste that can overwhelm its sweetness.

Cranberries are a major commercial crop in certain [[United States|American]] states and [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces (see [[Cranberry#Cultivation|cultivation]] and [[Cranberry#Food uses|uses]] below). Most cranberries are processed into products such as [[cranberry juice|juice]], sauce, jam, and sweetened [[dried cranberries]], with the remainder sold fresh to consumers. [[Cranberry sauce]] is regarded as an indispensable part of traditional American and Canadian [[Thanksgiving]] menus and some [[Europe]]an winter festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/nov/19/give-thanks-for-cranberries-grown-with-a-taste|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2009-11-20|title=Garden Tips: Give thanks for cranberries, grown with a taste of Florida|author=Carol Cloud Bailey|publisher=Scripps Interactive Newspapers Group|work=TCPalm.com}}</ref>

Since the early 21st century within the global [[functional food]] industry, raw cranberries have been marketed as a "[[superfruit]]" due to their [[nutrient]] content and [[antioxidant]] qualities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cranberries: How Ocean Spray made them the world’s most successful superfruit|url=http://www.new-nutrition.com/report/showReport/21|publisher=New Nutrition Business|accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hortresearch.co.nz/index/news/493 |title=Newsroom – 'Superfruits' the future of health |publisher=HortResearch |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>{{dead link|date=October 2011}}

== Species and description ==
[[File:Cranberrymap.jpg|thumb|250px|Approximate ranges of the cranberries in sect. ''Oxycoccus'': Red: Common Cranberry. Orange: Small Cranberry. Green: American Cranberry.]]

There are three to four species of cranberry, classified in two sections:
;Subgenus ''Oxycoccus'', sect. ''Oxycoccus''
*'''''Vaccinium oxycoccos''''' or ''Oxycoccus palustris'' ('''Common Cranberry''' or '''Northern Cranberry''') is widespread throughout the cool temperate northern hemisphere, including northern [[Europe]], northern [[Asia]] and northern [[North America]]. It has small 5–10&nbsp;mm leaves. The flowers are dark pink, with a purple central spike, produced on finely hairy stems. The fruit is a small pale pink [[berry]], with a refreshing sharp acidic flavour.
*'''''Vaccinium microcarpum''''' or ''Oxycoccus microcarpus'' ('''Small Cranberry''') occurs in northern [[North America]],<ref name="borealforest.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.borealforest.org/shrubs/shrub29.htm|publisher=Lakehead University Faculty of Natural Resources Management|title=borealforest.org}}</ref> northern Europe and northern Asia, and differs from ''V. oxycoccos'' in the leaves being more triangular, and the flower stems hairless. Some botanists include it within ''V. oxycoccos''.
*'''''Vaccinium macrocarpon''''' or ''Oxycoccus macrocarpus'' ('''Large cranberry''', '''American Cranberry''', '''Bearberry''') native to northern [[North America]] across [[Canada]], and eastern [[United States]], south to [[North Carolina]] at high altitudes). It differs from ''V. oxycoccos'' in the leaves being larger, 10–20&nbsp;mm long, and in its slightly apple-like taste.
;Subgenus ''Oxycoccus'', sect. ''Oxycoccoides''
*'''''Vaccinium erythrocarpum''''' or ''Oxycoccus erythrocarpus'' ([[Southern Mountain Cranberry]]) native to southeastern [[North America]] at high altitudes in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and also in eastern [[Asia]].
[[File:Vaccinum oxycoccos 120604.jpg|left|thumb|''Vaccinium oxycoccos'' flowers]]
Cranberries are related to [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], and [[huckleberry|huckleberries]], all in ''Vaccinium'' subgenus ''Vaccinium''. These differ in having stouter, woodier stems forming taller shrubs, and in the bell-shaped flowers, the petals not being reflexed.

Some plants of the completely unrelated genus ''[[Viburnum]]'' are sometimes inaccurately called "highbush cranberries" (''[[Viburnum trilobum]]'').

Cranberries are susceptible to false blossom, a harmful but controllable [[phytoplasma]] disease common in the eastern production areas of Massachusetts and New Jersey.

== Etymology and history ==
[[File:Jonathan eastman johnson cranberry harvest.jpg|thumb|''The Cranberry Harvest on the Island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]]'', [[Eastman Johnson]], 1880.]]
The name cranberry derives from "craneberry", first named by early European settlers in America who felt the expanding flower, stem, calyx, and petals resembled the neck, head, and bill of a [[crane (bird)|crane]]. Another name used in northeastern Canada is '''mossberry'''. The traditional English name for ''Vaccinium oxycoccos'', '''[[:ang:Fenberȝe|fenberry]]''', originated from plants found growing in [[fen]] (marsh) lands. In 17th century New England cranberries were sometimes called "bearberries" as bears were often seen feeding on them.
[[File:Annual Crops of Cranberries, 1907 to 1935, American Cranberry Exchange.png|thumb|Annual U.S. Crops of Cranberries, 1907 to 1935]]
In [[North America]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were the first to use cranberries as food. Native Americans used cranberries in a variety of foods, especially for [[pemmican]], wound medicine and dye. Calling the red berries '''Sassamanash''', [[Algonquian peoples]] may have introduced cranberries to starving English settlers in [[Massachusetts]] who incorporated the berries into traditional [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] feasts. [[American Revolutionary War]] veteran [[Henry Hall (American)|Henry Hall]] is credited as first to farm cranberries in the [[Cape Cod]] town of [[Dennis (town), Massachusetts|Dennis]] around 1816. In the 1820s cranberries were shipped to Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/history.html |title=History |publisher=Cranberries.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref> Cranberries became popular for wild harvesting in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Russia]]. In [[Scotland]], the berries were originally wild-harvested but with the loss of suitable habitat, the plants have become so scarce that this is no longer done.

==Cultivation==
=== Geography and bog method ===
[[File:Cranberrys beim Ernten.jpeg|thumb|right|Cranberry harvest in [[New Jersey]]]]
Cranberries are a major commercial crop in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]], as well as in the Canadian provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Ontario]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Quebec]]. 20% of the world's cranberries are produced in British Columbia's Lower Mainland region. In the United States, Wisconsin is the leading producer of cranberries, with over half of U.S. production.<ref>{{Cite web|last=United States Department of Agriculture|title=Wisconsin -Cranberries|accessdate=31 July 2011|url=http://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Wisconsin/Publications/Crops/cranberry.pdf|date=18 August 2010|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Historically, cranberry beds were constructed in wetlands. Today cranberry beds are constructed in upland areas with a shallow water table. The topsoil is scraped off to form [[dyke (construction)|dyke]]s around the bed perimeter. Clean sand is hauled into a depth of four to eight inches. The surface is laser leveled flat to provide even drainage. Beds are frequently drained with socked tile in addition to the perimeter ditch. In addition to making it possible to hold water, the dykes allow equipment to service the beds without driving on the vines. Irrigation equipment is installed in the bed to provide [[irrigation]] for vine growth and for spring and autumn frost protection.

=== Cultivation ===
Cranberry vines are propagated by moving vines from an established bed. The vines are spread on the surface of the sand of the new bed and pushed into the sand with a blunt disk. The vines are watered frequently during the first few weeks until roots form and new shoots grow. Beds are given frequent light application of nitrogen fertilizer during the first year. The cost of establishment for new cranberry beds is estimated to be about US$70,000 per hectare (approx. $28,300 per acre).

A common misconception about cranberry production is that the beds remain flooded throughout the year. During the [[growing season]] cranberry beds are not flooded, but are irrigated regularly to maintain soil moisture. Beds are flooded in the autumn to facilitate harvest and again during the winter to protect against low temperatures. In cold climates like Wisconsin, Maine, and eastern Canada, the winter flood typically freezes into ice, while in warmer climates the water remains liquid. When ice forms on the beds, trucks can be driven onto the ice to spread a thin layer of sand that helps to control pests and rejuvenate the vines. Sanding is done every three to five years.

=== Harvesting ===
[[File:Harvesting cranberries 2.jpg|thumb|Cranberry harvest (wet-picking)]]
Cranberries are harvested in the fall when the fruit takes on its distinctive deep red color. This is usually in September through the first part of November. To harvest cranberries, the beds are flooded with six to eight inches of water above the vines. A harvester is driven through the beds to remove the fruit from the vines. For the past 50 years, water reel type harvesters have been used. Harvested cranberries float in the water and can be corralled into a corner of the bed and conveyed or pumped from the bed. From the farm, cranberries are taken to receiving stations where they are cleaned, sorted, and stored prior to packaging or processing.

Although most cranberries are wet-picked as described above, 5–10% of the US crop is still dry-picked. This entails higher labor costs and lower yield, but dry-picked berries are less bruised and can be sold as fresh fruit instead of having to be immediately frozen or processed. Originally performed with two-handed comb scoops, dry picking is today accomplished by motorized, walk-behind harvesters which must be small enough to traverse beds without damaging the vines.

White [[cranberry juice]] is made from regular cranberries that have been harvested after the fruits are mature, but before they have attained their characteristic dark red color. Yields are lower on beds harvested early and the early flooding tends to damage vines, but not severely.

Cranberries for fresh market are stored in shallow bins or boxes with perforated or slatted bottoms, which deter decay by allowing air to circulate. Because harvest occurs in late autumn, cranberries for fresh market are frequently stored in thick walled barns without mechanical refrigeration. Temperatures are regulated by opening and closing vents in the barn as needed. Cranberries destined for processing are usually frozen in bulk containers shortly after arriving at a receiving station.

== Food uses ==
[[File:cranberries20101210.jpg|thumb|Cranberries]]
About 95% of cranberries are processed into products such as [[cranberry juice|juice drinks]], sauce, and sweetened dried cranberries. The remaining are sold fresh to consumers.

Cranberries are normally considered too sharp to be eaten plain and raw, as they are not only sour but bitter as well.<ref name="zeldes">{{cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | authorlink =  | title = Eat this!

Cranberry juice is a major use of cranberries; it is usually either sweetened to make "cranberry juice cocktail" or blended with other fruit juices to reduce its natural severe tartness. Many cocktails, including the [[Cosmopolitan (cocktail)|Cosmopolitan]], are made with cranberry juice. At one teaspoon of sugar per ounce, cranberry juice cocktail is more highly sweetened than even soda drinks that have been linked to obesity.<ref>Calvan, Bobby Caina.

Usually cranberries as fruit are cooked into a [[compote]] or [[jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]], known as [[cranberry sauce]]. Such preparations are traditionally served with roast [[Turkey meat|turkey]], as a staple of English Christmas dinners, and the [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Canadian]] and [[Holidays of the United States|US holiday]] [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. The berry is also used in baking ([[muffin]]s, [[scones]], [[cake]]s and [[breads]]). In baking it is often combined with [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] or [[orange zest]]. Less commonly, innovative cooks use cranberries to add tartness to savory dishes such as soups and stews.<ref name="zeldes" />

Fresh cranberries can be frozen at home, and will keep up to nine months; they can be used directly in recipes without thawing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/content.php?pid=87646&sid=652165 |title=The American Cranberry-Basic Information on Cranberries |publisher=Library.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>

[[Cranberry wine]] is made in some of the cranberry-growing regions of the United States and Canada from either whole cranberries, cranberry juice or cranberry juice concentrate.

In one [[pilot study]], cranberry juice consumption of two cups per day increased plasma antioxidant capacity and decreased oxidized low-density lipoprotein and [[malondialdehyde]] at eight weeks compared to a placebo. However,  juice consumption caused no significant improvements in blood pressure, glucose or lipid profiles, [[C-reactive protein]], or [[interleukin-6]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Basu A, Betts NM, Ortiz J, Simmons B, Wu M, Lyons TJ|title=Low-energy cranberry juice decreases lipid oxidation and increases plasma antioxidant capacity in women with metabolic syndrome|journal=Nutr Res |year=2011|volume=31|issue=3|pages=190–6|pmid=21481712|doi=10.1016/j.nutres.2011.02.003|pmc=3075541}}</ref>

=== Possible contraindications ===
An autumn 2004 caution from the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]], the UK agency dealing with drug safety, advised patients taking [[warfarin]] not to drink cranberry juice after adverse effects (such as increased incidence of bruising) were reported, possibly resulting from the presence of [[salicylic acid]] native to polyphenol-rich plants such as the cranberry. However, during 2006-8, several reviews of case reports and pilot studies have failed to confirm this effect, collectively indicating no statistically significant interaction between daily consumption of 250 mL cranberry juice and warfarin in the general population.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li Z, Seeram NP, Carpenter CL, Thames G, Minutti C, Bowerman S |title=Cranberry does not affect prothrombin time in male subjects on warfarin |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |volume=106 |issue=12 |pages=2057–61 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17126638 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2006.09.012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pham DQ, Pham AQ |title=Interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=490–4 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17322161 |doi=10.2146/ajhp060370 }}</ref> A gene (VKORC1, CYP2C9) has been shown to change warfarin sensitivity.

=== History ===
{{globalize|date=November 2010}}

In 1550, James White Norwood made reference to Indians using cranberries. In James Rosier's book "The Land of Virginia" there is an account of Europeans coming ashore and being met with Indians bearing bark cups full of cranberries. In Plymouth, Massachusetts, there is a 1633 account of the husband of Mary Ring auctioning her cranberry-dyed petticoat for 16 shillings. In 1640's "Key Into the Language" [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] described cranberries, referring to them as "bearberries" because bears ate them. In 1648, preacher John Elliott was quoted in [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard's]] book "Clear Sunshine of the Gospel" with an account of the difficulties the Pilgrims were having in using the Indians to harvest cranberries as they preferred to hunt and fish. In 1663, the Pilgrim cookbook appears with a recipe for cranberry sauce. In 1667, New Englanders sent to [[Charles II of England|King Charles]] 10 barrels of cranberries, 3 barrels of codfish and some Indian corn as a means of appeasement for his anger over their local coining of the Pine Tree shilling. In 1669, Captain Richard Cobb had a banquet in his house (to celebrate both his marriage to Mary Gorham and his election to the Convention of Assistance), serving wild turkey with sauce made from wild cranberries. In the 1672 book "New England Rarities Discovered" author John Josselyn described cranberries, writing:

<blockquote>"Sauce for the Pilgrims, cranberry or bearberry, is a small trayling plant that grows in salt marshes that are overgrown with moss.  The berries are of a pale yellow color, afterwards red, as big as a cherry, some perfectly round, others oval, all of them hollow with sower (sic) astringent taste; they are ripe in August and September.  They are excellent against the Scurvy.  They are also good to allay the fervor of hoof diseases.  The Indians and English use them mush, boyling (sic) them with sugar for sauce to eat with their meat; and it is a delicate sauce, especially with roasted mutton.  Some make tarts with them as with gooseberries."</blockquote>

"The Compleat Cook's Guide" published in 1683 made reference to cranberry juice.{{fact|date=October 2013}} In 1703, cranberries were served at the Harvard University commencement dinner.{{fact|date=October 2013}} In 1787, [[James Madison]] wrote [[Thomas Jefferson]] in France for background information on constitutional government to use at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson sent back a number of books on the subject and in return asked for a gift of apples, pecans and cranberries.{{fact|date=October 2013}}
[[William Aiton]], a Scottish botanist, included an entry for the cranberry in volume II of his 1789  work, ''[[Hortus Kewensis]]''. He notes that ''[[Vaccinium macrocarpon]]'' (American cranberry) was cultivated by James Gordon in 1760.{{fact|date=October 2013}}
In 1796, cranberries were served at the first celebration of the landing of the Pilgrims, and Amelia Simmons (an American orphan) wrote a book entitled "American Cookery" which contained a recipe for cranberry tarts.{{fact|date=October 2013}} In 1816, [[Henry Hall (American)|Henry Hall]] first commercially grew cranberries in East Dennis, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.{{fact|date=October 2013}} In 1843, [[Eli Howes]] planted his own crop of cranberries on Cape Cod, using the "Howes" variety.{{fact|date=October 2013}} In 1847, Cyrus Cahoon planted a crop of "Early Black" variety near Pleasant Lake, Harwich, Massachusetts.{{fact|date=October 2013}} In 1860, [[Edward Watson (poet)|Edward Watson]], a friend of [[Henry David Thoreau]], wrote a poem called "The Cranberry Tart."{{fact|date=October 2013}}

Cranberry sales in the United States have traditionally been associated with [[public holiday|holidays]] of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]]. Until the 1930s most of the crop was sold fresh.{{fact|date=October 2013}}

In the U.S., large scale cranberry cultivation has been developed as opposed to other countries.{{fact|date=October 2013}} American cranberry growers have a long history of cooperative [[marketing]]. As early as 1904, John Gaynor, a [[Wisconsin]] grower, and A.U. Chaney, a fruit broker from [[Des Moines, Iowa]], organized Wisconsin growers into a cooperative called the Wisconsin Cranberry Sales Company to receive a uniform price from buyers.{{fact|date=October 2013}} Growers in [[New Jersey]] and [[Massachusetts]] were also organized into cooperatives, creating the National Fruit Exchange that marketed fruit under the [[Eatmor]] [[brand]].{{fact|date=October 2013}} The success of cooperative marketing almost led to its failure. With consistent and high prices, area and production doubled between 1903 and 1917 and prices fell. In 1918, [[US$]]54,000 was spent on advertising, leading to US$1 million in increased sales.{{fact|date=October 2013}}

With surplus cranberries and changing American households some enterprising growers began [[canning]] cranberries that were below-grade for fresh market. [[Competition]] between canners was fierce because [[profit (accounting)|profits]] were thin. The [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] cooperative was established in 1930 through a merger of three primary processing companies: Ocean Spray Preserving company, Makepeace Preserving Co, and Cranberry Products Co. The new company was called Cranberry Canners, Inc. and used the Ocean Spray label on their products. Since the new company represented over 90% of the market, it would have been illegal (cf. [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]]) had [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] John Quarles not found an exemption for [[agricultural cooperative]]s. Morris April Brothers were the producers of Eatmor brand cranberry sauce, in Tuckahoe, New Jersey; Morris April Brothers brought an action against Ocean Spray for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and won $200,000 in real damages plus triple damages, in 1958, just in time for the Great Cranberry Scare of 1959.  As of 2006, about 65% of the North American industry belongs to the Ocean Spray cooperative. (The percentage may be slightly higher in Canada than in the U.S.)

A turning point for the industry occurred on November 9, 1959, when the secretary of the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] [[Arthur S. Flemming]] announced that some of the 1959 crop was tainted with traces of the [[herbicide]] [[aminotriazole]]. The market for cranberries collapsed and growers lost millions of dollars.<ref name="zeldes" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehound.net/19870404/mp3s/start12.mp3 |title="Cranberry Blues" 1959 recording (mp3 file) by Robert Williams and the Groovers |date= |accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref> However, the scare taught the industry that they could not be completely dependent on the holiday market for their products: they had to find year-round markets for their fruit. They also had to be exceedingly careful about their use of [[pesticide]]s.

After the aminotriazole scare, Ocean Spray reorganized and spent substantial sums on [[product development]]. New products such as cranberry apple [[juice]] blends were introduced, followed by other juice blends.

A [[Federal Marketing Order]] that is authorized to synchronize supply and demand was approved in 1962. The order has been renewed and modified slightly in subsequent years, but it has allowed for more stable marketing. The market order has been invoked during six crop years: 1962 (12%), 1963 (5%), 1970 (10%), 1971 (12%), 2000 (15%), and 2001 (35%). Even though supply still slightly exceeds demand, there is little will to invoke the Federal Marketing Order out of the realization that any pullback in supply by U.S. growers would easily be filled by Canadian production.

Prices and production increased steadily during the 1980s and 1990s. Prices peaked at about $65.00 per barrel (29&nbsp;¢/kg—A cranberry barrel equals 100 pounds or 45.4&nbsp;kg.) in 1996 then fell to $18.00 per barrel (8.2&nbsp;¢/kg) in 2001. The cause for the precipitous drop was classic oversupply. Production had outpaced consumption leading to substantial inventory in freezers or as concentrate.

Cranberry handlers (processors) include [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], [[Cliffstar|Cliffstar Corporation]], Northland Cranberries Inc.[Sun Northland LLC], Clement Pappas & Co., Decas Cranberry Products as well as a number of small handlers and processors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roper TR, Vorsa N |chapter=Cranberry: Botany and Horticulture |editor=Janick J |title=Horticultural Reviews |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=215–6 |isbn=0-471-18907-3 |url=http://www.pubhort.org/hr/hr21/HR_21_07_00000000.pdf}}</ref>

'''Cranberry Marketing Committee'''
The Cranberry Marketing Committee of the United States of America is an organization that represents 100% of the United States cranberry handlers in four marketing order districts.  The committee was established in 1963 as a Federal Marketing Order to safeguard the orderly supply of a quality product.  The Cranberry Marketing Committee, based in Wareham, Massachusetts, represents 18 cranberry handlers which represents about 1,200 United States cranberry growers located in Oregon, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.   
The authority for the actions taken by the Cranberry Marketing Committee are provided in Chapter IX, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations which is called the Federal Cranberry Marketing Order. The Order is part of the Agricultural marketing Agreement Act of 1937.  The act identifies cranberries as a commodity good that can be regulated by Congress.  The Federal Cranberry Marketing Order has been altered over the years to expand the Cranberry Marketing Committees ability to develop projects in the United States and around the world.   
The Cranberry Marketing Committee currently runs promotional programs in the United States, South Korea, the Netherlands, Austria, Australia, Switzerland, France, Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, and Mexico.

== Regulation ==
Problems may arise with the lack of validation of a quantifying method for the quantification of [[A-type proanthocyanidin]]s. For instance, in the case of cranberries extracts, it can be performed using several existing methods including for example the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] method, LC-MS<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.062|title=Characterisation of genuine and derived cranberry proanthocyanidins by LC–ESI-MS|year=2011|last1=Tarascou|first1=Isabelle|last2=Mazauric|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Meudec|first3=Emmanuelle|last4=Souquet|first4=Jean-Marc|last5=Cunningham|first5=David|last6=Nojeim|first6=Steve|last7=Cheynier|first7=Véronique|last8=Fulcrand|first8=Hélène|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=128|issue=3|pages=802}}</ref> or a modified [[4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde]] (DMAC) colorimetric method.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=20549799|doi=10.1002/jsfa.3966|title=Multi-laboratory validation of a standard method for quantifying proanthocyanidins in cranberry powders|year=2010|last1=Prior|first1=Ronald L|last2=Fan|first2=Ellen|last3=Ji|first3=Hongping|last4=Howell|first4=Amy|last5=Nio|first5=Christian|last6=Payne|first6=Mark J|last7=Reed|first7=Jess|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=90|issue=9|pages=1473–8}}</ref> This can lead to a difficulty to evaluated the real quality of extracts from different origins.
