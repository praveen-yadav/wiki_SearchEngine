'''[[Christmas]] in [[Poland]]''' is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Western world. The [[observance]] of Christmas developed gradually over the centuries, beginning in ancient times; combining old pagan customs with the religious ones introduced after the [[Christianization of Poland]] by the [[Catholic Church]]. Later influences include mutual permeating of local traditions and various folk cultures. [[Christmas tree]]s are decorated and lit in family rooms on the day of [[Christmas Eve]]. Other trees are placed in most public areas and outside churches.<ref name="pmkamsterdam" /> Christmas is called "Boże Narodzenie" in Polish<ref name="onet-translation">{{cite web | url = http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/tlumacz.html?tr=ang-auto&translate=OK&qs=Christmas | title = Christmas - Tłumacz - Onet.pl Portal wiedzy | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}</ref> (literally 'God's Birth').

==Advent==
Among the special tasks carried out in private homes during [[Advent]] (a time of waiting for the celebration of the [[Nativity of Jesus]]) is the baking of the Christmas [[Pierniki|piernik]] (gingerbread), and the making of Christmas decorations. Pierniki are made in a variety of shapes, including hearts, animals, and [[St. Nicholas]] figures. Unlike in non-Catholic Christian countries, St. Nicholas does not play a major role in Polish Christmas, but instead, is celebrated on his Saint feast day of December 6.<ref name="pmkamsterdam" />

Traditionally, the Christmas trees are decorated with glass [[bauble]]s, garlands and many homemade [[Decorative arts|ornaments]] including painted eggshells, shiny red apples, walnuts, wrapped chocolate shapes, candles, etc. They are lit on [[Christmas Eve]] before [[Wigilia]]. At the top of each tree there is a star or a glittering [[tree topper]]. In many homes, [[sparkler]]s are hung on the branches of the trees for wintery ambiance. Sometimes the trees are left standing until February 2, the [[feast day]] of St. Mary of the Candle of Lightning.<ref name="pmkamsterdam" />

During Advent and all the way until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], or the [[baptism of Jesus]] (day of January 6), the "gwiazdory", or the star carriers walk through the villages. Some of them sing [[carols]]; others recite verses or put on "szopki" ([[puppet show]]s), or "herody" ([[nativity scene]]s). The last two customs are inspired by the traditional [[manger]] scenes or "Jaselka" ([[Nativity scene|crib]]). One tradition unique to Poland is the sharing of the "[[opłatek]]", a thin wafer into which a holy picture is pressed. In the old days people carried these wafers from house to house wishing their neighbors a Merry Christmas. Nowadays, opłatek is mostly shared with members of the family and immediate neighbors before the Christmas Eve supper ([[Wigilia]] in the Polish language). As each person shares pieces of the wafer with another, they are supposed to forgive each other any hurts that have occurred over the past year and wish them happiness in the coming year.<ref name="pmkamsterdam" />

==''Wigilia'', the Christmas Eve supper==
In Poland, [[Christmas Eve]] is a day first of [[fasting]], then of feasting. The [[Wigilia]] feast begins at the appearance of the first star. There is no red meat served but fish, usually [[carp]]. The supper, which includes many traditional dishes and desserts, can sometimes last for over two hours. It is followed by the exchange of gifts. The next day, the [[Christmas Day]], is often spent visiting friends. In Polish tradition, people combine religion and family closeness at Christmas. Although gift-giving plays a major role in the rituals, emphasis is placed more on the making of special foods and decorations.<ref name="pmkamsterdam" />

On the night of Christmas Eve, so important is the appearance of the first star in remembrance of the [[Star of Bethlehem]], that it has been given an affectionate name of "the little star" or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, "The star has come!" Only after it appears, the family members sit down to a dinner table.<ref name="pmkamsterdam" /> 

According to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a [[manger]]. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the table cloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table. In many homes an empty place setting is symbolically left at the table for the [[Baby Jesus]] or, for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, or if a deceased relative should come and would like to share in the meal. 

The supper begins with the breaking of the [[opłatek]]. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the [[Twelve Apostles]], or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine). 

A traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried [[carp]] and [[barszcz]] (beetroot soup) with [[uszka]] (ravioli). Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; [[carp]] fillet, carp in [[aspic]] etc. Universal Polish Christmas foods are [[pierogi]] as well as some [[herring]] dishes, and for desert, [[makowiec (pastry)|makowiec]] or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a [[compote]] of dry fruits for a drink. 

The remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that "The Little Star" brings the gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.

Christmas Eve ends with [[Pasterka]], the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of  Christianity.<ref name="pmkamsterdam">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080107101742/http://www.pmkamsterdam.nl/PL/Czytelnia/BozeNar.htm  "Boże Narodzenie i polskie tradycje,"] Polska Misja Katolicka, Amsterdam {{pl icon}}</ref> The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses. According to scripture, the Christmas Day masses are interchangeable allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the religious services by individual parishioners.<ref name="Kędzierski">{{cite web | url=http://www.przewodnik-katolicki.pl/nr/ksiadz_odpowiada/pasterka_przed_polnoca.html | title=Pasterka przed północą...

==Kolędy, the Christmas carols==
[[Christmas carols]] are not celebrated in Poland until during-and-after the Christmas Vigil Mass called [[Pasterka]] held between 24 and 25 of December.<ref name="LC">[http://liturgicalcenter.org/?a=liturg&sub=trad&grupa=35&mod=49 "The Shepherds' Mass".] Polish-American Liturgical Center.org. 2008. Retrieved December 21, 2012.</ref> The Christmas season often runs until February 2. The early hymns sung in Catholic church were brought to Poland by the [[Franciscan Brothers of Peace|Franciscan Brothers]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The early Christmas music was Latin in origin. When the Polish words and melodies started to become popular, including many new secular [[pastoral]]s (pastoralka, or shepherd's songs), they were not written down originally, but rather taught among people by heart. Notably, the song ''[[Bóg się rodzi]]'' (''God Is Being Born'') with lyrics written by [[Franciszek Karpiński]] in 1792 became the Christmas hymn of Poland already in the court of King [[Stefan Batory]]. Many of the early Polish carols were collected in 1838 by Rev. Hioduszewki in a book called ''Pastorałki i Kolędy z Melodiami'' (Pastorals and Carols with Melodies).<ref name="polishsite">Lorraine Grochowsa Kiefer, [http://culture.polishsite.us/articles/art336.html Christmas Kolędy - Polish Carols], at culture.polishsite.us</ref>
