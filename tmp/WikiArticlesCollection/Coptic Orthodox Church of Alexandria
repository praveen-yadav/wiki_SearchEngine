The '''Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria''' is the official name for the largest [[Christianity|Christian]] church in [[Egypt]] and the Middle East.<ref>[[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{coptic|Ϯⲉⲕ̀ⲕⲗⲏⲥⲓⲁ ̀ⲛⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ ̀ⲛⲟⲣⲑⲟⲇⲟⲝⲟⲥ}} ''ti.eklyseya en.remenkimi en.orthodoxos'', literally: ''the Egyptian Orthodox Church''.</ref>

The Church belongs to the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] family of churches, which has been a distinct church body since the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, when it took a different position over [[Christology|Christological]] theology from that of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The precise differences in theology that caused the split with the Coptic Christians are still disputed, highly technical, and mainly concerned with the nature of [[Christ]]. The foundational roots of the Church are based in Egypt, but it has a worldwide following.

According to tradition, the church was established by [[St. Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]], an [[apostle]] and [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]], in the middle of the 1st century (approximately AD 42).<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the author of ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in the 4th century, states that Saint Mark came to Egypt in the first or third year of the reign of Emperor Claudius, i.e. 41 or 43 A.D. "Two Thousand years of Coptic Christianity" Otto F. A. Meinardus p28.</ref> The head of the church and the [[Apostolic see|See]] of Alexandria is the [[Coptic Pope|Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy See of Saint Mark]]. The See of Alexandria is titular and nowadays the Coptic Pope seat is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral]] in the [[Abbassia]] District in [[Cairo]].
 
As of 2012, about 10% of Egyptians belonged to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm |title=U.S.Dept of State/Egypt |publisher=State.gov |date=22 August 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{Religion in Egypt}}
{{Copts}}

===Apostolic foundation===
Egypt is identified in the [[Bible]] as the place of refuge that the [[Holy Family]] sought in its flight from [[Judea]]: <blockquote>When he [Joseph] arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, and was there until the death of [[Herod the Great]], that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, ''Out of Egypt I called My Son'' ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 2:12–23).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/The_Holy_Family_in_Egypt |title=Holy Family in Egypt |publisher=Orthodoxwiki.org |date= |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

The Egyptian Church, which is more than 1,900 years old, regards itself as the subject of many prophecies in the [[Old Testament]]. [[Isaiah]] the prophet, in Chapter 19, Verse 19 says "In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border."

The first Christians in Egypt were common people who spoke Egyptian [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref name="ECM">[http://home.att.net/~nathan.wilson/missionbios.html Early church missionary]</ref> There were also Alexandrian [[Jew]]s such as [[Theophilus (Biblical)|Theophilus]], whom [[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke the Evangelist]] addresses in the introductory chapter of his [[Gospel of Luke|gospel]]. When the church was founded by [[Saint Mark]] during the reign of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[emperor]] [[Nero]], a great multitude of native Egyptians (as opposed to [[Greeks]] or Jews) embraced the Christian faith.<ref name="ECM"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01300b.htm|title=The Church of Alexandria|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref>

Christianity spread throughout Egypt within half a century of Saint Mark's arrival in Alexandria, as is clear from the [[New Testament]] writings found in [[Oxyrhynchus|Bahnasa]], in Middle Egypt, which date around the year AD 200, and a fragment of the [[Gospel of John]], written in Coptic, which was found in [[Upper Egypt]] and can be dated to the first half of the 2nd century. In the 2nd century, Christianity began to spread to the rural areas, and scriptures were translated into the local languages, namely Coptic.

===Contributions to Christianity===

====The Catechetical School of Alexandria====
The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] is the oldest catechetical school in the world. St. [[Jerome]] records that the Christian School of Alexandria was founded by Saint Mark himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copticchurch.net/topics/patrology/schoolofalex/I-Intro/chapter1.html |title=The School of Alexandria – Part I – An Introduction to the School of Alexandria |publisher=Copticchurch.net |date= |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref> Around 190 AD under the leadership of the scholar [[Pantanaeus]], the school of Alexandria became an important institution of religious learning, where students were taught by scholars such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]], and the native Egyptian [[Origen]], who was considered the father of theology and who was also active in the field of commentary and comparative Biblical studies. Origen wrote over 6,000 commentaries of the Bible in addition to his famous [[Hexapla]].

Many scholars such as Jerome visited the school of Alexandria to exchange ideas and to communicate directly with its scholars. The scope of this school was not limited to theological subjects; science, mathematics and humanities were also taught there. The question-and-answer method of commentary began there, and 15 centuries before [[Braille]], wood-carving techniques were in use there by blind scholars to read and write.

The Theological college of the catechetical school was re-established in 1893. The new school currently has campuses in Ireland, [[Cairo]], [[New Jersey]], and Los Angeles, where Coptic priests-to-be and other qualified men and women are taught among other subjects Christian theology, history, the Coptic language and art – including chanting, music, [[iconography]], and tapestry.

====The cradle of monasticism and its missionary work====
{{Main|Coptic monasticism}}
Many Egyptian Christians went to the desert during the 3rd century, and remained there to pray and work and dedicate their lives to seclusion and worship of God. This was the beginning of the [[Monasticism|monastic movement]], which was organized by [[Saint Anthony the Great|Anthony the Great]], Saint Paul, the world's first [[anchorite]], [[Macarius the Great|Saint Macarius the Great]] and [[Pachomius|Saint Pachomius the Cenobite]] in the 4th century.

[[Christian monasticism]] was born in Egypt and was instrumental in the formation of the Coptic Orthodox Church character of submission, simplicity and humility, thanks to the teachings and writings of the [[Desert Fathers|Great Fathers of Egypt's Deserts]]. By the end of the 5th century, there were hundreds of monasteries, and thousands of cells and caves scattered throughout the Egyptian desert. A great number of these monasteries are still flourishing and have new vocations to this day.

All Christian monasticism stems, either directly or indirectly, from the Egyptian example: [[Saint Basil|Saint Basil the Great]] Archbishop of Caesaria of Cappadocia, founder and organizer of the monastic movement in Asia Minor, visited Egypt around AD 357 and his rule is followed by the Eastern Orthodox Churches; Saint Jerome who translated the Bible into Latin, came to Egypt, while en route to [[Jerusalem]], around AD 400 and left details of his experiences in his letters; [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]] founded the Benedictine Order in the 6th century on the model of Saint Pachomius, but in a stricter form. Countless pilgrims have visited the "Desert Fathers" to emulate their spiritual, disciplined lives.

===Role and participation in the Ecumenical Councils===

====Council of Nicea====
In the 4th century, an Alexandrian [[presbyter]] named [[Arius]] began a theological dispute about the nature of Christ that spread throughout the Christian world and is now known as [[Arianism]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea|Ecumenical Council of Nicea]] AD 325 was convened by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] under the presidency of Saint [[Hosius of Cordova]] and Pope Saint [[Alexander I of Alexandria]] to resolve the dispute and eventually led to the formulation of the Symbol of Faith, also known as the [[Nicene Creed]]. The Creed, which is now recited throughout the Christian world, was based largely on the teaching put forth by a man who eventually would become Pope Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the chief opponent of Arius.

====Council of Constantinople====
In the year AD 381, Pope [[Timothy I of Alexandria]] presided over the second ecumenical council known as the Ecumenical [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]], to judge Macedonius, who denied the Divinity of the Holy Spirit. This council completed the [[Nicene Creed]] with this confirmation of the divinity of the [[Holy Spirit]]:

<blockquote>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father through the Son is worshiped and glorified who spoke by the Prophets and in One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic church. We confess one Baptism for the remission of sins and we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the coming age, Amen.</blockquote>

====Council of Ephesus====
[[File:CopticAltar.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Coptic Icon in the Coptic Altar of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]
Another theological dispute in the 5th century occurred over the teachings of [[Nestorius]], the Patriarch of Constantinople who taught that God the Word was not [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostatically]] joined with human nature, but rather dwelt in the man Jesus. As a consequence of this, he denied the title "Mother of God" ''([[Theotokos]])'' to the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], declaring her instead to be "Mother of Christ" ''[[Christotokos]]''.

When reports of this reached the Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark, Pope Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]] acted quickly to correct this breach with orthodoxy, requesting that Nestorius repent. When he would not, the Synod of Alexandria met in an emergency session and a unanimous agreement was reached. Pope [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril I of Alexandria]], supported by the entire See, sent a letter to Nestorius known as "The Third Epistle of Saint Cyril to Nestorius." This epistle drew heavily on the established Patristic Constitutions and contained the most famous article of Alexandrian Orthodoxy: "The Twelve Anathemas of Saint Cyril." In these [[anathema]]s, Cyril excommunicated anyone who followed the teachings of Nestorius. For example, "Anyone who dares to deny the Holy Virgin the title ''[[Theotokos]]'' is Anathema!" Nestorius however, still would not repent and so this led to the convening of the [[First Ecumenical Council of Ephesus]] (431), over which Cyril presided.

The Council confirmed the teachings of [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius]] and confirmed the title of Mary as "[[Mother of God]]". It also clearly stated that anyone who separated Christ into two hypostases was anathema, as Athanasius had said that there is "One Nature and One Hypostasis for God the Word Incarnate" (''Mia Physis tou Theou Loghou Sesarkomeni''). Also, the introduction to the creed was formulated as follows:

<blockquote>We magnify you O Mother of the True Light and we glorify you O saint and Mother of God ''(Theotokos)'' for you have borne unto us the Saviour of the world. Glory to you O our Master and King: Christ, the pride of the Apostles, the crown of the martyrs, the rejoicing of the righteous, firmness of the churches and the forgiveness of sins. We proclaim the Holy Trinity in One Godhead: we worship Him, we glorify Him, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord bless us, Amen. [not dissimilar to the "Axion Estin" Chant still used in Orthodoxy]</blockquote>

====Council of Chalcedon====
[[File:StMarkCathAlex.jpg|thumb|left|St. Mark Coptic Cathedral in Alexandria]]
When in AD 451, Emperor [[Marcianus]] attempted to heal divisions in the Church, the response of [[Dioscorus of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus]] – the Pope of Alexandria who was later exiled – was that the emperor should not intervene in the affairs of the Church. It was at [[Chalcedon]] that the emperor, through the Imperial delegates, enforced harsh disciplinary measures against Pope Dioscorus in response to his boldness.

The [[Council of Chalcedon]], from the perspective of the Alexandrine Christology, has deviated from the approved Cyrillian terminology and declared that Christ was one hypostasis in two natures. However, in the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, "Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary," thus the foundation of the definition according to the [[Non-Chalcedonian]] adherents, according to the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria is valid. There is a change in the Non-Chalcedonian definition here, as the Nicene creed clearly uses the terms "of", rather than "in".

In terms of Christology, the Oriental Orthodox (Non-Chalcedonians) understanding is that Christ is "One Nature—the Logos Incarnate," ''of'' the full humanity and full divinity. The Chalcedonians' understanding is that Christ is ''in'' two natures, full humanity and full divinity. Just as humans are of their mothers and fathers and not in their mothers and fathers, so too is the nature of Christ according to [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. If Christ is in full humanity and in full divinity, then He is separate in two persons as the Nestorians teach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mfignatius/others/byzantine01.html&date=2009-10-26+02:32:52 |title=Split of the Byzantine and Oriental Churches |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref> This is the doctrinal perception that makes the apparent difference which separated the Oriental Orthodox from the Eastern Orthodox.

The Council's findings were rejected by many of the Christians on the fringes of the [[Byzantine Empire]], including Egyptians, [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrians]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]], and others.

From that point onward, Alexandria would have two patriarchs: the non-Chalcedonian native Egyptian one, now known as the [[List of Coptic Popes|Coptic Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy Apostolic See of St. Mark]] and the "[[Melkite]]" or Imperial Patriarch, now known as the Greek Orthodox Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa.<ref>[http://www.greekorthodox-alexandria.org/ Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria].</ref>

Almost the entire Egyptian population rejected the terms of the Council of Chalcedon and remained faithful to the native Egyptian Church (now known as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria).<ref name="georgetown1">{{cite web |url= http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=14 December 2011}} See drop-down essay on "Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire"</ref> Those who supported the Chalcedonian definition remained in [[Full communion|communion]] with the other leading churches of [[History of the Roman Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]]. The non-Chalcedonian party became what is today called the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Church]].

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria regards itself as having been misunderstood at the Council of Chalcedon. There was an opinion in the Church that viewed that perhaps the Council understood the Church of Alexandria correctly, but wanted to curtail the existing power of the Alexandrine Hierarch, especially after the events that happened several years before at Constantinople from Pope [[Theophilus of Alexandria]] towards Patriarch [[John Chrysostom]] and the unfortunate turnouts of the Second Council of Ephesus in AD 449, where Eutichus misled Pope Dioscorus and the Council in confessing the Orthodox Faith in writing and then renouncing it after the Council, which in turn, had upset Rome, especially that the Tome which was sent was not read during the Council sessions.

To make things even worse, the Tome of Pope Leo of Rome was, according to the Alexandria School of Theology, particularly in regards to the definition of Christology, considered influenced by Nestorian heretical teachings. So, due to the above mentioned, especially in the consecutive sequences of events, the Hierarchs of Alexandria were considered holding too much of power from one hand, and on the other hand, due to the conflict of the Schools of Theology, there would be an impasse and a scapegoat, i.e. Pope Dioscorus. The Tome of Leo has been widely criticized (surprisingly by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox scholars) in the past 50 years as a much less than perfect orthodox theological doctrine.

It is also to be noted that by anathemizing Pope Leo because of the tone and content of his tome, as per Alexandrine Theology perception, Pope Dioscorus was found guilty of doing so without due process; in other words, the Tome of Leo was not a subject of heresy in the first place, but it was a question of questioning the reasons behind not having it either acknowledged or read at the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] in AD 449. Pope Dioscorus of Alexandria was never labeled as heretic by the council's canons.

Copts also believe that the Pope of Alexandria was forcibly prevented from attending the third congregation of the council from which he was ousted, apparently the result of a conspiracy tailored by the Roman delegates.<ref>Romanides, John S. [http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.06.en.orthodox_and_oriental_orthodox_consultation.htm Leo of Rome's Support of Theodoret].</ref>

Before the current positive era of Eastern and Oriental Orthodox dialogues, Chalcedonians sometimes used to call the non-Chalcedonians "[[Monophysitism|monophysites]]", though the Coptic Orthodox Church in reality regards monophysitism as a heresy. The Chalcedonian doctrine in turn came to be known as "[[Dyophysitism|dyophysite]]".

A term that comes closer to Coptic Orthodoxy is [[Miaphysitism|miaphysite]], which refers to a conjoined nature for Christ, both human and divine, united indivisibly in the Incarnate Logos. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria believes that Christ is perfect in His divinity, and He is perfect in His humanity, but His divinity and His humanity were united in one nature called "the nature of the incarnate word", which was reiterated by [[Cyril of Alexandria|Saint Cyril of Alexandria]].

Copts, thus, believe in two natures "human" and "divine" that are united in one hypostasis "without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration". These two natures "did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye" (Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil of Caesarea).

===From Chalcedon to the Arab conquest of Egypt===
{{Eastern Christianity}}
Copts suffered under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The [[Melkite]] Patriarchs, appointed by the emperors as both spiritual leaders and civil governors, massacred the Egyptian population whom they considered heretics. Many [[Egyptians]] were tortured and martyred to accept the terms of Chalcedon, but Egyptians remained loyal to the faith of their fathers and to the Cyrillian view of Christology. One of the most renowned Egyptian saints of that period is [[Saint Samuel the Confessor]].

===Muslim conquest of Egypt===
The [[Muslim invasion of Egypt]] took place in AD 639. Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian population remained mainly Christian. However, the gradual conversions to [[Islam]] over the centuries changed Egypt from a Christian to a largely Muslim country by the end of the 12th century.<ref>Kamil, Jill (1997). ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo.</ref> Egypt's Umayyad rulers taxed Christians at a higher rate, driving merchants towards Islam and undermining the economic base of the Coptic Church.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchange in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 93.</ref> Although the Coptic Church did not disappear, the Umayyad tax policies made it difficult for the church to retain elites.<ref>Jerry Bentley, ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Encounters and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 93.</ref>

===From the 19th century to the 1952 revolution===
The position of the Copts began to improve early in the 19th century under the stability and tolerance of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]]. The Coptic community ceased to be regarded by the state as an administrative unit. In 1855 the ''jizya'' tax was abolished. Shortly thereafter, the Copts started to serve in the Egyptian army.<ref name="StGeorge">http://suscopts.org/stgeorgedaytona/coptic_church.html "Saint Mark" St George Coptic Orthodox Church of Daytona</ref>

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Coptic Church underwent phases of new development. In 1853, Pope Cyril IV established the first modern Coptic schools, including the first Egyptian school for girls. He also founded a printing press, which was the second national press in the country. Pope Cyril IV established very friendly relations with other denominations, to the extent that when the Greek Patriarch in Egypt had to absent himself for a long period of time outside the country, he left his Church under the guidance of the Coptic Patriarch.<ref name="StGeorge"/>

The Theological College of the School of Alexandria was reestablished in 1893. It began its new history with five students, one of whom was later to become its dean. Today it has campuses in Alexandria, Cairo, and various dioceses throughout Egypt, as well as outside Egypt, in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne and London, where potential clergymen and other qualified men and women are taught many subjects, among which are theology, church history, missionary studies, and Coptic language.<ref name="StGeorge"/>

==Present day==
[[File:Monastry3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A modern Coptic cathedral in Aswan.]]
On 4 November 2012, Bishop Tawadros was chosen as the 118th [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria and the Patriarch of All Africa on the Holy See of Saint Mark]]. His predecessor was [[Pope Shenouda III]], who died on 17 March 2012.

There are about 18 million Coptic Orthodox Christians in the world. Between 10 and 14 million of them are found in Egypt under the jurisdiction of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.<ref name="The world factbook/Egypt/">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=Egypt from "The World Factbook"|date=4 September 2008|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]]}}</ref>

There are also significant numbers in the diaspora in countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, and [[Sudan]].

Retrieved 25 November 2006.</ref> the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] (roughly 2.5 million), as members of the Coptic Orthodox Church. This is however a misnomer, since both the Ethiopian and the Eritrean Churches, although daughter churches of the Church of Alexandria, are currently autocephalous churches. In 1959, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted its first own Patriarch by [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Pope Cyril VI]]. Furthermore, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church similarly became independent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in 1994, when four bishops were consecrated by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] to form the basis of a local Holy Synod of the Eritrean Church. In 1998, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church gained its autocephelacy from the Coptic Orthodox Church when its first Patriarch was enthroned by [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]].

These three churches remain in [[full communion]] with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church do acknowledge the Honorary Supremacy of the [[Coptic Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]], since the [[Church of Alexandria]] is technically their Mother Church. Upon their selection, both Patriarchs (Ethiopian & Eritrean) must receive the approval and communion from the Holy Synod of the [[Church of Alexandria|Apostolic See of Alexandria]] before their enthronement.

Since the 1980s theologians from the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox and Eastern (Chalcedonian) Orthodox churches have been meeting in a bid to resolve theological differences, and have concluded that many of the differences are caused by the two groups using different terminology to describe the same thing (see [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Agreed_Official_Statements_on_Christology_with_the_Catholic_and_Eastern_Orthodox_Churches Agreed Official Statements on Christology with the Eastern Orthodox Churches]).

[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - A Monk at the Coptic Monastery.jpg|thumbnail|A monk at prayer in the Coptic Monastery in Jerusalem (1935)]]
In the summer of 2001, the Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox Patriarchates of Alexandria agreed<ref>[http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Pastoral_Agreement_between_the_Coptic_Orthodox_and_Greek_Orthodox_Patriarchates_of_Alexandria_%282001%29 Official Statements on Christology].</ref> to mutually recognize baptisms performed in each other's churches, making re-baptisms unnecessary, and to recognize the sacrament of marriage as celebrated by the other. Previously, if a Coptic Orthodox and Greek Orthodox wanted to get married, the marriage had to be performed twice, once in each church, for it to be recognized by both. Now it can be done in only one church and be recognized by both.

According to Christian Tradition and Canon Law, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria only ordains men to the priesthood and episcopate, and if they wish to be married, they must be married before they are ordained. In this respect they follow the same practices as does the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

Traditionally, the [[Coptic language]] was used in church services, and the scriptures were written in the [[Coptic alphabet]]. However, due to the Arabisation of Egypt, service in churches started to witness increased use of Arabic, while preaching is done entirely in Arabic. Native languages are used, in conjunction with Coptic, during services outside of Egypt.

Coptic Orthodox Christians celebrate [[Christmas]] on 7 January ([[Gregorian Calendar]]), which coincides with 25 December according to the [[Julian Calendar]]. The Coptic Orthodox Church uses the [[Julian Calendar]] as its Ecclesiastical Calendar. It is known as the [[Coptic calendar]] or the [[Coptic Calendar|Alexandrian Calendar]]. This calendar is in turn based on the old [[Egyptian calendar]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] is thus considered an Old Calendrist Church.

On 4 November 2012, Bishop Tawadros was chosen as the 118th Pope. In a ritual filled with prayer, chants and incense at [[Abbassia|Abbasiya]] cathedral in Cairo, the 60-year-old bishop's name was picked by a blindfolded child from a glass bowl in which the names of two other candidates had also been placed. The enthronement was scheduled on 18 November 2012.

==Jurisdiction outside of Egypt==
[[File:ChristCopticArt.jpg|frame| [[Jesus Christ]] in a [[Coptic art|Coptic icon]]]]
Besides Egypt, the [[Church of Alexandria]] has jurisdiction over [[Pentapolis]], [[Libya]], [[Nubia]], [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and all Africa.

Both the Patriarchate of [[Addis Ababa]] and all Ethiopia, and the Patriarchate of [[Asmara]] and all [[Eritrea]] do acknowledge the supremacy of honor and dignity of the [[Pope of Alexandria|Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria]] on the basis that both Patriarchates were established by the Throne of Alexandria and that they have their roots in the Apostolic Church of Alexandria, and acknowledge that Saint Mark the Apostle is the founder of their Churches through the heritage and Apostolic evangelization of the Fathers of Alexandria.

In other words, the Patriarchates of Ethiopia and Eritrea are daughter Churches of the Holy Apostolic [[Patriarchate of Alexandria]].

In addition to the above, the countries of [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Congo]], [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Botswana]], [[Malawi]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]] and South Africa are under the jurisdiction and the evangelization of the Throne of [[Alexandria]]. It is still expanding in the continent of Africa.

==Daughter churches==

===Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church===
Since the Christianization of Ethiopia in the 4th century, the Church of Ethiopia has come under the dominion of the Church of Alexandria. The first bishop of Ethiopia, [[Frumentius|Saint Frumentius]], was consecrated as [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Bishop of Axum]] by [[Pope Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 328 AD. From then on, until 1959, the [[Pope of Alexandria]], as Patriarch of All Africa, always named an Egyptian (a Copt) to be the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Church. On 13 July 1948, the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] reached an agreement concerning the relationship between the two churches. In 1950, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] was granted autocephaly by [[Pope Joseph II of Alexandria]], head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Five Ethiopian bishops were immediately consecrated by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, and were empowered to elect a new Patriarch for their church. This promotion was completed when Joseph II consecrated the first Ethiopian-born Archbishop, [[Abuna Basilios]], as head of the Ethiopian Church on 14 January 1951. In 1959, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] crowned [[Abuna Basilios]] as the first [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Patriarch of Ethiopia]].

Patriarch Basilios died in 1971, and was succeeded on the same year by [[Abuna Theophilos]]. With the fall of Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] in 1974, the new Marxist government arrested Abuna Theophilos and secretly executed him in 1979. The Ethiopian government then ordered the Ethiopian Church to elect [[Abuna Takla Haymanot]] as Patriarch of Ethiopia. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Abuna Takla Haymanot on the grounds that the Synod of the Ethiopian Church had not removed Abuna Theophilos, and that the Ethiopian government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and he was thus still legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were halted, although they remained in communion with each other.

After the death of Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1988, [[Abune Merkorios]] who had close ties to the [[Derg]] (Communist) government was elected Patriarch of Ethiopia. Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991, Abune Merkorios abdicated under public and governmental pressure and went to exile in the United States. The newly elected Patriarch, [[Abune Paulos]] was officially recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in 1992 as the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the Coptic Church of Alexandria and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] were resumed on 13 July 2007.
His Holiness Abune Paulos died in August 2012 and transitionally  a new pope is elected until an election is made next year.

===Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church===
Following the independence of [[Eritrea]] from Ethiopia in 1993, the newly independent Eritrean government appealed to [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] for Eritrean Orthodox autocephaly. In 1994, Shenouda ordained [[Abune Phillipos]] as first Archbishop of Eritrea. The [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] obtained autocephaly on 7 May 1998, and Abune Phillipos was subsequently consecrated as first Patriarch of Eritrea. The two churches remain in full communion with each other and with the other [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], although the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, along with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church  does not recognize the deposition of the third Patriarch of Eritrea, [[Abune Antonios]].

*[[Patriarch]] of All Africa.

*The Pillar and Defender of the [[Holy]], [[Catholic]] (Universal), [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] Church and of the [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Doctrine.

===Historical evolution of the ecclesiastical title===
The Bishop of Alexandria was first known just as the ''Bishop of Alexandria''. It continued to be so, until the Church grew within and all over the Egyptian Province, and many Bishops were consecrated for the newly founded parishes all over the towns and cities.

The Bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first Bishop in [[Egypt]] consecrated by [[Saint Mark]], was honored by the other Bishops, as first among equals ''"Primus inter Pares,"''. This was in addition to the appropriate honorary dignity, which was due by virtue of being the Senior Bishop of the main [[Metropolis]] of the Province, [[Alexandria]], which also the Capital and the main Port of the Province. This honor was bestowed by making the Senior Bishop an ''“[[Archbishop]],”'' thus presiding in dignity of honor over all the Alexandrine and Egyptian Bishops.

The appellation of ''“Pope”'' has been attributed to the Bishop of Alexandria since the Episcopate of [[Heraclas of Alexandria|Heraclas]], the 13th Bishop of [[Alexandria]]. All the clergy of [[Alexandria]] and [[Lower Egypt]] honored him with the appellation ''“Papas,”'' which means “Our Father,” as the Senior and Elder Bishop among all bishops, within the [[Egypt]]ian Province, who are under his jurisdiction. This is because [[Alexandria]] was the Capital of the Province, and the preaching center and the place of martyrdom of [[Saint Mark]] the Evangelist and Apostle.

The title ''“[[Patriarch]]”'' means the Head or the Leader of a Tribe or a Community. Ecclesiastically it means the Head of the Fathers (Bishops) and their congregation of faithful. This title is historically known as “[[Patriarch]] of [[Alexandria]] and all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Throne of [[Saint Mark]] the Evangelist,” that is “of [[Alexandria]] and of all Africa.” The title of “Patriarch” was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], convened in AD 431, and ratified at [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in AD 451.

It is to be noted that only the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] has the double title of '''Pope''' and '''Patriarch''' among the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Thrones.
