An '''architect''' is  a person trained and [[Profession|licensed]] to plan, design, and oversee the construction of [[buildings]]. To ''practice architecture'' means to provide services in connection with the design and construction of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.<!--Removed bit about 'human use' as obvious in most architectural work, except for animal shelters, zoos, etc.--><ref name=ns.ca>http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm</ref>
Etymologically, ''architect'' derives from the Latin ''architectus'', which derives from the Greek ''arkhitekton'' (''arkhi-'', chief + ''tekton'', builder), i.e., '''chief builder'''.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect Online Etymology of the term "architect"]</ref>

Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a ''practicum'' (or ''internship'') for practical experience to earn a license to practice [[architecture]]. Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction (see below).

The terms '''architect''' and '''architecture''' are also used  in the disciplines of [[landscape architecture]], [[naval architecture]] and often [[information technology]] (for example a network architect or [[software architect]]). In most jurisdictions, the professional and commercial uses of the terms "architect<ref><http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/8D62C73D8515D8B3482575EF00046EA6/$FILE/CAP_408_e_b5.pdf>
</ref>"
and "landscape architect" are legally protected.

==Origins==
{{Main|History of Architecture}}
Throughout ancient and medieval history, most architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s—such as stone [[masonry|mason]]s and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]]. Until modern times there was no clear distinction between architect and [[Civil engineering|engineer]]. In Europe, the titles ''architect'' and ''engineer'' were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt ISBN 0-8052-1082-2</ref><ref>http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined</ref>

It is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional 'gentleman' architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 1400s, but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600. The availability of both allowed pre-construction drawings to be made by professionals.<ref name="MAD 225">{{cite book|last=Pacey|first=Arnold|title=Medieval Architectural Drawing|year=2007|publisher=Tempus Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4404-8|pages=225–227}}</ref> Concurrently, the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three-dimensional building in two dimensions, together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy, helped building designers communicate their ideas.<ref name="MAD 225" /> However, the development was gradual. Until the 1700s buildings continued to be designed and set-out by craftsmen, with the exception of high status projects.<ref name="MAD 225" />

==Architecture==
In most developed countries, only qualified persons with appropriate licensure, certification, or registration with a relevant body, often governmental may legally practice architecture. Such licensure usually requires as accredited university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. The use of terms and titles, including derivatives such as ''[[architectural designer]],'' and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law. 

To practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term ''[[building design]] professional'' (or ''Design professional)'', by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as [[engineering]] professionals, or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as ''[[architectural technologist]]s'' and ''[[intern architect]]s''. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures.

==Practice==
In the architectural profession, technical knowledge, management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.

===Design role===
[[File:Rem Koolhaas SCL.jpg|thumb|300px|Architect [[Rem Koolhaas]] inspecting a model of the [[Seattle Central Library]]]]
The architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client [extensively] to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. This information, known as a program or brief, is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner—it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows) and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines.

===Construction role===
Architects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]],  and review the progress of the work during construction. They typically review [[General contractor|contractor]] [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide construction contract administration and Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]). In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the work is required.

Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less inclusive (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions). With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting.

===Alternate practice and specializations===
Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, health care, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as [[building code]], [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], [[historic preservation]](US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.

Many architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], [[construction management]], [[interior design]] or other related fields.

==Professional requirements==
{{Main|Professional requirements for architects}}
Although there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.

Educational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.

Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]], or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search/surveyor surveyor],{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.

==Professional title distinctions==
According to the [[American Institute of Architects]],<ref>[http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf "http://www.aianova.org/pdf/BP_Arch_Positions.pdf"]</ref> titles and job descriptions within American architectural offices might be as follows:

==Fees==
{{See also|Earnings for architects}}
Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.

Overall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner or shareholder, etc.) and the size and location of the firm.

==Professional organizations==
{{main|List of professional architecture organizations}}
A number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture.

==Prizes, awards, and titles==
{{main|List of architecture prizes}}
A wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] are awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures and professional careers.

The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the "[[Nobel Prize]] for [[architecture]]." Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]], the [[Richard H. Driehaus Prize for Classical Architecture]], the [[Alvar Aalto Medal]] ([[Finland]]), the [[Carlsberg Architecture Prize]] ([[Denmark]]), and the [[Governor General's Awards#Governor General's Medals in Architecture|Governor General's Awards]] ([[Canada]]). 

Architects in the [[UK]] who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, might until 1971 be elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An Honorary Fellow may use the initials Hon. FRIBA. and an International Fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA.  Architects in the [[United States|US]] who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and can write [[FAIA]] after their name.   Architects in [[Canada]] who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made special contribution, after nomination and election by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), maybe elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name.
