'''Disbarment''' is the removal of a [[lawyer]] from a [[bar association]] or the [[practice of law]], thus revoking his or her [[law license]] or [[admission to practice law]]. Procedures vary depending on the [[law society]].

==In the U.S.==

===Overview===
{{Weasel|date=November 2012}}
Generally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a [[felony]] is automatically disbarred in most{{Where|date=November 2012}} jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the [[American Bar Association]], has been described as a convicted felon's <!-- DON'T "FIX" THIS TO JUST DESSERTS -->[[just deserts]]<!-- "Desert", from the same French root as deserve, meaning something deserved -->.<ref>{{citation|volume=13|publisher=Hastings Const. L.Q.|pages=433|date=1985-1986|title=Automatic Disbarment: A Convicted Felon's Just Deserts|author=Gentile, Michael A.; McShea, Sarah Diane}}</ref>

In the [[United States]] legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the [[bar association|bar]] in another jurisdiction. However, under the [[American Bar Association]]'s [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]], which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.

Disbarment is quite rare. Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.

Because disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.<ref name="reapply">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3975/is_200707/ai_n19511820/pg_2 | work=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics | title=Should Permanent Disbarment be Permanent? | year=2007 | first=Brian | last=Finkelstein | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>

[[F. Lee Bailey]], noted criminal defense attorney in the [[O.J. Simpson murder trial]], was disbarred by the state of Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book ''Florida Pulp Nonfiction'' details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case along with extended interviews with Bailey that include his own defense.<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7153568/</ref>
