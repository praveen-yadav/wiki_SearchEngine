'''Broadway''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɔː|d|w|eɪ}} is a street, avenue, and boulevard in the [[U.S. state]] of New York.  Perhaps best known for the boulevard portion that runs through the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, it actually runs {{convert|13|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through Manhattan and {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} through [[the Bronx]], exiting north from the city to run an additional {{convert|18|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} through the municipalities of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-On-Hudson]], [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]], [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and terminating north of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref>There are four other streets named "Broadway" in New York City's remaining three boroughs: one each in [[Brooklyn]] ([[Broadway (Brooklyn)|with its own article]]) and [[Staten Island]], and two in [[Queens]] (one running from [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to [[Elmhurst, Queens|Elmhurst]], and the other in [[Hamilton Beach, Queens|Hamilton Beach]]). Each borough therefore has a street named "Broadway".</ref> 

It is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in New York City, dating to the first [[New Amsterdam]] settlement. The name ''Broadway'' is the English literal translation of the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name, ''Breede weg''. Broadway is known worldwide as the heart of the [[Broadway theatre|American theatre industry]].<ref name="1776 NYC Map" />

== History ==
[[File:NewYorkCity1860.jpg|thumb|left|Broadway in 1860]]
[[Image:Broadway-1885-APL.jpeg|thumb|left|In 1885 the Broadway commercial district was overrun with telephone, telegraph, and electrical lines. This view was north from Cortlandt and [[Maiden Lane (Manhattan)|Maiden Lane]].]]
Broadway was originally the Wickquasgeck Trail, carved into the brush of Manhattan by its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Streets Where History Lives |first=Russell |last=Shorto|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E5DD1F3BF93AA35751C0A9629C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |quote=And what about a marker for the Wickquasgeck Trail, the Indian path that ran the length of the island, which the Dutch made into their main highway and the English renamed Broadway?
}}</ref> This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island. 

Upon the arrival of the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]], the trail soon became the main road through the island from ''Nieuw Amsterdam'' at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur [[David de Vries]] gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 ("the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily"). The Dutch named the road "''Heerestraat''".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Epic of New York City |author=Ellis, Edward Robb |publisher=Old Town Books |year=1966 |pages=26}}</ref> Although current street signs are simply labeled as "Broadway", in a 1776 map of New York City, Broadway is explicitly labeled "Broadway Street".<ref name="1776 NYC Map">See the map inset.

In the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of [[Wall Street]], where traffic continued up the [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]] of the island via [[Eastern Post Road]] and the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] via Bloomingdale Road.  The western Bloomingdale Road would be widened and paved during the 19th century, and called "The Boulevard" north of Columbus Circle.  On February 14, 1899. the name "Broadway" was extended to the entire Broadway/Bloomingdale/Boulevard road.<ref>[http://www.ny1.com/6-bronx-news-content/features/4215/february-14th-in-nyc-history February 14th in NYC History: 1899], referred to as "the 'Western' Boulevard"; called "the 'Grand' Boulevard" in ''The New York Times'', February 1869, quoted in Michael V. Susi, ''The Upper West Side'' "Introduction", 2009:7.</ref>

== Route ==
{{See also|U.S. Route 9 in New York}}
[[File:Proposed arcarde railway broadway NY 1868.jpg|thumb|Plan of 1868 for an "arcade railway".]]
Broadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, roughly parallelling the [[Hudson River]], from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] at the south, to [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] at the northern tip of the island. South of [[Columbus Circle]], it is a one-way southbound street.  Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at [[Times Square]] between 47th and 42nd Streets, and at [[Herald Square]] between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians.  From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] via the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] and continues through [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and [[the Bronx]] into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].  [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. 9]] continues to be known as Broadway through its junction with [[New York State Route 117|NY 117]].

Because Broadway preceded the grid that the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] imposed on the island, Broadway crosses [[midtown Manhattan]] diagonally, intersecting with both the east-west streets and north-south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by "[[town square|squares]]" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].

[[File:Upbroadway e.jpg|left|thumb|A view up Broadway from Bowling Green, with the [[Chrysler Building]] visible in the background]]
The section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s, and is sometimes called the "[[#Canyon of Heroes|Canyon of Heroes]]" during such events. West of Broadway as far as [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]] was the city's fashionable residential area until {{circa|1825}}; landfill has more than tripled the area and the Hudson shore now lies far to the west, beyond [[Tribeca|TriBeCa]] and [[Battery Park City]].

Broadway marks the boundary between [[Greenwich Village]] to the west and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] to the east, passing [[Astor Place (Manhattan)|Astor Place]]. It is a short walk from there to [[New York University]] near [[Washington Square Park]], which is at the foot of [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]]. A bend in front of [[Grace Church, New York|Grace Church]] allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.

At [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with 4th Avenue, and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner. Union Square is the only location wherein Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan.

At [[Madison Square]], location of the [[Flatiron Building]], Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]].

At Greeley Square (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] aka the Avenue of the Americas. 

[[Macy's]] Herald Square department store is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th St. and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.

[[Image:Broadway 38th Street at dus.jpg|thumb|upright|Broadway and 38th Street]]
One famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theater|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the Theater District or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline "Found on the Great White Way" in the February 3, 1902 edition of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area.

After becoming the city's de facto [[Red-light district|Red Light District]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.  Until June 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'', from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on June 15, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Copy! |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/weekinreview/10dunlap.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 10, 2007 |accessdate=October 10, 2008 |quote=The sound is muffled by wall-to-wall carpet tiles and fabric-lined cubicles. But it’s still there, embedded in the concrete and steel sinews of the old factory at 229 West 43rd Street, where The New York Times was written and edited yesterday for the last time.}}</ref>

At the southwest corner of [[Central Park]], Broadway crosses [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] (called Central Park West north of 59th Street) at [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]]; on the site of the former [[New York Coliseum]] convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the [[Time Warner Center]], headquarters of [[Time Warner]].

North of [[Columbus Circle]], Broadway becomes a wide [[boulevard]] to 169th Street; it retains planted [[median (road)|center islands]] as a vestige of the central mall of "The Boulevard" that became the spine of the [[Upper West Side]].

Broadway intersects with [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus Avenue]] (known as 9th Avenue south of [[59th Street (Manhattan)|West 59th Street]]) at West 65th-66th Streets where the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Lincoln Center]], both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as the [[Manhattan New York Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] are found.

It intersects with [[Amsterdam Avenue]]. (called 10th Avenue south of West 59th Street) at the intersection with West 71st-[[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd]] Streets, where the triangle of tiny [[Verdi Square]] is surrounded by several notable apartment buildings, including [[The Ansonia]], and the Florentine palazzo occupied by [[Apple Bank for Savings]].

At its intersection with West 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction, to continue directly uptown aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are [[the Apthorp]] and the [[First Baptist Church in the City of New York]] (1891), built for a Baptist congregation in New York since 1762. The road heads north passing such important apartment houses as [[the Belnord]], the [[Astor Court Building]], and the [[Art nouveau]] [[The Cornwall|Cornwall]].<ref>Horsley, Carter B. [http://www.thecityreview.com/uws/bway/cornwall.html "The Cornwall"] ''City Review''</ref><ref>{{cite AIA4}} p. 351</ref>

At 99th Street, Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of [[the Ariel]] East and West.

At 107th Street, Broadway intersects with [[West End Avenue]] (called [[11th Avenue (Manhattan)|11th Avenue]] south of West 59th Street) to form [[Straus Park]] with its Titanic Memorial by [[Augustus Lukeman]].

[[Image:Broadway in Inwood.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Broadway at Dyckman Street in Inwood]]
Further north, Broadway follows the old Bloomingdale Road as the main spine of the [[Upper West Side]], passing the campus of [[Columbia University]] at [[116th Street]] in [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], in part on the tract that housed the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum|Bloomingdale (Lunatic) Asylum]] from 1808 until it moved to [[Westchester County]] in 1894. Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the handsome, park-like campus of [[Barnard College]]. Next, the beautiful Gothic quadrangle of [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and the brick buildings of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] with their beautifully landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the [[Manhattan School of Music]]. Broadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of [[City College of New York|CUNY—City College]]; the beautiful Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the handsome [[brownstone]]s of Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Place is a surviving section of Bloomingdale Road, and originally the address of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s house [[Hamilton Grange National Memorial|The Grange]], now moved.<ref>Simmons, Eleanor Booth [http://myinwood.net/where-cobwebs-thrive-on-manhattan-isle/ Where Cobwebs Thrive on Manhattan Isle] ''New York Tribune;'' November 6, 1921</ref> 

Broadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown [[Trinity Church Cemetery]] and the former Trinity Chapel, now the [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)|Church of the Intercession]] near 155th Street. The springtime plantings in the median, maintained by [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], are spectacular.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. The intersection with [[Saint Nicholas Avenue (Manhattan)|Saint Nicholas Avenue]] at 167th Street forms [[Mitchell Square Park]]. At 178th Street, [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] becomes concurrent with Broadway.

Broadway crosses the [[Harlem River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]] to [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] and then enters [[the Bronx]], where it is the eastern border of [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and the western border of [[Van Cortlandt Park]]. At 253rd Street, [[New York State Route 9A|NY 9A]] joins with U.S. 9 and Broadway. (NY 9A splits off Broadway at Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers.) After leaving New York City, it is the main north–south street of western [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] through Sleepy Hollow (known as either North or South Broadway in most sections), before becoming [[Albany Post Road]] (and Highland Avenue) at the northern border of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

== Public transit ==
From south to north, Broadway at one point or another runs over or under the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], the [[BMT Broadway Line]], the [[IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line]], and the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]]:

* The IRT Lexington Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]] to [[Fulton Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] ({{NYCS Lexington south}} trains).
* The BMT Broadway Line runs under it from [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] to [[Times Square – 42nd Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Times Square – 42nd Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway}} trains).
* The IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line runs under and over Broadway from [[Times Square – 42nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square]] to [[168th Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh}} trains), and from 218th Street to its terminal in [[the Bronx]] at [[Van Cortlandt Park – 242nd Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|Van Cortlandt Park – 242nd Street]] ({{NYCS Broadway-Seventh north local}} train).
* The northern portion of the IND Eighth Avenue Line runs under Broadway from [[Dyckman Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Dyckman Street]] to [[Inwood – 207th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Inwood – 207th Street]] ({{NYCS Eighth far north}} train).

Early [[street railway]]s on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] ([[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]) and [[Times Square]] ([[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's [[Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line]] (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's [[Broadway Branch Line]] (1885?) between Times Square and [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]], and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line<!--when?--> north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's [[Broadway Line (Lower Manhattan surface)|Broadway Line]], a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]], with two cable branches: the [[Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]].

These streetcar lines were replaced with [[bus route]]s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the [[New York City Omnibus Company]]'s (NYCO) [[6 (NYCO)|6]] (Broadway below Times Square), [[7 (NYCO)|7]] (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and [[11 (NYCO)|11]] (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the [[Surface Transportation Corporation]]'s [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]] (Kingsbridge) and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]] (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]]'s (FACCo) [[4 (FACCo)|4]] and 5 used Broadway from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]]. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].

As of 2011, Broadway is now served by the [[M4 (New York City bus)|M4]] (ex-FACCo 4), [[M5 (New York City bus)|M5]] (ex-FACCo 5), [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] (ex-NYCO 7), [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]], and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]]. Other routes that use part of Broadway include the [[M10 (New York City bus)|M10]], [[M20 (New York City bus)|M20]], [[M60 (New York City bus)|M60]], [[Bx7 (New York City bus)|Bx7]], [[Bx9 (New York City bus)|Bx9]], and [[Bx20 (New York City bus)|Bx20]].

[[Bee-Line Bus System|Bee-Line]] buses also serves Broadway within Riverdale, the Bronx and Westchester County. Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13 and several others run on a portion of Broadway.

==Canyon of Heroes==
{{see also|List of ticker-tape parades in New York City}}
[[Image:Apollo 11 ticker tape parade 2.jpg|right|thumbnail|Canyon of Heroes during a ticker-tape parade for the [[Apollo 11]] [[astronaut]]s on August 13, 1969]]
'''''Canyon of Heroes''''' is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] that is the location of the city's [[ticker-tape parade]]s.

The traditional route of the parade is northward from [[Bowling Green (Manhattan)|Bowling Green]] to [[City Hall Park, Manhattan|City Hall Park]]. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.

While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the [[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] parade on August 14 and 15, 1945 – marking the end of [[World War II]] – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the [[New York City Department of Sanitation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Q & A: Today’s Giants Ticker-Tape Parade  |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/q-a-todays-giants-ticker-tape-parade/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2008}}</ref>

More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades.<ref>{{cite news |title=Super Bowl-Winning Giants Get Canyon of Heroes Honor |first=Fernanda |last=Santos |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/nyregion/11bloomberg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |quote=The plaque is one of the more than 200 granite strips in a route known as the Canyon of Heroes, marking those who have been honored by the city with ticker-tape parades.}}</ref>

The most recent parade up the Canyon of Heroes was on February 7, 2012 for the [[New York Giants]] in honor of their [[Super Bowl XLVI]] championship.

== Great White Way ==
[[Image:Broadway Plaza41 jeh.JPG|right|thumb|Plaza]]

"Great White Way" is a nickname for a section of Broadway in the [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] section of the New York City [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]], specifically the portion that encompasses the [[Theater District, New York|Broadway Theater District]], between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Streets]], and encompassing [[Times Square]].

In 1880, a stretch of Broadway between [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] and [[Madison Square]] was illuminated by [[Charles F. Brush|Brush]] [[arc lamp]]s, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1063</ref> By the 1890s, the portion from [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it "The Great White Way."<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p.1066</ref>  When the theater district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the [[Times Square]] area.

The phrase ''Great White Way'' has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by [[Albert Paine]].<ref name="bloom">Bloom, Ken. [http://books.google.com/books?id=GBiEO8q59f0C&pg=PA499&dq=%22great+white+way%22+Shep+Friedman&hl=en&ei=TDzQTNneAsKclgf-mOi9Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22great%20white%20way%22%20Shep%20Friedman&f=false Broadway: its history, people, and places : an encyclopedia], p.499 (2003) (ISBN 978-0415937047)</ref>  The headline "Found on the Great White Way" appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the ''[[New York World-Telegram|New York Evening Telegram]]''.<ref name="bloom"/>

A portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and "The Great White Way" late at night appeared in "Artist In Manhattan"(1940)<ref>Jerome Myers, Artist in Manhattan, New York: American Artists Group, Inc. 1940.</ref> written by the painter-writer [[Jerome Myers]]:

::Early morn on Broadway, the same light that tips the mountain tops of the Colorado canyons gradually discloses the quiet anatomy, the bare skeletons of the huge iron signs that trellis the sky, now denuded of the attractions of the volcanic night. Almost lifeless, the tired entertainers of the night clubs and their friends straggle to their rooms, taximen compare notes and earnings, the vast street scene has had its curtain call, the play is over.

::Dear old Broadway, for many years have I dwelt on your borders. I have known the quiet note of your dawn. Even earlier I would take my coffee at Martin's, at 54th Street–now, alas, vanished–where I would see creatures of the night life before they disappeared with the dawn.

::One night a celebrated female impersonator came to the restaurant in all his regalia, directly from a club across the street. Several taximen began to poke fun at him. Unable any longer to bear their taunts, he got up and knocked all the taximen out cold. Then he went back to the club, only to lament under his bitter tears, "See how they've ruined my dress!"

::Gone are the old-time Broadway oyster bars and chop houses that were the survivors of a tradition of their sporting patrons, the bon vivants of Manhattan. Gone are the days when the Hoffman House flourished on Madison Square, with its famous nudes by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]; when barrooms were palaces, on nearly every corner throughout the city; when [[Steve Brodie (bridge jumper)|Steve Brodie]], jumping from [[Brooklyn Bridge]], splashed the entire country with publicity; when [[Bowery]] concert halls dispensed schooners of beer for a nickel, with a stage show thrown in; when Theis's Music Hall still resounded on 14th Street with its great mechanical organ, the wonder of its day, a place of beauty, with fine paintings and free company and the frankest of female life. Across the street was [[Tammany Hall]], and next to it [[Tony Pastor]]'s, where stars of the stage were born. Tony himself, in dress clothes and top hat, sang his ballads, a gallant trouper introducing [[Lillian Russell]] and others to fame through his audience.

== Modern traffic flow ==
Broadway was once a [[two-way street]] for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs [[one-way traffic|one-way]] southbound south of [[Columbus Circle]] ([[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] became southbound and [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and [[Times Square]] (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes.<ref>{{cite news |title=7th and 8th Aves.

In August 2008, two traffic lanes from 42nd to 35th Streets were taken out of service and converted to public plazas. Additionally, bike lanes were added on Broadway from 42nd Street down to [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]].<ref>{{cite news |title=City to Make Two Broadway Lanes Bikes, Walkers Only for Seven Blocks |first=Pete |last=Donohue |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/07/10/2008-07-10_city_to_make_two_broadway_lanes_bikes_wa.html |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=New York |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref> <ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/broadwayblvd.pdf Broadway Boulevard I]</ref>

Since May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city.  The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010.  Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses.<ref>{{cite news |title=New York Traffic Experiment Gets Permanent Run |first=Michael M. |last=Grynbaum |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12broadway.html |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}</ref> The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road.

In May 2013, the [[New York City Department of Transportation|NYCDOT]] decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic. <ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]</ref>
