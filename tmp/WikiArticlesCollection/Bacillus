'''''Bacillus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Gram-positive]], rod-shaped [[bacteria]] and a member of the phylum [[Firmicutes]]. ''Bacillus'' species can be obligate [[aerobe]]s or [[facultative aerobes|facultative anaerobes]], and test positive for the [[enzyme]] [[catalase]].<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Turnbull PCB | title = Bacillus. ''In:'' Barron's Medical Microbiology ''(Baron S ''et al.'', eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.925 | isbn = 978-0-9631172-1-2 }}</ref> Ubiquitous in nature, ''Bacillus'' includes both free-living and [[pathogen]]ic species. Under stressful environmental conditions, the cells produce oval [[endospore]]s that can stay dormant for extended periods. These characteristics originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many have been moved to other genera.<ref name=Brock>{{cite book | author = Madigan M; Martinko J (editors). | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-13-144329-1 }}</ref>

[[Bacteria]] of the genus ''Bacillus'' are known to form intracellular inclusions of [[polyhydroxyalkanoates]] under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).

==Industrial significance==
Many ''Bacillus'' species are able to [[secretion|secrete]] large quantities of enzymes. ''[[Bacillus amyloliquefaciens]]'' is the source of a natural antibiotic protein [[barnase]] (a [[ribonuclease]]), [[alpha amylase]] used in starch hydrolysis, the [[protease]] [[subtilisin]] used with detergents, and the [[BamH1]] [[restriction enzyme]] used in DNA research.

A portion of the ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' genome was incorporated into corn (and cotton) crops. The resulting [[GMO]]s are therefore resistant to some insect pests.

==Use as model organism==
''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' is one of the best understood prokaryotes, in terms of molecular biology and cell biology. Its superb genetic amenability and relatively large size have provided the powerful tools required to investigate a bacterium from all possible aspects. Recent improvements in fluorescence microscopy techniques have provided novel and amazing insight into the dynamic structure of a single cell organism. Research on ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' has been at the forefront of bacterial molecular biology and cytology, and the organism is a model for differentiation, gene/protein regulation, and cell cycle events in bacteria.<ref name=Graumann>{{cite book | author = Graumann P (editor). | title = Bacillus: Cellular and Molecular Biology | edition = 2nd | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2012 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/bacillus | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/bacillus ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-97-4}}</ref>

==Clinical significance==
Two ''Bacillus'' species are considered medically significant: ''[[Bacillus anthracis|B. anthracis]]'', which causes [[anthrax]], and ''[[Bacillus cereus|B. cereus]]'', which causes a [[foodborne illness]] similar to that of ''[[Staphylococcus]]''.<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}</ref> A third species, ''[[B. thuringiensis]]'', is an important [[insect]] pathogen, and is sometimes used to control insect pests. The [[type species]] is ''[[Bacillus subtilis|B. subtilis]]'', an important [[model organism]]. It is also a notable food spoiler, causing ropiness in bread and related food. Some environmental and commercial strains ''[[Bacillus coagulans|B. coagulans]]'' may play a role in food spoilage of highly acidic, tomato based products.

An easy way to isolate ''Bacillus'' is by placing nonsterile soil in a [[test tube]] with water, shaking, placing in melted [[mannitol salt agar]], and incubating at room temperature for at least a day. Colonies are usually large, spreading and irregularly shaped. Under the microscope, the ''Bacillus'' cells appear as rods, and a substantial portion usually contain an oval [[endospore]] at one end, making it bulge.

== Cell wall ==
The cell wall of ''Bacillus'' is a structure on the outside of the cell that forms the second barrier between the bacterium and the environment, and at the same time maintains the rod shape and withstands the pressure generated by the cell's [[turgor]]. The cell wall is composed of [[teichoic acid|teichoic]] and teichuronic acids. ''B. subtilis'' is the first bacterium for which the role of an [[actin]]-like [[cytoskeleton]] in cell shape determination and [[peptidoglycan]] synthesis was identified, and for which the entire set of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes was localised. The role of the cytoskeleton in shape generation and maintenance is important.<ref name=Scheffers>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/bacillus |author=Scheffers DJ|chapter=The Cell Wall of Bacillus subtilis | title = Bacillus: Cellular and Molecular Biology 2e (Graumann P, ed.)| publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2012 | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/bacillus ] |isbn=978-1-904455-97-4}}</ref>

==Phylogeny==
The genus ''Bacillus'' was coined in 1835 by [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] (who coined the genus ''[[Bacterium (genus)|Bacterium]]'' seven years prior) to contain rod-shaped bacteria, later amended by [[Ferdinand Cohn]] to spore-forming, Gram-positive/variable, rod-shaped bacteria.<ref>COHN (F.): Untersuchungen über Bakterien. Beitrage zur Biologie der Pflanzen Heft 2, 1872, 1, 127-224.</ref> Like other genera associated with the early history of microbiology, such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Vibrio]]'', members of the ''Bacillus'' genus (266 species<ref>{{lpsn|b/bacillus.html|Bacillus}}</ref>) are found ubiquitously, and it is one of the genera with the largest [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] diversity and environmental diversity.

Several studies have tried to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. The ''Bacillus''-specific study with the most diversity covered is by Xu and Cote' using 16S and the ITS region, where they divide the genus into 10 groups, which includes the nested genera ''Paenibacillus, Brevibacillus, Geobacillus, Marinibacillus'' and ''Virgibacillus''.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1099/Ijs.0.02346-0}}</ref> However, the tree [http://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/living_tree/LTP_release_104/LTPs104_SSU_tree.pdf] constructed by [['The All-Species Living Tree' Project|the living tree project]], a collaboration between ARB-Silva and [[LPSN]] where a 16S (and 23S if available) tree of all validated species was constructed,<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/J.Syapm.2008.07.001}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.syapm.2010.08.001}}</ref> the genus ''Bacillus'' contains a very large number of nested taxa and majorly in both 16S and 23S it is paraphyletic to Lactobacillales (''Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Listeria'', etc.), due to ''[[Bacillus coahuilensis]]'' and others. A gene concatenation study found similar results to Xu and Cote', but with a much more limited number of species in terms of groups,<ref name="Alcaraz2010">{{cite doi|10.1186/1471-2164-11-332}}</ref> but used ''Listeria'' as an outgroup, so in light of the ARB tree, it may be "inside-out".

One clade, formed by ''B. anthracis'', ''B. cereus'', ''B. mycoides'', ''B. pseudomycoides'', ''B. thuringiensis'' and ''B. weihenstephanensis'' under current classification standards, should be a single species (within 97% 16S identity), but due to medical reasons, they are considered separate species,<ref>Ole Andreas Økstad and Anne-Brit Kolstø [http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-7686-4_2#page-1 Chapter 2: Genomics of Bacillus Species] in M. Wiedmann, W. Zhang (eds.), Genomics of Foodborne Bacterial Pathogens, 29 Food Microbiology and Food Safety. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011 DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-7686-4_2</ref>{{rp|34–35}} an issue also present for four species of ''[[Shigella]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.<ref>BRENNER (D.J.): Family I.
