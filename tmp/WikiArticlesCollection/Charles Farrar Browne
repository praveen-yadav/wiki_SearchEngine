==Biography==
Browne was born in [[Waterford, Maine]]. He began life as a compositor and occasional contributor to the daily and weekly journals. In 1858, he published in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]) the first of the "Artemus Ward" series, which, in a collected form, achieved great popularity in both America and [[England]]. In 1860, he became editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'', a humorous New York weekly, which proved a failure. About the same time, he began to appear as a lecturer and, by his droll and eccentric humor, attracted large audiences.

"Artemus Ward" was the favorite author of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Before presenting "[[The Emancipation Proclamation]]" to his Cabinet, Lincoln read to them the latest episode, "Outrage in Utiky", also known as ''High-Handed Outrage at Utica''. 

Ward is also said to have inspired [[Mark Twain]] when Ward performed in [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Nevada]]. Legend has it that, following Ward's stage performance, he, Mark Twain, and [[Dan De Quille]] were taking a drunken rooftop tour of Virginia City until a town constable threatened to blast all three of them with a [[shotgun]] loaded with [[rock salt]].

In 1866, Ward visited England, where he became exceedingly popular both as a lecturer and as a contributor to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. In the spring of the following year, Ward's health gave way and he died of [[tuberculosis]] at Southampton on March 6, 1867.

After initially being buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], Ward's remains were removed to the United States on May 20, 1868. He is buried at Elm Vale Cemetery in Waterford, Maine.
