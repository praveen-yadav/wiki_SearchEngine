'''Carl Linnaeus''' (23 May<ref group=note name=birthdate /> 1707 – 10 January 1778), also known after his [[Swedish nobility|ennoblement]] as {{Audio|sv-Carl_von_Linné.ogg|'''Carl von Linné'''}},<ref name="Blunt171">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 171.</ref> was a Swedish [[botanist]], physician, and [[zoologist]], who laid the foundations for the modern biological naming scheme of [[binomial nomenclature]]. He is known as the father of modern [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]], and is also considered one of the fathers of modern ecology. Many of his writings were in [[Latin]], and his name is rendered in Latin as '''{{lang|la|Carolus Linnæus}}''' (after 1761 '''Carolus a Linné''').

Linnaeus was born in the countryside of [[Småland]], in southern Sweden. Linnaeus received most of his higher education at [[Uppsala University]], and began giving lectures in [[botany]] there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published a first edition of his ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of medicine and botany at [[Uppsala]]. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 60s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe.

The Swiss philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] sent him the message: "Tell him I know no greater man on earth."<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |work=Linné on line |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> The German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] wrote: "With the exception of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly."<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Swedish author [[August Strindberg]] wrote: "Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist".<ref name="deceased">{{cite web |url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/9_0.html |title=Linnaeus deceased |publisher=[[Uppsala University]] |work=Linné on line |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Among other compliments, Linnaeus has been called ''{{lang|la|Princeps botanicorum}}'' (Prince of Botanists), "The [[Natural History (Pliny)|Pliny]] of the North," and "The Second [[Adam#Creation|Adam]]".<ref name="Broberg7">[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 7.</ref>

In botany, the [[Author citation (botany)|author abbreviation]] used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for species' names is '''L.'''<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Plant Names Index]] |work=Author Details |url=http://www.ipni.org/ipni/idAuthorSearch.do?id=12653-1 |title=Linnaeus, Carl (1707–1778) |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> In older publications, sometimes the abbreviation "Linn." is found (for instance in: [[s:Manual of the New Zealand Flora|Cheeseman, T.F. (1906) - ''Manual of the New Zealand Flora'']]). Linnaeus' remains comprise the [[holotype|type specimen]] for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'', following the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], since the sole specimen he is known to have examined when writing the species description was himself.<ref group=note name=holotype>[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/] ICZN Chapter 16, Article 72.4.1.1 - "For a nominal species or subspecies established before 2000, any evidence, published or unpublished, may be taken into account to determine what specimens constitute the type series." and Article 73.1.2 - "If the nominal species-group taxon is based on a single specimen, either so stated or implied in the original publication, that specimen is the holotype fixed by monotypy (see Recommendation 73F).

==Biography==

===Early life===

====Childhood====
[[File:LA2-Rashult-2.jpg|thumb|right|Birth place of Linnaeus at [[Råshult]]]]

Carl Linnaeus was born in the village of [[Råshult]] in [[Småland]], Sweden on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus and Christina Brodersonia. His father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the [[patronymic]] naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the [[University of Lund]], he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant [[linden tree]] (or lime tree), ''{{lang|sv|lind}}'' in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead.<ref name="Blunt12">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 12.</ref> This name was spelled with the [[æ]] [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linnæus, with his father's family name. The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications.<ref name="Blunt13">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 13.</ref> Carl's patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus.

One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur [[botanist]], a [[Lutheran]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], and the [[curate]] of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland. Christina was the daughter of the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius. She subsequently gave birth to three daughters and another son, Samuel (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on [[beekeeping]]).<ref name="Blunt12"/><ref name="Stöver8">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 8.</ref><ref name="Broberg10">[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 10.</ref> A year after Linnaeus' birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the [[rectory]] from the curate's house.<ref name="Blunt13"/><ref name="nationalgeographic2007">[[#Quammen|Quammen (2007)]], p. 1.</ref>

Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.<ref name="Blunt15">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 15.</ref>

====Early education====
Linnaeus' father began teaching him Latin, religion, and geography at an early age; one account says that due to family use of Latin for conversation, the boy learned Latin before he learned Swedish. When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local [[yeoman]]. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander "was better calculated to extinguish a child's talents than develop them."<ref name="Blunt15-16">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 15–16.</ref> Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower [[Grammar School]] at [[Växjö]] in 1717.<ref name="Stöver5">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 5.</ref> Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden. He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at [[Katedralskolan, Växjö|Katedralskolan]] (a [[Gymnasieskola|gymnasium]]) in Växjö. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine.<ref name="Blunt16">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 16.</ref><ref name="Stöver5-6">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 5–6.</ref> At the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical literature. He remarks in his journal "read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh Månsson's Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz's Flora Åboensis, [[Johannes Palmberg|Palmberg's Serta Florea Suecana]],  Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis...."  <ref>Carl von Linnés betydelse såsom naturforskare och läkare : skildringar utgifna af Kungl. Vetenskapsakademien i anledning af tvåhundraårsdagen af Linnés födelse|http://runeberg.org/linne200ar/linnebotan/0007.html</ref>

Linnaeus entered the Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, where he studied mainly [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[theology]] and [[mathematics]], a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood.<ref name="Stöver6">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 6.</ref><ref name="Blunt16-17">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 16–17.</ref> In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him [[physiology]] and botany. Nils accepted this offer.<ref name="Blunt17-18">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 17–18.</ref><ref name="Stöver8-11">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 8–11.</ref>

===University===

==== Lund ====
[[File:Carl von Linné i Lund.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Linnaeus as a University student in [[Lund]]]]

Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort's]] system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to [[Sébastien Vaillant]].<ref name="Blunt17-18"/> In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in [[Lund University]] in [[Skåne]].<ref name="Blunt18">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 18.</ref><ref name="Stöver13">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 13.</ref> He was registered as ''{{lang|la|Carolus Linnæus}}'', the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.<ref name="Blunt171"/>

Professor [[Kilian Stobæus]], natural scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures.<ref name="Blunt21-22">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 21–22.</ref><ref name="Stöver15">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 15.</ref> In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne, together with students sharing the same interests.<ref name="Stöver14-15">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 14–15.</ref>

====Uppsala====
[[File:Linné-Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pollination]] depicted in ''{{lang|la|Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum}}'' (1729)]]
In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend [[Uppsala University]] on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: [[Olof Rudbeck the Younger]] and [[Lars Roberg]]. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state.<ref name="Blunt23-25">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 23–25.</ref> In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, [[Olof Celsius]], who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist.<ref name="Blunt31-32">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 31–32.</ref> He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden.<ref name="Stöver19-20">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 19–20.</ref>

In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, ''{{lang|la|Praeludia Sponsaliorum Plantarum}}'' on [[plant sexual reproduction]]. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people.<ref name="Blunt32-34">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 32–34.</ref> In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius' house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions.<ref name="Blunt34-37">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 34–37.</ref> Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of [[stamen]]s and [[pistil]]s. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Critica Botanica}}''. He also produced a book on the plants grown in the [[Linnaean Garden|Uppsala Botanical Garden]], ''{{lang|la|Adonis Uplandicus}}''.<ref name="Blunt2001-36-37">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 36–37.</ref>

Rudbeck's former assistant, [[Nils Rosén von Rosenstein|Nils Rosén]], returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus' botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Rosén gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a "disagreement" with Rudbeck's wife and had to move out of his mentor's house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.<ref name="Blunt2001-36-37"/><ref name="Anderson40">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 40.</ref>

===Expedition to Lapland===
{{main|Expedition to Lapland|Flora Lapponica}}
[[File:Carolus Linnaeus by Hendrik Hollander 1853.jpg|thumb|upright|Linnaeus in the traditional dress of the [[Sami people]] of [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]], holding the [[twinflower]] that became his personal emblem]]

During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]]; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native [[Sami people]], reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the [[Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala]] for his journey.<ref name="Anderson42-43">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 42–43.</ref><ref name="Blunt2001-38">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 38.</ref>

Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala in May; he travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and [[ornithological]] manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near [[Gävle]] he found great quantities of ''Campanula serpyllifolia'', later known as ''[[Linnaea borealis]]'', the twinflower that would become his favourite.<ref name="Blunt2001-42-43">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 42–43.</ref> He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock<ref name="Anderson43-44">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 43–44.</ref> and was particularly interested in [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s, the latter a main part of the diet of the [[reindeer]], a common and economically important animal in Lapland.<ref name="Anderson46">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 46.</ref>

Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], making major inland incursions from [[Umeå]], [[Luleå]] and [[Tornio]]. He returned from his six-month long, over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks.<ref name="Blunt2001-63-65">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 63–65.</ref><ref name="Blunt39-42">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 39–42.</ref><ref name="Broberg29">[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 29.</ref> Although Lapland was a region with limited [[biodiversity]], Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book ''{{lang|la|[[Flora Lapponica]]}}''.<ref name="nationalgeographic1">[[#Quammen|Quammen (2007)]], p. 2.</ref><ref name="Stöver38-39">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 38–39.</ref>

In ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'' Linnaeus' ideas about [[nomenclature]] and [[Biological classification|classification]] were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern [[Flora]].<ref name="Frodin_p27"/> The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] who attributed Linnaeus with ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'' as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian [[Edward Lee Greene|E. L. Greene]] described ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'' as "the most classic and delightful" of Linnaeus's works.<ref name="Frodin_p27">[[#Frodin|Frodin (2001)]], p. 27.</ref>

It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a [[Eureka effect|flash of insight]] regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was traveling, Linnaeus remarked: "If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds."<ref name="Blunt2001-54">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 54.</ref>

====Dalarna====
In 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to [[Dalarna]]. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at [[Røros]].<ref name="Broberg29"/>

===European excursions===
[[File:Karte Linne.png|thumb|right|Cities where Linnaeus worked; those outside Sweden were only visited during 1735–1738.]]

====Doctorate====
Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' relations with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in [[Falun]] with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun.<ref name="Blunt2001-74">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 74.</ref> Sohland's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the [[Dutch Republic]] and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.<ref name="Blunt2001-78-79">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 78–79.</ref>

In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the [[Netherlands]], with Linnaeus to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the [[University of Harderwijk]].<ref name="Stöver71">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 71.</ref> On the way, they stopped in [[Hamburg]], where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] remains of a seven-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast of Revelation]]. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.<ref name="Anderson60-61">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 60–61.</ref><ref name="Blunt90">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 90.</ref>

[[File:Albertus Seba - Hydra.jpg|thumb|left|The Hamburg Hydra, from the ''{{lang|la|Thesaurus}}'' (1734) of [[Albertus Seba]]]]
When Linnaeus reached [[Harderwijk]], he began working toward a degree immediately; at the time, Harderwijk was known for awarding "instant" degrees after as little as a week.<ref name="Blunt94"/> First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden, which he then defended in a public debate. The next step was to take an oral examination and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28.<ref name="Anderson60-61"/><ref name="Blunt94">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=N54GuRxlgrMC&pg=PA94 p. 94].</ref> During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, [[Peter Artedi]]. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the [[canals of Amsterdam]], and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.<ref name="Anderson66">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 66.</ref><ref name="Blunt98-100">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 98–100.</ref>

====Publishing of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''====
One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Johan Frederik Gronovius]] to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}''.<ref name="Blunt98">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 98.</ref><ref name="Anderson62-63">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 62–63.</ref>

Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, [[Herman Boerhaave]], who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist [[Johannes Burman]]. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest's knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his ''{{lang|la|Thesaurus Zeylanicus}}''. Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working: ''{{lang|la|Fundamenta Botanica}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Bibliotheca Botanica}}''.<ref name="Blunt100-102">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 100–102.</ref>

In August, during Linnaeus' stay with Burman, he met [[George Clifford III]], a director of the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of [[Hartekamp]] in [[Heemstede]]. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus' ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane's]] ''Natural History of Jamaica'', a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted.<ref name="Anderson64">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 64.</ref><ref name="Stöver81-82">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 81–82.</ref> On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus became the botanical curator and house physician at Hartekamp, free to buy any book or plant he wanted.

In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford's expense.<ref name="Blunt106-107">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 106–107.</ref> He went to London to visit [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]], a collector of natural history, and to see his [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinet]],<ref name="Stöver89">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 89.</ref> as well as to visit the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] and its keeper, [[Philip Miller]]. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''. Miller was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus' system.<ref name="Stöver89-90">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 89–90.</ref> Linnaeus also traveled to Oxford University to visit the botanist [[Johann Jacob Dillenius]]. He failed, however, to make Dillenius publicly accept his new classification system. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants.<ref name="Stöver90-93">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 90–93.</ref> The next year, he published ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'', in which he described 935 [[genera]] of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with ''{{lang|la|Corollarium Generum Plantarum}}'', with another sixty (''sexaginta'') genera.<ref name="Stöver95">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 95.</ref>

His work at Hartekamp led to another book, ''{{lang|la|[[Hortus Cliffortianus]]}}'', a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.<ref name="Blunt100-102"/> It contains the first use of the name ''[[Nepenthes]]'', which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of [[pitcher plants]].<ref>[[#Veitch|Veitch (1897)]]</ref><ref group=note name=nepenthes>"If this is not Helen's ''[[Nepenthe]]s'', it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator!" (translated from Latin by [[Harry Veitch]])</ref>

Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as [[Antoine de Jussieu]]. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.<ref name="Blunt123">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], p. 123.</ref><ref name="Koerner56">[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 56.</ref>

===Return to Sweden===
[[File:LinnaeusWeddingPortrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Wedding portrait of Linnaeus]]

When Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to [[Falun]], where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family.<ref name=nrm.se>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrm.se/researchandcollections/botany/phanerogamicbotany/botanicalhistory/carlvonlinne.4.5fdc727f10d795b1c6e80007524.html |title=Carl Linnaeus |accessdate=3 April 2010 |author=Louise Petrusson |publisher=[[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] }}</ref><ref name="Stöver141">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 141.</ref> Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with [[Carl Gustav Tessin|Count Carl Gustav Tessin]], who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty.<ref name="Stöver146-147">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 146–147.</ref><ref name="Koerner16">[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 16.</ref> During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]]; he became the first [[Praeses]] in the academy by drawing of lots.<ref name="Koerner103-105">[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], pp. 103–105.</ref>

Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, [[Carl Linnaeus the Younger|Carl]]. Two years later, a daughter, [[Elisabeth Christina von Linné|Elisabeth Christina]], was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died when 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.<ref name=nrm.se/><ref name="Stöver382">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 382.</ref>

[[File:CarlvonLinne house.jpg|thumb|left|The Linnaeus house in [[Uppsala]]]]
In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and [[natural history]], instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala.<ref name="Gribbin49-50">[[#Gribbin|Gribbin & Gribbin (2008)]], pp. 49–50.</ref>

===Further exploration of Sweden===

==== Öland and Gotland ====
Ten days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of [[Öland]] and [[Gotland]] with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to [[Visby]] in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in ''{{lang|sv|Öländska och Gothländska Resa}}'', written in Swedish. Like ''{{lang|la|Flora Lapponica}}'', it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland.<ref name="Koerner115">[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 115.</ref><ref name="Blunt137-142">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 137–142.</ref>

During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books: ''{{lang|la|Flora Suecica}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Fauna Suecica}}''. ''{{lang|la|Flora Suecica}}'' was a strictly botanical book, while ''{{lang|la|Fauna Suecica}}'' was [[zoology|zoological]].<ref name=nrm.se/><ref name="Stöver117-118">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 117–118.</ref> [[Anders Celsius]] had created the temperature scale [[Celsius|named after him]] in 1742. Celsius' scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0 °C and freezing point at 100 °C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard.<ref name="Koerner204">[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 204.</ref>

====Västergötland====
In the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of [[Västergötland]]. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book ''{{lang|sv|Wästgöta-Resa}}'', published the next year.<ref name="Koerner115"/><ref name="Blunt159">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 159.</ref> After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province [[Scania]]. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy.<ref name=nrm.se/>

In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title [[archiater]], or chief physician, by the Swedish king [[Adolf Frederick of Sweden|Adolf Frederick]]—a mark of great respect.<ref name="Blunt165">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 165.</ref> The same year he was elected member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences in Berlin]].<ref name="Stöver167">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], p. 167.</ref>

====Scania====
In the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to [[Scania]], again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow [[walnut]] and [[Sorbus intermedia|Swedish whitebeam]] trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus' observations were published the next year in ''{{lang|sv|Skånska Resa}}''.<ref name="Blunt198-205">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 198–205.</ref><ref name="Koerner116">[[#Koerner|Koerner (1999)]], p. 116.</ref>

===Rector of Uppsala University===
[[File:CarlvonLinne Hammarby.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|The Linnaeus summer home at his Hammarby estate]]
[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|right|The Linnaean garden in Uppsala]]

In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed.<ref name=nrm.se/> Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his "apostles".<ref name="Gribbin56-57">[[#Gribbin|Gribbin & Gribbin (2008)]], pp. 56–57.</ref> His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.<ref name="Blunt206">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 173–174.</ref>

==== Publishing of ''{{lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}'' ====
Linnaeus published ''{{lang|la|[[Philosophia Botanica]]}}'' in 1751. The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden.<ref name="Blunt221">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 221.</ref>

==== Publishing of ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'' ====
Linnaeus published ''{{lang|la|[[Species Plantarum]]}}'', the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern [[botanical nomenclature]], in 1753.<ref name="Stace_p24">[[#Stace|Stace (1991)]], [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&pg=PA24 p. 24].</ref> The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August<ref>[[#ICBN|ICBN (Vienna Code)]], [http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0017Ch2Sec4a013.htm Art. 13.5, ex. 13.3].</ref> of the same year.{{#tag:ref|The date of issue of both volumes was later, for practical purposes, arbitrarily set on 1 May, see Stearn, W.T.

He was then seldom seen not wearing the order.<ref name="Blunt166">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 166.</ref>

====Ennoblement====
Linnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added.<ref name="Koerner116"/><ref name="Blunt219">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 219.</ref> In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.<ref name="Blunt220-224">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 220–224.</ref>

Since the initial release of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for [[zoological nomenclature]], the equivalent of ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}''.<ref name="Gribbin47"/><ref name="Blunt6">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 6.</ref>

The Swedish king Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus [[nobility]] in 1757, but he was not [[ennobled]] until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linné (Latinized as ''{{lang|la|Carolus a Linné}}''), 'Linné' being a shortened and [[French language|gallicised]] version of 'Linnæus', and the German title '[[von]]' signifying his ennoblement.<ref name="Blunt171"/> The noble family's [[coat of arms]] prominently features a twinflower, one of Linnaeus' favourite plants; it was given the scientific name ''Linnaea borealis'' in his honour by [[Jan Frederik Gronovius|Gronovius]]. The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the center is an egg "to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated ''in ovo''." At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the [[Aeneid]], which reads "{{Allcaps|Famam extendere factis}}": we extend our fame by our deeds.<ref name="Blunt199">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 199.</ref><ref name="Blunt229-230">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 229–230.</ref><ref name="Gribbin62">[[#Gribbin|Gribbin & Gribbin (2008)]], p. 62.</ref>

After his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, [[Catherine II of Russia]] sent him seeds from her country.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_0.html Uppsala University, Linné Online], English language version</ref> He also corresponded with [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], "the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire", who was a doctor and a botanist in [[Idrija]], [[Duchy of Carniola]] (nowadays [[Slovenia]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/soban.htm |title=A Living Bond between Idrija and Uppsala |first=Branko |last=Soban |newspaper=The Slovenian |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the [[olm]] and the [[dormouse]], two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected him and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, ''[[Scopolia]]'', the source of [[scopolamine]], after him. Because of a great distance, they didn't ever meet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/soban.htm |title=A Living Bond between Idrija and Uppsala |accessdate=2007-12-01 |last=Soban |first=Branko |month=January |year=2005 |work=Slovenija.svet  |publisher=Slovene Emigrant Association}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Scopoli, Giovanni Antonio|title=Joannes A.

===Last years===
[[File:LinnéUppsalaDom.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Headstone]] of Carl Linnaeus and his son [[Carl Linnaeus the Younger]]]]

Linnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after.<ref name=nrm.se/> He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.<ref name="Koerner56"/><ref name="Blunt245">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 245.</ref>

Linnaeus' last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Rosén. He developed [[sciatica]] in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him.<ref name="Blunt232">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 232.</ref> He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognize himself as their author.<ref name="Stöver243-245">[[#Stöver|Stöver (1974)]], pp. 243–245.</ref><ref name="Broberg42">[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], p. 42.</ref>

In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby.<ref name="Blunt245"/><ref name="Gribbin63">[[#Gribbin|Gribbin & Gribbin (2008)]], p. 63.</ref> Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was interred in [[Uppsala Cathedral]] on 22 January.<ref name="nationalgeographic4">[[#Quammen|Quammen (2007)]], p. 4.</ref><ref name="Anderson104-106">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 104–106.</ref>

His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. [[Joseph Banks]], an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. However, in 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, [[James Edward Smith]], who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the [[Linnean Society of London]] five years later.<ref name="Anderson104-106"/><ref name="Blunt2001-238-240">[[#Blunt2001|Blunt (2001)]], pp. 238–240.</ref>

==Apostles==
{{Main|Apostles of Linnaeus}}
[[File:Pehr Forsskål portrait (cropped and color balanced).png|thumb|upright|left|[[Peter Forsskål]] was among the apostles who met a tragic fate abroad.]]

During Linnaeus' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught [[List of students of Linnaeus|many devoted students]], 17 of whom he called "apostles". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition.<ref name="Blunt189-190">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 189–190.</ref> To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished.<ref name="Broberg37-39">[[#Broberg|Broberg (2006)]], pp. 37–39.</ref> Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland.<ref name="Anderson92-93">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 92–93.</ref> The British botanist [[William T. Stearn]] notes without Linnaeus' new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens.<ref name="Blunt184-185">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 184–185.</ref> Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.

===Early expeditions===
Christopher Tärnström, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a [[Swedish East India Company]] ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on [[Côn Sơn Island]] the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström.<ref name="Blunt185-186">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 185–186.</ref> Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including [[Pehr Forsskål]] and [[Pehr Löfling]].<ref name="Blunt184-185"/>

Two years after Tärnström's expedition, Finnish-born [[Pehr Kalm]] set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in ''Species Plantarum'' had been brought back by Kalm.<ref name="Anderson93-94">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], pp. 93–94.</ref>

===Cook expeditions and Japan===
[[File:Mortimer - Captain James Cook, Sir Joseph Banks, Lord Sandwich, Dr Daniel Solander and Dr John Hawkesworth.jpg|thumb |right |Apostle [[Daniel Solander]] (far left) with [[Joseph Banks]] (left, sitting) accompanied [[James Cook]] (centre) on his journey to Australia.]]
[[Daniel Solander]] was living in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist [[Joseph Banks]]. With Banks, Solander joined [[James Cook]] on his expedition to Oceania on the ''[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' in 1768–71.<ref name="Anderson96">[[#Anderson|Anderson (1997)]], p. 96.</ref><ref name="Blunt191-192">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 191–192.</ref> Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; [[Anders Sparrman]] followed on the ''[[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]]'' in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.<ref name="Blunt192-193">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 192–193.</ref>

Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of [[Dejima]] outside [[Nagasaki]], so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.<ref name="Blunt193-194">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], pp. 193–194.</ref>

==Major publications==
{{Main|Carl Linnaeus bibliography}}

===''Systema Naturae''===
[[File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturæ'']] (1758)]]

{{Main|Systema Naturae|10th edition of Systema Naturae}}

The first edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work.<ref name="SystNat1">[[#L1735|Linnaeus (1735)]]</ref> By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. In it, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as "''{{lang|la|Physalis annua ramosissima, ramis angulosis glabris, foliis dentato-serratis}}''", were supplemented with concise and now familiar "binomials", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet – in the case given, ''[[Physalis angulata]]''. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as [[binomial nomenclature]], was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see [[Gaspard Bauhin]] and [[Johann Bauhin]]) almost 200 years earlier,<ref>[[#Windelspecht|Windelspecht (2002)]], p. 28.</ref> Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.

===''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}''===
{{Main|Species Plantarum}}

''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum}}'' (or, more fully, ''{{lang|la|Species Plantarum, exhibentes plantas rite cognitas, ad genera relatas, cum differentiis specificis, nominibus trivialibus, synonymis selectis, locis natalibus, secundum systema sexuale digestas}}'') was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of [[botanical nomenclature|plant nomenclature]] as it exists today.<ref name="Stace_p24"/>

====''{{lang|la|Genera Plantarum}}''====
{{Main|Genera Plantarum}}

''{{lang|la|Genera plantarum: eorumque characteres naturales secundum numerum, figuram, situm, et proportionem omnium fructificationis partium}}'' was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition.<ref name="Stace_p22">[[#Stace|Stace (1991)]], [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&pg=PA22 p. 22].</ref> In it Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 24 classes. One, [[Cryptogamia]], included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns).<ref name="Hoek, Mann and Jahns 95">[[#Hoek|Van den Hoek ''et al.'' (2005)]].</ref>

====''{{lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}''====
{{Main|Philosophia Botanica}}

''{{lang|la|Philosophia Botanica}}'' (1751) was a summary of Linnaeus' thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in ''{{lang|la|[[Fundamenta Botanica]]}}'' (1736) and ''{{lang|la|[[Critica Botanica]]}}'' (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his ''{{lang|la|[[Classes Plantarum]]}}'' and ''{{lang|la|[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]}}'': all were printed in Holland (as well as ''{{lang|la|[[Genera Plantarum]]}}'' (1737) and ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}'' (1735)), the ''Philosophia'' being simultaneously released in Stockholm.<ref>[[#Stafleu|Stafleu (1971)]], p. 157.</ref>

==Linnaean collections==
At the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in [[Uppsala]] was considered as one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by [[Carl Gyllenborg]] (in 1744–1745), crown-prince [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|Adolf Fredrik]] (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and [[Jonas Alströmer]] (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalized and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum.<ref name="Wallin, L. 2001">[http://www.evolutionsmuseet.uu.se/samling/UUZM04_Linnaeus.pdf Wallin, L. 2001.] Catalogue of type specimens. 4. Linnaean specimens. - pp. [1], 1-128. Uppsala. (Uppsala University, Museum of Evolution, Zoology Section).</ref>

In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his countryhouse at [[Linnaeus Hammarby|Hammarby]] near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.

In Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linné's son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linné's death his son confirmed that mice had caused "horrible damage" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage.<ref name="Dance, S.P. 1967">Dance, S.P. 1967. Report on the Linnaean shell collection. - Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London 178 (1): 1-24, Pl. 1-10.</ref> He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father's later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material.

In 1784 the botanist [[James Edward Smith]] purchased from the inheritants (the widow and daughter of Carl Linnaeus) nearly all of the Linnean private scientific effects and transferred them to London.<ref>Jackson, B. D. 1923. Linnaeus (afterwards Carl von Linné), the story of his life. Adapted from the Swedish of Theodor Magnus Fries. - pp. I-XV [= 1-15], 1-416. London. (Witherby).</ref> Not all material in Linné's private collection was transported to England. 33 fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent away and were later lost.

In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection, he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away.<ref>Examples are evident in the [http://resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de/purl?PPN603451020 Portland catalogue p. 76 Lot 1715 and p. 188 Lot 3997.] "A catalogue of the Portland Museum, lately the property of the Duchess Dowager of Portland, deceased: Which will be sold by auction by Mr. Skinner and Co.

[1]. [London]. (Skinner).</ref> Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.<ref name="Dance, S.P. 1967" />

Much material which had been intensively studied by Linné in his scientific career belonged to the collection of [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Queen Lovisa Ulrika]] (1720–1782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as "Museum Ludovicae Ulricae" or "M. L. U."). This collection was donated by his grandson [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|King Gustav IV Adolf]] (1778–1837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband [[Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden|King Adolf Fredrik]] (1710–1771) (in the Linnean sources known as "Museum Adolphi Friderici" or "Mus. Ad. Fr."), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and is today housed in the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] at [[Stockholm]]. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala.<ref name="Wallin, L. 2001" />

==Linnaean taxonomy==
[[File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png|thumb|right|Table of the Animal Kingdom (''{{lang|la|Regnum Animale}}'') from the 1st edition of ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae|Systema Naturæ]]}}'' (1735)]]

{{Main|Linnaean taxonomy}}

The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature.<ref name="Reveal 1993 p. 160-161">[[#Reveal|Reveal & Pringle (1993)]], p.&nbsp;160–161.</ref> During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the ''Linnaean taxonomy''; the system of [[scientific classification]] now widely used in the [[biology|biological sciences]].

The Linnaean system classified nature within a [[nested hierarchy]], starting with three [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]. Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera (''singular:'' genus), which were divided into Species (''singular:'' species).<ref>[[#Simpson|Simpson (1961)]], p.&nbsp;16–19.</ref> Below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower (unnamed) [[taxonomic rank|rank]]; these have since acquired standardised names such as ''variety'' in botany and ''subspecies'' in zoology.  Modern taxonomy includes a rank of [[Family (biology)|family]] between order and genus and a rank of [[phylum]] between kingdom and class that were not present in Linnaeus' original system.<ref name="Davis 1973 p. 17">[[#Davis|Davis & Heywood (1973)]], p. 17.</ref>

Linnaeus' groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not simply upon differences.<ref name="Davis 1973 p. 17"/> Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.<ref name="Reveal 1993 p. 160-161"/><ref>[[#Simpson|Simpson (1961)]], p.&nbsp;56–57.</ref> While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid "observable characteristics" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, [[DNA sequencing]], unavailable in Linnaeus' time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their [[Phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]]), the fundamental principle remains sound.

== Views on mankind ==
According to German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]], the question of man's origin began with Linnaeus. He helped future research in the natural history of man by describing humans just as he described any other plant or animal.<ref name="Frängsmyr156-157">[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], pp. 156–157.</ref> He was the first person to place humans in a system of biological classification{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

=== {{anchor|Biological Family}} Anthropomorpha ===
[[File:Antropomorpha12c.png|thumb|left|Detail from the 6th edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' (1748) describing ''[[Anthropomorpha|Ant[h]ropomorpha]]'' with a division between ''Homo'' and ''Simia''.]]

Linnaeus classified humans among the [[primate]]s (as they were later called) beginning with the first edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}''. During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man.<ref name="Gribbin56-57">[[#Gribbin|Gribbin & Gribbin (2008)]], pp. 173–174.</ref> He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences.<ref name="Frängsmyr170">[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.''

(1983)]], p. 167, quotes Linnaeus explaining the real difference would necessarily be absent from his classification system, as it was not a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristic: ''"I well know what a splendidly great difference there is [between] a man and a ''bestia'' [literally, "beast"; that is, a non-human animal] when I look at them from a point of view of [[morality]]. Man is the animal which the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]] has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent [[mind]] and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life"''.

''It does not please [you] that I've placed [[human|Man]] among the [[Anthropomorpha]], perhaps because of the term 'with human form',<ref group=note>"antropomorphon" {{sic}}</ref> but man learns to [[know thyself|know himself]]. Let's not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a [[genus|generic]] difference between man and [[simia]]n that [follows] from the principles of [[Natural history|Natural History]].<ref group=note>Others who followed were more inclined to give humans a special place in classification; [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] in the first edition of his ''Manual of Natural History'' (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the [[Quadrumana]] (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and [[Bimana]] (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably [[Georges Cuvier]]. Some elevated the distinction to the level of [[order (biology)|order]]. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates – and especially the great apes – made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote, in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871:
<br />
<blockquote>''The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Blumenbach]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm Bischoff|Bischoff]], [[Christoph Theodor Aeby|Aeby]], and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.''</blockquote></ref> I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the [[theology|theologians]] against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.''</blockquote>

The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the [[great chain of being]], and second, because the Bible says man was created in the [[image of God]]<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|1:26–1:27|9}}</ref> ([[theomorphism]]), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept.<ref name="Frängsmyr171-172">[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], pp. 171–172.</ref> The conflict between [[world view]]s based on science and [[theology]] that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, [[creation–evolution controversy]] began in earnest with the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859.

After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of ''{{lang|la|Systema Naturae}}'' introduced new terms, including ''Mammalia'' and ''Primates'', the latter of which would replace ''Anthropomorpha''<ref name="Frängsmyr175">[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], p. 175.</ref> as well as giving humans the full binomial ''Homo sapiens''.<ref name="Blunt8">[[#Blunt|Blunt (2004)]], p. 8.</ref> The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place to rule over nature, not be a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it.<ref name="Frängsmyr191-192">[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.'' (1983)]], pp. 191–192.</ref> In his book ''{{lang|la|Dieta Naturalis}}'', he said, "One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a [[soul]] and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility."<ref name="Frängsmyr166">[[#Frängsmyr|Frängsmyr ''et al.''

==Commentary on Linnaeus==
[[Andrew Dickson White]] wrote in ''[[wikiquote:A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom|A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896):
<blockquote>
Linnaeus&nbsp;... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking.&nbsp;... Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his ''Systema Naturæ'' he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works.&nbsp;... warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.<ref>[[Andrew Dickson White]], ''History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom'' (1922) [http://books.google.com/books?id=8EXID2XVPzEC& Vol.1] pp.&nbsp;59–61</ref>
