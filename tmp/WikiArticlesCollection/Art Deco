'''Art Deco'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑr|t|_|ˈ|d|ɛ|k|oʊ}}), or '''Deco''', is an influential [[visual arts]] design style which first appeared in [[France]] after [[World War I]], flourishing internationally in the 1930s and 1940s before its popularity waned after [[World War II]].<ref name="Hillier1">{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=Art Deco of the 20s and 30s | publisher=Studio Vista | year=1968 | page=12 | isbn= 978-0-289-27788-1}}</ref> It is an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style that combines traditional [[craft]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] with [[Machine Age]] imagery and materials. The style is often characterized by rich colors, bold [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes, and lavish ornamentation.

Deco emerged from the [[Interwar period]] when rapid industrialization was transforming culture. One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology. This distinguishes Deco from the [[Organic (model)|organic]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] favored by its predecessor [[Art Nouveau]].

Historian [[Bevis Hillier]] defined Art Deco as "an assertively modern style [that] ran to symmetry rather than asymmetry, and to the rectilinear rather than the curvilinear; it responded to the demands of the machine and of new material [and] the requirements of mass production".<ref name="Hillier3">{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=Art Deco of the 20s and 30s | publisher=Studio Vista | year=1968 | isbn= 978-0-289-27788-1}}</ref>

During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.

==Etymology==
The first use of the term Art Deco has been attributed to architect [[Le Corbusier]], who penned a series of articles in his journal ''L'Esprit nouveau'' under the headline ''1925 Expo: Arts Déco''. He was referring to the 1925 [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] (International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts).<ref name="Benton 2003 16">{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Charlotte | last2=Benton | first2=Tim | last3=Wood | first3=Ghislaine | title=Art Deco: 1910–1939 | publisher=Bulfinch | year=2003 | page=16 | isbn=978-0-8212-2834-0}}</ref>

The term came into more general use in 1966, when a French exhibition celebrating the 1925 event was held under the title ''Les Années 25: Art Déco/Bauhaus/Stijl/Esprit Nouveau''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Bayer | first=Patricia | title=Art Deco Architecture: design, decoration and detail from the twenties and thirties | publisher=Thames & Hudson | location=London | year=1992 | page=12}}</ref> Here the term was used to distinguish the new styles of French decorative crafts that had emerged since the [[Belle Epoque]].<ref name="Benton 2003 16"/> The term Art Deco has since been applied to a wide variety of works produced during the [[Interwar period]] (''L'Entre Deux Guerres''), and even to those of the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany. However Art Deco originated in France. It has been argued that the term should be applied to French works and those produced in countries directly influenced by France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10453 |title=Suzanne Tise, Museum of Modern Art, MoMA, Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian [[Bevis Hillier]] published the first book on the subject: ''Art Deco of the 20s and 30s''.<ref name="Hillier3">{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=Art Deco of the 20s and 30s | publisher=Studio Vista | year=1968 | isbn= 978-0-289-27788-1}}</ref> Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites The Times (2 November 1966) and an essay on ''Les Arts Déco'' in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage.<ref>{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Charlotte | last2=Benton | first2=Tim | last3=Wood | first3=Ghislaine | title=Art Deco: 1910–1939 | publisher=Bulfinch | year=2003 | page=430 | isbn=978-0-8212-2834-0}}</ref> In 1971 Hillier organized an exhibition at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], which she details in her book about it, ''The World of Art Deco''.<ref name="Hillier4">{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=The World of Art Deco: An Exhibition Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, June- September 1971 | publisher=E.P.

Some historians trace Deco's roots to the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exposition of 1900]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/soci-t-des-artistes-d-corateurs  |title=Société des Artistes Décorateurs: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com | accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> After this show a group of artists established an informal collective known as ''La Société des artistes décorateurs'' (Society of Decorator Artists) to promote French crafts. Among them were [[Hector Guimard]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Raoul Lachenal]], [[Paul Bellot]], Maurice Dufrêne, and Emile Decoeur. These artists are said to have influenced the principles of Art Deco.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Art Deco">{{cite book |last=Duncan | first=Alastair |title=Encyclopedia of Art Deco |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |year= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-7472-0083-3 }}</ref>

The Art Deco era is often anecdotally dated from 1925 when the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] was organized to showcase new ideas in [[applied arts]].,<ref name="Benton 2003 16"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Scarlett |last2=Townley |title=Arts Décoratifs 1925: A Personal Recollection of the Paris Exhibition |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |year=1975 |isbn=0-85670-257-9 }}</ref><ref name="Design Handbook">{{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 | accessdate=06/11/08}}</ref><ref name="Paris 1925 Exhibition">{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1157_art_deco/virtual/gallery1/paris1925.htm|title=The Paris 1925 Exhibition |publisher=V&A Publishers | accessdate=30 October 2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081104151656/http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1157_art_deco/virtual/gallery1/paris1925.htm  |archivedate=4 November 2008 <!--DASHBot-->  |deadurl=no}}</ref> although the style had been in full force in France for several years before that date. Deco was heavily influenced by pre-modern art from around the world, and observable at the [[Musée du Louvre]], [[Musée de l'Homme]] and the [[Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie]]. During the 1920s affordable travel permitted ''in situ'' exposure to other cultures. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] etc. Artists and designers integrated  [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] from ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[Asia]], [[Mesoamerica]], and [[Oceania]] with [[Machine Age]] elements.<ref name="Essential Art Deco">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ghislaine |title=Essential Art Deco |publisher=VA&A Publications |location=London |isbn=0-8212-2833-1}}</ref><ref name="Design: A Concise History">{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: A Concise History |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |year=1998 |edition=1 }}</ref><ref name="Art Deco Style">{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm  |title=Art Deco Style |publisher=Museum of London |accessdate=6 November 2008 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081026194631/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm  | archivedate=26 October 2008 <!--DASHBot--> | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |title=Art Deco Study Guide |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum | accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081025210428/http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html  | archivedate=25 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->  |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html  |title=Introduction to Art Deco|last=Juster |first=Randy |publisher=decopix.com |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081029202446/http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html  |archivedate=29 October 2008 <!--DASHBot--> | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="University Times">{{cite journal |date=9 October 2003 |title=How Art Deco came to be |journal=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh |volume=36 |issue=4 |url=http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&-lay=a&-format=d.html&storyid=1754&-Find | accessdate=07/11/2008}}</ref>

In 1905, before the onset of Cubism, [[Eugène Grasset]] wrote and published ''Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6109619d |title=Eugène Grasset, '&#39;Méthode de composition ornementale, Éléments rectilignes'&#39;, 1905, Librarie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, Paris (in French) |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> within which he systematically explores the decorative (ornamental) aspects of [[geometry|geometric]] elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating [[Art Nouveau]] style of [[Hector Guimard]], so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stresses the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eugène Grasset, '&#39;Méthode de composition ornementale'&#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

At the 1907 [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris, [[Georges Braque]] exhibited ''Viaduc à l'Estaque'' (a proto-Cubist work), now at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. Simultaneously, there was a retrospective exhibition of 56 works by [[Paul Cézanne]], as a tribute to the artist who died in 1906. Cézanne was interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone.

[[Paul Iribe]] created for the couturier [[Paul Poiret]] esthetic designs that shocked the Parisian milieu with its novelty. These illustrations were compiled into an album, ''Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe'', published in 1908.<ref>''Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe'', P. Poiret, 1908, Paris</ref>

[[File:Théâtre des Champs-Élysées DSC09330.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], 15 Avenue Montaigne, Paris. Opened in 1913, designed by French architect [[Auguste Perret]], with bas-reliefs [[Antoine Bourdelle]]]]
At the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]] [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], shown together in Room 18, elaborated upon Cézannian syntax, revealing to the general public for the first time a 'mobile perspective' in their art, soon to become known as [[Cubism]]. Several months later the Salon d'Automne saw the invitation of Munich artists who for several years had been working with simple geometric shapes. Leading up to 1910 and culminating in 1912, the French designers [[André Mare]] and Louis Sue turned towards the quasi-mystical [[Golden ratio]], in accord with Pythagorean and Platonic traditions, giving their works a Cubist sensibility.

Between 1910 and 1913, Paris saw the construction of the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]], 15 [[avenue Montaigne]], another sign of the radical aesthetic change experienced by the Parisian milieu of the time. The rigorous composition of its facade, designed by [[Auguste Perret]], is a major example of early Art Deco.<ref>[http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/france/paris/review-97513.html Théâtre des Champs-Élysées Review]  Fodor's Travel Guide</ref><ref>Peter Collins, Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture, New York, Horizon Press, 1959</ref> The building includes an exterior [[bas relief]] by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[Édouard Vuillard]] and Jacqueline Marval, and a stage curtain design by [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]].

The artists of the [[Section d'Or]] exhibited (in 1912) works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion designers, furniture and interior designers.<ref>''La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000</ref>

These revolutionary changes occurring at the outset of the 20th century are summarized in the 1912 writings of André Vera. ''Le Nouveau style'', published in the journal ''L'Art décoratif'' expressed the rejection of Art Nouveau forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque), and called for ''simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie''; themes that would eventually become ubiquitous within the context of Art Deco.<ref>André Vera, ''Le Nouveau style'', published in L'Art décoratif, January 1912, pp. 21-32</ref>

Order, color and geometry: the essence of Art Deco vocabulary was made manifest before 1914.

Several years after [[World War I]], in 1927, Cubists [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Henri Laurens]], the sculptor [[Gustave Miklos]], and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], designed by the architect Paul Ruaud, and owned by the French fashion designer [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]]: also a collector of [[Post-Impressionist]] and [[Cubist]] paintings (including [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]], which he bought directly from Picasso's studio).

===La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)===
In the Art Décoratif section of the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as ''Maison Cubiste'' (Cubist House), signed [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]] and [[André Mare]] along with a group of collaborators. "Mare's ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence", writes Christopher Green, "creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metiznger themselves, but of [[Marie Laurencin]], the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare's old friends [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]]".<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=%22maison+cubiste%22+1912&source=bl&ots=jv-hGOpwJc&sig=0m8pM6Oi2mPGtmB6uB0Fe3s9YAQ&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22maison%20cubiste%22%201912&f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900-1940, Chapter 8, Modern Spaces; Modern Objects; Modern People, 2000]</ref> 

''La Maison Cubiste'' was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the ''Salon Bourgeois'', where paintings by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marie Laurencin]] and [[Fernand Léger]] were hung—and a bedroom. It was an early example of ''L'art décoratif'', a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade.<ref>[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324a.html La Maison Cubiste, 1912]</ref> This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston,<ref>[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]</ref> listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled ''"Facade architectural, plaster"'' (''Façade architecturale'').<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Duchamp-Villon's ''Façade architecturale'', 1913]</ref><ref>[http://archive.org/stream/catnter00unse/catnter00unse_djvu.txt "Catalogue of international exhibition of modern art: at the Armory of the Sixty-ninth Infantry, 1913, Duchamp-Villon, Raymond, ''Facade Architectural'']</ref>

Art Deco was a globally popular style and affected many areas of design. It was used widely in consumer products such as automobiles, furniture, cookware, china, textiles, jewelry, clocks, and electronic items such as radios, telephones, and [[jukebox]]<nowiki/>es. It also influenced [[architecture]], [[interior design]], [[industrial design]], [[fashion]], [[graphic arts]], and [[Film|cinema]].

==Streamline Moderne==
{{main |Streamline Moderne}}

A style related to Art Deco is Streamline Moderne (or Streamline) which emerged during the mid-1930s. Streamline was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for [[aviation]] and [[ballistics]] to reduce air friction at high velocities. Designers applied these principles to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings.<ref name="Design: A Concise History">{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: A Concise History |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |year=1998 |edition=1}}</ref>

One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122–124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}}</ref>

Streamlining quickly influenced [[automotive design]] and evolved the rectangular [[Brass Era car|"horseless carriage"]] into sleek vehicles with aerodynamic lines, [[symmetry]], and V-shapes. These designs continued to be popular after [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

==Surviving examples==

===United States===
The U.S. has many examples of art-deco architecture. New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles have many art deco buildings: The famous skyscrapers are the best-known, but notable art deco buildings can be found in various neighborhoods. Detroit's many examples of art-deco architecture include the [[Fisher Building|Fisher]], [[Guardian Building|Guardian]] and [[Penobscot Building|Penobscot]] Buildings, all of which are now [[National Historic Landmark]]s. Los Angeles' art-deco architecture is particular along [[Wilshire Boulevard]], a main thoroughfare that experienced a period of intense construction activity during the 1920s. Notable examples include the [[Bullocks Wilshire]] building and the [[Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre]], built in 1929 and 1931 respectively. Both buildings experienced recent restoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/no-56-bullocks-wilshire-building.html|title=Big Orange Landmarks No. 56 |last=Bariscale|first=Floyd|year=2007|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2008/02/no-118-pellissier-building.html|title=Big Orange Landmarks No. 118 |last=Bariscale|first=Floyd|year=2008|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

[[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]], Florida, has a large collection of art-deco buildings, with some thirty blocks of hotels and apartment houses dating from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1979, the [[Miami Beach Architectural District]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpl.org/ |title=Our Mission Statemente |publisher=Miami Design Preservation League |date= |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Nearly all the buildings have been restored and painted in their original pastel colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamibeach-usa.com/miami-beach-art-deco/|title=Miami Beach Art Deco|last=Brown|first=Joseph|year=2009|publisher=Miami Beach Magazine|accessdate=15 February 2010|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100131160841/http://www.miamibeach-usa.com/miami-beach-art-deco/|archivedate= 31 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>

Art deco was popular during the later years of the [[movie palace]] era of theatre construction.  Excellent examples of art deco theatres, such as the [[Fargo Theatre]] in [[Fargo, North Dakota]] and [[The Campus Theatre]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]] still exist throughout the United States.

[[Fair Park]], located in Dallas, Texas, is a large collection of art deco structures. Much of the art deco heritage of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], Oklahoma remains from that city's [[History of Tulsa, Oklahoma#Second main era of oil production: 1915-1930|oil boom days]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/artdeco/|title=Tulsa’s Art Deco Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Tulsa Reservation Commission|accessdate=7 November 2008|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081023195740/http://tulsapreservationcommission.org/artdeco/|archivedate= 23 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Houston]], Texas has some buildings surviving, such as the [[Houston City Hall]], the [[JPMorgan Chase Building (Houston, Texas)|JPMorgan Chase Building]], [[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]], and the [[1940 Air Terminal Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstondeco.org |title=Houston Deco |publisher=Houston Deco |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> In [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], the [[Jefferson County Courthouse (Texas)|Jefferson County Courthouse]], [[Kyle Building]] and the [[First National Bank Building (Beaumont, Texas)|First National Bank Building]] are some of the few art deco buildings still in the city.

[[Hoover Dam]] is a somewhat unusual example of art deco design. Many dam guides state that the design was to be [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], including the installation of gargoyles with water shooting out of their mouths.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  The recently opened [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts|Smith Center]] in [[Downtown Las Vegas]] incorporates many design elements from Hoover Dam and, therefore, is a contemporary example of the use of art deco design elements.

[[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] is home to the [[Kansas City Power and Light Building]], which was completed in 1931. This building is a good example of the [[Great Depression]] and its effect on art deco construction. Original plans were for a twin tower to be built next to it on its west side. However, it was never built due to financial constraints. As a result, the {{convert|476|ft|m|adj=on}} tower has a bare west side, with no windows. Other examples of art deco buildings in Kansas City include [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)]], the [[Jackson County Courthouse (Kansas City, Missouri)]], [[Kansas City City Hall]]; and [[909 Walnut]].

[[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] has the [[Foshay Tower]], which was finished in 1929.  The building was built right before the [[Great Depression]] and is one of, if not the only obelisk shaped office building in the world.  Minneapolis also has the [[Rand Tower]] and the [[Wells Fargo Center (Minneapolis)|Wells Fargo Center]], an example of modern art deco architecture. Neighboring [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] has the [[First National Bank Building (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|First National Bank Building]] and the [[Saint Paul City Hall]].  The city of [[Rochester, Minnesota]] houses the [[Plummer Building]], the original building for the world-famous [[Mayo Clinic]], which was built in 1927.

[[Cincinnati]], Ohio, houses the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal|Cincinnati Union Terminal]], an art-deco-style passenger railroad station that began operation in 1933. After the decline of railroad travel, most of the building was converted to other uses. It now serves as the Cincinnati Museum Center, which serves more than one million visitors per year and is the 17th most visited museum in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincymuseum.org/explore_our_sites/union_terminal/history/ |title=Cincinnati Union Terminal – History |accessdate=3 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url= http://cincymuseum.org/information_center/press_room/press_releases/nationalmedal.asp |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101028084733/http://cincymuseum.org/information_center/press_room/press_releases/nationalmedal.asp |archivedate= 2010-10-28 |date=5 October 2009 |title=Cincinnati Museum Center Receives Nation's Highest Award for Community Service |publisher=Cincinnati Museum Center |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Cincinnati is also home to the [[Carew Tower]], a 49-story art deco skyscraper built in 1931.

In 2005, the largest residential restoration project in the country and the largest collection of art deco buildings in [[New Jersey]] began at the {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site of the former [[Beacon, Jersey City|Jersey City Medical Center]]. The conversion of the national historic site to a residential enclave had as of 2009 been completed on three of the several buildings on the site.

[[Flint, Michigan]] is also home to [[The Paterson Building]]. The Paterson Building has extensive art deco throughout the interior and exterior.

[[Syracuse, New York]] is home to the [[Niagara Mohawk Building]], completed in 1932 and listed as a National Historic Landmark. Niagara Mohawk was considered in the 1930s to be the nation's most powerful electricity supplier, thus the building emphasiszed a vast futuristic look with an electric style embedded into it.

===Canada===
In Canada Art Deco structures that survives are mainly in urban centres like [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. They range from public buildings like [[Vancouver City Hall]] to commercial buildings ([[College Park (Toronto)]]) to public works ([[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]]). Toronto hosts the vast majority of Art Deco buildings built and surviving. In Montréal, the Salle Ernest Cormier at Université de Montréal is considered an example of the Art Deco style. The beautiful style ended just as soon as World War 2 started. The age of cheaper construction began because the main concern at the time was the war. Hamilton boasts a large collection of Art Deco buildings as well. [[Hamilton GO Centre]] is the only example of Art Deco [[railway station]] architecture in Canada. Other buildings include: The [[Pigott Building]], an 18 storey condominium (1929), The Sunlife Building, The Bell Telephone Baker Exchange (first telephone exchange in the [[British Empire]], 1929), Dominion Public Building refurbished into the John Sopinka Courthouse (1936), and The Hamilton Port Authority (1953).

===Latin America===
[[File:Kavanagh.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kavanagh building]], [[Buenos Aires]]. 1934 design by Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos, Luis María de la Torre.]]
Some of the finest surviving examples of art deco art and architecture are found in Cuba, especially in [[Havana]]. The [[Bacardi Building (Havana)|Bacardi Building]] is noted for its particular art deco style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n18/Bacardi.html|title=Bacardi Building Sports Spirited Design|last=Fernandez|first=Enrique|year=2005|publisher=Miami Herald|accessdate=4 November 2008|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081017043339/http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues2/2005/vol09n18/Bacardi.html|archivedate= 17 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The style is expressed by the architecture of residences, businesses, hotels, and many pieces of decorative art, furniture, and utensils in public buildings, as well as in private homes.<ref name="Hillier3"/>

Another country with many examples of art deco architecture is Brazil, especially in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Goiânia]] and cities like [[Cipó]] ([[Bahia]]), [[Iraí]] ([[Rio Grande do Sul]]) and [[Rio de Janeiro]], especially in [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]]. Also in the Brazil's north-east – notably in cities such as [[Campina Grande]] in the state of [[Paraíba]] – there are art deco buildings which have been termed "Sertanejo Art Deco" because of their peculiar architectural features.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://art-deco-sertanejo.com/english//|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041207160622/http://art-deco-sertanejo.com/english//|archivedate=7 December 2004|title=Art Deco Sertanejo|last=Rossi|first=Lia|coauthors=José Marconi de Souza|year=2002|accessdate=7 November 2008}}</ref> The reason for the style being so widespread in Brazil is its coincidence with the fast growth and radical economic changes of the country during the 1930s.

In [[Santiago, Chile]], the Hotel Carrera (no longer a hotel) is a very fine example of art deco architecture. Art deco buildings are also numerous in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, including the [[Palacio Salvo]], which was South America's tallest building when it was built in the late 1920s. Another example of art deco in Latin America is the [[Edificio El Moro]] in Mexico which has the [[Loteria Nacional]] nowadays, it was also the biggest building of Mexico City at the time it was completed
[[File:Edificio El Moro 2010.JPG|thumb|upright|Edificio El Moro, Mexico City. 1945 design by Manuel Ortiz Monasterio, Bernardo Calderón, Luis Ávila and José Antonio Cuevas.]]

In Argentina, architect [[Alejandro Virasoro]] introduced art deco in 1926 and developed the use of reinforced concrete, with the Banco El Hogar Argentino and the Casa del Teatro (both in [[Buenos Aires]]) being his most important works. The [[Kavanagh building]] (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure at its time, and a notable example of late art deco style. In the [[Buenos Aires Province]], architect [[Francisco Salamone]] designed cemetery portals, city halls and slaughterhouses commissioned by the provincial government in the 1930s; his designs combined art deco with futurism. In [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], the [[Palacio Minetti]] is the most representative art deco piece.

During the 1930s, art deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom,<ref name="Art Deco Style">{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm|title=Art Deco Style|publisher=Museum of London|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081026194631/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm|archivedate= 26 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref> as well as the design of various public buildings.<ref name="Design Handbook" /> Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.<ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)">{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm|title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)|last=Heindorf|first=Anne|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081026194631/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm|archivedate= 26 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm|title=Art Deco Buildings|year=2007|publisher=london-footprints.co.uk|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081211074839/http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm|archivedate= 11 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php|title=Art Deco in Frinton on sea|year=2006|publisher=Art Deco Classics|accessdate=6 November 2008|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081201132519/http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php|archivedate= 1 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>

In London, the former [[Arsenal Stadium]] has the famous East Stand facade. It remains at the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal football club]]'s old home at [[Highbury]], [[London Borough of Islington]], which was vacated in the summer of 2006. Opened in October 1936, the structure now has [[Listed building|Grade II listed status]] and has been converted into [[Highbury Square|apartments]]. William Bennie, the organizer of the project, famously used the art deco style in the final design which was considered one of the most opulent and impressive stands of world football. The [[London Underground]] is also famous for many examples of art deco architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes – Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC  |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>

[[Du Cane Court]], in Balham, south-west London, is a good example of the art deco style. It was thought to be possibly the largest block of privately owned apartments under one roof in Britain at the time it was built, and the first to employ pre-stressed concrete. It has a grand reception area and is surrounded by Japanese-style gardens; and it has had many famous residents, especially from the performing arts. Elsewhere in south-west London, is the famous [[Battersea Power Station]], which has appeared in films and artwork including the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album [[Animals (Pink Floyd album)]]. Partially built in the 1930s, the building retains its powerful Art Deco facade.

In [[North West England]], the [[Midland Hotel, Morecambe]] is considered one of the finest surviving examples from this period, with famous sculptures by artist [[Eric Gill]]. The buildings and structures related to the [[Queensway Tunnel]] which connects [[Liverpool]] and [[Birkenhead]] are also distinctly Art Deco. Other notable Art Deco buildings in Liverpool include [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]] and the former terminal building at Liverpool Airport—now the [[Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel|Crowne Plaza LJLA]].

In north east England, the [[Wills Building]], an old cigarette factory, is a fine art deco building built in the late 1940s in Newcastle upon Tyne.

====Spain====
[[Valencia]] was built profusely in art deco style during the period of economic bounty between wars in which Spain remained neutral. Particularly remarkable are the famous bath house Las Arenas, the building hosting the rectorship of the [[University of Valencia]] and the cinemas Rialto (currently the Filmoteca de la [[Generalitat Valenciana]]), Capitol (reconverted into an office building) and Naruto.

====Germany====
[[File:Berlin, Mitte, Schuetzenstrasse, Mosse-Zentrum 05.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Mossehaus]] with Art Deco elements by [[Erich Mendelsohn]] from 1923. Jerusalemer Str., [[Berlin]]]]

In [[Germany]] two variations of art deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neue Sachlichkeit]] (New Objectivity) employed the same curving horizontal lines and nautical motifs that are known as [[Streamline Moderne]] in the Anglophone world. While Neue Sachlichkeit was rather austere and reduced (eventually merging with the [[Bauhaus]] style), [[Expressionist architecture]] came up with a more emotional use of shapes, colors and textures, partly reinterpreting shapes from the Germany and Baltic [[Brick Gothic]] style. Notable examples are [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s ''[[Mossehaus]]'' and ''[[Schaubühne]]'' theater in [[Berlin]], [[Fritz Höger]]'s ''[[Chilehaus]]'' in [[Hamburg]] and his ''[[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]]'' in Berlin, the ''Anzeiger Tower'' in [[Hannover]] and the ''Borsig Tower'' in Berlin. Art deco architecture was revived in the late-20th century by architects like [[Hans Kollhoff]] (see his tower on [[Potsdamer Platz]]), Jan Kleihues and Tobias Nöfer.

====Norway====

An example of art deco in Norway is found in the [[Student Society in Trondheim]] (built 1927-29). It's interior is based on an abandoned circus, so that the exterior exhibits a characteristic round shape.

====Romania====
As a result of the inter-war period of rapid development, cities in Romania have numerous art deco buildings, including government buildings, hotels, and private houses. The best representative in this regard is the capital, [[Bucharest]], which, despite the widespread destruction of its architecture during [[Communism in Romania#Heavy industrialisation|Communist times]], still has many art deco examples, both on its main boulevards and in the lesser known parts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html |title=Bucharest Art Deco |date=5 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100823224530/http://www.rezistenta.net/2010/08/perspective-21-art-deco-bucurestean.html|archivedate= 23 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/05/arhitectura-interbelica-modernista-in.html |title=Inter-war modernist architecture |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bucharestunknown.blogspot.com/2010/03/bijuterii-art-deco-in-bucuresti.html |title=Art Deco jewels in Bucharest  |date=8 May 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> [[Ploieşti]] also has many art deco houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republicaploiesti.net/2010/08/art-deco-ploiestean-i.html |title=Art Deco in Ploiesti |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100821165705/http://www.republicaploiesti.net/2010/08/art-deco-ploiestean-i.html|archivedate= 21 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Lithuania====
Like Romania, [[Lithuania]] too experienced booming industrial growth during the [[Interwar period]]. This resulted in the rapid modernization of the city of [[Kaunas]] in particular. At this time it became the temporary capital of Lithuania. [[Vytautas the Great War Museum]], built in 1936 and located in downtown Kaunas, along with the Central Post Building and the Pienocentras HQ Building (1934) are the three most prominent art deco structures in the city. Today many of these buildings still stand, and apartment complexes and large government buildings alike survive from this time, even through the [[Nazi]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet occupations]] of Kaunas. Many other buildings around the city were built in the [[Bauhaus]] style.

====Belgium====
One of the largest art deco buildings in Western Europe is the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in Koekelberg, [[Brussels]]. In 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the ''Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes'' in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicakoekelberg.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Koekelberg |publisher=Basilicakoekelberg.be |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>

In Indonesia, the largest stock of [[Dutch East Indies]]-era buildings is found in the large cities of [[Java]].  [[Bandung]] has one of the largest remaining collections of 1920s art deco buildings in the world,<ref>{{cite book |last=Dawson|first=B. |last2=Gillow |first2=J. |title=The Traditional Architecture of Indonesia |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=1994  |location=London |isbn=0-500-34132-X  |page=25 }}</ref> including those by several Dutch architects and planners, notably [[Albert Aalbers]]'s DENIS bank (1936) in [[Braga Street]] and the renovated [[Savoy Homann Bidakara Hotel|Savoy Homann Hotel]] (1939). Others were [[Thomas Karsten]], [[Henri Maclaine Pont]], J Gerber and [[Wolff Schoemaker|C.P.W. Schoemaker]]. The Sociëteit Concordia (now [[Merdeka Building]]) is a historic building in Bandung designed by Van Galen Last and C.P. Wolff Schoemaker.  In [[Jakarta]], surviving art deco buildings include the Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij building (1929), now the Museum Bank Mandiri, by J. de Bryun, A. P. Smiths, and C. Van de Linde; the [[Jakarta Kota Station]] (1929) designed by Frans Johan Louwrens Ghijsels, and the [[Metropole, Jakarta|Metropole]] Cinema in [[Menteng]].

In China, at least sixty buildings, of which many are art deco, designed by Hungarian architect [[Laszlo Hudec]] survive in downtown Shanghai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-shanghai.com/?p=7|title=Year of Hudec|accessdate=18 May 2010}}</ref>

In Japan, the 1933 [[Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum|residence]] of [[Prince Asaka Yasuhiko|Prince Asaka]] in Tokyo is an art-deco house turned museum.

In the Philippines, art deco buildings are found mostly in [[Manila]], [[Iloilo City]], and [[Sariaya]].  The best examples of these are the older buildings of the [[Far Eastern University]] and the [[Manila Metropolitan Theater]], both in Manila.

Examples of art deco architecture in [[Malaysia]] include the [[Central Market, Kuala Lumpur|Central Market]], the [[Coliseum Theatre]], the Odeon Cinema and the Lee Rubber Building in [[Kuala Lumpur]], and the [[Standard Chartered]] Building, India House, and the OCBC Bank Building in [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]].

There are a few Art Deco survivors in [[Hong Kong]], ([[The Peninsula Hong Kong]] 1928, [[Bank of China Building (Hong Kong)]] 1952) with high profile buildings demolished to make way for the modern skylines ([[HSBC Building (Hong Kong)|HSBC Building]] 1935, demolished 1978). Residential buildings in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon used basic Art Deco theme at a much smaller scale.<ref>http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=386037</ref> The [[Star Ferry Pier, Central]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier]] (both built 1957 and former demolished 2006) were both [[Streamline Moderne]] with some Art Deco elements.

===Oceania===

====New Zealand====
The town of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], New Zealand, was rebuilt in the art deco style after being largely razed by the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake|Hawke's Bay earthquake]] of 3 February 1931 and is the world's most consistently art deco city. Although a few art deco buildings were replaced with contemporary structures during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, most of the centre remained intact long enough to become recognized as architecturally unique, and from the 1990s onwards had been protected and restored. As of 2007, Napier has been nominated for UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |title=Napier Earthquake |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |date=3 February 1931 |accessdate=8 July 2010|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100706013856/http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx|archivedate= 6 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |title=Home – Art Deco Trust |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |accessdate=8 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100630211317/http://www.artdeconapier.com/|archivedate= 30 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl= no}}</ref>  According to the [[World Heritage Trust]], when Napier is compared to the other cites noted for their art deco architecture, such as Miami Beach, Santa Barbara, [[Bandung]] in Indonesia (planned originally as the future capital of Java), and Asmara in [[Eritrea]] (built by the Italians as a model colonial city), "none... surpass Napier in style and coherence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5125/ |title=Napier Art Deco historic precinct – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref>

[[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] was also rebuilt in art deco style after the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake]], and many fine art deco buildings survive.

[[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] has retained a sizeable number of art deco buildings, in spite of constant post-[[World War II]] development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellington.govt.nz/services/heritage/pdfs/artdeco.pdf |title=Art Deco heritage trail |publisher=wellington.gov.nz |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>

====Australia====
{{See also|List of Art Deco buildings in Sydney|List of Art Deco buildings in Melbourne|List of Art Deco buildings in Tasmania|List of Art Deco buildings in Perth}}
Australia also has many surviving examples of art deco architecture. Among the most notable are Sydney's [[ANZAC War Memorial]], 'mini-skyscrapers', such as the [[Grace Building (Sydney)]] and the [[Manchester Unity Building]] (Melbourne) featuring purely decorative towers to circumvent the [[height restriction laws]] of the time; the [[AWA Tower]] in Sydney, consists of a radio transmission tower atop a 15-story building; and the former [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]] in Melbourne, with its main multi-storey brick building designed by architect [[Percy Edgar Everett]], reminiscent of the design of the [[Empire State Building]].

In [[St Kilda, Victoria]], the [[Palais Theatre|Palais]] and the [[The Astor Theatre|Astor]] theatres are considered some of the finest surviving art deco buildings in Australia, while many rural towns such as [[Wagga Wagga]], [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]], [[Albury]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] also have significant amounts of art deco buildings and homes.

===Africa===
Africa's most celebrated examples of art deco were built in Eritrea during [[Eritrea#Colonialism|Italian rule]]. Many buildings survive in [[Asmara]], the capital, and elsewhere.

Also there are many buildings in downtown [[Casablanca]], Morocco's economic capital. During [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonial rule in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], a large number of buildings were erected especially in the capital cities of [[Luanda]] and [[Maputo]]. Cities in South Africa also contain examples of art-deco design such as the City Hall, in [[Benoni, Gauteng]], constructed in 1937. There are a few art deco buildings in Egypt, one of the most famous being the former Cadillac dealership in downtown [[Cairo]] and Casa d'Italia in [[Port Said]] (1936)— designed by the famous Italian architect [[Busiri Vici|Clemente Busiri Vici]].
