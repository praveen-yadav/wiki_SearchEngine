The '''Lockheed C-130 Hercules''' is a four-engine [[turboprop]] [[military transport aircraft]] designed and built originally by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], now [[Lockheed Martin]]. Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[MEDEVAC|medical evacuation]], and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], maritime patrol, and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is now the main [[airlift#tactical airlift|tactical airlifter]] for many military forces worldwide. Over 40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60 nations.

The C-130 entered service with U.S. in the 1950s, followed by Australia and others. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in countless military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. The family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft—after the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker]], all designs with various forms of aviation [[gas turbine]] powerplants—to mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer, in this case, the [[United States Air Force]]. The C-130 is one of the only military aircraft to remain in continuous production for over 50 years with its original customer, as the updated [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules|C-130J Super Hercules]].

==Design and development==

===Background and requirements===
The [[Korean War]], which began in June 1950, showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports—[[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s—were inadequate for modern warfare. Thus, on 2 February 1951, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[Chase Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and [[Airlifts Inc]]. The new transport would have a capacity for 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that was approximately {{convert|41|ft|m}} long, {{convert|9|ft|m}} high, and {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed from the ground-up as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage. This innovation for military [[cargo aircraft]] was first pioneered, known as the ''Trapoklappe'', on the World War II German [[Junkers Ju 252]] and Ju 352 "Hercules" transport prototypes.

The Hercules resembled a larger four-engine brother to the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout that evolved from the Chase XCG-20 Avitruc, which in turn, was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm "Chase XCG-20 Avitruc."] ''globalsecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref> The Boeing [[C-97 Stratofreighter|C-97]] also had a rear ramp, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the plane (also possible with forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included low-altitude extraction for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] and even dropping large improvised "[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]" bombs.

A key feature was the introduction of the [[Allison T56]] [[turboprop]] power plant, first developed specifically for the C-130. At the time, the turboprop was a new application of [[Gas turbine|turbine engines]] that used exhaust gases to turn a propeller, which offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure [[turbojets]], which were faster but thirstier. As was the case on helicopters of that era, such as the UH-1 Huey, [[turboshaft]]s produced much more power for their weight than piston [[engines]]. Lockheed would subsequently use the same engines and technology in the [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]]. That aircraft failed financially in its civilian configuration but was successfully adapted into the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] maritime patrol and submarine attack aircraft where the efficiency and endurance of turboprops excelled.

The new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|-2|abbr=on}}, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down. Fairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.

[[File:YC-130s formation usaf.jpg|thumb|The two YC-130 prototypes; the blunt nose was replaced with a [[radome]] on later production models]]

The Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130 page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.<ref name='rhodes'>Rhodes, Jeff. "Willis Hawkins and the Genesis of the Hercules." ''Code One Magazine'', Volume 19, Issue 3, 2004.</ref> [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, "If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company."<ref name='rhodes'/> Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.<ref name='boyne'>Boyne, Walter J. ''Beyond the Horizons: The Lockheed Story.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998. ISBN 978-0-312-19237-2.</ref>

The first flight of the ''YC-130'' [[prototype]] was made on 23 August 1954 from the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] plant in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California. The aircraft, [[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''53-3397'', was the second prototype, but the first of the two to fly. The YC-130 was piloted by Stanley Beltz and Roy Wimmer on its 61-minute flight to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; [[Jack Real]] and Dick Stanton served as flight engineers. Kelly Johnson flew chase in a [[P2V Neptune]].<ref name='dabney'>Dabney, Joseph E. A. "Mating of the Jeep, the Truck, and the [[Airplane]]." ''lockheedmartin.com,'' 2004.<nowiki></nowiki>''Excerpted from ''HERK: Hero of the Skies'' in ''Lockheed Martin Service News, Lockheed Martin Air Mobility Support '' Volume 29, Issue 2, p. 3.</ref>

===Into production===
After the two prototypes were completed, production began in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], Georgia, where over 2,300 C-130s have been built through 2009.<ref>Olausson 2009, p. 129.</ref>

The initial production model, the ''C-130A'', was powered by [[Allison T56]]-A-9 turboprops with three-blade [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]s. Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the ''C-130B'' model in 1959. Some A models were re-designated ''C-130D'' after being equipped with [[ski]]s. The newer C-130B had [[aileron]]s with increased boost—3,000&nbsp;[[pounds per square inch|psi]] (21&nbsp;MPa) versus 2,050&nbsp;psi (14&nbsp;MPa)—as well as uprated engines and four-bladed propellers that were standard until the J-model's introduction.

===Improved versions===
[[File:C-130E Hercules dropping flares.jpg|thumb|A [[Michigan Air National Guard]] C-130E dispatches its flares during a low-level training mission]]

As the C-130A became operational with [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added in the form of external pylon-mounted tanks at the end of the wings.

The C-130B model was developed to complement the A models that had previously been delivered, and incorporated new features, particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an AC electrical system. Four-bladed Hamilton Standard propellers replaced the Aero Product three-bladed propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models. An electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.

The extended range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360&nbsp;US [[gallon|gal]] (5,150&nbsp;L) ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[ailerons]] was reduced back to 2050 psi as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966–67 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.

===Refueling versions===
The ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F''s procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable 3,600&nbsp;US gal (13,626&nbsp;l) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300&nbsp;US gal per minute (19&nbsp;l per second) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.

===More improvements===
[[File:RAAF Lockheed C-130H Hercules AVV Creek.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force]] C-130H, 2007]]

The ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retro-fitted to many earlier H-models. The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered RAAF Service in 1958.
[[File:Lockheed C-130H Hercules (L-382), Brazil - Air Force AN1875386.jpg|thumb|[[Brazilian Air Force]] C-130 (L-382)]]
The United States Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.

C-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF. The 3 denoting the third variation in design for the H series. Improvements included ring laser gyros for the INUs, GPS receivers, a partial [[glass cockpit]] (ADI and HSI instruments), a more capable APN-241 color radar, [[night vision device]] compatible instrument lighting, and an integrated radar and missile warning system. The electrical system upgrade included Generator Control Units (GCU) and Bus Switching units (BSU)to provide stable power to the more sensitive upgraded components.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[File:raf.hercules.c-130k.c3.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Air Force]] C-130K (C.3)]]

The equivalent model for export to the UK is the ''C-130K'', known by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as the ''Hercules C.1''. The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100&nbsp;in (2.54&nbsp;m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80&nbsp;in (2.03&nbsp;m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as flight-test bed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130K (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm "C-130K in the Austrian Air Force."] ''doppeladler.com.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref>

===Later models===
The ''[[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130E Combat Talon]]'' was developed for the USAF during the [[Vietnam War]] to support [[special operations]] missions throughout Southeast Asia, and spawned both an ''[[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130H Combat Talon II]]'' as well as a family of other special missions aircraft. 37 of the earliest models currently operating with the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC) are scheduled to be replaced by new-production MC-130J versions. The [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] is another special missions variant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]], and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies.  Other versions of the [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]], most notably the [[EC-130H Compass Call]], are also special variants, but are assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]] was first developed during the [[Vietnam War]] to provide [[close air support]] and other [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] duties.

The ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.

The ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.

The RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].

The ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.

===Next generation===
{{Main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}

In the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.

Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/C130.html NASA and Lockheed Martin Partners In C-130 Technology] Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref>  Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and horsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct
mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/Service-News/V12N3.pdf The High Technology Test Bed] Lockheed Service News Vol. 12 No. 3, September 1985. Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref> The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X.  After demonstrating many new technologies, some of which were applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at [[Dobbins Air Reserve Base]], in Marietta, Georgia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Norton |first=Bill |title=STOL Progenitors: The Technology Path to a Large STOL Aircraft and the C-17A |year=2002 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |location=Reston, Virginia |isbn=1-56347-538-3}}</ref>  The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training.<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19930203-1 ASN Aircraft Accident] Retrieved 21 May 2013.</ref>

In the 1990s, the improved [[C-130J Super Hercules]] was developed by Lockheed (later Lockheed Martin). This model is the newest version and the only model in production. Externally similar to the classic Hercules in general appearance, the J model has new turboprop engines, six-bladed propellers, digital avionics, and other new systems.<ref>[http://defense-studies.blogspot.com/2011/12/lockheed-unveils-two-future-c-130.html Lockheed Unveils Two Future C-130 Variants]</ref>

===Upgrades and changes===
In 2000, Boeing was awarded a {{US$|1.4 billion}} contract to develop an Avionics Modernization Program kit for the C-130.

===Replacement===
In October 2010, the Air Force released a capabilities request for information (CRFI) for the development of a new airlifter to replace the C-130.  The new aircraft is to carry a 190 percent greater payload and assume the mission of mounted vertical maneuver (MVM).  The greater payload and mission would enable it to carry medium-weight armored vehicles and drop them off at locations without long runways.  Various options are being considered, including new or upgraded fixed-wing designs, rotorcraft, [[tiltrotor]]s, or even an [[airship]].  Development could start in 2014, and become operational by 2024.  The C-130 fleet of around 450 planes would be replaced by only 250 aircraft.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2010/10/usaf-asks-industry-to-answer-c/ USAF asks industry to answer C-130 replacement questions - See more at: http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2010/10/usaf-asks-industry-to-answer-c/#sthash.ary0qCUc.dpuf] - Flightglobal.com, 22 October 2010</ref> The Air Force had attempted to replace the C-130 in the 1970s through the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project, which resulted in the [[C-17 Globemaster III]] that instead replaced the [[C-141 Starlifter]].<ref name="speedagile">[http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/09/images-lockheeds-stealth-c-130/ Lockheed’s stealth C-130 successor revealed] - Flightglobal.com, 13 September 2011</ref> The [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] funded Lockheed and Boeing demonstrators for the '''Speed Agile''' concept, which had the goal of making a STOL aircraft that can take off and land at speeds as low as {{convert|70|knot|mph|abbr=on}} on airfields less than 2,000&nbsp;ft long and cruise at Mach 0.8-plus.  Boeing's design used upper-surface blowing from embedded engines on the inboard wing and blown flaps for circulation control on the outboard wing. Lockheed's design also used blown flaps outboard, but inboard used patented reversing ejector nozzles.  Boeing's design completed over 2,000 hours of windtunnel tests in late 2009.

The first production aircraft, C-130As were first delivered beginning in 1956 to the [[463d Troop Carrier Wing]] at [[Ardmore AFB]], Oklahoma and the [[314th Troop Carrier Wing]] at [[Sewart AFB]], Tennessee. Six additional squadrons were assigned to the [[322d Air Division]] in Europe and the [[315th Air Division]] in the Far East. Additional aircraft were modified for electronics intelligence work and assigned to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]], Germany while modified RC-130As were assigned to the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) photo-mapping division.

In 1958, a U.S. reconnaissance C-130A-II of the [[7406th Support Squadron]] was shot down over Armenia by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17s]].<ref name="nsagov2009">[http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/vigilance_park/shootdown_flight60528.shtml "The Shootdown of Flight 60528."] ''National Vigilance Park- NSA/CSS'' via ''nsa.gov,'' 12 January 2009.

Australia became the first non-American force to [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules in Australian service|operate the C-130A Hercules]] with 12 examples being delivered from late 1958. These aircraft were fitted with AeroProducts three-blade, 15-foot diameter propellers. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] became another early user with the delivery of four B-models (Canadian designation C-130 Mk I) in Oct/Nov 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Military Aircraft|url=http://www.rwrwalker.ca/RCAF_10301_10418_detailed.html|accessdate=6 September 2013}}</ref>

In 1963, a Hercules achieved and still holds the record for the largest and heaviest aircraft to land on an [[aircraft carrier]].<ref>[http://www.defenceaviation.com/2007/06/c-130-hercules-on-aircraft-carrier.html "C-130 Hercules on Aircraft carrier."] ''Defence Aviation,'' 2 May 2007. Retrieved 2 October 2010.</ref> During October and November that year, a USMC KC-130F (BuNo ''149798''), loaned to the U.S. Naval Air Test Center, made 29 [[touch-and-go landing]]s, 21 [[Arresting gear|unarrested]] full-stop landings and 21 unassisted take-offs on the [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']] at a number of different weights.<ref>[http://navysite.de/cvn/cv59.htm "USS Forrestal (CV 59)."] ''navysite.de (Unofficial U.S. Navy site).'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref> The pilot, LT (later [[Rear Admiral|RADM]]) [[James H. Flatley III]], USN, was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his role in this test series. The tests were highly successful, but the idea was considered too risky for routine "[[Carrier onboard delivery|Carrier Onboard Delivery]]" (COD) operations. Instead, the [[Grumman C-2 Greyhound]] was developed as a dedicated COD aircraft. The Hercules used in the test, most recently in service with Marine Aerial Refueler Squadron 352 ([[VMGR-352]]) until 2005, is now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] at [[NAS Pensacola]], Florida.

In 1964, C-130 crews from the 6315th Operations Group at [[Naha Airbase]], Okinawa commenced [[forward air control]] (FAC; "Flare") missions over the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] in Laos supporting USAF strike aircraft. In April 1965 the mission was expanded to [[North Vietnam]] where C-130 crews led formations of [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57]] bombers on night reconnaissance/strike missions against communist supply routes leading to South Vietnam. In early 1966 Project Blind Bat/Lamplighter was established at [[Ubon]] RTAFB, [[Thailand]]. After the move to Ubon the mission became a four-engine FAC mission with the C-130 crew searching for targets then calling in strike aircraft. Another little-known C-130 mission flown by Naha-based crews was [[Operation Commando Scarf|Operation ''Commando Scarf'']], which involved the delivery of chemicals onto sections of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos that were designed to produce mud and landslides in hopes of making the truck routes impassable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In November 1964, on the other side of the globe, C-130Es from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing but loaned to [[322d Air Division]] in France, flew one of the most dramatic missions in history in the former [[Belgian Congo]]. After a Congolese rebel group named "Simba" took white residents of the city of [[Kisangani|Stanleyville]] hostage, [[Simba Rebellion|the U.S. and Belgium developed a joint rescue mission]] that used the C-130s to airlift and then drop and air-land a force of [[Belgians|Belgian]] paratroopers to rescue the hostages. Two missions were flown, one over Stanleyville and another over [[Paulis (Congo)|Paulis]] during Thanksgiving weeks.<ref>Odom, Maj. T.

Retrieved 2 October 2010.</ref> The headline-making mission resulted in the first award of the prestigious [[MacKay Trophy]] to C-130 crews.

In the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], the [[Pakistan Air Force]] modified/improvised several aircraft for use as heavy bombers, and attacks were made on Indian bridges and troop concentrations with some successes. No aircraft were lost in the operations, though one was slightly damaged.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In October 1968 a C-130Bs from the 463rd Tactical Airlift Wing dropped a pair of [[M-121 (bomb)|M-121]] 10,000 pound bombs that had been developed for the massive [[B-36]] bomber but had never been used. The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force resurrected the huge weapons as a means of clearing landing zones for helicopters and in early 1969 the 463rd commenced [[BLU-82|Commando Vault]] missions. Although the stated purpose of COMMANDO VAULT was to clear LZs, they were also used on enemy base camps and other targets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

During the late 1960s, the U.S. was eager to get information on Chinese nuclear capabilities. After the failure of the [[Black Cat Squadron]] to plant operating sensor pods near the [[Lop Nur]] Nuclear Weapons Test Base using a [[Lockheed U-2]], the [[CIA]] developed a plan, named ''Heavy Tea'', to deploy two battery-powered sensor pallets near the base. To deploy the pallets, a [[Black Bat Squadron]] crew was trained in the U.S. to fly the C-130 Hercules. The crew of 12, led by Col Sun Pei Zhen, took off from [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in an unmarked U.S. Air Force C-130E on 17 May 1969. Flying for six and a half hours at low altitude in the dark, they arrived over the target and the sensor pallets were dropped by parachute near Anxi in Gansu province. After another six and a half hours of low altitude flight, they arrived back at Takhli. The sensors worked and uploaded data to a U.S. intelligence satellite for six months, before their batteries wore out. The Chinese conducted two nuclear tests, on 22 September 1969 and 29 September 1969, during the operating life of the sensor pallets. Another mission to the area was planned as Operation ''Golden Whip'', but was called off in 1970.<ref>Pocock, Chris. ''The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights over China from Taiwan 1951–1969''.

These two aircraft were delivered to [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] in 1964.<ref>Leeker, Dr. Joe.

The A-model continued in service through the [[Vietnam War]], where the aircraft assigned to the four squadrons at [[Naha AB]], Okinawa and one at [[Tachikawa Airfield|Tachikawa Air Base]], Japan performed yeoman's service, including operating highly classified special operations missions such as the BLIND BAT FAC/Flare mission and FACT SHEET leaflet mission over Laos and North Vietnam. The A-model was also provided to the South Vietnamese Air Force as part of the Vietnamization program at the end of the war, and equipped three squadrons based at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut AFB]]. The last operator in the world is the [[Honduran Air Force]], which is still flying one of five A model Hercules (FAH ''558'', c/n 3042) as of October 2009.<ref>Olausson 2010, p. 5.</ref> As the Vietnam War wound down, the 463rd Troop Carrier/Tactical Airlift Wing B-models and A-models of the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing were transferred back to the United States where most were assigned to [[Air Force Reserve]] and [[Air National Guard]] units.

[[File:DaNangairbase1965.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines disembark from C-130 transports at the [[Da Nang Airbase]] on 8 March 1965]]
Another prominent role for the B model was with the [[United States Marine Corps]], where Hercules initially designated as GV-1s replaced C-119s. After Air Force C-130Ds proved the type's usefulness in [[Antarctica]], the U.S. Navy purchased a number of B-models equipped with skis that were designated as LC-130s. C-130B-II electronic reconnaissance aircraft were operated under the SUN VALLEY program name primarily from Yokota Air Base, Japan. All reverted to standard C-130B cargo aircraft after their replacement in the reconnaissance role by other aircraft.

The C-130 was also used in the 1976 [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in which [[Israel]]i [[commando]] forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner hijacked by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and German terrorists at [[Entebbe Airport]], Uganda. The rescue force — 200 soldiers, jeeps, and a black [[Mercedes-Benz]] (intended to resemble Ugandan [[Dictator]] [[Idi Amin]]'s vehicle of state) — was flown over {{convert|2200|nmi|mi km|0|abbr=on}} almost entirely at an altitude of less than {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on}} from Israel to Entebbe by four [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) Hercules aircraft without mid-air refueling (on the way back, the planes refueled in [[Nairobi]], Kenya).

During the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Malvinas}}) of 1982, [[Argentine Air Force]] C-130s undertook highly dangerous, daily re-supply night flights as blockade runners to the Argentine garrison on the [[Falkland Islands]]. They also performed daylight maritime survey flights. One [[Nigel Ward|was lost]] during the war. Argentina also operated two KC-130 [[Aerial refueling|tankers]] during the war, and these refueled both the [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s and Navy [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard]]s; some C-130s were modified to operate as bombers with bomb-racks under their wings. The British also used RAF C-130s to support their logistical operations.

During the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 ([[Operation Desert Storm|Operation ''Desert Storm'']]), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, along with the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the UK. The [[MC-130 Combat Talon]] variant also made the first attacks using the largest conventional [[bomb]]s in the world, the [[BLU-82]] "Daisy Cutter" and [[GBU-43/B]] [[Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb]], also known as the MOAB. Daisy Cutters were used to clear landing zones and to eliminate [[land mine|mine fields]]. The weight and size of the weapons make it impossible or impractical to load them on conventional [[bomber aircraft|bombers]]. The GBU-43/B MOAB is a successor to the BLU-82 and can perform the same function, as well as perform strike functions against hardened targets in a low air threat environment.

Since 1992, two successive C-130 aircraft named ''Fat Albert'' have served as the support aircraft for the U.S. Navy [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration team. ''Fat Albert I'' was a [[TC-130]]G (''15189''), while ''Fat Albert II'' is a C-130T (''164763 ''). Although ''Fat Albert'' supports a Navy squadron, it is operated by the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and its crew consists solely of USMC personnel. At some [[Air Show|air shows]] featuring the team, ''Fat Albert'' takes part, performing flyovers. Until 2009, it also demonstrated its rocket-assisted takeoff (RATO) capabilities; these ended due to dwindling supplies of rockets.<ref name="FA JATO">McCullough, Amy.

The AC-130 also holds the record for the longest sustained flight by a C-130. From 22 to 24 October 1997, two AC-130U gunships flew 36.0 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field Florida to Taegu (Daegu), South Korea while being refueled seven times by KC-135 tanker aircraft. This record flight shattered the previous record longest flight by over 10 hours while the 2 gunships took on {{convert|410000|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel. The gunship has been used in every major U.S. combat operation since Vietnam, except for [[Operation El Dorado Canyon|Operation ''El Dorado Canyon'']], the 1986 attack on Libya.<ref>[http://www.afsoc.af.mil/library/afsocheritage/index.asp "AFSOC Heritage."] ''US Air Force Special Operations Command.''

During the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan in 2001]] and the ongoing support of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom|Operation ''Enduring Freedom'']]), the C-130 Hercules has been used operationally by Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, the UK and the United States.

During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Operation ''Iraqi Freedom'']]), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by Australia, the UK and the United States. After the initial invasion, C-130 operators as part of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]] used their C-130s to support their forces in Iraq.

Since 2004, the Pakistan Air Force has employed C-130s in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]]. Some variants had [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR Systems Star Safire III EO/IR) sensor balls, to enable close tracking of [[Islamist]] militants.<ref>(http://tribune.com.pk/story/291762/paf-conducted-5500-bombing-runs-in-fata-since-2008/</ref>

The [[U.S. Forest Service]] developed the [[Modular Airborne FireFighting System]] for the C-130 in the 1970s, which allows regular aircraft to be temporarily converted to an [[airtanker]] for fighting [[wildfire]]s.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/maffs/index.html "Modular Airborne FireFighting Systems."] ''U.S. Forest Service,'' 16 March 2010.

After one of these aircraft crashed due to wing separation in flight as a result of fatigue stress cracking, the entire fleet of C-130A air tankers was permanently grounded in 2004 (see [[2002 airtanker crashes]]). C-130s have been used to spread chemical dispersants onto the massive oil slick in the Gulf Coast in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Accidents==
{{Main|List of accidents and incidents involving the C-130 Hercules}}

The C-130 Hercules has had a low accident rate in general. The Royal Air Force recorded an accident rate of about one aircraft loss per 250,000 flying hours over the last forty years, placing it behind [[Vickers VC10]]s and [[Lockheed TriStar (RAF)|Lockheed TriStars]] with no flying losses.<ref name="dasa">[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/natstats/accidents/accdam/acctab2.html "Aircraft Air Accidents and Damage Rates."]{{Dead link|date=February 2011}} ''Defence Analytical Services Agency.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.</ref> USAF C-130A/B/E-models had an overall attrition rate of 5 percent as of 1989 as compared to 1 to 2 percent for commercial airliners in the U.S., according to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], 10 percent for [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers, and 20 percent for fighters ([[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]], [[F-111]]), trainers ([[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]], [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]]), and helicopters ([[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|H-3]]).<ref>Diehl 2002, p. 45.</ref>

A total of 70 aircraft were lost by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps during combat operations in the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia. By the nature of the Hercules' worldwide service, the pattern of losses provides an interesting barometer of the global hot spots over the past 50 years.<ref name="avs1">[http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type.php?type=335-C "Lockheed C-130 Hercules."] ''Aviation Safety Network, Flight Safety Foundation,'' 13 November 2004.

John Hering, co-pilot; Lt. Richard A. Lenz, navigator; Tech. Sgt. Jon Sanders, flight engineer, loadmasters Tech. Sgt. Charlie Shaub and A1C Dave McAleece|group=N}} The C-130E attempted to airdrop ammunition to surrounded South Vietnamese forces at An Loc, Vietnam. Approaching the drop zone, Spare 617 received heavy enemy ground fire that damaged two engines, ruptured a bleed air duct in the cargo compartment, and set the ammunition on fire. Flight engineer Sanders was killed, and navigator Lenz and co-pilot Hering were both wounded. Despite receiving severe burns from hot air escaping from the damaged air bleed duct, loadmaster Shaub extinguished a fire in the cargo compartment, and successfully jettisoned the cargo pallets, which exploded in mid-air. Despite losing a third engine on final approach, pilot Capt. Caldwell landed Spare 617 safely. For their actions, Caldwell and Shaub received the [[Air Force Cross (United States)|Air Force Cross]], the U.S. Air Force's second highest award for valor. Shaub also received the William H.
