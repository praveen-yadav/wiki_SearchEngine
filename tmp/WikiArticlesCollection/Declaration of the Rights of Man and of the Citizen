[[File:Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789.jpg|thumb|The ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' was approved by the [[National Constituent Assembly]] of France, 26 August 1789.]]

The '''''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen''''', or '''''Declaration of Human and Civic Rights''''' ({{lang-fr|Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen|links=no}}) is a fundamental document of the [[French Revolution]] and in the history of [[human rights]], defining the individual and collective rights of all the [[estates of the realm]] as universal. Influenced by the doctrine of "[[natural rights|natural right]]", the rights of man are held to be [[universality (philosophy)|universal]]: valid at all times and in every place, pertaining to [[human nature]] itself.

==History==
The last article of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen was adopted on 26 August 1789,<ref>Some sources say 27 August because the debate was not officially closed.</ref> by the [[National Constituent Assembly]] (''Assemblée nationale constituante''), during the period of the [[French Revolution]], as the first step toward writing a constitution for France. Inspired by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the original version of the Declaration was discussed by the representatives on the basis of a 24 article draft proposed by the sixth bureau,<ref>The original draft is an annex to the report of the August 12th report (Archives parlementaires, 1,<sup>e</sup> série, tome VIII, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k495230.image.f499.langFR débats du 12 août 1789], p. 431).</ref><ref>Archives parlementaires, 1<sup>e</sup> série, tome VIII, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k495230.image.f527.langFR débats du 19 août 1789], p. 459.</ref> led by [[:fr:Jérôme Champion de Cicé|Jérôme Champion de Cicé]]. The draft was later modified during the debates. A second and lengthier declaration, known as the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1793]] was later adopted.{{citation needed|date = August 2013}}

==Philosophic and theoretical context==
The concepts in the Declaration come from the philosophical and political duties of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[individualism]], the [[social contract]] as theorized by the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and the [[separation of powers]] espoused by the [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]. As can be seen in the texts, the French declaration is heavily influenced by the political philosophy of the Enlightenment, and by Enlightenment principles of human rights, some of which it shares with the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] which preceded it (4 July 1776).<!-- The American Declaration was in part based on the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] developed by [[George Mason]] in June 1776, themselves based on the [[Bill of Rights 1689|1689 English Bill of Rights]], published a full century before the French version. By comparison, few French in 1789 were vividly aware of these precedents of the American declaration. --> [[Thomas Jefferson]], primary author of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, was at the time in France as a U.S. diplomat,<ref>http://sc94.ameslab.gov/TOUR/tjefferson.html</ref> and was in correspondence with members of the French National Constituent Assembly. [[James Madison]]'s proposal for a [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]] was adopted by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on 21 August 1789,<ref>{{cite book|title=Freedom of Religion, the First Amendment, and the Supreme Court: How the Court Flunked History|last=Adamson|first=Barry|year=2008|page=93|publisher=Pelican Publishing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Tgw-rCrNYacC&pg=PA93|isbn=9781455604586}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Journal of the House of Representatives of the United States, 1789–1793|page=85|date=Friday, August 21, 1789|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(hj001139)):}}</ref> that is 5 days before the French declaration. Considering the speed at which information crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the 18th century, it can be assumed that the French declaration was not directly inspired by its US counterpart in the sense that it was made after the American Constitution. However as far as it concerns the authorship and the people who influenced its content, it was exactly the same people who took part in shaping both documents, Lafayette admired Jefferson and Jefferson found him useful which shows the reverence Lafayette had for Jefferson. In Jefferson's own words(12.16.1786; Boyd 1950– 10: 602).:

"The Marquis de La Fayette is a most valuable auxiliary to me. His zeal is unbounded, & his weight with those in power, great. His education having been merely military,
commerce was an unknown field to him. But his good sense enabling him to comprehend
perfectly whatever is explained to him, his agency has been very efficacious. He has a
great deal of sound genius, is well remarked by the King, & rising in popularity. He has nothing against him, but the suspicion of republican principles. I think he will one day be of the ministry. His foible is, a canine appetite for popularity and fame; but he will get above this." (1.30.1787; Peterson 1984, p.&nbsp;885. Italicized passages sent in code.)

According to Iain McLean: "Lafayette was thus the ideal tool for Jefferson’s interests as they broadened from American trade to French politics."

The declaration is in the spirit of what has come to be called "secular natural law", which does not base itself on religious [[doctrine]] or [[authority]], in contrast with traditional [[natural law]] theory, which does.<ref name="Merryman 2007 16">{{cite book| last = Merryman| first = John Henry| coauthors = Rogelip Perez-Perdomo| title = The civil law tradition: an introduction to the legal system of Europe and Latin America| publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 2007| location =| page = 16| url = http://books.google.com/?id=6OJf9CbgKTkC&pg=PA16&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen#v=onepage&q=Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen&f=false| doi =| id =| isbn =9780804755696 }}</ref>

The declaration defines a single set of individual and collective rights for all men. Influenced by the doctrine of [[natural right]]s, these rights are held to be [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] and valid in all times and places. For example, "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good."<ref>First Article, Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.</ref> They have certain natural rights to [[property]], to [[liberty]] and to life. According to this theory the role of government is to recognize and secure these rights. Furthermore government should be carried on by elected representatives.<ref name="Merryman 2007 16"/>

At the time of writing, the rights contained in the declaration were only awarded to men. Furthermore, the declaration was a statement of vision rather than reality. The declaration was not deeply rooted in either the practice of the West or even France at the time. The declaration emerged in the late 18th Century out of war and revolution. It encountered opposition as democracy and [[individual rights]] were frequently regarded as synonymous with [[anarchy]] and [[subversion]]. The declaration embodies ideals and aspirations towards which France pledged to struggle in the future.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lauren| first = Paul Gordon| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The evolution of international human rights: visions seen| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2003| location =| page = 32| url = http://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen| doi =| id = | isbn =9780812218541 }}</ref>

==Substance==
The Declaration is introduced by a preamble describing the fundamental characteristics of the rights which are qualified as being "natural, unalienable and sacred" and consisting of "simple and incontestable principles" on which citizens could base their demands. In the second article, "the natural and imprescriptible rights of man" are defined as "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression". It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges by proclaiming an end to [[feudalism]] and to exemptions from taxation, freedom and equal rights for all human beings (referred to as "Men"), and access to public office based on talent. The monarchy was restricted, and all citizens were to have the right to take part in the legislative process. [[Freedom of speech]] and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed.<ref>{{cite book| last = Spielvogel| first = Jackson J.| title = Western Civilization: 1300 to 1815| publisher=Wadsworth Publishing | year = 2008| location = | page = 580| url = http://books.google.com/?id=0QKxEJF-zQQC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen | isbn = 978-0-495-50289-0 }}</ref>

The Declaration also asserted the principles of [[popular sovereignty]], in contrast to the [[divine right of kings]] that characterized the French monarchy, and social equality among citizens, "All the citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally admissible to all public dignities, places, and employments, according to their capacity and without distinction other than that of their virtues and of their talents," eliminating the special rights of the nobility and clergy.

Articles:

# Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.
# The aim of all political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.
# The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority which does not proceed directly from the nation.
# Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.
# Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.
# Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. All citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, are equally eligible to all dignities and to all public positions and occupations, according to their abilities, and without distinction except that of their virtues and talents.
# No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. Any one soliciting, transmitting, executing, or causing to be executed, any arbitrary order, shall be punished. But any citizen summoned or arrested in virtue of the law shall submit without delay, as resistance constitutes an offense.
# The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.
# As all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty, if arrest shall be deemed indispensable, all harshness not essential to the securing of the prisoner's person shall be severely repressed by law.
# No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.
# The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.
# The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be entrusted.
#  A general tax is indispensable for the maintenance of the public force and for the expenses of administration; it ought to be equally apportioned among all citizens according to their means.<ref name="Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (August 1789)">{{cite web | url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/declaration.html | title=Declaration | accessdate=August 10, 2012}}</ref>
# All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of the taxes.
# Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his administration.
# A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all.
# Property being an inviolable and sacred right, no one can be deprived of it, unless demanded by public necessity, legally constituted, explicitly demands it, and under the condition of a just and prior indemnity.

===Active and passive citizenship===
While the [[French Revolution]] provided rights to a larger portion of the population, there remained a distinction between those who obtained the political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen and those who did not. Those who were deemed to hold these political rights were called active citizens. [[Active citizenship]] was granted to men who were French, at least 25 years old, paid taxes equal to three days work, and could not be defined as servants [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/ (Thouret)].<ref>Thouret 1789, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/282/</ref> This meant that at the time of the Declaration only male property owners held these rights.<ref>Censer and Hunt 2001, p. 55.</ref>  The deputies in the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] believed that only those who held tangible interests in the nation could make informed political decisions.<ref name="Popkin 2006, p. 46">Popkin 2006, p. 46.</ref> This distinction directly affects articles 6, 12, 14, and 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen as each of these rights is related to the right to vote and to participate actively in the government. With the decree of 29 October 1789, the term active citizen became embedded in French politics.<ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 124">Doyle 1989, p. 124.</ref>

The concept of [[passive citizens]] was created to encompass those populations that had been excluded from political rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. Because of the requirements set down for active citizens, the vote was granted to approximately 4.3 million Frenchmen.<ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 124"/> out of a population of around 29 million.<ref>[http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap1a.html “Social Causes of the Revolution”]</ref>  These omitted groups included women, slaves, children, and foreigners. As these measures were voted upon by the General Assembly, they limited the rights of certain groups of citizens while implementing the democratic process of the new [[French First Republic|French Republic (1792–1804)]].<ref name="Popkin 2006, p. 46"/> This legislation, passed in 1789, was amended by the creators of the [[French Constitution of 1795|Constitution of 1795]] in order to eliminate the label of active citizen.<ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 420">Doyle 1989, p. 420.</ref> The power to vote was then, however, to be granted solely to substantial property owners.<ref name="Doyle 1989, p. 420"/>

Tensions arose between active and passive citizens throughout the Revolution. This happened when passive citizens started to call for more rights, or when they openly refused to listen to the ideals set forth by active citizens. This [http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/ cartoon] clearly demonstrates the difference that existed between the active and passive citizens along with the tensions associated with such differences.<ref>“Active/Passive Citizen”, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/75/.</ref> In the cartoon, a passive citizen is holding a spade and a wealthy landowning active citizen is ordering the passive citizens to go to work. The act appears condescending to the passive citizen and it revisits the reasons why the French Revolution began in the first place.

Women, in particular, were strong passive citizens who played a significant role in the Revolution. [[Olympe de Gouges]] penned her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' in 1791 and drew attention to the need for gender equality.<ref>De Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Women", 1791.</ref> By supporting the ideals of the French Revolution and wishing to expand them to women, she represented herself as a revolutionary citizen. Madame Roland also established herself as an influential figure throughout the Revolution. She saw women of the French Revolution as holding three roles; “inciting revolutionary action, formulating policy, and informing others of revolutionary events.”<ref>Dalton 2001, p. 1.</ref> By working with men, as opposed to working separate from men, she may have been able to further the fight of revolutionary women. As players in the French Revolution, women occupied a significant role in the civic sphere by forming social movements and participating in popular clubs, allowing them societal influence, despite their lack of direct political influence.<ref>Levy and Applewhite 2002, pp. 319–20, 324.</ref>

===Women's rights===
The Declaration recognized many rights as belonging to citizens (who could only be male). This was despite the fact that after [[The March on Versailles]] on 5 October 1789, women presented the [[Women's Petition to the National Assembly]] in which they proposed a decree giving women equality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In 1790 [[Nicolas de Condorcet]] and [[Etta Palm d'Aelders]] unsuccessfully called on the National Assembly to extend civil and political rights to women.<ref>{{cite book |title=Letters written in France |last=Williams |first= Helen Maria |authorlink= |coauthors=Neil Fraistat, Susan Sniader Lanser, David Brookshire |year=2001 |publisher=Broadview Press Ltd |location= |isbn=978-1-55111-255-8 |page=246  |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5Ruwz82RicgC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref> Condorcet declared that “and he who votes against the right of another, whatever the religion, color, or sex of that other, has henceforth abjured his own”.<ref>{{cite book |title=The evolution of international human rights |last=Lauren |first=Paul Gordon |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location= |isbn= 978-0-8122-1854-1 |pages=18–20 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=gHRhWgbWyzMC&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Man+and+of+the+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref> The French Revolution did not lead to a recognition of [[women’s rights]] and this prompted [[Olympe de Gouges]] to publish the [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]] in September 1791.<ref>{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=136 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref>

The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen is modelled on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and is ironic in formulation and exposes the failure of the [[French Revolution]], which had been devoted to [[Egalitarianism|equality]]. It states that:
<blockquote>
“This revolution will only take effect when all women become fully aware of their deplorable condition, and of the rights they have lost in society”.
</blockquote>
The ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen'' follows the seventeen articles of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' point for point and has been described by Camille Naish as “almost a parody... of the original document”. The first article of the ''Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen'' proclaims that:
<blockquote>
“Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be based only on common utility.”
</blockquote>
The first article of ''Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen'' replied:
<blockquote>
“Woman is born free and remains equal to man in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on common utility”.
</blockquote>
De Gouges also draws attention to the fact that under French law women were fully punishable, yet denied equal rights, declaring “Women have the right to mount the scaffold, they must also have the right to mount the speaker’s rostrum”.<ref>{{cite book |title=Death comes to the maiden: Sex and Execution, 1431–1933 |last=Naish |first=Camille |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-05585-7 |page=137  |url= http://books.google.com/?id=OHYOAAAAQAAJ&dq=Declaration+of+the+Rights+of+Woman+and+the+Female+Citizen |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Slavery===
The declaration did not revoke the institution of slavery, as lobbied for by Jacques-Pierre Brissot's ''[[Slavery abolition efforts by Les Amis des Noirs|Les Amis des Noirs]]'' and defended by the group of colonial planters called the Club Massiac because they met at the Hôtel Massiac.<ref>The club of reactionary colonial proprietors meeting since July 1789 were opposed to representation in the Assemblée of France's overseas dominions, for fear "that this would expose delicate colonial issues to the hazards of debate in the Assembly," as Robin Blackburn expressed it (Blackburn, The Overthrow of Colonial Slavery, 1776–1848 [1988:174f]); see also the speech of [[Jean-Baptiste Belley]]</ref> Despite the lack of explicit mention of slavery in the Declaration, slave uprisings in [[Saint-Domingue]] in the [[Haitian Revolution]] took inspiration from its words, as discussed in [[C. L. R. James]]' history of the Haitian Revolution, ''[[The Black Jacobins]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Deplorable conditions for the thousands of slaves in Saint-Domingue, the most profitable slave colony in the world, led to the uprisings which would be known as the first successful slave revolt in the New World. Slavery in the French colonies was abolished by the Convention dominated by the Jacobins in 1794. However, Napoleon reinstated it in 1802. The colony of Saint-Domingue became an independent state in 1804.

==Legacy==
The declaration has also influenced and inspired rights-based [[liberal democracy]] throughout the world. It was translated as soon as 1793–1794 by Colombian [[Antonio Nariño]], who published it despite the Inquisition and was sentenced to be imprisoned for ten years for doing so. In 2003, the document was listed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World register]].

===Constitution of the French Fifth Republic===
{{Main|Constitution of the French Fifth Republic}}
According to the [[preamble]] of the [[Constitution of the French Fifth Republic]] (adopted on 4 October 1958, and the current constitution), the principles set forth in the Declaration have constitutional value. Many laws and regulations have been canceled because they did not comply with those principles as interpreted by the [[Conseil Constitutionnel]] ("Constitutional Council of France") or by the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' ("Council of State").
* Taxation legislation or practices that seem to make some unwarranted difference between citizens are struck down as unconstitutional.
* Suggestions of [[positive discrimination]] on ethnic grounds are rejected because they infringe on the principle of equality, since they would establish categories of people that would, by birth, enjoy greater rights.

===Conspiracy theories===
The [[Eye of Providence]] represents the sun 'shining' on the laws and fueled several [[conspiracy theories]], for instance that the French Revolution was caused by [[occult]] groups.<ref>Mounier, Jean Joseph, On the Influence Attributed to Philosophers, Free-Masons, and to the Illuminati on the Revolution of France, facsimile reproduction with an introduction by Theodore A.
