==Etymology==
Alberta is named after [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise Caroline Alberta]] (1848–1939),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/history.cfm|title=History|publisher=[[Government of Alberta]]|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref> the fourth daughter of [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], the [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] until 1901, and [[Albert, Prince Consort]].

Alberta, with an area of {{convert|661848|km2|-2|abbr=on}}, is the fourth largest province after [[Quebec]], Ontario, and British Columbia.<ref name=area>{{cite web| url= http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/phys01.htm | title= Land and freshwater area, by province and territory | author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | year= 2005 | month= February | accessdate=March 7, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210220013/http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/phys01.htm| archivedate= February 10, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> To the south, the province borders on the [[49th parallel north]], separating it from the U.S. state of [[Montana]], while on the north the [[60th parallel north]] divides it from the [[Northwest Territories]]. To the east the [[110th meridian west]] separates it from the province of [[Saskatchewan]], while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the [[120th meridian west]] south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the [[Continental Divide]] at the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N.

The province extends {{convert|1223|km|abbr=on}} north to south and {{convert|660|km|abbr=on}} east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is {{convert|3747|m|abbr=on|0}} at the summit of [[Mount Columbia (Canada)|Mount Columbia]] in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border, while its lowest point is {{convert|152|m|abbr=on|0}} on the [[Slave River]] in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in the northeast.<ref name="aboutab">

With the exception of the [[semi-arid]] [[steppe]] of the southeastern section, the province has adequate [[water resources]]. There are numerous [[list of rivers of Alberta|rivers]] and [[list of lakes in Alberta|lakes]] used for swimming, fishing and a range of water sports. There are three large lakes, [[Lake Claire (Albertan lake)|Lake Claire]] ({{convert|1436|km2|abbr=on }}) in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], [[Lesser Slave Lake]] ({{convert|1168|km2|abbr=on}}), and [[Lake Athabasca]] ({{convert|7898|km2}}) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the [[Athabasca River]] which travels {{convert|1538|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Columbia Icefield]] in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
Alberta's capital city, [[Edmonton]], is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canada's largest oil fields, has most of western Canada's oil refinery capacity. [[Calgary]] is located approximately {{convert|280|km|abbr=on}} south of Edmonton and {{convert|240|km|abbr=on}} north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the province's population lives in the [[Calgary–Edmonton Corridor]].  The land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years.<ref>[http://railways.library.ualberta.ca/Maps-2-2-5/ "Alberta Land Grants" (Atlas of Alberta Railways)]</ref> 

Most of the northern half of the province is [[boreal forest]], while the [[Rocky Mountains]] along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see [[Alberta Mountain forests]] and [[Alberta-British Columbia foothills forests]]). The southern quarter of the province is [[prairie]], ranging from [[shortgrass prairie]] in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central [[aspen parkland]] region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to [[Lloydminster]], contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to [[dairy farming]], with [[mixed farming]] more common in the north and centre, while [[ranching]] and [[irrigated agriculture]] predominate in the south.<ref>

The Alberta [[badlands]] are located in southeastern Alberta, where the [[Red Deer River]] crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], near [[Brooks, Alberta]], showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Alberta's past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Banff Trail 2.jpg|thumb|left|Winter climate at [[Banff Trail (C-Train)|Banff Trail station]] in Calgary]]
Alberta has a dry [[continental climate]] with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, the temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from {{convert|-54|C|sigfig=2}} in northern Alberta to {{convert|-46|C|sigfig=2}} in southern Alberta. In the summer, continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from {{convert|32|C}} in the mountains to {{convert|40|C}} in southern Alberta.<ref name="climatlas">

[[File:Prairie Alberta.jpg|thumb|[[Prairie]] in Alberta]]
Alberta extends for over {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average high temperatures in January range from {{convert|0|C|sigfig=2}} in the southwest to {{convert|-24|C|sigfig=2}} in the far north. The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[prevailing westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} in the southeast to {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on}} in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach {{convert|600|mm|abbr=on}} annually.<ref name="aboutab"/><ref>{{cite web  | title = Alberta Weather and Climate Data | publisher = Government of Alberta, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development | year = 2012 | url = http://agriculture.alberta.ca/acis }}</ref> The province is the namesake of the [[Alberta clipper]], a type of intense, fast-moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and descends with great speed over the rest of Canada and the northern United States.<ref name="Alberta Clipper">{{cite web|title=Alberta Clipper|url=http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/2000/02/15.html|publisher=The Weather Notebook|accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>
[[File:May 2011 Wildfires in Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of wildfires in Alberta]]
In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around {{convert|21|C}} in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north, up to around {{convert|28|C}} in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation.
Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 up to just under 2600 hours per year. Northern Alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.<ref name="climatlas"/>

In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry [[chinook winds]] blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at [[Pincher Creek]], temperatures soared from {{convert|-19|to|22|C|F|sigfig=2}} in just one hour.<ref name="aboutab"/> The region around [[Lethbridge]] has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year. Calgary has a 56% chance of a [[white Christmas (weather)|white Christmas]], while Edmonton has an 86% chance.<ref name=Canadawhitechristmas>{{cite web|title=Chance of White Christmas|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=642F4B39-1|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>

Northern Alberta is mostly covered by [[taiga|boreal forest]] and has a [[subarctic climate]]. The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[steppe]] climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that [[evapotranspiration|evaporates or is used by plants]]. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the [[Palliser Triangle]], experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent [[crop yield]] problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter [[chinook wind]]s. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a [[biome]] transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.

After [[Southern Ontario]], [[The Prairies]] and [[Central Alberta]] is the most likely region in Canada to experience [[tornadoes]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the [[Calgary–Edmonton Corridor]] is notable for having the highest frequency of [[hail]] in Canada, which is caused by [[orographic lifting]] from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.

Both yellow and white [[sweet clover]] can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.

The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Conifer]]s include [[Jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[Lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].

==== Fauna ====
[[File:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|The [[bighorn sheep]] is Alberta's provincial animal]]
The four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.

Alberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[American Black Bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], fox, [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).

[[Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tail deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]].

[[File:Mill woods edmonton waterfowl.JPG|thumb|left|Water birds in Edmonton]]Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout|brown]] [[trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. [[Bull Trout]], native to the province, is the Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.

Alberta is the only province in Canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument |title = The History of Rat Control in Alberta| author=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=January 11, 2007}}</ref> Since the early 1950s, the [[Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can be kept in the province by only zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions.

[[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the [[last ice age]]. They are thought to have migrated from [[Siberia]] to [[Alaska]] on a [[Beringia|land bridge]] across the [[Bering Strait]], and then may have moved down the east side of the [[Rocky Mountains]] through Alberta to [[Settlement of the Americas|settle the Americas]]. Others may have [[Coastal Migration#Coastal migration hypothesis in the New World|migrated down the coast]] of British Columbia and then moved inland.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Canada's First Nations | work = Applied History | publisher = University of Calgary | year = 2000 | url = http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/firstnations/theories.html | accessdate =February 1, 2011 }}</ref> Over time they differentiated into various [[First Nations]] peoples, including the [[Plains Indian]] tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy]] and the [[Plains Cree]], who generally lived by hunting buffalo ([[American bison]]), and the more northerly tribes such as the [[Woodland Cree]] and [[Chipewyan]] who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.<ref>{{cite web | title = First Nations | work = History | publisher = Government of Alberta | date = 1995–2011 | url = http://alberta.ca/home/182.cfm#Nations | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110716160911/http://alberta.ca/home/182.cfm#Nations | archivedate = 2011-07-16 | accessdate =February 1, 2011}}</ref>

After the [[British America|British arrival in Canada]], approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the [[Athabasca River]] drainage, became part of [[Rupert's Land]] which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into [[Hudson Bay]]. This area was granted by [[Charles II of England]] to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of [[French Canadian]]s in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] and [[Bonnyville, Alberta|Bonnyville]]. Fort La Jonquière was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.

The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who learned of the [[Methye Portage]], which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the [[North West Company]] (NWC) of [[Montreal]] to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]] in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the [[Mackenzie River]]—which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2521|title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography|author=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|accessdate=January 5, 2006}}</ref>

The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], [[Louisiana Purchase|sold to the United States]] in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the [[49th parallel north|Forty-Ninth Parallel]] was ceded to Great Britain.

Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities. The amalgamated Hudson's Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed [[Canadian Government]] purchased Rupert's Land. Northern Alberta was included in the [[North-Western Territory]] until 1870, when it and Rupert's land became Canada's [[Northwest Territories]].

The [[District of Alberta]] was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the District of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] as the first premier.

On June 21, 2013, during the [[2013 Alberta floods]] Alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the [[Bow River|Bow]], [[Elbow River|Elbow]], [[Highwood River|Highwood]] and [[Oldman River|Oldman]] rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kaufmann |first=Bill |title=Thousands flee rising waters from Red Deer to Crowsnest |work=Calgary Sun |date=June 21, 2013 |page=3}}</ref>

[[File:Alberta population.svg|thumb|Alberta's population has grown steadily for over a century.]]

In the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 census]], Alberta had a population of 3,645,257 living in 1,390,275 of its 1,505,007 total dwellings, a 10.8% change from its 2006 population of 3,290,350.

Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.<ref name="Components of population growth of Alberta">{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo33c.htm|title=Components of population growth, by province and territory |publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas.

The [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 census]] found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the province's population. The next most common mother tongues were various [[Chinese languages]] with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).<ref name="Detailed Mother Tongue Alberta">{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/tbt/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=838045&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=89201&PRID=0&PTYPE=88971,97154&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2006&THEME=70&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=|title=Detailed Mother Tongue (186), Knowledge of Official Languages (5), Age Groups (17A) and Sex (3) for the Population of Canada, Provinces, Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2001 and 2006 Censuses – 20% Sample Data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref>

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from [[English Canadian|England]], [[Scottish Canadian|Scotland]], [[Irish Canadian|Ireland]] and [[Canadians of Welsh descent|Wales]], but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably [[German Canadian|Germany]], [[French Canadian|France]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukraine]] and [[Scandinavia]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables | work = 2006 Census | publisher = Statistics Canada | year = 2008 | url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/index.cfm?Lang=E | accessdate =August 19, 2008}}
</ref> According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of [[Francophones]] in western Canada (after [[Manitoba]]). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of [[Franco-Albertan|Alberta's French-speaking residents]] live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.

As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Alberta's population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic [[Chinatown]]s, and Calgary has Canada's third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. [[Aboriginal peoples in Alberta|Aboriginal Albertans]] make up approximately three percent of the population.

In the 2006 [[Census in Canada|Canadian census]], the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 [[English-Canadian|English]] (27.2%); 679,705 [[German-Canadian|German]] (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] (20.3%); 539,160 [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] (16.6%); 388,210 [[French Canadian|French]] (11.9%); 332,180 [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]] (10.2%); 172,910 [[Canadians of Dutch descent|Dutch]] (5.3%); 170,935 [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] (5.2%); 169,355 [[North American Indian]] (5.2%); 144,585 [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] (4.4%); and 137,600 [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] (4.2%).

Amongst those of British origins, the [[Scottish Canadian|Scots]] have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including [[Calgary]], [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]], [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]], and [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] having [[Scottish place names in Canada|Scottish]] origins.

As of the [[Canada 2001 Census]] the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 25.7% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of [[non-religious]] residents in Canada (after British Columbia) at 23.1% of the population. Of the remainder, 13.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the [[United Church of Canada]], while 5.9% were [[Anglican Church in Canada|Anglican]]. [[Lutherans]] made up 4.8% of the population while [[Baptists]] comprised 2.5%.

The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province and made up 1.7% of the population. Alberta has a population of [[Hutterite]]s, a communal [[Anabaptist]] sect similar to the [[Mennonites]] (Hutterites represented 0.4% of the population while Mennonites were 0.8%), and has a significant population of [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] at 0.3%. Alberta is home to several [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the [[Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton]], and the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada]]'s [[Archbishop of Edmonton and Western Canada|Western Diocese]] which is based in Edmonton.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Alberta}}
Alberta's economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at [[Canadian dollar|C$]]74,825. This was 61% higher than the national average of [[Canadian dollar|C$]]46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.statcan.ca/english/ads/11-010-XPB/pdf/sep06.pdf| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090326023337/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ads-annonces/11-010-x/pdf/6000725-eng.pdf| archivedate= 2009-03-26|format=PDF |author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada | title= The Alberta economic Juggernaut:The boom on the rose| month= September |year= 2006| accessdate=February 2, 2007}}</ref> According to the 2006 census,<ref name="Median earnings for economic families with earnings Alberta">{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/income/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=5&Data1=1&Data2=1&StartRec=1&Sort=2&Display=Page|title=Median earnings for economic families with earnings, both senior and non-senior families, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).

The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).<ref name="CECorridor">{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=January 20, 2003|accessdate=March 22, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070223191204/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm| archivedate= February 23, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style [[quality of life]], offering [[universal health care]] benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other [[List of cities in Canada|Canadian cities]] at that time.

The [[Fraser Institute]] states that Alberta also has very high levels of [[economic freedom]] and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://oldfraser.lexi.net/media/media_releases/2001/20010626.html | title= Alberta Rated as Best Investment Climate | author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2006| month= November | accessdate=March 2, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070416011123/http://oldfraser.lexi.net/media/media_releases/2001/20010626.html| archivedate= April 16, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and the second freest economy amongst U.S. states and Canadian provinces.<ref>{{cite book| url= http://www.freetheworld.com/efna.html | title= Economic Freedom of North America 2008 Annual Report| author= The Fraser Institute | authorlink= Fraser Institute| year= 2008| accessdate=August 1, 2008 | isbn=0-88975-213-3 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080621175010/http://www.freetheworld.com/efna.html| archivedate= June 21, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The government of Alberta has invested its earnings wisely; as of 30 September 2013, official statistics reported nearly 500 holdings.<ref>[http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/her-majesty-the-queen-in-right-of-the-province-of-alberta-as-804398 NASDAQ Institutional Portfolio: "HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA"]</ref>

=== Industry ===
[[File:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]]]
Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], natural gas and gas products in Canada. Alberta is the world’s second largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth largest producer.<ref name="Alaska and Alberta - An Overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061215031033/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm|archivedate=December 15, 2006|title=Alaska and Alberta – An Overview|publisher=Government of Alaska|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in North America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, [[polyethylene]] and [[vinyl]] manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world. Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical]] industry to the east of Edmonton.

The [[Athabasca oil sands]] surrounding [[Fort McMurray]] have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6&nbsp;trillion barrels (254&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>). Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the [[oil sands]]. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.<ref name="Canada's Oil and Gas Industry">{{cite web|url=http://www.buyusa.gov/montana/canadaoilsands.html|title=Canada Oilsands Opportunities|publisher=U.S. Commercial Service|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] have made it profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive [[liquid crystal display]] systems.<ref>[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5448263.html Interactive display system]—US Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; [http://web.archive.org/web/20090215131340/http://www2.smarttech.com/st/en-US/About+Us/News+Room/Media+Releases/2002+Media+Releases.htm?guid=%7BB3BD6857-5D25-4EC7-A741-C0232368F5FE%7D U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive Technology]—SMART Technologies</ref> With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

=== Agriculture and forestry ===
[[File:Peace Country grain fields.JPG|thumb|Grain fields in the Peace Country]]
[[File:Warner Elevator Row.jpg|thumb|The [[Warner elevator row]], the last surviving elevator row in Alberta, currently unprotected]]
Agriculture has a significant position in the province's economy. The province has over three million head of cattle,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$Department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb13754 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections – October 2011 |date=November 24, 2011 |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the top producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.

Wheat and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other [[cereal|grains]] are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern forest reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint.

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Alberta}}

Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as [[West Edmonton Mall]], [[Calgary Stampede]], outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the [[Commonwealth Games]] and Olympic Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like [[Elk Island National Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], and the [[Columbia Icefield]].

According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.<ref name="Geography & Climate:Encourage Canadian Immigration">{{cite web|url=http://www.akcanada.com/lic_alberta.cfm|title=Living in Canada : Alberta|publisher=AKCanada|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref> Alberta tourism relies heavily on [[Southern Ontario]] tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many international countries.

Alberta's Rocky Mountains include well-known tourist destinations Banff National Park and [[Jasper National Park]]. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic [[Icefields Parkway]]. Banff is located {{convert|128|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Calgary on [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway 1]], and Jasper is located {{convert|366|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Edmonton on [[Yellowhead Highway]]. Five of Canada's fourteen [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage site]]s are located within the province: [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], Wood Buffalo National Park, [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]] and [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]].

[[File:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]] in the [[Canadian Rockies]]]]
About 1.2 million people visit the of [[Calgary Stampede]],<ref name="Landmark Stampede Dates">{{cite web|url=http://www.stampede.coolattractions.com/history.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071116223219/http://www.stampede.coolattractions.com/history.html|archivedate=November 16, 2007|title=History of the Stampede|publisher=Calgary Stampede|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> a celebration of Canada's own [[Wild West]] and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmonton's [[K-Days]] (formerly Klondike Days and Capital EX).<ref name=KDays>{{cite news | url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/festivals/Capital+named+Days/7002873/story.html | title=Capital Ex to be named K-Days (Poll) | author=Manisha Krishnan | newspaper=[[Edmonton Journal]] | publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] | date=2012-07-29 | accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalex.ca/about|title=About|publisher=Northlands|accessdate=March 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100328142638/http://www.capitalex.ca/about| archivedate= March 28, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the [[Yukon]] [[Gold mining|gold field]]s, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous [[Chilkoot Pass]].

Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. [[Drumheller]], "Dinosaur Capital of The World", offers the [[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology]]. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canada's largest coal producers during the war years.

Located in east-central Alberta is [[Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions]], a popular tourist attraction operated out of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]], that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.

Alberta has numerous ski resorts most notably [[Sunshine Village]], [[Lake Louise Mountain Resort|Lake Louise]], [[Marmot Basin]], [[Mount Norquay ski resort|Norquay]] and [[Nakiska]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}{{See also|List of Alberta Premiers|List of Alberta general elections|Executive Council of Alberta}}
[[File:Edmonton leg.jpg|thumb|[[Alberta Legislature Building|Alberta's Legislative Building]] in [[Edmonton]]]]

[[File:JasperRoadEdmt.jpg|thumb|alt=Image looking west down Jasper Avenue showing the major financial centre in Edmonton|[[Jasper Avenue]] is Edmonton's hub of offices and the financial centres.]]
The Government of Alberta is organized as a [[parliamentary]] democracy with a unicameral legislature. Its [[unicameral]] legislature—the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]]—consists of eighty-seven members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.<ref>[http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly]</ref>

Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide. Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as "counties" in Alberta.

As Canada's [[head of state]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor [[Donald Ethell]]. Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is [[Alison Redford]] who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on October 1, 2011. Redford was sworn in as the 14th [[Premier of Alberta]] on October 7, 2011. The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and she draws all the members of her Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.

The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of Alberta.

Alberta's elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives ("Conservatives" or "Tories"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]. A fourth party, the strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. Only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.

Alberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are several currently active groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form.

In the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 provincial election]], held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] members were elected.<ref name="2008 Alberta Election Results">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308170551/http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archivedate=2008-03-08|title=2008 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

The April 23, 2012 [[Alberta general election, 2012|election]] returned the Progressive Conservative Party to government, making leader [[Alison Redford]] Alberta's first elected female premier.<ref name="2012 Alberta Election Results">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/albertavotes2012/story/2012/04/23/albertavotes2012-election-results.html|title=2012 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref> In the 2012 provincial election, held on April 23, 2012, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government and party leader Alison Redford retained as premier with 43.9% of the vote and 61 of 87 seats (The Legislative Assembly added 4 seats, increasing the total to 87, with the 2012 election), the [[Wildrose Party]] led by Danielle Smith was elected as the Official Opposition with 34.3% of the vote and 17 members (replacing the Liberal Party), five Liberals were elected with 9.9% of the vote and four NDP members were elected with 9.8% of the vote.<ref>[http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm Provincial General Election April 23, 2012]</ref>

=== Taxation ===
Government revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).<ref name="Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength">{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503001735/http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archivedate=May 3, 2008|title=Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] of 5%). It is also the only Canadian province to have a [[flat tax]] for personal income taxes, which is 10% of taxable income.<ref name="What are the income tax rates in Canada for 2009?">{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/fq/txrts-eng.html|title=What are the income tax rates in Canada for 2009?|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

The Alberta personal income tax system maintains a [[progressive taxation|progressive character]] by granting residents personal tax exemptions of $16,977, in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.<ref name="Alberta Tax and Credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/prvncl/09-eng.html|title=Alberta Tax and Credits|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> Alberta's municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co-operation with the provincial government.

Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution. The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.<ref name="The Right Way to Sell Booze in New Brunswick">{{cite web|title=The Right Way to Sell Booze in New Brunswick|url=http://www.taxpayer.com/atlantic/right-way-sell-booze-new-brunswick|publisher=Taxpayer|accessdate=November 2, 2010}}</ref> Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million.

[[File:DavidThompsonHighway.JPG|thumb|[[Alberta Highway 11|David Thompson Highway]] outside of [[Banff National Park]]]]

[[File:Alberta Hwy 63 2.jpg|thumb|Alberta Highway 63 north of [[Fort McMurray]]]]
Alberta has over {{convert|181000|km|0|abbr=on}} of highways and roads, of which nearly {{convert|41000|km|0|abbr=on}} are paved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://albertacanada.com/about-alberta/roads-and-highways.html |title=Roads and highways |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> The main north-south [[wikt:corridor|corridor]] is [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]], which begins south of [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] at the [[Carway, Alberta|Carway]] border crossing and is part of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]]. [[Alberta Highway 4|Highway 4]], which effectively extends [[Interstate 15]] into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the [[Coutts, Alberta|Coutts]] border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. [[Alberta Highway 3|Highway 3]] joins Lethbridge to [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Fort Macleod]] and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.

North of Edmonton, the highway continues to [[Athabasca, Alberta|Athabasca]], then northwesterly along the south shore of [[Lesser Slave Lake]] into [[High Prairie, Alberta|High Prairie]], north to [[Peace River, Alberta|Peace River]], west to [[Fairview, Alberta (town)|Fairview]] and finally south to [[Grande Prairie]], where it ends at an interchange with [[Alberta Highway 43|Highway 43]]. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the [[Queen Elizabeth II Highway]] to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005. Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: [[Alberta Highway 22|Highway 22]], west of Highway 2, known as ''Cowboy Trail'', and [[Alberta Highway 21|Highway 21]], east of Highway 2. Highway 43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the [[Peace River Country]]; [[Alberta Highway 63|Highway 63]] travels northeast to Fort McMurray, the location of the Athabasca oil sands.

Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the [[Yellowhead Highway]] ([[Alberta Highway 16|Highway 16]]), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and [[Jasper National Park]] into British Columbia. One of the most scenic drives is along the [[Icefields Parkway]], which runs for {{convert|228|km|0|abbr=on}} between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.

Another major corridor through central Alberta is [[Alberta Highway 11|Highway 11]] (also known as the [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] Highway), which runs east from the [[Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta|Saskatchewan River Crossing]] in Banff National Park through [[Rocky Mountain House]] and [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], connecting with [[Alberta Highway 12|Highway 12]] {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Stettler, Alberta|Stettler]]. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.

Urban stretches of Alberta's major highways and freeways are often called ''trails''. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called [[Deerfoot Trail]] as it passes through Calgary but becomes [[Calgary Trail]] (for southbound traffic) and [[Gateway Boulevard]] (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban [[limited-access road|expressway]]s ''trails'' and naming many of them after prominent [[First Nations]] individuals and tribes, such as [[Crowchild Trail]], Deerfoot Trail, and [[Stoney Trail]].
[[File:Calgary LRT-3.JPG|thumb|[[Calgary Transit]] [[C-Train]] ]]
Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial [[public transit]] systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate [[light rail transit]] (LRT) systems. [[Edmonton LRT]], which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary [[C-Train]] has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.

Alberta is well-connected by air, with [[international airport]]s in both Calgary and Edmonton. [[Calgary International Airport]] and [[Edmonton International Airport]] are the fourth and fifth [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|busiest in Canada]] respectively. Calgary's airport is a hub for [[WestJet|WestJet Airlines]] and a regional hub for [[Air Canada]]. Calgary's airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in [[Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Calgary Airport Authority">{{cite web|url=http://www.yyc.com/|title=Calgary Airport Authority|publisher=Calgary Airport Authority|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref> Edmonton's airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.<ref name="EIA">{{cite web|url=http://www.flyeia.com/|title=EIA|publisher=Edmonton International Airport|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

There are more than {{convert|9000|km|0|abbr=on}} of operating mainline railway; the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]] companies operate railway [[freight]] across the province. Passenger trains include [[Via Rail]]'s '''Canadian''' (Toronto-Vancouver) or '''Jasper-Prince Rupert''' trains, which use the CN mainline and pass through Jasper National Park and parallel the Yellowhead Highway during at least part of their routes. The [[Rocky Mountaineer]] operates two sections: one from Vancouver to Banff and Calgary over CP tracks, and a section that travels over CN tracks to Jasper.

[[File:Alberta Children's Hospital 3+4.jpg|thumb|[[Alberta Children's Hospital]], Calgary]]

Alberta provides a [[publicly funded health care]] system for all its citizens and residents as set out by the provisions of the [[Canada Health Act]] of 1984. Alberta became Canada's second province (after [[Saskatchewan]]) to adopt a [[Tommy Douglas]]-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] system.

Alberta's health care budget is currently $17.1 billion during the 2013–2014 fiscal year (approximately 45% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Every hour more than $1.9 million is spent on health care in the province.<ref name="Health Care Funding Allocations 2013–2014">{{cite web |url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding.html |title=Health funding – Allocations for 2013–2014 |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Alberta}}
[[File:SAIT Heart Building 2.jpg|thumb|Heritage Hall at [[SAIT Polytechnic]]]]
As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).

=== Elementary schools ===
There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]]) has a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.

For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K–12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K–12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K–12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.

[[Public school (government funded)|Public]] and separate school boards, [[charter school]]s, and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Homeschool tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.

=== Universities ===
{{Main|Higher education in Alberta}}
[[File:Saint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|St. Joseph’s College at the [[University of Alberta]]]]

The [[University of Alberta]], established in Edmonton in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]], both of which are located in their title cities.

In early September 2009, [[Mount Royal University]] became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made [[MacEwan University]] Edmonton's second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]].<ref name="Service Centres">{{cite web|url=http://aet.alberta.ca/technology/actionplan/servicecentres.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110706164312/http://aet.alberta.ca/technology/actionplan/servicecentres.aspx|archivedate=2011-07-06|title=Service Centres|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>

There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly [[List of colleges in Alberta#Private Colleges|Christian Universities]], bringing the total number of universities to twelve, plus a [[DeVry University]] in Calgary, the only location in Canada. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier [[Ralph Klein]] made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.su.ualberta.ca/su/student_government/advocacy/|title=Advocacy|publisher=University of Alberta Students Unions|accessdate=August 9, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061011224154/http://www.su.ualberta.ca/su/student_government/advocacy/|archivedate=October 11, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=276&month=2&day=16&year=2005 |title=Klein promises tuition freeze |last=Bellamy |first=Marshall |publisher=The Gazette |date=February 16, 2005 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref> So far, no plan has been released by the Government of Alberta.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Alberta}}
{{See also|Festivals in Alberta}}
[[File:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|thumb|The [[Calgary Stampede]]]]
Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]] is the world's second largest after the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals. The city's "heritage days" festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmonton's [[Churchill Square (Edmonton)|Churchill Square]] is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton & [[The Works Art & Design Festival]] throughout the summer months.

The City of Calgary is also famous for its [[Calgary Stampede|Stampede]], dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth." The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as [[calf roping]] and [[bull riding]]. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.

The [[Banff Centre]] hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international [[Banff Mountain Film Festival|Mountain Film Festival]]. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. Soccer, [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta.
