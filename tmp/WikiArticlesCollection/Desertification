'''Desertification''' is a type of [[land degradation]] in which a relatively [[drylands|dry]] land region becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.<ref name="Geist-2005-p2">Geist (2005), [http://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&pg=PA2 p. 2]</ref> It is caused by a variety of factors, such as [[climate change]] and human activities. Desertification is a significant global ecological and [[environmental problems|environmental problem]].<ref name="Geist-2005-p4">Geist (2005), [http://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref>

==Definitions==
Considerable controversy exists over the proper definition of the term "desertification" for which Helmut Geist (2005) has identified more than 100 formal definitions.The most widely accepted<ref name="Geist-2005-p2" /> of these is that of the [[Princeton University]] Dictionary which defines it as "the process of fertile land transforming into desert typically as a result of deforestation, drought or improper/inappropriate agriculture"<ref>[https://www.google.com.sg/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=define%3Adesertification#hl=en&q=desertification&tbs=dfn:1&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=HWuXT-GGL8_NrQeTvq26AQ&ved=0CCwQkQ4&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=83aa6ed19b0ba29e&biw=1440&bih=809 Google Dictionary (2012)]</ref>

The earliest known discussion of the topic arose soon after the [[French colonization]] of [[West Africa]], when the Comité d'Etudes commissioned a study on ''desséchement progressif'' to explore the prehistoric expansion of the Sahara Desert.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Mortimore, Michael|title=Adapting to drought: farmers, famines, and desertification in west Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-521-32312-3|page=12|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dx89AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12}}</ref>

==History==
The world's most noted [[deserts]] have been formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts are large [[sand sea]]s now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, some extending beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the [[Sahara]], the largest hot desert.<ref name="Desertification">United States Geological Survey, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/ "Desertification"], 1997</ref>

Desertification has played a significant role in human history, contributing to the collapse of several large empires, such as Carthage, Greece, and the Roman Empire, as well as causing displacement of local populations.<ref name="Geist-2005-p4" /><ref>{{cite book|author=Whitford, Walter G.|title=Ecology of desert systems|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-12-747261-4|page=277|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OZ4hZbXS8IcC&pg=PA277}}</ref><ref>Bogumil Terminski (2011), Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella, Policy Studies Organization (PSO), Washington.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geist|first=Helmut|title=The causes and progression of desertification|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=desertification+and+its+effect+on+ancient+civilisations&source=bl&ots=5kLznD1bv-&sig=pd8eodCyZuBl_KH4MQHyfx9QKsY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gVHYUfnIM4bmigLAzoHwCw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=desertification%20and%20its%20effect%20on%20ancient%20civilisations&f=false|work=Antony Rowe Ltd|publisher=Ashgate publishing limited|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>

Drylands occupy approximately 40–41% of Earth’s land area<ref>Bauer (2007), [http://books.google.com/books?id=mR3E4xJFNw0C&pg=PA78 p. 78]</ref><ref name="johnson-1">Johnson et al (2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=da6vhzHEpf0C&pg=PA1 p. 1]</ref> and are home to more than 2 billion people.<ref name="johnson-1" /> It has been estimated that some 10–20% of drylands are already degraded, the total area affected by desertification being between 6 and 12 million square kilometres, that about 1–6% of the inhabitants of drylands live in desertified areas, and that a billion people are under threat from further desertification.<ref name="holtz">[http://www.unccd.int/cop/cop8/docs/parl-disc.pdf Holtz (2007)]</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=World Bank|title=Gender in agriculture sourcebook|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8213-7587-7|page=454|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XxBrq6hTs_UC&pg=PA454}}</ref>

As of 1998, the then-current degree of southward expansion of the [[Sahara]] was not well known, due to a lack of recent, measurable expansion of the desert into the Sahel at the time.<ref>[http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/~alesall/ouagaCILSS/articles/sen_bams1998.pdf]</ref>

==Vegetation patterning==
As the desertification takes place, the landscape may progress through different stages and continuously transform in appearance. On gradually sloped terrain, desertification can create increasingly larger empty spaces over a large strip of land, a phenomenon known as "[[Tiger bush|Brousse tigrée]]". An mathematical model of this phenomenon proposed by C. Klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Klausmeier|first=Christopher|title=Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=284|issue=5421|pages=1826–1828}}</ref>  One outcome of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15182754,00.html Straw squares method: planting with empty spaces in between plants to combat desertification]</ref>

==Causes==
[[Image:Cabrasnortechico.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A herd of [[goats]] in [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], [[Chile]]. Overgrazing of drylands is one of the primary causes of desertification.]]
[[File:Morroco-arid-climate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A shepherd guiding his sheep through the high desert outside of [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]].]]

The immediate cause is the removal of most vegetation. This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil. Studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Geeson, Nichola et al|title=Mediterranean desertification: a mosaic of processes and responses|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0-470-84448-9|page=58|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G_0qg0f49GQC&pg=PA58}}</ref> Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan. Alternatively, recent research has suggested that the movement and migration of large herds of livestock and wildlife has an integral role in the preservation of vegetation and soil fertilization, and that the removal of livestock and wildlife (largely by human influence) has been the main driver of increasing desertification.<ref>{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Allan Savory: How to green the world's deserts and reverse climate change|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Holistic resource management: a conceptual framework for ecologically sound economic modelling|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ISEE_economic_modeling_paper.pdf|work=Ecological Economics|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Butterfield|first=Jody|title=Holistic Management Handbook: Healthy Land, Healthy Profits, Second Edition|year=2006|publisher=Island Press|isbn=1559638850}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Savory|first=Allan|title=Response to request for information on the "science" and "methodology" underpinning Holistic Management and holistic planned grazing|url=http://www.savoryinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Science-Methodology-Holistic-Mgt_Update_March.pdf|work=Savory Institute|accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

==Poverty==
At least 90% of the inhabitants of drylands live in [[developing nations]], where they also suffer from poor economic and social conditions.<ref name="holtz" /> This situation is exacerbated by land degradation because of the reduction in productivity, the precariousness of living conditions and the difficulty of access to resources and opportunities.<ref>
Dobie, Ph. 2001. “Poverty and the drylands”, in Global Drylands Imperative, Challenge paper, Undp, Nairobi (Kenya) 16 p.</ref>

A downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries by overgrazing, land exhaustion and overdrafting of groundwater in many of the marginally productive world regions due to [[overpopulation]] pressures to exploit marginal drylands for farming. Decision-makers are understandably averse to invest in arid zones with low potential. This absence of investment contributes to the marginalisation of these zones. When unfavourable agro-climatic conditions are combined with an absence of infrastructure and access to markets, as well as poorly adapted production techniques and an underfed and undereducated population, most such zones are excluded from development.<ref name="csf-desertification.org">[http://www.csf-desertification.org/index.php/bibliotheque/doc_details/119-cornet-antoine-2002-desertification-and-its-relationship-to-the-environment-and-development Cornet A., 2002.

Desertification often causes rural lands to become unable to support the same sized populations that previously lived there. This results in mass migrations out of rural areas and into urban areas, particularly in Africa. These migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people, who end up living in [[slums]].<ref>{{cite book|authors=Pasternak, Dov & Schlissel, Arnold|title=Combating desertification with plants|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-46632-8|page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B-i8-DPf6xgC&pg=PA20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=161|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&pg=PA161}}</ref>

==Countermeasures and prevention==

Techniques exist for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification, however there are numerous barriers to their implementation. One of these is that the costs of adopting sustainable agricultural practices sometimes exceed the benefits for individual farmers, even while they are socially and environmentally beneficial.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Another issue is a lack of political will, and lack of funding to support [[land reclamation]] and anti-desertification programs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=237|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&pg=PA237}}</ref>

Desertification is recognized as a major threat to [[biodiversity]]. Some countries have developed [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to counter its effects, particularly in relation to the protection of endangered [[flora]] and [[fauna]].<ref>Techniques for Desert Reclamation by Andrew S. Goudie</ref><ref>[http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html Desert reclamation projects]</ref>

[[Reforestation]] gets at one of the root causes of desertification and isn't just a treatment of the symptoms. Environmental organizations<ref>For example, [http://edenprojects.org/ Eden Reforestation Projects].</ref> work in places where deforestation and desertification are contributing to extreme [[poverty]]. There they focus primarily on educating the local population about the dangers of deforestation and sometimes employ them to grow seedlings, which they transfer to severely deforested areas during the rainy season.<ref>{{USGovernment|sourceURL=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/}}</ref>

Techniques focus on two aspects: provisioning of water, and fixation and hyper-fertilizing soil.

Fixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce soil [[erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].

Some soils (for example, clay), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of sandy soils). Some techniques as zaï or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.<ref>[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html Arid sandy soils becoming consolidated; zai-system]</ref>

Another technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150m long, 1m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water of flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches of closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.<ref>[http://nagafoundation.org/ Westerveld's Naga Foundation]</ref>

Enriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often done by plants. Of these, the [[legume|Leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fixes it in the soil, and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.<ref>[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating]</ref>

As there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt-flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in [[Saudi-Arabia]]. These salt-flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.<ref>[http://www.h2ome.net/en/2011/09/rethinking-landscapes-105400/ Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-André Berdellé July 2011] H2O magazine</ref>

[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest — A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change – Water Matters - State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>

===Managed grazing===
Restoring grasslands store CO<sub>2</sub> from the air into plant material.
