The '''California Department of Transportation''' ('''Caltrans''') is an [[Executive (government)|executive]] department within the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. Its purpose is to improve mobility across the state. 

Caltrans manages the [[State highways in California|state highway system]] (which includes the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]]) and is actively involved with [[public transportation]] systems throughout the state. 

The department is part of the state [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]-level [[California State Transportation Agency]] (CalSTA). 

Like the majority of state government agencies, Caltrans is headquartered in [[Sacramento]].<ref>"[http://www.dot.ca.gov/mail.htm Caltrans Mail Addresses]." California Department of Transportation. Retrieved on November 19, 2009.</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Cal Trans District7 HD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Caltrans District 7 Headquarters|District 7 Headquarters]], Los Angeles, birds-eye view (designed by [[Thom Mayne]] (2004))]]
[[Image:Sb dt state 001a.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Caltrans District 8 Headquarters, San Bernardino, midheight (2005)]]
The earliest predecessor of Caltrans was the Bureau of Highways, which was created by the [[California Legislature]] and signed into law by Governor [[James Budd]] in 1895.<ref name=ForsythHagwood11>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 11</ref>  This agency consisted of three commissioners who were charged with analyzing the state road system and making recommendations.  At the time, there was no state highway system, since roads were purely a local responsibility.  The roads of California consisted of crude dirt roads maintained by county governments as well as some paved roads within city boundaries, and this ''ad hoc'' system was no longer adequate for the needs of the state's rapidly growing population.  After the commissioners submitted their report to the Governor on November 25, 1896, the Legislature replaced the Bureau with the Department of Highways.<ref>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 12.</ref>

Due to the state's weak fiscal condition and corrupt politics, little progress was made until 1907, when the Legislature replaced the Department of Highways with the Department of Engineering, within which there was a Division of Highways.<ref name=ForsythHagwood11/>  The voters approved a $18 million bond issue for the construction of a state highway system in 1910 and the first [[California Highway Commission|Highway Commission]] was convened in 1911.<ref name=ForsythHagwood11/>  On August 7, 1912, the Department broke ground on its first construction project, the section of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] between [[South San Francisco, California|South San Francisco]] and [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]] (now part of [[California State Route 82]]).<ref>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 13.</ref>  1912 also saw the founding of the Transportation Laboratory and the creation of seven administrative divisions (the predecessors of the 12 district offices that exist today).<ref name=ForsythHagwood11/>

In 1913, the Legislature started requiring vehicle registration and allocated the resulting funds to support regular highway maintenance, which began the next year.<ref name=ForsythHagwood11/>

In 1921, the Legislature turned the Department of Engineering into the Department of Public Works.<ref>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 32.</ref>

The history of Caltrans and its predecessor agencies during the 20th century was marked by many firsts.  It was one of the first agencies in the U.S. to implement the painting of centerlines on highways statewide (thanks to [[June McCarroll]]); the first to build a freeway west of the Mississippi (the [[Pasadena Freeway]]); the first to build a [[Four Level Interchange|four-level stack interchange]]; the first to develop and deploy nonreflective raised pavement markers, better known as [[Botts' dots]]; and one of the first to implement dedicated freeway-to-freeway connector ramps for [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s.

In late 1972, the Legislature approved a reorganization (suggested from a study initiated by then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]), in which the Department of Public Works was merged with the Department of Aeronautics to become the modern Department of Transportation.<ref>Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 128.</ref>

==Administration==
For administrative purposes, Caltrans has divided the state of California into 12 districts supervised by district offices. Most districts cover multiple [[County (United States)|counties]]; District 12 ([[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) is the only district with one county. The largest districts by population are District 4 ([[San Francisco Bay Area]]) and District 7 ([[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties). Like most state agencies, Caltrans maintains its headquarters in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which is covered by District 3.
