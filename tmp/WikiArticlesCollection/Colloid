The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 1 and 1000 [[nanometre|nanometers]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Ira N.|coauthors=|authorlink=|title=Physical Chemistry|edition=5th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|year=2001|isbn=0-07-231808-2|series=}}, p. 955</ref> Such particles are normally invisible in an optical [[microscope]], though their presence can be confirmed with the use of an [[ultramicroscope]] or an [[electron microscope]]. [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|Homogeneous]] mixtures with a dispersed phase in this size range may be called ''colloidal aerosols'', ''colloidal emulsions'', ''colloidal foams'', ''colloidal dispersions'', or ''hydrosols''. The dispersed-phase particles or droplets are affected largely by the [[surface science|surface chemistry]] present in the colloid.

Some colloids are translucent because of the [[Tyndall effect]], which is the scattering of light by particles in the colloid. Other colloids may be opaque or have a slight color.

Colloidal solutions (also called colloidal suspensions) are the subject of [[interface and colloid science]]. This field of study was introduced in 1861 by [[Scotland|Scottish]] scientist [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]].

==Classification==
Because the size of the dispersed phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of [[solution]]s, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane with a size smaller than their own dimension. The smaller the size of the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The exact value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for [[solubility]] studies of readily [[hydrolysed]] species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or [[organic matter]] [[complexation|complexing]] these species.
Colloids can be classified as follows:

Based on the nature of interaction between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, colloids can be classified as:
Hydrophilic colloids: These are water-loving colloids.The colloid particles are attracted toward water. They are also called reversible sols. 
Hydrophobic colloids: These are opposite in nature to hydrophilic colloids. The colloid particles are repelled by water. They are also called irreversible sols.

In some cases, a colloid can be considered a homogeneous mixture. This is because the distinction between "dissolved" and "particulate" matter can be sometimes a matter of approach, which affects whether or not it is homogeneous or heterogeneous.

==Hydrocolloids==
A '''hydrocolloid''' is defined as a colloid system wherein the colloid particles are hydrophilic polymers dispersed in [[water]]. A hydrocolloid has colloid particles spread throughout water, and depending on the quantity of water available that can take place in different states, e.g., [[gel]] or [[sol (colloid)|sol]] (liquid). Hydrocolloids can be either [[irreversibility|irreversible]] (single-state) or [[reversible reaction|reversible]]. For example, [[agar]], a reversible hydrocolloid of [[seaweed]] extract, can exist in a gel and solid state, and alternate between states with the addition or elimination of heat.

Many hydrocolloids are derived from natural sources. For example, [[agar-agar]] and [[carrageenan]] are extracted from seaweed, [[gelatin]] is produced by hydrolysis of proteins of [[bovinae|bovine]] and fish origins, and [[pectin]] is extracted from [[citrus]] peel and apple [[pomace]].

[[Gelatin dessert]]s like jelly or [[Jell-O]] are made from gelatin powder, another effective hydrocolloid. Hydrocolloids are employed in food mainly to influence [[Mouthfeel|texture]] or [[viscosity]] (e.g., a sauce). [[Hydrocolloid dressing|Hydrocolloid-based medical dressing]]s are used for [[Human skin|skin]] and [[wound]] treatment.

Other main hydrocolloids are [[xanthan gum]], [[gum arabic]], [[guar gum]], [[locust bean gum]], cellulose derivatives as [[carboxymethyl cellulose]], [[alginate]] and [[starch]].

Based on the nature of interaction between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, colloids can be classified as:
Hydrophilic colloids: These are water-loving colloids.The colloid particles are attracted toward water. They are also called reversible sols. 
Hydrophobic colloids: These are opposite in nature to hydrophilic colloids. The colloid particles are repelled by water. They are also called irreversible sols.

==Interaction between particles==
The following forces play an important role in the interaction of colloid particles:
*[[Excluded volume|Excluded volume repulsion]]: This refers to the impossibility of any overlap between hard particles.
*[[Coulomb's law|Electrostatic interaction]]: Colloidal particles often carry an electrical charge and therefore attract or repel each other. The charge of both the continuous and the dispersed phase, as well as the mobility of the phases are factors affecting this interaction.
*[[van der Waals force]]s: This is due to interaction between two dipoles that are either permanent or induced. Even if the particles do not have a permanent dipole, fluctuations of the electron density gives rise to a temporary dipole in a particle. This temporary dipole induces a dipole in particles nearby. The temporary dipole and the induced dipoles are then attracted to each other. This is known as van der Waals force, and is always present (unless the refractive indexes of the dispersed and continuous phases are matched), is short-range, and is attractive.
*[[Entropic force]]s: According to the second law of thermodynamics, a system progresses to a state in which entropy is maximized. This can result in effective forces even between hard spheres.
*[[Steric effects|Steric forces]] between polymer-covered surfaces or in solutions containing non-adsorbing polymer can modulate interparticle forces, producing an additional steric repulsive force (which is predominantly entropic in origin) or an attractive [[depletion force]] between them. Such an effect is specifically searched for with tailor-made [[superplasticizer]]s developed to increase the workability of concrete and to reduce its [[water reducer|water content]].

==Preparation==
There are two principal ways of preparation of colloids:<ref>http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=preparation_of_colloids</ref>
* Dispersion of large particles or droplets to the colloidal dimensions by milling, [[Aerosol spray|spraying]], or application of shear (e.g., shaking, mixing, or [[High-shear mixer|high shear mixing]]).
* Condensation of small dissolved molecules into larger colloidal particles by precipitation, condensation, or redox reactions. Such processes are used in the preparation of colloidal [[Stöber process|silica]] or [[colloidal gold|gold]].

==Stabilization (peptization)==
The stability of a colloidal system is the capability of the system to remain as it is.

Stability is hindered by aggregation and sedimentation phenomena, which are driven by the colloids tendency to reduce surface energy. Reducing the interfacial tension will stabilize the colloidal system by reducing this driving force. 
[[File:ColloidalStability.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of a stable and of an unstable colloidal dispersion.]]

Aggregation is due to the sum of the interaction forces between particles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Israelachvili|first=Jacob N.|title=Intermolecular and Surface Forces|year=1991|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-391927-4|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=vgyBJbtNOcoC&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281&dq=Intermolecular+and+Surface+Forces+1991+ISBN&source=bl&ots=_NPm5jB_Yf&sig=LwEkFopryZDlLipJft4qidkO1e8&hl=it&ei=YZbPTu3lNePm4QScm4k8&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Menachem Elimelech, John Gregory, Xiadong Jia, Richard Williams|title=Particle deposition and aggregation: measurement, modelling and simulation|year=1998|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=0-7506-7024-X}}</ref> If attractive forces (such as van der Waals forces) prevail over the repulsive ones (such as the electrostatic ones) particles aggregate in clusters.

Electrostatic stabilization and steric stabilization are the two main mechanisms for stabilization against aggregation.
* '''Electrostatic stabilization''' is based on the mutual repulsion of like electrical charges. In general, different phases have different charge affinities, so that an electrical double layer forms at any interface. Small particle sizes lead to enormous surface areas, and this effect is greatly amplified in colloids. In a stable colloid, mass of a dispersed phase is so low that its buoyancy or kinetic energy is too weak to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between charged layers of the dispersing phase.
* '''Steric stabilization''' consists in covering the particles in polymers which prevents the particle to get close in the range of attractive forces.
A combination of the two mechanisms is also possible (electrosteric stabilization). All the above mentioned mechanisms  for minimizing [[particle aggregation]] rely on the enhancement of the repulsive interaction forces.

Electrostatic and steric stabilization do not directly address the sedimentation/floating problem.

Particle sedimentation (and also floating, although this phenomenon is less common) arises from a difference in the density of the dispersed and of the continuous phase. The higher the difference in densities, the faster the particle settling.
* The '''gel network stabilization''' represents the principal way to produce colloids stable to both aggregation and sedimentation.<ref name="Comba 2009 3717–3726">{{cite journal|last=Comba|first=Silvia|coauthors=Sethi|title=Stabilization of highly concentrated suspensions of iron nanoparticles using shear-thinning gels of xanthan gum|journal=Water Research|year=2009|month=August|volume=43|issue=15|pages=3717–3726|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2009.05.046|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313540900356X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cantrell|first=K.J.|coauthors=Kaplan, D.I., Gilmore, T.J.|title=Injection of colloidal Fe-0 particles in sand with shear-thinning fluids|journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering-Asce|year=1997|volume=123|issue=8|pages=786–791|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1997)123:8(786)|url=http://ascelibrary.org/eeo/resource/1/joeedu/v123/i8/p786_s1?isAuthorized=no}}</ref>
The method consists in adding to the colloidal suspension a polymer able to form a gel network and characterized by shear thinning properties. Examples of such substances are xanthan and guar gum.

[[File:ComparisonStericStab-ShearThinningFluids2.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Steric and Gel network stabilization.]]

Particle settling is hindered by the stiffness of the polymeric matrix where particles are trapped.<ref name="Comba 2009 3717–3726"/> In addition, the long polymeric chains can provide a steric or electrosteric stabilization to dispersed particles.

The rheological shear thinning properties find beneficial in the preparation of the suspensions and in their use, as the reduced viscosity at high shear rates facilitates deagglomeration, mixing and in general the flow of the suspensions.

==Destabilization (flocculation)==
Unstable colloidal dispersions can form [[flocculation|flocs]] as the particles aggregate due to interparticle attractions. In this way photonic glasses can be grown. This can be accomplished by a number of different methods:
*Removal of the electrostatic barrier that prevents aggregation of the particles. This can be accomplished by the addition of salt to a suspension or changing the pH of a suspension to effectively neutralize or "screen" the surface charge of the particles in suspension. This removes the repulsive forces that keep colloidal particles separate and allows for coagulation due to van der Waals forces.
*Addition of a charged polymer flocculant. Polymer flocculants can bridge individual colloidal particles by attractive electrostatic interactions. For example, negatively-charged colloidal silica or clay particles can be flocculated by the addition of a positively-charged polymer.
*Addition of non-adsorbed polymers called depletants that cause aggregation due to entropic effects.
*Physical deformation of the particle (e.g., stretching) may increase the van der Waals forces more than stabilization forces (such as electrostatic), resulting coagulation of colloids at certain orientations.

Unstable colloidal suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual clusters of particles fall to the bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the [[Brownian motion|Brownian forces]] that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with viscoelastic properties. Viscoelastic colloidal gels, such as [[bentonite]] and [[toothpaste]], flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.

===Monitoring stability===
[[File:MLS scan.gif|thumb|Measurement principle of multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning]]

Multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilisation phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0378-5173(03)00364-8|title=Systematic characterization of oil-in-water emulsions for formulation design|year=2003|last1=Roland|first1=I|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|volume=263|pages=85–94|pmid=12954183|last2=Piel|first2=G|last3=Delattre|first3=L|last4=Evrard|first4=B|issue=1–2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1025017502379|year=2003|last1=Lemarchand|first1=Caroline|last2=Couvreur|first2=Patrick|last3=Besnard|first3=Madeleine|last4=Costantini|first4=Dominique|last5=Gref|first5=Ruxandra|journal=Pharmaceutical Research|volume=20|pages=1284–92|pmid=12948027|title=Novel polyester-polysaccharide nanoparticles|issue=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0927-7757(98)00680-3|title=Characterisation of instability of concentrated dispersions by a new optical analyser: the TURBISCAN MA 1000|year=1999|last1=Mengual|first1=O|journal=Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects|volume=152|pages=111 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=P. Bru ''et al.''|title= Particle sizing and characterisation|editor=T. Provder and J. Texter|year=2004}}</ref> It works on concentrated dispersions without dilution. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the particles / droplets. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (''e.g.''[[Creaming (chemistry)|Creaming]] and [[Sedimentation]]) and global changes in size (''e.g.'' [[flocculation]], [[coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]]) are detected and monitored.

===Accelerating methods for shelf life prediction===
The kinetic process of destabilisation can be rather long (up to several months or even years for some products) and it is often required for the formulator to use further accelerating methods in order to reach reasonable development time for new product design. Thermal methods are the most commonly used and consists in increasing temperature to accelerate destabilisation (below critical temperatures of phase inversion or chemical degradation). Temperature affects not only the viscosity, but also interfacial tension in the case of non-ionic surfactants or more generally interactions forces inside the system. Storing a dispersion at high temperatures enables to simulate real life conditions for a product (e.g. tube of sunscreen cream in a car in the summer), but also to accelerate destabilisation processes up to 200 times.
Mechanical acceleration including vibration, [[centrifugation]] and agitation are sometimes used. They subject the product to different forces that pushes the particles / droplets against one another, hence helping in the film drainage. However, some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity, while they do under artificial gravity.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=hDOS5OfL_pQC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89|page=89|author= J-L Salager|title=Pharmaceutical emulsions and suspensions|editor=Françoise Nielloud,Gilberte Marti-Mestres|year=2000|isbn=0-8247-0304-9|publisher=CRC press}}</ref> Moreover segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using centrifugation and vibration.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/la802459u|title=Size Segregation in a Fluid-like or Gel-like Suspension Settling under Gravity or in a Centrifuge|year=2008|last1=Snabre|first1=Patrick|last2=Pouligny|first2=Bernard|journal=Langmuir|volume=24|pages=13338–47|pmid=18986182|issue=23}}</ref>

==As a model system for atoms==
In [[physics]], colloids are an interesting model system for [[atom]]s. Micrometre-scale colloidal particles are large enough to be observed by optical techniques such as [[confocal microscopy]]. Many of the forces that govern the structure and behavior of matter, such as excluded volume interactions or electrostatic forces, govern the structure and behavior of colloidal suspensions. For example, the same techniques used to model ideal gases can be applied to [[Scientific modelling|model]] the behavior of a hard sphere colloidal suspension. In addition, phase transitions in colloidal suspensions can be studied in real time using optical techniques,<ref name=greenfield2013shockwave>{{cite journal|last=Greenfield|first=Elad|coauthors=Nemirovsky, Jonathan and El-Ganainy, Ramy and Christodoulides, Demetri N and Segev, Mordechai|title=Shockwave based nonlinear optical manipulation in densely scattering opaque suspensions|journal=Optics Express|year=2013|volume=21|issue=20|pages=23785–23802|doi=10.1364/OE.21.023785 {{!}}|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/view_article.cfm?gotourl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eopticsinfobase%2Eorg%2FDirectPDFAccess%2F68F14BC0-E0DB-8AA8-219AAA639C2D7953_268541%2Foe-21-20-23785%2Epdf%3Fda%3D1%26id%3D268541%26seq%3D0%26mobile%3Dno&org=}}</ref> and are analogous to phase transitions in liquids.

==Crystals==

{{Main|Colloidal crystal}}

A colloidal crystal is a highly [[Order (crystal lattice)|ordered]] array of particles that can be formed over a very long range (typically on the order of a few millimeters to one centimeter) and that appear [[analogous]] to their atomic or molecular counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal|author =Pieranski, P.|year =1983| title = Colloidal Crystals| journal= Contemporary Physics| volume= 24| page =25|doi =10.1080/00107518308227471|bibcode = 1983ConPh..24...25P }}</ref> One of the finest [[natural]] examples of this ordering phenomenon can be found in precious [[opal]], in which brilliant regions of pure [[wikt:spectrum|spectral]] [[color]] result from [[close-packed]] domains of [[amorphous]] colloidal spheres of [[silicon dioxide]] (or [[silica]], SiO<sub>2</sub>).<ref>{{cite journal|author = Sanders, J.V.|year =1964|title = Structure of Opal|journal = Nature |volume=204|page =1151|doi=10.1038/204990a0|last2 = Sanders|first2 = J.

Thus, it has been known for many years that, due to [[Coulomb's Law|repulsive]] [[Coulombic]] interactions, [[electrically charged]] [[macromolecules]] in an [[aqueous]] environment can exhibit long-range [[crystal]]-like correlations with interparticle separation distances, often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. In all of these cases in nature, the same brilliant [[iridescence]] (or play of colors) can be attributed to the diffraction and [[constructive interference]] of visible lightwaves that satisfy [[Bragg’s law]], in a matter analogous to the [[scattering]] of [[X-rays]] in crystalline solids.

The large number of experiments exploring the [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] of these so-called "colloidal crystals" has emerged as a result of the relatively simple methods that have evolved in the last 20 years for preparing synthetic monodisperse colloids (both polymer and mineral) and, through various mechanisms, implementing and preserving their long-range order formation.

==In biology==
In the early 20th century, before [[enzyme|enzymology]] was well understood, colloids were thought to be the key to the operation of [[enzyme]]s; i.e., the addition of small quantities of an enzyme to a quantity of water would, in some fashion yet to be specified, subtly alter the properties of the water so that it would break down the enzyme's specific [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} such as a solution of [[ATPase]] breaking down [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Furthermore, [[life]] itself was explainable in terms of the aggregate properties of all the colloidal substances that make up an [[organism]]. As more detailed knowledge of [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]] developed, the colloidal theory was replaced by the [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] theory, which explains an enzyme as a collection of identical huge [[molecule]]s that act as very tiny [[machine]]s, freely moving about between the water molecules of the solution and individually operating on the substrate, no more mysterious than a [[factory]] full of machinery. The properties of the water in the solution are not altered, other than the simple [[osmosis|osmotic]] changes that would be caused by the presence of any [[solution|solute]]. In humans, both the [[thyroid gland]] and the [[intermediate lobe]] (''pars intermedia'') of the [[pituitary gland]] contain colloid follicles.

==Intravenous therapy==
Colloid solutions used in [[intravenous therapy]] belong to a major group of [[volume expander]]s, and can be used for intravenous [[fluid replacement]]. Colloids preserve a high [[colloid osmotic pressure]] in the blood,<ref name=gregory>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/503138 An Update on Intravenous Fluids] by Gregory S. Martin, MD, MSc</ref> and therefore, they should theoretically preferentially increases the [[intravascular volume]], whereas other types of volume expanders called [[crystalloid solution|crystalloid]]s also increases the [[interstitial volume]] and [[intracellular volume]]. However, there is still controversy to the actual difference in efficacy by this difference.<ref name=gregory/> Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.<ref name=gregory/>
Recently, however, it has been determined that the use of colloids was bolstered by faked research studies.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8360667/Millions-of-surgery-patients-at-risk-in-drug-research-fraud-scandal.html Millions of surgery patients at risk in drug research fraud scandal], ''The Telegraph'', 4 November 2011</ref>{{clarify|date=June 2012}}
