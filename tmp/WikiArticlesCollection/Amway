==History==

===Founding===
[[File:Amway Japan Head Office.jpg|thumb|upright|Amway Japan Head Office.]]
[[File:Honda- Amway アムウェイベトナム（AVCL）Hồ Chí Minh PB277728.jpg|thumb|upright|Amway Vietnam (Hồ Chí Minh since 2008).]]

Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, friends since school days, had been business partners in various endeavors including a hamburger stand, air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949 they were introduced by Neil Maaskant (Van Andel's second cousin) to the ''Nutrilite Products'' Corporation. [[Nutrilite]] was a California-based direct sales company founded by Dr. [[Carl Rehnborg]], developer of the first [[multivitamin]] marketed in the United States. In August 1949, after a night-long talk, DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for Nutrilite food supplements.<ref name="Conn">{{Cite book|last= Conn|first= Charles Paul|title= The Possible Dream: A Candid Look At Amway|authorlink=Charles Paul Conn|publisher=[[Revell]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-8007-0857-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. Shortly thereafter, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor, they traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar. The meeting was at a downtown hotel, with over a hundred people in attendance. After seeing promotional filmstrips and listening to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business opportunity with enthusiasm. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop their new business further.<ref name="Conn" />{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed '''Ja-Ri Corporation''' (abbreviated from their respective first names) for importing wooden goods from South American countries. After their trip to the Nutrilite seminar, they dropped{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}<!---Sold?---> this business and Ja-Ri became their Nutrilite distributorship.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Van Andel|first= Jay|title= An Enterprising Life|authorlink=Jay Van Andel|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-88730-997-6|pages=37–39}}</ref> In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite also offered commission on the sales of products by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system today known as [[multi-level marketing]] or [[network marketing]]. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of over 5,000 distributors. However, following concerns about the stability of Nutrilite, in April 1959 they and some of their top distributors formed ''The American Way Association'' to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Robinson|first= James W.|title= Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It Means to You|publisher=[[Prima Publishing]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7615-1088-5|page=11}}</ref>

Their first product was called ''Frisk'', a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner).<ref>{{cite video

===International expansion===
Amway expanded overseas to Australia in 1971, to Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to Ukraine in 2003, to Russia in 2005, and to Vietnam in 2008.

===Quixtar===
{{Main|Amway Global}}
In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named [[Alticor]], and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named [[Quixtar]], [[Access Business Group]], and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by [[Fulton Innovation]], pursued research and development and [[Access Business Group]] handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third party clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007706130458 |title=Amway marque to be revived; Quixtar label scrapped |publisher=The Detroit News |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

The main difference was that all "Independent Business Owners" (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their [[upline]] "direct distributor," and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18 to 24 month period in favor of a unified Amway brand ([[Amway Global]]) worldwide.

In 2006, Quixtar published ''The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan'', in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for "Active" IBOs was $115.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf |title=Quixtar.com |format=PDF |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110715140756/http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf| archivedate= July 15, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Global markets==
According to the Amway website, as of 2011 the company operates in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia.

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 |title=Amway Parent hits 50th year running recording 15% sales growth |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=February 5, 2009}}</ref>

===Amway China===
Amway grew quickly in China from its market launch in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal [[pyramid scheme]]s led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all [[direct selling]] companies, including Amway.<ref>"Chinese officials ban direct marketing", April 22, 1998 ''[[Associated Press]]'', The Associated Press</ref> After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]], and [[Mary Kay]] continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force.<ref>"Once-barred Amway becomes booming business in China", Leslie Chang, March 12, 2003,  ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''</ref> China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the U.S., salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit. 

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2&nbsp;billion in annual sales.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/business/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/business-3/116693763565130.xml&coll=7 "Amway, Mary Kay get long-awaited direct-selling licenses in China"] Rob Kirkbride, December 24, 2006, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''</ref> In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked No.88 by Forbes magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women.<ref name="ForbesWomen">{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/11/biz_powerwomen08_Eva-Cheng_34MT.html |title=Forbes' The 100 Most Powerful Women; No.88 Eva Cheng |work=Forbes |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=August 27, 2008}}</ref> In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of ¥17&nbsp;billion (US$2.5billion).<ref name=LevinD>{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Dan|title=Amway's China Redux|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:msGs9qx1urAJ:www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html+2008+Amway+China+28%25+growth&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&source=www.google.com|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=August 27, 2009}}</ref> According to a report in Bloomberg Businessweek in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and US$3&nbsp;billion in revenue.<ref name=EinhornB>{{cite news|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|title=Why Amway and China are a Good Fit|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Businessweek]]|date=April 8, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606102312/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm| archivedate= June 06 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Amway China holds large incentive trips each year as rewards for its top achievers to different destinations. As the trips involve thousands of participants, events often result in a boost for the local economy of the destination.

==Brands==
Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent [[SA8]] added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line [[Artistry (cosmetics)|Artistry]] (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India and the United States, as well as Nutrilite organic farms in [[Brazil]], Mexico and the United States (California and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]). Amway brands include: [[Artistry]], Atmosphere, [[Body Blends]], Body Works, Clear Now, eSpring, [[Fulton Street]], [[Glister (brand)|Glister]], iCook, Kahve, [[Legacy of Clean]], [[Nutrilite]], Peter Island, Perfect Empowered Drinking Water, Personal Accents, Ribbon, [[Satinique]], [[Tolsom]], [[XS Energy Drink|XS]], and Zsenso

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, [[SA8]] laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent, scoring 99 out of a possible 100 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/cooking-cleaning/laundry-detergents-1-07/overview/0107_soap_ov.htm |title=Laundry Detergents |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Consumer Reports did, however, criticise SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Rob Kirkbride / The Grand Rapids Press|title=Amway's old reliable cleans up|publisher=Grand Rapids Press, The (MI)|page=A1 |date= December 12, 2006}}</ref> Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested.

==Business model==
Amway combines direct selling with a multi-level marketing strategy. "Independent Business Owners" (IBOs) may market products directly to potential customers and may also recruit (sponsor) and train other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated.<ref name="Xardel"/> People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices. Amway provides training to the IBOs on products and business skills through the sale of "business support materials"; for example, DVDs, CDs, books, websites, seminars, and business conventions.

===Political causes===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 political campaign]] of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor [[Sue Myrick]] (N.C.).<ref name=burstein>{{cite web| title = She Did it Amway | author=Rachel Burstein | publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = September/October 1996 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}</ref> According to two reports by ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager “used the company’s extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871” to Myrick’s campaign.<ref name=burstein/><ref name=zibrowski>{{cite web| title = Tough sell| author=John Zibrowski, Jenna Ziman | publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = Nov–Dec 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/tough-sell| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}</ref> According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.<ref name=burstein/> Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained “close ties to Amway and Yager”, and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, “most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors”, in the 1997–98 election cycle.<ref name=zibrowski/>

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election – $2.5&nbsp;million to the [[Republican National Committee]] – and was the number one corporate political donor in the U.S.<ref name=burstein/> In the [[2004 Elections|2004 election cycle]], the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative [[527 group]], [[Progress for America]].<ref>From opensecrets.org: [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&cycle=2004&format=&tname=Progress+for+America Progress for America – Top Contributors, 2004 Cycle]</ref>

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3&nbsp;million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3&nbsp;million to pay for Republican "infomercials" and televising of the GOP convention on [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Family Channel]], but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.<ref name=burstein/><ref name=vlasic>{{Cite news | last = Vlasic | first = Bill  | coauthors = Mary Beth Regan | title = Amway II: The Kids take over |work=BusinessWeek   | date = February 16, 1998 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3565099.arc.htm?chan=search  | accessdate =May 9, 2011 }}</ref>

==Criticism==

===Pyramid scheme accusations===

Amway utilizes a tiered distribution and remuneration model (the Amway ''Sales and Marketing Plan'') that promises to reward participants who grow Amway's market share through a combination of sales and recruitment. This tiered distribution model relies on Independent Business Owners (IBOs) acquiring and training further Independent Business Owners, which is the principal characteristic of a [[pyramid scheme]].

[[Harvard Business School]] of Leadership, which described Amway as “one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world", noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos:

:"...accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors. "<ref name=HarvardBS>{{cite news|title=American Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century – Richard M. DeVos, Amway Corporation |url=http://www.hbs.edu/leadership/database/leaders/richard_m_devos.html|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Harvard Business School]] |year= 2011}}</ref>

The "pyramid-like distribution system" of the Amway business model lead to Amway being accused of being a [[pyramid scheme]]. However, a 1979 US Federal Trade Commission ruling established that the Amway business model is ''not'' an illegal pyramid scheme.

===Class action settlement===

On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56&nbsp;million&nbsp;– $34&nbsp;million in cash and $22&nbsp;million in products&nbsp;– to settle a [[class action]] that had been filed in Federal District Court in California in 2007.<ref name=classaction>{{cite web|author=Chris Knape |url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/amway_agrees_to_pay_56_million.html#incart_mce |title=Amway agrees to pay $56 million, settle case alleging it operates a 'pyramid scheme' |date=November 2010 |publisher=MLive.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011|work=The Grand Rapids Press}}</ref> The class action, which had been brought against Quixtar and several of its top-level distributors, alleged fraud, [[racketeering]], and that the defendants operated as an illegal pyramid scheme.

While noting that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability, Amway acknowledged that it had made changes to its business operations as a result of the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which was expected in early 2011.<ref name=classaction/> The economic value of the settlement, including the changes Amway made to its business model, totals $100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/lawyers_say_their_20_million_p.html |title="Lawyers say their $20 million payment is fair for $100 million settlement in Amway pyramid scheme lawsuit", '&#39;Grand Rapids Press'&#39; (November 4, 2010) |publisher=Mlive.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

===Canadian tax case===
In 1983, Amway pleaded guilty to criminal [[tax evasion]] and [[Customs (tax)|customs]] fraud in Canada, resulting in a fine of $25&nbsp;million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in Canada at the time. In 1989 the company settled the outstanding customs duties for $45&nbsp;million CAD.<ref name=CanadaTax>{{Cite news

In a 1994 interview, Amway co-founder Rich DeVos stated that this incident had been his greatest "moral or spiritual challenge", first in "soul searching as to whether they had done anything wrong" and then for pleading guilty for technical reasons, despite believing they were innocent of the charges. DeVos stated he believed that the case had been motivated by "political reasons".<ref>{{cite web|author=by Rich DeVos |url=http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-4-number-5/capitalism-compassion |title=Capitalism with Compassion, '&#39;Religion and Liberty'&#39;,'&#39;Volume 4'&#39;,'&#39;Number 5'&#39; |publisher=Acton.org |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110608124404/http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-4-number-5/capitalism-compassion| archivedate= June 08 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1996, alleging that copyrighted music was used on "highly profitable" training videotapes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4D61339F932A15751C0A960958260 |title=Record Labels Sue Amway over its videos |work=New York Times |date=February 21, 1996 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Amway denied wrongdoing, blaming the case on a misunderstanding by distributors, and settled the case out of court for $9&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19783607.html |title=Amway pays $9&nbsp;million to settle copyright infringement suit |publisher=Highbeam.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> In a related lawsuit initiated by the distributors involved, the Court established that Mahaleel Lee Luster, who had been contracted to make the videotapes, had violated copyright without the knowledge of three of the five of those distributors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf |title='&#39;Foley v Luster'&#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110722093115/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf| archivedate= July 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Procter & Gamble===
Some Amway distributors were involved with an [[urban legend]] that the (old) [[Procter & Gamble logo controversy|Procter & Gamble service mark]] was in fact a [[Satanism|Satanic]] symbol or that the CEO of P&G is himself a practicing [[Satanist]]. (In some variants of the urban legend, it is also claimed that the CEO of Procter & Gamble donated "satanic tithes" to the [[Church of Satan]].)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/procter.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Procter and Gamble and Satanism Rumor |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Procter & Gamble alleged that several Amway distributors were behind a resurgence of the urban legend in the 1990s and sued several independent Amway distributors and the company for defamation and slander.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=[[Procter & Gamble]] v.

On 18 December 2012 the court ruled that film can be screened, but the makers have to remove "untrue informations", as the screen near the end of the movie stated that 30% of company income is generated by sales of training materials and that the vast majority of its profits are shared only by the tiny fraction of top distributors.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrzej Biernat, poseł PO o zachowaniu Jarosława Gowina |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,13073248,Koniec_procesu_ws__Amway__TVP_moze_pokazac_film__ale.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Wiadomości - Gazeta.pl |language={{pl icon}} |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> This is not the only court case, so the film is still banned on other grounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,13074755,Rezyser_filmu_o_Amwayu_szczerze_o_wyroku__Nikt_nic.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Reżyser filmu o Amwayu szczerze o wyroku: Nikt nic nie rozumie, czyli 'Witajcie w życiu' [WYWIAD&#93; |language={{pl icon}} |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>

  | accessdate =July 5, 2007 }}</ref> The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the “high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar [Amway]” are actually “making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar’s cosmetics, soaps, and electronics.”

:"In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don’t get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can’t sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed."

It was also revealed that an Amway recruiter featured in the report (Greg Fredericks) made misleading and inconsistent statements about Amway earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding [[arrest warrant]] for [[drug dealing]].<ref name=DATELINE/>
