The '''capybara''' (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris'') is the largest [[rodent]] in the world, followed by the [[beaver]], [[porcupine]], and [[Mara (mammal)|mara]]. Its closest relatives are [[guinea pig]]s and [[Rock cavy|rock cavies]], and is more distantly related to the [[Common agouti|agouti]], [[chinchilla]]s, and the [[coypu]]. Native to [[South America]], the capybara inhabits [[savanna]]s and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species, though it is hunted for its meat and [[Hide (skin)|hide]] and also for a grease from its thick fatty skin which is used in the pharmaceutical trade.<ref>[http://www.arkive.org/capybara/hydrochoerus-hydrochaeris/ Capybara (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris'')]. ARKive.org</ref>

==Etymology==
Its [[common name]] is derived from [[Tupi language|Tupi]] ''ka'apiûara'', a complex agglutination of ''kaá'' (leaf) + ''píi'' (slender) + ''ú'' (eat) + ''ara'' (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".<ref>Ferreira, A. B. H. (1986) ''Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa'', 2nd ed., Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, p.344</ref>
The [[scientific name]], both ''hydrochoerus'' and ''hydrochaeris'', comes from [[Greek Language|Greek]] '''ὕδωρ''' (''hydor'' = water) + '''χοίρος''' (''choiros'' = pig, hog).<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Woods|id=13400218|page=1556}}</ref><ref name="inDarwin">{{Cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles R. | year=1839 | title=Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

==Classification and phylogeny==
The capybara and the [[lesser capybara]] belong to the subfamily [[Hydrochoerinae]] along with the [[Kerodon|rock cavies]]. The living capybaras and their [[extinct]] relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae.<ref name=r4/> Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between ''Hydrochoerus'' and ''Kerodon''<ref name="Rowe 2002"/> supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of [[Caviidae]].<ref name=msw3/> Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as ''[[Neochoerus]]''.<ref name="Vucetich 2005"/><ref name="Deschamp 2007"/> The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced.<ref name="Vucetich 2005"/><ref name="Deschamp 2007"/> This is largely due to the recognition that capybara [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual.<ref name="Vucetich 2005"/> In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, ''Cardiatherium paranense''.<ref name="Vucetich 2005"/>

==Description==
The capybara has a heavy, [[barrel]]-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents.<ref name=r4/> The animal lacks underhair, and guard hair differs little from overhair. Adult capybaras grow to {{convert|107|to|134|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in length, stand {{convert|50|to|64|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the [[withers]], and typically weigh {{convert|35|to|66|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with an average in the [[Venezuela]]n [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|llanos]] of {{convert|48.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Smithsonian"/><ref name="Palm Beach Zoo"/> The top recorded weights are {{convert|91|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for a wild female from [[Brazil]] and {{convert|73.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for a wild male from [[Uruguay]].<ref name=r4/><ref name=r3/> The [[dental formula]] is {{DentalFormula|upper=1.1.0.0|lower=1.1.3.3}}.<ref name=r4/> Capybaras have slightly [[Interdigital webbing|webbed]] feet and  [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] tails.<ref name=r4/> Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.<ref name="enchantedlearning.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com |title=Enchanted Learning Home Page |publisher=Enchantedlearning.com |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads. Females are slightly heavier than males.

Its [[karyotype]] has [[Diploid|2n]] = 66 and [[Fundamental number|FN]] = 102.<ref name=msw3/>

==Ecology==
Capybaras are semi-aquatic mammals<ref name="Palm Beach Zoo"/> found throughout almost all countries of South America (except [[Chile]]<ref name="Bristol"/>) in densely [[forest]]ed areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and marshes,<ref name="Smithsonian"/> as well as flooded [[savannah]] and along rivers in [[tropical forest]]. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches.<ref name=r4/> They roam in home [[range (biology)|range]]s averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.<ref name=r4/>

Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings are fairly common in [[Florida]], although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.<ref>[http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/mammals/capybara/ Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission: Capybara – '&#39;Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris'&#39;]</ref> In 2011, one was spotted in the central coast of California.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0818-capybara-20110818,0,104462.story|title=A gnawing question answered: It's a capybara roaming Paso Robles|last=Mather|first=Kate|date=18 August 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref>

===Diet and predation===
[[File:Capibara 1.jpg|thumb|Foraging]]
[[File:Chiguires-bns.jpg|thumb|Group of capybaras]]
Capybaras are [[herbivore]]s, grazing mainly on grasses and [[aquatic plants]],<ref name="Smithsonian"/><ref name="RevBiolTrop"/> as well as [[fruit]] and tree bark.<ref name="Palm Beach Zoo"/> They are very selective feeders<ref name="Quintana 1998"/> and will feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.<ref name="Barreto 1998"/> Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter and therefore are not consumed at that time.<ref name="Quintana 1998"/> The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular and they thus chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.<ref name="SFZoo"/> Capybaras are [[coprophagous]], meaning they eat their own [[feces]] as a source of bacterial [[gut flora]], to help [[digestion|digest]] the [[cellulose]] in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by a cow.<ref name="Lord-Rexford 1994"/> As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;<ref name="Bristol"/> their cheek teeth also grow continuously.<ref name="SFZoo"/>

Like its cousin the [[guinea pig]], the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize [[vitamin C]], and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of [[scurvy]].<ref name=r2/>

They can have a [[life expectancy|life span]] of 8–10 years in the wild,<ref name=r6/> but live less than four years on average, as they are "a favourite [[food]] of [[jaguar]], [[Cougar|puma]], [[ocelot]], [[eagle]] and [[caiman]]".<ref name="Bristol"/> The capybara is also the preferred [[prey]] of the [[Eunectes murinus|anaconda]].<ref name="SoundsandColours"/>

==Natural history==
[[File:Capybara male.jpg|thumb|right|Capybara male as it has a gland on nose]]
Capybaras are very gregarious. While they do sometimes live solitarily, they are more commonly found in groups that average 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females and the rest juveniles.<ref name="Alho 1987"/> Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season,<ref name="Lord-Rexford 1994"/><ref name="Macdonald 1981"/> when the animals gather around available water sources. Males are organized in stable, linear hierarchies. The dominant male in each group is significantly heavier than any of the subordinates, but among subordinates, status is not correlated with weight.<ref name="Herrera 1993">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris)|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> The dominant male is positioned in the center of the group while subordinates are on the periphery. These hierarchies are established early in life among the young with play fights and mock copulations.<ref name="Alho 1987"/> The most dominant males have access to the best resources.<ref name="Herrera 1993"/> Capybaras are very vocal and, when in groups, chatter with each other to establish social bonds, dominance or general group census.<ref name="Macdonald 1981"/> They can make dog-like barks<ref name="Lord-Rexford 1994"/> when threatened or when females are herding young.<ref name="Murphey 1985"/> Capybaras have two different scent glands; a morillo, located on the snout, and an anal gland.<ref name="Macdonald 1984"/> Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morillos and their anal pockets can open more easily. The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and are released when in contact with objects like plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. A capybara marks by rubbing its morillo on an object or by walking over a scrub and marking with its anal gland. A capybara can spread its scent further by urinating. However, females usually mark without urinating and mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males will also mark females.<ref name="Macdonald 1984"/>

===Reproduction===
[[File:2007 02 CapybaraFamily.jpg|thumb|Family swimming]]
[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|right|Mother with typical litter of four pups]]
[[File:Die vergleichende Osteologie (1821) Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris.jpg|thumb|right|Skeleton]]

When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name="Herrera 1993"/> In addition, a female will alert males she is in estrus by whistling though her nose.<ref name="Lord-Rexford 1994"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she will either submerge or leave the water.<ref name="Lord-Rexford 1994"/><ref name="Macdonald 1981"/> Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent all the subordinates from copulating.<ref name="Herrera 1993"/> The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male.<ref name="Herrera 1993"/> The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.<ref name=r1/>

Capybara [[gestation]] is 130–150 days, and usually produces a [[litter (animal)|litter]] of four capybara babies, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter.<ref name=r4/> Birth is on land and the female will rejoin the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which will join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but will continue to [[Breastfeeding|suckle]]—from any female in the group—until weaned at about 16 weeks. The young will form a group within the main group.<ref name="Bristol"/> [[Alloparenting]] has been observed in this species.<ref name="Macdonald 1981"/> Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in [[Mato Grosso]], Brazil.<ref name=r4/>

===Activities===
Though quite agile on land (capable of running as fast as a [[horse]]),<ref>[[The Life of Mammals]] – "Chisellers"</ref> Capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are excellent swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes,<ref name="Smithsonian"/> an ability they use to evade [[predator]]s. Capybaras can sleep in water if need be, only keeping their noses out of the water. During midday, as temperatures increase, they wallow in water and then graze in late afternoons and early evenings.<ref name=r4/> They also spend a lot of time wallowing in mud.<ref name="enchantedlearning.com"/> They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.

==Conservation and human interaction==
Capybaras are not considered a [[threatened species]];<ref name=iucn>{{IUCN2011.1|assessors=Queirolo, D., Vieira, E. & Reid, F.|year=2008|id=10300|title=Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris|downloaded=17 June 2011}}</ref> their [[population]] is stable throughout most of their South American range, though in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.<ref name="Smithsonian"/><ref name="Bristol"/>

Capybaras are hunted for their meat and [[Pelage|pelts]] in some areas,<ref name="inRich"/> and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for [[livestock]]. In some areas, they are [[farming|farmed]], which has the effect of ensuring the [[wetland]] [[habitats]] are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.<ref name="Bristol"/>

Capybaras can be found in many areas in [[zoo]]s and [[park]]s,<ref name="SFZoo"/> and may live for 12 years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].<ref name="Bristol"/> Capybaras are gentle and will usually allow humans to pet and hand-feed them.

The [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] (EAZA) tasked Drusillas Park in [[Alfriston]], [[Sussex]] to keep the studbook for Capybaras, to monitor captive populations in Europe. The studbook includes information about all births, deaths and movements of capybaras, as well as how they are related.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drusillas.co.uk/conservation-1 |title=Conservation at Drusillas Park |publisher=Drusillas.co.uk |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>

Capybara are farmed for meat and skins in South America.<ref name="SDzoo"/> The meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas, while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein.<ref name=r4/> In parts of South America, especially in [[Venezuela]], capybara meat is popular during [[Lent]] and [[Holy Week]] as the [[Catholic Church]] is claimed to have given a special dispensation that allows for its consumption even while [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|other meats are generally forbidden]]. Accounts differ of how the dispensation arose.<ref name="NYSun"/>

Although it is illegal in some [[States of the United States|states]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the [[United States]].<ref name="perez_snake">{{cite book|last=Perez|first=Larry|title=Snake in the Grass: an Everglades Invasion|year=2012|publisher=Pineapple Press|location=Sarasota, Fla.|isbn=9781561645138|page=89|edition=1st}}</ref>
