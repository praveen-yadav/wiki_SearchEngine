The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from South and Central Asia. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard.

The [[Pre-Imperial China|ancient Chinese civilization]] – one of the world's earliest – flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythological [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] of the Yellow River basin (c. 2000 BCE). Since 221 BCE, when the [[Qin Dynasty]] first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times. The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) overthrew the [[Qing Dynasty|last dynasty]] in 1911, and ruled the [[mainland China|Chinese mainland]] until 1949. After the defeat of the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[World War II]], the Communist Party defeated the nationalist [[Kuomintang]] in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to its present capital of [[Taipei]].

Since the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], China has become one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] major economies. As of 2013, it is the world's second-largest economy by both [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal total GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|purchasing power parity (PPP)]], and is also the world's largest exporter and importer of goods.<ref name="ChinaBiggestTrader">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/9860518/China-trade-now-bigger-than-US.html|title=China trade now bigger than US|work=Daily Telegraph|date=10 February 2013|accessdate=15 February 2013}}</ref> China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], with the [[List of countries by military expenditures|second-largest defense budget]].<ref name="ChineseNukes" /> The PRC has been a [[United Nations]] member since 1971, when it replaced the ROC as a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N.

ISBN 81-206-0451-2. In the [http://purl.pt/435/ Portuguese original], the chapter is titled "O Grande Reino da China".</ref> It first appears in English in a translation published by [[Richard Eden]] in 1555.<ref>[[Richard Eden|Eden, Richard]] (1555).

The common Chinese names for the present country are ''Zhōngguó'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:中国|中国]]}}, from ''zhōng'', "central" or "middle", and ''guó'', "state" or "states," and in modern times, "nation") and ''Zhōnghuá'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:中华|中华]]|links=no}}), although the country's official name has been changed numerous times by successive [[dynasties]] and modern governments. The term ''Zhōngguó'' appeared in various ancient texts, such as the ''[[Classic of History]]'' of the 6th century BCE,{{efn|[http://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E5%B0%9A%E6%9B%B8/%E6%A2%93%E6%9D%90 《尚書•梓材》]:「皇天既付中國民越厥疆土于先王」}} and in pre-imperial times it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the [[Huaxia]] tribes from perceived "barbarians". The term, which can be either singular or plural, referred to the group of states or provinces in the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]], but was not used as a name for the country as a whole until the nineteenth century.  The Chinese were not unique in regarding their country as "central", since other civilizations had the same view of themselves.<ref>Wilkinson, Endymion (2000). ''Chinese History: A Manual''.

Many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year [[Spring and Autumn Period]], only occasionally deferring to the Zhou king. By the time of the [[Warring States period]] of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now China, each with its own king, ministry and army.

=== Imperial China ===
The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE, after the [[state of Qin]] conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified Chinese state. [[Qin Shi Huang]], the emperor of Qin, proclaimed himself the "First Emperor" (始皇帝) and imposed reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of the Chinese language, measurements, length of cart axles, and currency. The [[Qin Dynasty]] lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after Qin Shi Huang's death, as its harsh [[Legalism (philosophy)|legalist]] and authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.<ref name="Bodde1986">Bodde, Derk.

In the 13th century, China was [[Mongol invasion of China|gradually conquered by the Mongol empire]]. In 1271, the [[Mongol]] leader [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan Dynasty]]; the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song Dynasty in 1279. A peasant named [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 and founded the [[Ming Dynasty]].
Under the Ming Dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that [[Zheng He]] led [[Treasure voyages|explorations throughout the world, reaching as far as Africa]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/kenya-china | work=The Guardian | first=Xan | last=Rice | title=Chinese archaeologists' African quest for sunken ship of Ming admiral | date=25 July 2010}}</ref> In the early years of the Ming Dynasty, China's capital was moved from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing. During the Ming Dynasty, thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of [[individualism]] and innate morality.

In 1644, Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]], a minor Ming official who led the peasant revolt. The last Ming [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing Dynasty]] then allied with Ming Dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]] and overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]], and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing Dynasty.

The Qing Dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In the 19th century, the Qing Dynasty experienced Western imperialism following two [[Opium Wars]] (1839–42 and 1856–60) with Britain. China was forced to sign unequal treaties, pay compensation, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede [[Hong Kong]] to the British.<ref>Ainslie Thomas Embree, Carol Gluck (1997).

The weakening of the Qing regime led to increasing domestic disorder. In 1850s and 1860s, the failed [[Taiping Rebellion]] ravaged southern China. [[Timeline of late anti-Qing Dynasty rebellions|Other costly rebellions]] included the [[Punti–Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855–67), the [[Nien Rebellion]] (1851–68), the Miao Rebellion (1854–73), the [[Panthay Rebellion]] (1856–73) and the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]] (1862–77).<ref>Jenks, R.D.

In the 19th century, the great [[Chinese Diaspora]] began. Emigration rates were strengthened by conflicts and catastrophes such as the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879]], which claimed between 9 and 13 million lives in northern China.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm "Dimensions of need – People and populations at risk"]. 1995.

The ill-fated anti-Western [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899–1901 further weakened the Qing Dynasty. The [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911–12 brought an end to the Qing Dynasty and established the [[Republic of China]].

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2010}}</ref> The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lowest Places on Earth|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref>

A major environmental issue in China is the continued [[desertification|expansion of its deserts]], particularly the Gobi Desert.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fighting Desertification|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/terrywaghorn/2011/03/07/fighting-desertification/|newspaper=Forbes|date=7 March 2011}}</ref><ref name="Ref_au">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm "Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm"].

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex [[topography]].

These 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, and four municipalities can be collectively referred to as "[[mainland China]]", a term which usually excludes the SARs of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].  None of these divisions are recognized by the ROC government, which claims the entirety of the PRC's territory.

==== Trade relations ====
In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues.<ref name="Ref_s">Dillon, Dana; and Tkacik, John, Jr.; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html ''China's Quest for Asia''].

China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics. China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001.

In 2000, the [[United States Congress]] approved "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinton signs China trade bill|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090505165947/http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|archivedate=5 May 2009|date=10 October 2000}}</ref> China has a significant [[trade surplus]] with the United States, its most important export market.<ref name="Ref_w">"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11544677 US trade gap widens on increased Chinese imports]".

In addition to claiming all of Taiwan, China has been involved in a number of other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a [[Kashmir|disputed border with India]] and an undefined border with [[Bhutan]].

The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]].

===Economic history and growth===
{{main|Economic history of China (1949–present)}}
From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,<ref name="Ref_ay">{{cite web |url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |title=China is already a market economy—Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia|publisher=EastDay.com |year=2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009}}</ref> and is one of the leading examples of [[state capitalism]].<ref>[http://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ "Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives"].

=== Historical ===
China was a world leader in science and technology until the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Ancient [[List of Chinese discoveries|Chinese discoveries]] and [[List of Chinese inventions|inventions]], such as [[papermaking]], [[History of typography in East Asia|printing]], the [[compass]], and [[gunpowder]] (the [[Four Great Inventions]]), later became widespread in Asia and Europe.

The most spoken varieties are [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (spoken by 70% of the population<ref>{{cite news|title=China: 400 Million Cannot Speak Mandarin|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/world/asia/china-400-million-cannot-speak-mandarin.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=5 September 2013}}</ref>), [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (includes [[Shanghainese]]), [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (includes [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]]), [[Min Chinese|Min]] (includes [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].

Retrieved 3 May 2006.</ref> [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]], a variety of Mandarin based on the [[Beijing dialect]], is the official national language of China and is used as a [[lingua franca]] between people of different linguistic backgrounds.

[[Classical Chinese]] was the written standard in China for thousands of years, and allowed for written communication between speakers of various unintelligible languages and dialects in China. [[Written vernacular Chinese]], or ''baihua'', is the written standard, based on the Mandarin dialect and first popularized in Ming Dynasty novels. It was adopted, with significant modifications, during the early 20th century as the national standard. Classical Chinese is still part of the high school curriculum, and is thus intelligible to some degree to many Chinese. Since their promulgation by the government in 1956, [[Simplified Chinese characters]] have become the official standardized [[writing system|written script]] used to [[Written Chinese|write the Chinese language]] within mainland China, supplanting the use of the earlier [[Traditional Chinese characters]].

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]] and conservative philosophies. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious [[imperial examination]]s, which have their origins in the [[Han Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|title=China: Understanding Its Past|year=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=29}}</ref> The [[Chinese literature|literary emphasis]] of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Classical Chinese poetry|poetry]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]] were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.<ref name="ChinaFuture" /> Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today.

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of [[feudalism]]". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like [[Peking opera]],<ref name="Ref_abcded">{{cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn|title=Tour Guidebook: Beijing|publisher=China National Tourism Administration|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.
