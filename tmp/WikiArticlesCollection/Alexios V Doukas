'''Alexios V Doukas''', surnamed '''Mourtzouphlos''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Ἀλέξιος Δούκας Μούρτζουφλος}}}}; died December 1205) was [[Byzantine Emperor]] (5 February &ndash; 12 April 1204) during the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|second and final siege]] of [[Constantinople]] by the participants of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. He was related to the imperial [[Doukas]] family.

His nickname "Mourtzouphlos" referred to either his bushy, overhanging eyebrows or his sullen character. The term has the meaning of one being crestfallen, depressed, despondent, downcast, gloomy, sullen and evidently frowning, scowling.

A Byzantine nobleman, he had risen to the court position of ''[[protovestiarios]]'' by the time of the Fourth Crusade. He had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of [[Eudokia Angelina]], a daughter of Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]]. His participation in the attempted overthrow of [[Alexios III Angelos]] by [[John Komnenos the Fat]] in 1200 had led to his imprisonment until the restoration to the throne of [[Isaac II Angelos]].  Isaac II, along with his son [[Alexios IV Angelos]], were restored to the throne through the intervention of leaders of the Fourth Crusade in July 1203. Isaac II had been deposed and imprisoned by his brother Alexios III in 1195 while Isaac II was away hunting in Thrace.  Alexios III had captured Isaac II at [[Stagira]] in Macedonia, put out his eyes, and had kept him a prisoner.

By the beginning of 1204, Isaac II and Alexios IV had inspired little confidence among the people of Constantinople in their efforts to defend the city from the Latins and Venetians, who were restless and rioted when the money and aid promised by Alexios IV was not forthcoming. Alexios Doukas emerged as a leader of the anti-Latin movement and personally led some skirmishes against the crusaders. When the populace rebelled in late January 1204, the two emperors barricaded themselves in the palace and entrusted Alexios Doukas with a mission to seek help from the crusaders. Instead, Alexios Doukas used his access to the palace to arrest the emperors. The young Alexios IV was strangled in prison, while his father Isaac died shortly afterwards, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or foul play. Alexios V Doukas was crowned in early February 1204.

After his coronation, Alexios V began to strengthen the [[Walls of Constantinople|defenses]] of [[Constantinople]] and ended negotiations with the Latins. It was too late, however, for the new Emperor to make much of a difference. An attempted surprise attack against the crusader camp failed despite the Emperor's personal leadership. During the ensuing fight, the defenders of Constantinople held out against the crusader counterattack of 9 April. The crusaders' second attack proved too strong to repel, and Alexios V fled towards [[Thrace]] on the night of 12 April 1204, accompanied by Eudokia Angelina and her mother [[Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera]]. Constantinople was under Latin control by the next day.

The refugees reached [[Mosynopolis]], the base of the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos, where they were initially well received, with Alexios V marrying Eudokia Angelina. Later, however, Alexios III arranged for his new son-in-law to be ambushed and blinded, making him ineligible for the imperial throne. Abandoned by his supporters and enemies alike, Alexios V was captured near Mosynopolis by the advancing Latins under Thierry de Loos in November 1204. Brought back to Constantinople, Alexios V was condemned to death for treason against Alexios IV, and was thrown from the top of the [[Column of Theodosius]]. He was the last Byzantine Emperor to reign in Constantinople before the establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaean Emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]].
