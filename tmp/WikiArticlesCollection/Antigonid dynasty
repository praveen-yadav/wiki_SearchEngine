The '''Antigonid dynasty''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|t|ɪ|ɡ|ɵ|n|ɪ|d}}; Greek: Δυναστεία των Αντιγονιδών) was a dynasty of [[Hellenistic]] kings descended from [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] general [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] ("the One-eyed").

==History==

Succeeding the [[Antipatrid dynasty]] in much of Macedonia, Antigonus ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria.  His attempts to take control of the whole of Alexander's empire led to his defeat and death at the [[Battle of Ipsus]] in 301 BC. Antigonus's son [[Demetrius I Poliorcetes]] survived the battle, and managed to seize control of [[Macedon]] itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of [[Seleucus I]]. After a period of confusion, Demetrius's son [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.<ref>{{cite book | last = J.

==Legacy==

It was one of four dynasties established by Alexander's successors, the others being the [[Seleucid dynasty]], [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] and [[Attalid dynasty]]. The last scion of the dynasty, [[Perseus of Macedon]], who reigned between 179-168 BC, proved unable to stop the advancing Roman legions and Macedon's defeat at the [[Battle of Pydna]] signaled the end of the dynasty.<ref>'''Britannica''', ''Antigonid dynasty'', 2008, O.Ed. But Perseus’ failure to deploy his full resources brought about his defeat (168) at Pydna in Macedonia and signaled the end of the dynasty."</ref>
