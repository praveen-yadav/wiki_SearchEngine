In addition, her father was a minister in the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]], [[Lutheran Church in America]], and later the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. Her mother, Lorena (Daeschner) Hall, helped found Gustavus Adolphus College's Art Department and served as the department head.<ref name="gustavus.edu">Biographical Notes from ''Hall Family. Papers Concerning Camilla Hall and George F. and Lorena Hall, 1938-1995.'' CAMC Collection 13. Gustavus Adolphus College Archives, St. Peter, Minnesota. [http://gustavus.edu/academics/library/archives/CAMC0013.pdf]</ref> Camilla Hall was the only surviving child of four; two of her siblings died of a [[kidney]] disorder, Peter and Nan, and a third, Terry, of congenital [[heart disease]].<ref>"Camilla Hall Ends Her Long Journey Home".

In 1952, the Hall family moved to what is now [[Tanzania]] in East Africa. George and Lorena Hall taught in schools and did mission work, while Camilla and Nan played with the native children.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Camilla Hall's Place in the Symbionese Liberation Army'' by Rachel Hanel, Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minnesota 2004</ref> In 1954, when Camilla was nine, the family moved back to Saint Peter, because of seven-year-old Nan's poor health. While Camilla Hall attended elementary school in Minnesota, the family moved to [[Montclair, New Jersey]] until Hall was to start high school.

After moving back to Minnesota, Hall went to [[Washburn High School]] in Minneapolis where she was involved in many activities. The 1963 Washburn Yearbook says, "Candy was a member of Blue Tri, Class Play, Poplars Staff, Quill Club, Forensics, Pep Club, and Hall of Fame"<ref name="gustavus.edu"/> Blue Tri club was an organization that encouraged Christian ideals and put together service projects.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In addition, Camilla Hall was voted class clown in High School.<ref name="gustavus.edu"/> In 1963, she graduated from Washburn High School.

After college graduation, Hall moved to [[Duluth, Minnesota]] where she was a [[Caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] for [[St. Louis County, Minnesota]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Her distrust of the government showed in early 1968 when she was elected to carry the Eugene McCarthy banner, in support of the [[Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign, 1968|Eugene McCarthy Presidential Campaign]], for her St. Louis County precinct.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Even though Hall enjoyed helping people in her work, she found it difficult to separate her feelings while being a caseworker.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> For her job in Duluth, Minnesota, Hall used her musical and poetic talents in an advertising campaign.<ref name="ReferenceB">"Camilla Hall's Place in the Symbionese Liberation Army" by Rachel Hanel, Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minnesota 2004</ref> 

In June 1968, Hall returned to Minneapolis, Minnesota and worked as a caseworker for the [[Hennepin County, Minnesota]] welfare office in Minneapolis.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Co-workers and friends of Hall described her as witty, sympathetic, helpful, and compassionate.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Also, she had an outgoing personality and had a passion for literature. At the same time, Hall frequently talked with family and friends about philosophy and how she was disappointed with the state of welfare.<ref>Hall Family.

==In California==

[[File:Camilla Hall with her art.jpg|thumb|right|border|275px|Camilla Hall with her art.]]
In November 1969, Hall moved to Topanga, a northern suburb of Los Angeles, California.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In March, she moved into Los Angeles proper in west Los Angeles. According to Rachael Hanel, "She lived off her savings, interest income from a trust, money from her parents, and selling her simple, Rubenesque line drawings."<ref>Page 55 in ''Camilla Hall's Place in the Symbionese Liberation Army'' by Rachel Hanel, Minnesota State University, Mankato, Minnesota 2004</ref> Even though Hall didn't express dissatisfaction as being an artist, she decided to move again.

Hall moved to Berkeley in February 1971. In May 1971, Hall moved into an apartment complex on Channing Way where she met [[Patricia Soltysik]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Previous to this relationship, Hall had not lived publicly in a lesbian relationship.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Patricia Soltysik was the object of Hall's love poem named "Mizmoon".<ref name="O'Brien, Susan 1976"/>

In Berkeley, Hall continued being politically active. She was one of the activists who took over Berkeley park in the People's Park demonstration, summer 1972.

Hall died in a shootout (May 17, 1974) with police in which five other SLA members were killed. As their hideout burned, Hall and fellow SLA member [[Nancy Ling Perry]] exited out of the back door. Police claimed that Perry came out firing a revolver while Hall fired an automatic pistol. Police shot them both immediately. Perry was shot twice; one shot hit her right [[human lung|lung]], the other shot severing her [[human vertebral column|spine]]. Hall was shot once in the forehead. Investigators working for Hall's parents claimed that Perry had come walking out of the house intending to surrender.<ref>Bryan, John.
