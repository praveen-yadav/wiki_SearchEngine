'''Rhyming slang''' is a form of phrase construction in the [[English language]] and is especially prevalent in dialectal English from the [[East End of London|East End]] of [[London]]; hence the alternative name, '''[[Cockney]] rhyming slang''' (or '''CRS'''). The construction involves replacing a common word with a rhyming phrase of two or three words and then, in almost all cases, omitting the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied), in a process called hemiteleia,<ref name="roberts"/><ref name=mother>{{cite book|last=Bryson|first=Bill|title=Mother Tongue|publisher=Penguin|year=1990|isbn=0-14-014305-X}}</ref> making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to listeners not in the know.<ref name="ayto"/>

The most frequently cited example involves the replacement of "stairs" with the rhyming phrase "apples and pears". Following the usual pattern of omission, "and pears" is dropped and "stairs" is referred to as "apples". Thus the spoken phrase "I'm going up the apples" means "I'm going up the stairs".

In similar fashion, "telephone" is replaced by "dog" (= 'dog-and-bone'); "wife" by "trouble" (= 'trouble-and-strife'); "eyes" by "mincers" (= 'mince pies'); "wig" by "syrup" (= 'syrup of figs') and "feet" by "plates" (= 'plates of meat'). Thus a construction of the following type could conceivably arise: "It nearly knocked me off me plates—he was wearing a syrup! So I ran up the apples, got straight on the dog to me trouble and said I couldn't believe me mincers."

In some examples the meaning is further obscured by adding a second iteration of rhyme and truncation to the original rhymed phrase. For example, the word "Aris" is often used to indicate the buttocks.  This is the result of a double rhyme, starting with the original rough synonym "arse", which is rhymed with "bottle and glass", leading to "bottle". "Bottle" was then [[Bruces' Philosophers Song|rhymed with "Aristotle"]] and truncated to "Aris".<ref name=mother/>

The use of rhyming slang has spread beyond the purely dialectal and some examples are to be found in the mainstream British English lexicon and internationally, although many users may be unaware of the origin of those words. One example is "berk", a mild pejorative widely used across the UK and not usually considered particularly offensive, although the origin lies in a contraction of "[[Berkeley Hunt]]", as the rhyme for the significantly more offensive "[[cunt]]".<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Reference Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press}}[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/berk]</ref> Another example is to "have a butcher's" for to have a look, from "butcher's hook".

Most of the words changed by this process are nouns. A few are adjectival e.g. 'bales' (of cotton = rotten), or the adjectival phrase 'on one's tod' = 'on one's own ([[Tod Sloan (jockey)|Tod Sloan]], a famous jockey).

==History==

Rhyming slang is believed to have originated in the mid-19th century in the [[East End]] of [[London]], with several sources suggesting some time in the 1840s.<ref>Partridge, Eric. Dictionary of Historical Slang. Penguin, 1972.</ref><ref name="hott">{{cite book|last=Hotten|first=John Camden|title=A dictionary of modern slang, cant, and vulgar words|pages=133–136|chapter=Some account of the Rhyming Slang, the secret language of Chaunters and Patterers|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zhk9h-w1negC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dictionary+of+Modern+Slang,+Cant+and+Vulgar+Words&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false | year=1859 | publisher=John Camden Hotten}}</ref><ref name="vicweb"/>

According to Partridge (1972:12), it dates from around 1840 and arose in the East End of London,  however [[John Camden Hotten]] in his 1859 ''[[Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant and Vulgar Words]]'' states that (English) rhyming slang originated "about twelve or fifteen years ago" (i.e. in the 1840s) with 'chaunters' and 'patterers' in the [[Seven Dials]] area of London. (The reference is to travelling salesmen of certain kinds. Chaunters sold sheet music and patterers offered cheap, tawdry goods at fairs and markets up and down the country). Hotten's  ''Dictionary'' included a "Glossary of the Rhyming Slang", the first known such work. It included later mainstays such as "Frog and toad—the main road" and "Apples and pears—stairs" as well as many that later grew more obscure, e.g. "Battle of the Nile—a tile" (vulgar term for a hat), "Duke of York—take a walk", and "Top of Rome—home".

It remains a matter of speculation whether rhyming slang was a linguistic accident, a game, or a [[cryptolect]] developed intentionally to confuse non-locals. If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community. It is possible that it was used in the marketplace to allow traders to talk amongst themselves in order to facilitate [[collusion]], without customers knowing what they were saying. Another suggestion is that it may have been used by criminals ''(see [[thieves' cant]])'' to confuse the police.

==Evolution==
At any point in history, in any location, rhyming slang can be seen to incorporate words and phrases that are relevant at that particular time and place. Many examples are based on locations in London and, in all likelihood, will be meaningless to people unfamiliar with the capital e.g. "[[Peckham Rye]]", meaning "tie" (as in necktie), which dates from the late 19th century; "[[Hampstead Heath]]", meaning "teeth" (usually as "Hampsteads”), which was first recorded in 1887 and "[[Barnet Fair]]", meaning "hair", which dates from the 1850s. (In these examples and many subsequent ones the final step of hemiteleia has been omitted in order to allow the reader more readily to trace the origin of the substituted words).

By the mid-20th century many rhyming slang expressions used the names of contemporary personalities, especially actors and performers: for example "[[Gregory Peck]]"  meaning "neck" and also "cheque"; "[[Ruby Murray]]" meaning "curry"; "Alans", meaning "knickers" from [[Alan Whicker]]; "[[Max Miller (comedian)|Max Miller]]" meaning "pillow" when pronounced /ˈpilə/  and "[[Henry Hall (bandleader)|Henry Halls]]" for "balls (testicles)".

The use of personal names as rhymes continued into the late 20th century, for example "[[Tony Blair]]s" meaning "flares", as in trousers with a wide bottom (previously this was "[[Lionel Blair]]s"  and this change illustrates the ongoing mutation of the forms of expression) and  "[[Britney Spears]]", meaning "beers".

Many examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in England in their contracted form. "To have a butcher's", meaning to have a look, originates from "[[butcher]]'s hook", an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat, and dates from the late 19th century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as "butchers". Similarly, "use your loaf", meaning "use your head", derives from "loaf of [[bread]]" and also dates from the late 19th century but came into independent use in the 1930s.<ref name="ayto" /> To "have a giraffe" is commonly employed for a "laugh", although technically this does not involve hemitelea.

Rhyming slang, in keeping with the rest of the language, is at the mercy of what one might loosely refer to as "false etymology". An example occurs that involves the term "barney", which has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late 19th century, although without a clear derivation.<ref>Partridge,Eric, A concise dictionary of slang and unconventional English. Routledge, 1991:22. (ISBN 0-415-06352-3)</ref>  Thus, in the 1964 film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', [[John Lennon]] mischievously taunts the road manager with the line “If you're gonna have a barney, can I hold your coat?".<ref>''A Hard Day’s Night'', [[United Artists]], 1964</ref>  In the 2001 feature film ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' [[Don Cheadle]] uses the term "barney" and the claim is made that this rhyme is derived from [[Barney Rubble]],<ref>[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/13/messages/932.html Re: Having a barney]</ref> ("trouble") with references to a character from the ''[[Flintstones]]'' cartoon show. This usage can be seen either as an abuse of history, or as a good example of the ever-changing nature of rhyming slang.

==Regional and international variations==
Rhyming slang is used mainly in London in England but can to some degree be understood across the country. Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work. The term "Charing Cross" for example (a place in London) has been used to mean "horse" since the mid-19th century<ref name="ayto" /> but does not rhyme unless "horse" is pronounced as "hoss" - possibly indicating the local-dialect pronunciation of the word at the time. A similar example is "Joanna" meaning "piano", which is based on the pronunciation of "piano" as "pianna" {{IPAc-en|p|i|ˈ|æ|n|ə}}). Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed "Derby Road", which rhymes with "cold", a conjunction that would not be possible elsewhere in the UK.

Outside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but is not in general use in the United States. (Some notable exceptions: "bread" [bread & honey = money], "blow a raspberry" [raspberry tart = fart] and "put up your dukes" [Duke of York = fork, a Cockney slang term for "fist"].) In Australian slang the term for an English person is "[[Alternative words for British#Pommy|pommy]]", which has been proposed as a rhyme on "pomegranate" rhyming with "immigrant".<ref>The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites a well-known Australian weekly, ''[[The Bulletin]]'', which on 14 November 1912 reported: "The other day a Pummy Grant (assisted immigrant) was handed a bridle and told to catch a horse." [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50183640?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=pomegranate&first=1&max_to_show=10  Online Oxford English Dictionary entry for "Pomegranate"].</ref><ref>Partridge,Eric, A concise dictionary of slang and unconventional English. Routledge,1991:342. (ISBN 0-415-06352-3)</ref> A more recent Australian invention is the term "reginalds" to describe underpants (referred to as "undies" in Australian slang), from "Reg Grundies" after [[Reg Grundy]], the Australian media tycoon. In Australia and South Africa, the colloquial term "China" is derived from "mate" rhyming with "China plate" (the identical form, heard in expressions like "me old China" is also a long-established Cockney idiom).

In London rhyming slang is continually evolving, and new phrases are introduced all the time.  As mentioned new personalities replace old ones (as in [[Lionel Blair|Lionel]]/[[Tony Blair]]s—flares), or pop culture introduces new words—as in "I haven't a Scooby" (from [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]], the eponymous cartoon dog of the [[Scooby-Doo|cartoon series]]) meaning "I haven't a clue".

==Rhyming slang and taboo terms==
Rhyming slang is often used as a substitute for words regarded as taboo, often to the extent that the association with the taboo word becomes unknown over time. "[[Wiktionary:berk|Berk]]" (often used to mean "foolish person") originates from the most famous of all [[fox hunting|fox hunts]], the  "[[Berkeley Hunt]]" meaning "cunt"; "[[Wiktionary:cobblers|cobblers]]" (often used in the context "what you said is rubbish") originates from "[[Stitching awl|cobbler's awls]]", meaning "balls" (as in testicles); and "hampton" meaning "prick" (as in penis) originates from "[[Hampton Wick]]" (a place in London).

Lesser taboo terms include "[[pony]] and [[Trap (carriage)#Types of horse-drawn carriages|trap]]" for "crap" (as in defecate, but often used to denote nonsense or low quality); to blow a [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]] (rude sound of derision) from raspberry tart for "fart"; "[[D'Oyly Carte (disambiguation)|D'Oyly Carte]]" for "fart"; "[[Jimmy Riddle]]" for "piddle" (as in [[urinate]]), "[[J. Arthur Rank]]" (a film mogul), "[[Jodrell Bank]]" or "[[Ham hock|ham shank]]" for "[[wank (sexual act)|wank]]", "[[Bristol City Football Club|Bristol Cities]]" (contracted to 'Bristols') for "titties", etc. "Taking the Mick" or "taking the Mickey" is thought to be a rhyming slang form of "[[taking the piss]]", where "Mick" came from "Mickey Bliss".<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090109062814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/wordhunt/whoweretheyextras.shtml "Who Were They?—Tricky Verdicts", from ''Balderdash and Piffle'', BBC, August 2007]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>

Rhyming slang terms for [[Jew]] have included "[[Chelsea Football Club|Chelsea Blue]]", "[[Glue|Stick of Glue]]", "[[dimensional lumber|Four by Two]]", "[[Shoemaking|Buckle my shoe]]", and "Front Wheel Skid", which is a more palatable form of the insulting term "Yid", short for [[Yiddish]], the language spoken by many Jewish immigrants to the UK in the early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In December 2004 [[Joe Pasquale]], winner of the fourth series of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]'', became well known for his frequent use of the term "Jacobs", for [[Jacob's|Jacob's Crackers]], a rhyming slang term for knackers i.e. [[testicles]].

The term Jacobs was used in a line uttered by Brick Top in the movie ''Snatch'':
"Listen, you fucking fringe, if I throw a dog a bone, I don't want to know if it tastes good or not. You stop me again whilst I'm walking, and I'll cut your fucking ''Jacobs'' off."

==Rhyming slang in popular culture==

Rhyming slang is used, then described and a number of examples suggested as  dialogue in one scene of the 1967 film ''[[To Sir With Love]]'' starring [[Sidney Poitier]]. The English students are telling their foreign teacher that the slang is a drag and something for old people.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aSFoY3W3NM To Sir With Love] YouTube</ref>

In Britain rhyming slang had a resurgence of popular interest beginning in the 1970s resulting from its use in a number of London-based television programmes such as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', ''[[Mind Your Language]]'', ''[[The Sweeney]]'' (the title of which is itself rhyming slang—"Sweeney Todd" for "[[Flying Squad]]", a rapid response unit of London’s Metropolitan Police), ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]],<ref>Hawkins, Brian, The Phenomenon that was Minder. Chameleon Press, 2002 (ISBN 962-86812-1-4)</ref> '' ''[[Citizen Smith]]'', ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and ''[[EastEnders]]''. ''Minder'' could be quite uncompromising in its use of obscure forms without any clarification. Thus the non-Cockney viewer was obliged to deduce that, say, "iron" was "male homosexual" ('iron' = 'iron hoof' = 'poof'). One episode in Series 5 of ''Steptoe and Son'' was entitled "Any Old Iron", for the same reason, when Albert thinks that Harold is 'on the turn'.

There is increased interest in "Nominative CRS" or "Nominative Cockney rhyming slang", a derivative of [[Nominative Determinism]], in which the rhyming slang for a celebrity's name is chosen not only to rhyme but also in line with their behaviour.  A prominent example is that of [[Bob Hope]] being used as rhyming slang for dope, after Bob Hope admitted smoking marijuana.<ref>Rolling Stone, 20 March 1980</ref>

In ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'', a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids' = 'kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...).

In modern literature, Cockney rhyming slang is used frequently in the novels and short stories of [[Kim Newman]], for instance in the short story collections "The Man from the Diogenes Club" (2006) and "Secret Files of the Diogenes Club" (2007), where it is explained at the end of each book.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/sherlock/shamblesinbelgravia1.shtml Shambles in Belgravia] BBC Cult</ref> Also, in the novel ''[[Moving Pictures (novel)|Moving Pictures]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], this slang is frequently used.

In popular music, [[Spike Jones]] and his City Slickers recorded "So 'Elp Me", based on rhyming slang (without the hemiteleia), in 1950.  London-based artists such as [[Audio Bullys]] and [[Chas & Dave]] (and others from elsewhere in the UK, such as [[The Streets]], who are from Birmingham) frequently use rhyming slang in their songs. The UK punk scene of the late 1970s introduced bands that glorified their working-class heritage: [[Sham 69]] had a hit song "The Cockney Kids are Innocent". The idiom made a brief appearance in the UK-based DJ reggae music of the 1980s in the hit "Cockney Translation" by [[Smiley Culture]] of [[South London]]; this was followed a couple of years later by Domenick and Peter Metro's "Cockney and Yardie". The 1967 [[Kinks]] song "Harry Rag" was based on the usage of the name [[Harry Wragg]] as rhyming slang for "fag" (i.e. a cigarette).

In movies, Cary Grant's character teaches rhyming slang to his female companion in the film ''[[Mr. Lucky (film)|Mr. Lucky]]'' (1943) and describes it as Australian rhyming slang. The closing song of the 1969 [[Michael Caine]] crime caper, ''[[The Italian Job]]'', ("Getta Bloomin' Move On" a.k.a. "The Self Preservation Society") contains many slang terms. In present day feature films rhyming slang is often used to lend authenticity to an East End setting. Examples include ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998) (wherein the slang is translated via subtitles in one scene); ''[[The Limey]]'' (1999); ''[[Sexy Beast]]'' (2000); ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000); ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001); and ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002); ''[[It's All Gone Pete Tong]]'' (2004), after BBC radio disc jockey [[Pete Tong]] whose name is used in this context as rhyming slang for "wrong"; ''[[Green Street Hooligans]]'' (2005). In [[Margin_Call_(film)|''Margin Call'']] (2011), Will Emerson, played by London-born actor [[Paul Bettany]], asks a friend on the telephone, "How's the trouble and strife?" ("wife").

In Scottish Football, a number of Clubs have nicknames taken from rhyming slang. Partick Thistle are known as the "Harry Rags", which is taken from the rhyming slang of their 'official' nickname "the jags". Rangers are known as the "Teddy Bears", which comes from the rhyming slang for "the Gers" (shortened version of Ran-gers).  Heart of Midlothian are known as the "Jambos", which comes from "Jam Tarts" which is the rhyming slang for "Hearts" which is the common abbreviation of the Club's name. Hibernian are also referred to as "The Cabbage" which comes from Cabbage and Ribs being the rhyming slang for Hibs.

On the TV show [[The League]] in episode ''The Guest Bong'',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119261/</ref> Andre repeatedly uses cockney rhyming slang and explains the pattern. One of the times he uses it, he uses "Christmas Carol" as shorthand for "barrel", which causes a misunderstanding that becomes a plot point.

American-born M.C. MF Doom released an ode to the dialect entitled "Rhymin' Slang", after settling in the UK in 2010. The track was released on his 2012 album "Keys to the Kuffs".
