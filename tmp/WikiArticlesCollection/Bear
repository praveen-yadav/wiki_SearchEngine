'''Bears''' are [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Ursidae'''. They are [[caniformia|caniforms]], or doglike carnivorans, with the [[pinniped]]s being their closest living relatives. Although only eight [[species]] of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and partially in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Bears are found on the [[continent]]s of [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]].

Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, shaggy hair, [[plantigrade]] paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. The [[polar bear]] is mostly carnivorous, the [[giant panda]] feeds almost entirely on [[bamboo]], and the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets.

Except [[mating|courting]] individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically [[solitary animals]]. They are generally [[diurnality|diurnal]], but may be active during the night ([[nocturnal]]) or twilight ([[crepuscular]]) particularly around humans. Bears possess an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]] and, despite their heavy build and awkward gait, are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. In autumn, some bear species forage much fermented fruit, which affects their behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/241001,slovakia-warns-of-tipsy-bears.html|accessdate=2008-11-11|title=Slovakia warns of tipsy bears|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKfsKyJo |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> Bears den in caves and burrows; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period (up to 100 days) of sleep that resembles [[hibernation]].<ref name="bear_essentials_of_hibernation">{{cite web|author=Peter Tyson is editor in chief of NOVA Online. |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/bear-essentials-of-hibernation.html |title=Bear Essentials of Hibernation |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref>

Bears have been hunted since [[prehistoric]] times for [[bear meat|their meat]] and fur. With their tremendous physical presence and charisma, they play a prominent role in the [[The Arts|arts]], [[mythology]], and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, the bears' existence has been pressured through the encroachment on their habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear parts, including the [[Asia]]n [[bile bear]] market. The [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] lists six bear species as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[endangered species|endangered]], and even [[least concern]] species, such as the [[brown bear]], are at risk of [[Local extinction|extirpation]] in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.

==Etymology==
The English word "bear" comes from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|bera}}'' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in [[Germanic languages]] that originate from an adjective meaning "{{lang|en|brown}}".<ref name="indo-european1959">[[Pokorny (1959)]] [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/startq.cgi?flags=endnnnl&root=leiden&basename=\data\ie\pokorny indo-european.nl] {{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>
In Scandinavia, the word for bear is ''{{lang|sv|[[bjorn|björn]]}}'' (or ''{{lang|da|bjørn}}''), and is a relatively common given name for males. The use of this name is ancient and has been found mentioned in several [[runestone]] inscriptions.<ref>[http://hildebrand.raa.se/arkeologi/uppland.asp hildebrand.raa.se]{{dead link |date=November 2012}}</ref>

The reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] name of the bear is ''{{PIE|*h₂ŕ̥tḱos}}'', whence [[Sanskrit]] ''{{lang|sa|r̥kṣa}}'', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''{{lang|ae|arša}}'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄρκτος (''arktos'')}}, [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|ursus}}'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|arth}}'' (whence perhaps "[[Arthur]]"), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''{{lang|sq|ari}}'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{lang|hy|արջ (''arj'')}}. Also compared is [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''{{lang|hit|ḫartagga-}}'', the name of a monster or predator.<ref name="indo-european1959"/> In the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] of the [[brown bear]], ''Ursus arctos'', [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] simply combined the Latin and Greek names.

The Proto-Indo-European (PIE) word for bear, ''{{PIE|*h₂ŕ̥tḱos}}'' seems to have been subject to [[taboo deformation]] or replacement in some languages (as was the word for [[wolf]], ''{{PIE|wlk<sup>w</sup>os}}''), resulting in the use of numerous unrelated words with meanings like "brown one" (English bruin) and "honey-eater" (Slavic ''medved'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/bear.html |title=Bears |accessdate=2009-03-12 |last=Votruba |first=Martin |work=Slovak Studies Program |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKg2MOh4 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no }}</ref> Thus, some Indo-European language groups do not share the same PIE root.

==Evolutionary history==
The family Ursidae is one of 9 families in the suborder '''[[Caniformia]]''', or "doglike" carnivores, within the [[Order (biology)|order]] '''[[Carnivora]]'''. Bears' closest living relatives are the [[pinniped]]s, [[canids]], and [[musteloidea|musteloid]]s.<ref name=Hunt2005>{{cite journal | author = Welsey-Hunt, G.D. & Flynn, J.J. | year = 2005 | title = Phylogeny of the Carnivora: basal relationships among the Carnivoramorphans, and assessment of the position of 'Miacoidea' relative to Carnivora | journal = Journal of Systematic Palaeontology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | doi = 10.1017/S1477201904001518}}</ref>

The following [[synapomorphy|synapomorphic]] (derived) traits set bears apart from related families:
* presence of an [[alisphenoid]] canal
* paroccipital processes that are large and not fused to the [[auditory bullae]]
* auditory bullae are not enlarged
* [[lacrimal bone]] is [[vestigial]]
* cheek teeth are [[molar tooth#Molars among species|bunodont]] and hence indicative of a broad, hypocarnivorous (not strictly meat-eating) diet (although [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] (strictly meat-eating) taxa are known from the fossil record)<ref name=Wang>{{cite journal | author = Wang, Xiaoming, Malcolm C.

* [[carnassials]] are flattened
Additionally, members of this family possess posteriorly oriented M2 postprotocrista [[molar (tooth)|molars]], elongated m2 molars, and a reduction of the premolars.

Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: [[Ailuropodinae]] (monotypic with the [[giant panda]]), [[Tremarctinae]] (monotypic with the [[spectacled bear]]), and [[Ursinae]] (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending upon authority).

===Fossil bears===
The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily [[Amphicynodontinae]], including ''[[Parictis]]'' (late [[Eocene]] to early middle [[Miocene]], 38–18 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) and the slightly younger ''Allocyon'' (early [[Oligocene]], 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. ''Parictis'' does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene.<ref name=Kemp>{{cite book | author = Kemp, T.S. | year = 2005 | title = The Origin and Evolution of Mammals | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-850760-4}}</ref> It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the [[Bering land bridge]] may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene.<ref name=Wang2>{{cite journal | author = Wang Banyue and Qiu Zhanxiang | year = 2005 | title = Notes on Early Oligocene Ursids (Carnivora, Mammalia) from Saint Jacques, Nei Mongol, China | journal = Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | issue = 279 | pages = 116–124 | url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/447/22/B279a05.pdf | doi = 10.1206/0003-0090(2003)279<0116:C>2.0.CO;2 | volume = 279|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lQDJK1oN |archivedate = 2009-11-20|deadurl=no}}</ref> European genera morphologically are very similar to ''Allocyon'', and also the much younger American ''[[Kolponomos]]'' (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including ''Amphicticeps'' and ''[[Amphicynodon]]''.

[[File:Plithocyon armagnacensis.JPG|thumb|left|''Plithocyon armagnacensis'' skull]] The raccoon-sized, dog-like ''[[Cephalogale]]'' is the oldest-known member of the subfamily [[Hemicyoninae]], which first appeared during the middle [[Oligocene]] in Eurasia about 30 Mya ago. The subfamily also includes the younger genera ''[[Phoberocyon]]'' (20–15 Mya), and ''[[Plithocyon]]'' (15–7 Mya).

A ''Cephalogale''-like species gave rise to the genus ''[[Ursavus]]'' during the early Oligocene (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of ''Ursavus'' subsequently entered North America, together with ''Amphicynodon'' and ''Cephalogale'', during the early Miocene (21–18 Mya).

Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from ''Ursavus'' around 20 Mya ago, likely via the species ''Ursavus elmensis''. Based on genetic and morphological data, the [[Ailuropodinae]] (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya ago, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 Mya.<ref name=krause2008/>

The New World short-faced bears ([[Tremarctinae]]) differentiated from [[Ursinae]] following a dispersal event into North America during the mid Miocene (about 13 Mya).<ref name=krause2008/> They [[Great American Interchange|invaded South America]] (~1 Ma) following formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Soibelzon | first = L.

This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the [[Arctodus|North American short-faced bears]] (genus ''Arctodus''), the [[Arctotherium|South American short-faced bears]] (''Arctotherium''), and the [[spectacled bears]], ''Tremarctos'', represented by both an extinct North American species (''[[Tremarctos floridanus|T. floridanus]]''), and the lone surviving representative of the Tremarctinae, the South American [[spectacled bear]] (''T. ornatus'').

[[File:Teufelshöhle-Höhlenbär-Dreiviertelprofil.jpg|thumb|Fossil of [[cave bear]] (''Ursus spelaeus'')]]
The subfamily [[Ursinae]] experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya ago coincident with major environmental changes, with the first members of the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'' also appearing around this time.<ref name=krause2008/> The [[sloth bear]] is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya ago, the species ''Ursus minimus'' appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's [[Asiatic black bear]]. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from ''U. minimus'': the black bears (including the [[sun bear]], the Asiatic black bear, and the [[American black bear]]); and the brown bears (which includes the [[polar bear]]). Modern [[brown bear]]s evolved from ''U. minimus'' via ''[[Ursus etruscus]]'', which itself is ancestral to both the extinct [[Pleistocene]] [[cave bear]] and today's brown and polar bears. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene.<ref name=Qiu >{{cite journal | author = Qiu Zhanxiang | year = 2003 | title = Dispersals of Neogene Carnivorans between Asia and North America | journal = Bulletin American Museum of Natural History | issue = 279 | pages = 18–31 | url = http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/447/25/B279a02.pdf | doi = 10.1206/0003-0090(2003)279<0018:C>2.0.CO;2 | volume = 279|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lQDJK0Fa |archivedate = 2009-11-20|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The fossil record of bears is exceptionally good. Direct ancestor-descendent relationships between individual species are often fairly well established, with sufficient intermediate forms known to make the precise cut-off between an ancestral and its daughter species subjective.<ref name=Kurten>Kurtén, B., 1995. The cave bear story: life and death of a vanished animal, Columbia University Press, ISBN 0-231-10361-1</ref>

Other extinct bear genera include ''Agriarctos'', ''Indarctos'', and ''[[Agriotherium]]'' (sometimes placed within [[hemicyonidae|hemicyonids]]).

===Taxonomic revisions of living bear species===
The giant panda's taxonomy (subfamily Ailuropodinae) has long been debated. Its original classification by [[Armand David]] in 1869 was within the bear genus ''Ursus'', but in 1870, it was reclassified by [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]] to the [[raccoon]] family.<ref>Lindburg, Donald G. (2004). ''Giant Pandas: Biology and Conservation'', pp. 7–9. University of California Press, ISBN 0-520-23867-2</ref> In recent studies, the majority of [[DNA]] analyses suggest the giant panda has a much closer relationship to other bears and should be considered a member of the family Ursidae.<ref>Olaf R.

Unlike their neighbors elsewhere, the [[brown bear]]s of Alaska's [[ABC islands (Alaska)|ABC Islands]] evidently are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears in the world. Researchers Gerald Shields and Sandra Talbot of the [[University of Alaska]] Fairbanks Institute of Arctic Biology studied the [[DNA]] of several samples of the species and found their DNA is different from that of other brown bears. The discovery has shown, while all other brown bears share a brown bear as their closest relative, those of Alaska's ABC Islands differ and share their closest relation with the polar bear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF13/1314.html |title=The Brown Bear: Father of the Polar Bear?, Alaska Science Forum |publisher=Gi.alaska.edu |date=1996-12-05 |accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqqFrYLO |archivedate = 2010-01-17|deadurl=no}}</ref> Also, the very rare [[Tibetan blue bear]] is a type of brown bear.

The genera ''[[Melursus]]'' and ''[[Helarctos]]'' are sometimes also included in ''Ursus''. The Asiatic black bear and the polar bear used to be placed in their own genera, ''Selenarctos'' and ''Thalarctos''; these names have since been reduced in rank to [[subgenus|subgeneric]] rank.

A number of [[Ursid hybrids|hybrids]] have been bred between American black, brown, and polar bears.

===Morphology===
[[File:Black bear large.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite being [[quadruped]]s, bears can stand and sit similarly to humans.]]
[[File:Bear foot.jpg|thumb|left|Unlike most other Carnivora, bears have [[plantigrade]] feet]]
Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with relatively short legs. They are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] with regard to size, with the males being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species, and where a species varies in size across its distribution, individuals from larger-sized areas tend also to vary more. Bears are the most massive terrestrial members of the order Carnivora. Some exceptional polar bears and [[Kodiak bear]]s (a brown bear subspecies) have been weighed at over {{convert|750|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. As to which species is the largest depends on whether the assessment is based on which species has the largest individuals (brown bears) or on the largest average size (polar bears), as some races of brown bears are much smaller than polar bears. Adult male Kodiak bears average {{convert|480|to|533|kg|lb|abbr=on}} compared to an average of {{convert|386|to|408|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in adult male polar bears, per the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.<ref name="Wood">{{cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}</ref> The smallest bears are the [[sun bear]]s of Asia, which weigh an average of {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the males and {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the females, though the smallest mature females can weigh only {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "HMW">{{Cite book | first = David L. | last = Garshelis | editor-last = Wilson | editor-first = Don| editor2-last =Mittermeier | editor2-first = Russell | contribution = Family Ursidae (Bears) | title = [[Handbook of the Mammals of the World]].

The tails of bears are often considered a vestigal feature and can range from {{convert|3|to|22|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Hunter"/><ref name = Walker/>

Unlike most other land carnivorans, bears are [[plantigrade]]. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are still quite fast, with the brown bear reaching {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on}}, although they are still slower than [[Felinae|felines]] and [[dog|canines]]. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Bears' nonretractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. Their ears are rounded.

Bears have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], better than the [[dog]]s (Canidae), or possibly any other mammal. This sense of smell is used for signalling between bears (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to find most of their food.<ref name = "HMW"/>

====Dentition====
Unlike most other members of the [[Carnivora]], bears have relatively undeveloped [[carnassial]] teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter. The [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] are large, and the [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth flat and crushing. Considerable variation occurs in [[dentition|dental formula]] even within a given species. This may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from carnivorous to predominantly herbivorous diets. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved fully functional carnassials, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory.<ref name=EoM>{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D.|author= Bunnell, Fred|year=1984 |title= The Encyclopedia of Mammals|publisher= Facts on File|location=New York|page= 87|isbn= 978-0-87196-871-5}}</ref> The dental formula for living bears is:
{{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.2-4.2|lower=3.1.2-4.3}}

===Distribution and habitat===
{{See also|List of carnivorans by population}}
Bears are primarily found in the Northern Hemisphere, and with one exception, only in Asia, North America and Europe. A single species, the [[spectacled bear]], is native to the [[Andes|Andean region]] of South America. The [[Atlas bear]], a subspecies of the brown bear, was the only bear native to [[Africa]]. It was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but has been extinct since around the 1870s. The most widespread species is the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia to the western areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species are Asian.<ref name = "HMW"/>

With the exception of the polar bear, bears are mostly forest species. Some species, particularly the brown bear, may inhabit or seasonally use other areas, such as alpine scrub or tundra.

===Behaviour===
While many people think bears are [[nocturnal]], they are, in fact, generally [[diurnality|diurnal]], active for the most part during the day. The belief they are nocturnal apparently comes from the habits of bears that live near humans, which engage in some nocturnal activities, such as raiding trash cans or crops while avoiding humans. The sloth bear of Asia is the most nocturnal of the bears, but this varies by individual, and females with cubs are often diurnal to avoid competition with males and nocturnal predators.<ref name = "HMW"/> Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. Liaisons between breeding bears are brief, and the only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs).<ref name = "HMW"/>

===Vocalizations===
Bears produce a variety of vocalizations such as:
* '''Moaning''' is produced mostly as mild warnings to potential threats or in fear,
* '''Barking''' is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position.
* '''Huffing''' is made during courtship or between mother and cubs to warn of danger.
* '''Growling''' is produced as strong warnings to potential threats or in anger.
* '''Roaring''' is used much for the same reasons as growls and also to proclaim territory and for intimidation.

===Diet and interspecific interactions===

[[File:Bear Alaska (3).jpg|thumb|[[Brown bear]]s make use of infrequent but predictable salmon runs in order to feed]]

Their carnivorous reputation not withstanding, most bears have adopted diets of more plant than animal matter and are completely opportunistic omnivores. Some bears will climb trees to obtain [[mast (botany)|mast]] (edible vegatative or reproductive parts such as acorns); smaller species that are more able to climb include a greater amount of this in their diets.<ref name="diet">{{cite journal|last=Mattson|first=David J.|year=1998|title=Diet and Morphology of Extant and Recently Extinct Northern Bears |journal=Ursus, A Selection of Papers from the Tenth International Conference on Bear Research and Management, Fairbanks, Alaska, July 1995, and Mora, Sweden, September 1995|volume=10|pages=479–496|jstor=3873160}}</ref> Such masts can be very important to the diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Christopher|year=2007|title=Influence of mast production on black bear non-hunting mortalities in West Virginia|journal=Ursus|volume=18|issue=1|pages=46–53| doi = 10.2192/1537-6176(2007)18[46:IOMPOB]2.0.CO;2|last2=Pack|first2=James C.|last3=Igo|first3=William K.|last4=Billings|first4=Anthony}}</ref> One exception is the polar bear, which has adopted a diet mainly of [[marine mammal]]s to survive in the Arctic. The other exception is the giant panda, which has adopted a diet mainly of bamboo.

D. }}</ref> All bears will feed on any food source that becomes available, the nature of which varies seasonally. A study of Asiatic black bears in [[Taiwan]] found they would consume large numbers of acorns when they were most common, and switch to [[ungulate]]s at other times of the year.<ref name = "asiablackdiet">{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Mei-Hsiu|year=2002|title=Diets of Asiatic black bears in Taiwan, with Methodological and Geographical Comparisons|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_13/Hwang_13.pdf |journal=Ursus|volume=13|pages=111–125 }}</ref>

When taking warm-blooded animals, bears will typically take small or young animals, as they are easier to catch. However, both species of black bears and the brown bear can sometimes take large prey, such as [[ungulate]]s.<ref name = "asiablackdiet"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Zager| first=Peter|year=2006|title=The role of American black bears and brown bears as predators on ungulates in North America|journal=Ursus|volume=17|issue=2|pages=95–108|doi = 10.2192/1537-6176(2006)17[95:TROABB]2.0.CO;2|last2=Beecham|first2=John}}</ref> Often, bears will feed on other large animals when they encounter a carcass, whether or not the carcass is claimed by, or is the kill of, another predator. This competition is the main source of interspecies conflict. Bears are typically the apex predators in their ranges due to their size and power, and can defend a carcass against nearly all comers. Mother bears also can usually defend their cubs against other predators. The [[tiger]] is the only predator known to regularly prey on adult bears, including sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, giant pandas, sun bears and small brown bears.

===Breeding===

The age at which bears reach [[sexual maturity]] is highly variable, both between and within species. Sexual maturity is dependent on body condition, which is in turn dependent upon the food supply available to the growing individual. The females of smaller species may have young in as little as two years, whereas the larger species may not rear young until they are four or even 9 years old. First breeding may be even later in males, where competition for mates may leave younger males without access to females.<ref name="HMW"/>
[[File:Black Bears mating.jpg|left|thumb|American black bears mating]]
The bear's courtship period is very brief. Bears in northern climates reproduce seasonally, usually after a period of inactivity similar to hibernation, although tropical species breed all year round. Cubs are born toothless, blind, and bald. The cubs of brown bears, usually born in [[litter (animal)|litters]] of one to three, will typically stay with the mother for two full seasons. They feed on their mother's milk through the duration of their relationship with their mother, although as the cubs continue to grow, nursing becomes less frequent and cubs learn to begin hunting with the mother. They will remain with the mother for about three years, until she enters the next cycle of [[estrus]] and drives the cubs off. Bears will reach sexual maturity in five to seven years. Male bears, especially polar and brown bears, will kill and sometimes devour cubs born to another father to induce a female to breed again. Female bears are often successful in driving off males in protection of their cubs, despite being rather smaller.

Many bears of northern regions are assumed{{by whom|date=March 2012}} to [[hibernation|hibernate]] in the winter, a belief supported by a number of scientific studies.<ref name=Science2011>{{cite journal | author = Gerhard Heldmeier | year = 2011 | title = Life on Low Flame in Hibernation | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6019 | pages = 866–867 | doi = 10.1126/science.1203192 }}</ref><ref name=Shimozuru2013>{{cite journal | author = Shimozuru, M., ''et al.'' | year = 2013 | title = Pregnancy during hibernation in Japanese black bears: effects on body temperature and blood biochemical profiles | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 618–627 | doi = 10.1644/12-MAMM-A-246.1}}</ref> While many bear species do go into a [[physiological]] state often colloquially called "hibernation" or "[[winter sleep]]", it is not true hibernation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In true hibernators, body temperatures drop to near ambient and heart rates slow drastically, but the animals periodically rouse themselves to urinate or defecate and to eat from stored food.

==Relationship with humans==
{{See also|Bear danger}}
Some species, such as the polar bear, American black bear, sloth bear, and brown bear, are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people. All bears are physically powerful and are likely capable of fatally attacking a person, but they, for the most part, are shy, are easily frightened and will avoid humans. Injuries caused by bears are rare, but are often widely reported.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Douglas|year=2003|title=Polar Bear–Human Interactions in Canadian National Parks, 1986–2000|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_14_1/Clark_Douglas_14_1.pdf |journal=Ursus|volume=14|issue=1|pages=65–71}}</ref> The danger that bears pose is often vastly exaggerated, in part by the human imagination.

Laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from [[habitat destruction]]. Public perception of bears is often very positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, ability to stand on two legs, and symbolic importance,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kellert|first=Stephen|title=Public Attitudes toward Bears and Their Conservation |journal=Bears: Their Biology and Management|volume=9|issue=1|pages=43–50|doi=10.2307/3872683|year=1994|jstor=3872683}}</ref> and support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Andersone|first=Žanete|year=2004|title=Public perception of large carnivores in Latvia|journal=Ursus|volume=15|issue=2|pages=181–187|doi=10.2192/1537-6176(2004)015<0181:PPOLCI>2.0.CO;2|last2=Ozolinš|first2=Jānis}}</ref> In more rural and poorer regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.<ref name="livestock"/> Some populated areas with bear populations have also outlawed the feeding of bears, including allowing them access to garbage or other food waste. Bears in captivity have been trained to dance, box, or ride [[bicycle]]s; however, this use of the animals became controversial in the late 20th century. Bears were kept for [[Bear-baiting|baiting]] in Europe at least since the 16th century.

Some cultures use bears for food and [[folk medicine]]. Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In [[Cantonese cuisine]], bear paws are considered a delicacy. The peoples of China, Japan, and Korea use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Culture==

===Names===
The female first name "Ursula", originally derived from a Christian [[St. Ursula|saint]]'s name and common in English- and German-speaking countries, means "little she-bear" (diminutive of [[Latin]] ''ursa''). In Switzerland, the male first name "Urs" is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of [[Bern]] is derived from ''Bär'', [[German language|German]] for bear.

In Scandinavia, the male personal names [[Björn]] (Sweden, Iceland) and [[Bjørn]] (Norway, Denmark), meaning "bear", are relatively common. In Finland, the male personal name [[Otso]] is an old poetic name for bear, similar to Kontio.

In [[Russian (language)|Russian]] and other [[Slavic languages]], the word for bear, ''medved'' (медведь), and variants or derivatives such as [[Medvedev (surname)|Medvedev]], are common surnames.

The [[Irish people|Irish]] family name "McMahon" means "Son of Bear" in [[Irish language|Irish]].

In East European Jewish communities, the name ''Ber'' (בער)—[[Yiddish]] cognate of "Bear"—has been attested as a common male first name, at least since the 18th century, and was, among others, the name of several prominent [[rabbi]]s. The Yiddish ''Ber'' is still in use among [[Orthodox Jewish]] communities in Israel, the US, and other countries. With the transition from Yiddish to [[Hebrew]] under the influence of [[zionism]], the Hebrew word for "bear", ''dov'' (דב), was taken up in contemporary [[Israel]] and is at present among the commonly used male first names in that country.

"[[Ten Bears]]" (Paruasemana) was the name of a well-known 19th century chieftain among the [[Comanche]]. Also among other [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes, bear-related names are attested.

===Myth and legend===
{{for|bears in mythology|Jean de l'Ours|Arcturus|Ursa Major|Berserker|Kalevala}}
There is evidence of prehistoric [[bear worship]]. Anthropologists such as [[Joseph Campbell]] have regarded this as a common feature in most of the [[fishing]] and [[hunting]]-[[tribe]]s. The prehistoric [[Finns]], along with most [[Siberian peoples]], considered the bear as the spirit of one's forefathers. This is why the bear (''karhu'') was a greatly respected animal, with several euphemistic names (such as ''otso'', ''mesikämmen'' and ''kontio''). The bear is the national animal of [[Finland]].

This kind of attitude is reflected in the traditional [[Russia]]n [[fairy tale]] "''[[Morozko]]''", whose arrogant protagonist Ivan tries to kill a mother bear and her cubs—and is punished and humbled by having his own head turned magically into a bear's head and being subsequently shunned by human society.

"[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]" is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear, and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. In the 1970s, this story was adapted into the [[East German]] [[fantasy film]] ''[[The Singing Ringing Tree]]'' and broadcast on British television.

Evidence of bear worship has been found in early Chinese and [[Ainu religion|Ainu culture]]s, as well (see [[Iomante]]). [[Korean people]] in their [[Korean mythology|mythology]] identify the bear as their ancestor and symbolic animal. According to the Korean legend, a god imposed a difficult test on a she-bear; when she passed it, the god [[40th century BC#Mythology|turned her into a woman]] and married her.

Legends of saints taming bears are common in the Alpine zone. In the arms of the bishopric of [[Freising]], the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by St. [[Corbinian]] and made to carry his civilised baggage over the mountains. A bear also features prominently in the legend of St. [[Romedius]], who is also said to have tamed one of these animals and had the same bear carry him from his hermitage in the mountains to the city of [[Trento]].

Similar stories are told of [[Saint Gall]] and [[Saint Columbanus]].

This recurrent motif was used by the Church as a symbol of the victory of Christianity over paganism.<ref>Pastoreau, Michel (2007) ''L'ours. Historie d'un roi déchu'', Seuil ISBN 2-02-021542-X.</ref> In the Norse settlements of northern England during the 10th century, a type of "hogback" grave cover of a long narrow block of stone, with a shaped apex like the roof beam of a long house, is carved with a muzzled, thus Christianised, bear clasping each gable end. Though the best collection of these is in the church at [[Brompton, Hambleton|Brompton, North Yorkshire]],<ref>Noted and illustrated in Hall, Richard (1995) ''Viking Age Archaeology'', p. 43 and fig. 22, ISBN 0-7478-0063-4.</ref> their distribution ranges across northern England and southern Scotland, with a scattered few in the north Midlands and single survivals in Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland; a late group is found in the [[Orkney Islands]].

Bears are a popular feature of many children's stories, including Goldilocks and "[[The Story of the Three Bears]]", the [[Berenstein Bears]], and [[Winnie the Pooh]].

[[Smokey Bear]] has become a part of [[United States|American]] culture since his introduction in 1944. Known to almost all Americans, he and his message, "Only you can prevent forest fires" (updated in 2001 to "Only you can prevent wildfires"), have been a symbol of preserving woodlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=129 |title=Forest Fire Prevention – Smokey Bear (1944–Present) |publisher=Ad Council |date=1944-08-09 |accessdate=2010-10-16|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKg3eCG9 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}</ref> Smokey wears a [[Campaign hat|hat]] similar to one worn by U.S. Forest Service rangers; state police officers in some states wear a similar style, giving rise to the [[CB slang]] "bear" or "Smokey" for the [[highway patrol]].

===Figures of speech===
The physical attributes and behaviours of bears are commonly used in figures of speech in English.
* In the [[stock market]], a ''[[bear market]]'' is a period of declining prices. Pessimistic forecasting or negative activity is said to be ''bearish'' (due to the stereotypical posture of bears looking downwards), and one who expresses bearish sentiment is a ''bear''. Its opposite is a ''bull market'', and ''bullish'' sentiment from ''bulls''.
* In [[gay slang]], the term "[[bear community|bear]]" refers to male individuals who possess physical attributes much like a bear, such as a heavy build, abundant body hair, and commonly facial hair.
* A ''[[bear hug]]'' is typically a tight [[hug]] that involves wrapping one's arms around another person, often leaving that person's arms immobile. It was used in the [[Ronald Reagan]] political ad "[[Bear in the woods]]".
* ''Bear tracking'' – in the [[old West]]ern states of the [[U.S.]] and, to this day, in the former [[Dakota Territory]], the expression "you ain't just a bear trackin'" is used to mean "you ain't lying" or "that's for sure". This expression evolved as an outgrowth of the experience pioneer hunters and mountainmen had when tracking bear. Bears often lay down false tracks and are notorious for doubling back on anything tracking them. If you are not following bear tracks, you are not following false trails or leads in your thoughts, words or deeds.
* In [[Korean culture]] a person is referred to as being "like a bear" when they are stubborn or not sensitive to what is happening around their surroundings. Used as a phrase to call a person "stubborn bear".
* The [[Bible]] compares [[King David]]'s "bitter warriors", who fight with such fury that they could overcome many times their number of opponents, with "a bear robbed of her whelps in the field" (2 [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] 17:8 [[s:Bible (King James)/2 Samuel#Chapter 17]]). The phrase "a bereaved bear" (דב שכול), derived from this Biblical source, is still used in the literary [[Hebrew]] of contemporary [[Israel]].
