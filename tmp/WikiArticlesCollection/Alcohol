In [[chemistry]], an '''alcohol''' is an [[organic compound]] in which the [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]] (-[[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]]) is bound to a [[carbon]] atom. In particular, this carbon center should be [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], having single bonds to three other atoms.<ref>{{GoldBookRef | title = Alcohols | file = A00204}}</ref>

An important class of alcohols are the simple [[aliphatic compound|acyclic]] alcohols, the general formula for which is C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+1</sub>OH. Of those, [[ethanol]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) is the type of alcohol found in [[alcoholic beverages]], and in common speech the word ''alcohol'' refers specifically to ethanol.

Other alcohols are usually described with a clarifying adjective, as in ''[[isopropyl alcohol]]'' (''propan-2-ol'') or ''wood alcohol'' (''methyl alcohol'', or [[methanol]]). The suffix ''-ol'' appears in the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC chemical name]] of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix ''hydroxy-'' will appear in the [[IUPAC]] name. The suffix ''-ol'' in non-systematic names (such as [[paracetamol]] or [[cholesterol]]) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol.  But many substances, particularly sugars (examples [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]]) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix.

In everyday life "alcohol" without qualification usually refers to ethanol, or a [[Alcoholic beverage|beverage based on ethanol]] (as in the term "[[alcohol abuse]]").

Alcoholic beverages have been consumed by humans since prehistoric times for a variety of hygienic, dietary, medicinal, religious, and recreational reasons.

Primary alcohols (R-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) (e.g. acetaldehyde) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO<sub>2</sub>H), while the oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.

Ethanol's toxicity is largely caused by its primary metabolite, [[acetaldehyde]] (systematically ethanal)<ref name='CERI'>{{cite journal | title = Living with alcohol | journal = [http://www.ceri.com/sdnews.htm Smart Drug News] | date = 1996-12-13 | first = Steven | last = Fowkes | volume = 5| id = | url = http://www.ceri.com/alcohol.htm | accessdate = 2012-03-02}}</ref><ref name='ns poison'>{{cite web | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325901.700-whats-your-poison.html | title = What's your poison | accessdate = 2007-02-10 | last = Melton | first = Lisa | work = New Scientist | archiveurl = http://www.cheerzhangover.com/Cheerz_ATH-NewScience.pdf| archivedate = 2012-02-21}}</ref> and secondary metabolite, [[acetic acid]].<ref name='ns poison' /><ref>{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0015963}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Oct2004/pdf/Oct2004p41-47.pdf | title = The Biochemistry of Alcohol Toxicity | accessdate = 2012-02-21 | last = Ramachandra Murty | first = B | date = 2004-10-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Cassarett | first1 = Lewis | last2 = Doull | first2 = John | title = Toxicology: The Basic Science of Poisons | edition = 3 | year = 1986 | pages = 648–653 | accessdate = 2012-02-21}}</ref> All primary alcohols are broken down into aldehydes then to carboxylic acids whose toxicities are similar to acetaldehyde and acetic acid.

[[tert-Amyl alcohol|''tert''-Amyl alcohol]] found in alcoholic beverages are a good example of a tertiary alcohol which saw both medicinal and recreational use.

Other alcohols are substantially more poisonous than ethanol, partly because they take much longer to be metabolized and partly because their metabolism produces substances that are even more toxic. Methanol (wood alcohol), for instance, is oxidized to [[formaldehyde]] and then to the poisonous [[formic acid]] in the liver by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[formaldehyde dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s, respectively; accumulation of formic acid can lead to blindness or death.<ref name="Schep">{{cite journal |author=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |issue= |pages=b3929 |year=2009 |month=Sep 30|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}</ref> Likewise, poisoning due to other alcohols such as [[ethylene glycol]] or [[diethylene glycol]] are due to their metabolites, which are also produced by alcohol dehydrogenase.<ref name="Brent-2009">{{cite journal |author=Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=N.

===Treatment===
An effective treatment to prevent toxicity after methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion is to administer ethanol. Alcohol dehydrogenase has a higher affinity for ethanol, thus preventing methanol from binding and acting as a [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]].

==Nomenclature==

===Systematic names===
In the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature|IUPAC]] system, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal "e" and adds "ol", e.g., "methanol" and "ethanol".<ref name = reusch-alcohols>{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = VirtualText of Organic Chemistry | title = Alcohols | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom | accessdate = 2007-09-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070919162404/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom| archivedate= 19 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the "ol": [[propan-1-ol]] for CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, [[Isopropyl alcohol|propan-2-ol]] for CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CH<sub>3</sub>. Sometimes, the position number is written before the IUPAC name: 1-propanol and 2-propanol. If a higher priority group is present (such as an [[aldehyde]], [[ketone]], or [[carboxylic acid]]), then it is necessary to use the prefix "hydroxy",<ref name = reusch-alcohols/> for example: 1-hydroxy-2-propanone (CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>2</sub>OH).<ref>Organic chemistry IUPAC nomenclature. Alcohols Rule C-201. http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_202.htm</ref>

The IUPAC nomenclature is used in scientific publications and where precise identification of the substance is important. In other less formal contexts, an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word "alcohol", e.g., [[methyl group|methyl]] alcohol, [[ethyl group|ethyl]] alcohol. [[Propyl]] alcohol may be [[propanol|''n''-propyl alcohol]] or [[isopropyl alcohol]], depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the 1st or 2nd carbon on the [[propane]] chain.

{{anchor|secondary|tertiary}}
Alcohols are classified into 0°, primary (1°), secondary (2°; also italic abbreviated ''sec-'' or just ''s-''), and tertiary (3°; also italic abbreviated ''tert-'' or just ''t-''), based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) [[functional group]]. The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH<sub>2</sub>OH; secondary ones are RR'CHOH; and tertiary ones are RR'R"COH, where R, R', and R" stand for alkyl groups. Methanol ([[carbon|C]] [[hydrogen|H]]<sub>3</sub>[[oxygen|O]] [[hydrogen|H]] or CH<sub>4</sub>O) is a 0° alcohol. Some sources include [[methanol]] as a primary alcohol,<ref name="titlean introduction to alcohols">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/organicprops/alcohols/background.html |title=an introduction to alcohols |accessdate=2007-11-22 |work=}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-7641-1664-9">{{Cite book|author=Albert S.

====Alkyl chain variations in alcohols====
Short-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 1-3 carbons. Medium-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 4-7 carbons. Long-chain alcohols (also known as [[fatty alcohols]]) have alkyl chains of 8-21 carbons, and very long-chain alcohols have alkyl chains of 22 carbons or longer.<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.ecocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?object=Short-Chain-Alcohols|title= MetaCyc Compound Class: a short-chain alcohol}}</ref>

====Simple alcohols====
"Simple alcohols" appears to be a completely undefined term. However, simple alcohols are often referred to by common names derived by adding the word "alcohol" to the name of the appropriate alkyl group.  For instance, a chain consisting of one carbon (a methyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>) with an OH group attached to the carbon is called "methyl alcohol" while a chain of two carbons (an ethyl group, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>) with an OH group connected to the CH<sub>2</sub> is called "ethyl alcohol." For more complex alcohols, the IUPAC nomenclature must be used.<ref>[http://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/molecule_gallery/05_alcohols/00_alcohols.htm Molecule Gallery - Alcohols<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Simple alcohols, in particular ethanol and methanol, possess [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] and inert rendering properties, leading to their use as anti-microbial agents in medicine, pharmacy, and industry. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====Higher alcohols====
Encyclopædia Britannica states, "The higher alcohols - those containing 4 to 10 carbon atoms – are somewhat viscous, or oily, and they have heavier fruity odours. Some of the highly branched alcohols and many alcohols containing more than 12 carbon atoms are solids at room temperature."<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13366/alcohol alcohol (chemical compound) - Encyclopedia Britannica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Like ethanol, [[n-Butanol|butanol]] can be produced by fermentation processes. (However, the fermenting agent is a bacterium, ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'', that feeds on [[cellulose]], not sugars like the [[Saccharomyces]] [[yeast]] that produces ethanol.) Saccharomyces yeast are known to produce these higher alcohols at temperatures above {{convert|75|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

===History and etymology===
The word ''alcohol'' appears in English as a term for a very fine powder in the 16th century.  It was borrowed from French, which took it from medical [[Middle Latin|Latin]]. 

Ultimately the word is from the [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|[[wikt:الكحل|كحل]]}} (''{{transl|ar|al-kuḥl}},'' "[[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], a powder used as an eyeliner"). [[Al-]] is the Arabic [[Article (grammar)|definitive article]], equivalent to ''the'' in English; ''alcohol'' was originally used for  the very fine powder produced by the [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] of the natural mineral [[stibnite]] to form [[antimony]] [[sulfide]] [[antimony|Sb]]<sub>2</sub>[[sulfur|S]]<sub>3</sub> (hence the essence or "spirit" of the substance), which was used as an [[antiseptic]], eyeliner, and cosmetic (see [[kohl (cosmetics)]]). [[Bartholomew Traheron]], in his 1543 translation of [[John of Vigo]], introduces the word as a term used by "barbarous" ([[Moorish]]) authors for "fine powder."  Vigo wrote:
''the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre.''

The  1657 ''[[Lexicon Chymicum]]'' by William Johnson glosses the word as ''antimonium sive stibium.'' By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including "alcohol of wine," the distilled essence of wine. [[Libavius]] in ''Alchymia'' (1594) refers to ''vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum''. Johnson (1657) glosses ''alcohol vini'' as ''quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.'' The word's meaning became restricted to "spirit of wine" (the chemical known today as [[ethanol]]) in the 18<sup>th</sup> century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as "alcohols" in modern chemistry after 1850.

The first alcohol (today known as [[ethyl alcohol]]) was discovered by the tenth-century Persian alchemist [[al-Razi]].
The current Arabic name for alcohol ([[ethanol]]) is  الغول al-ġawl – properly meaning "spirit" or "demon" – with the sense "the thing that gives the wine its headiness" (in the Qur'an [[sura 37]] verse 47).<ref>[http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Alcohol Alcohol - New World Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
The term ''ethanol'' was invented 1838, modeled on the German word äthyl (Liebig), which is in turn based on Greek ''aither'' [[ether]] and  ''hyle'' "stuff."<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ethyl&allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Physical and chemical properties==
Alcohols have an odor that is often described as “biting” and as “hanging” in the nasal passages. Ethanol has a slightly sweeter (or more fruit-like) odor than the other alcohols.

In general, the [[hydroxyl group]] makes the alcohol molecule [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to other compounds (except in [[2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol|certain large molecules]] where the hydroxyl is protected by [[steric hindrance]] of adjacent groups<ref name="maje">{{cite journal | first=Irena |last1=Majerza |first2= Ireneusz |last2=Natkaniec |year=2006 | title=Experimental and theoretical IR, R, and INS spectra of 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-t-butyl-pentane-3-ol |journal=Journal of Molecular Structure |volume =788 |issue= 1–3 |pages =93–101 | doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2005.11.022  | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= |bibcode = 2006JMoSt.788...93M }}
</ref>). This hydrogen bonding means that alcohols can be used as [[protic solvent]]s. Two opposing solubility trends in alcohols are: the tendency of the polar OH to promote solubility in water, and the tendency of the carbon chain to resist it. Thus, methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible in water because the hydroxyl group wins out over the short carbon chain. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble because of a balance between the two trends. Alcohols of five or more carbons ([[amyl alcohol|pentanol]] and higher) are effectively insoluble in water because of the hydrocarbon chain's dominance. All simple alcohols are miscible in organic solvents.

Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29 °C, compared to 69 °C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]] (a common constituent of [[gasoline]]), and 34.6 °C for [[diethyl ether]].

Alcohols, like water, can show either acidic or basic properties at the -OH group. With a [[pKa|pK<Sub>a</sub>]] of around 16-19, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]], but they are still able to react with strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or reactive metals such as [[sodium]]. The [[salt]]s that result are called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O<sup>-</sup> [[Metal|M]]<sup>+</sup>.

Meanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:

[[File:Methanol acid base.gif|500px|Acidity & basicity of methanol]]

Alcohols can also undergo [[oxidation]] to give [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, or [[carboxylic acid]]s, or they can be dehydrated to [[alkene]]s. They can react to form [[ester compound]]s, and they can (if activated first) undergo [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions. The lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles. For more details, see the [[Alcohol#Reactions|reactions of alcohols]] section below.

As one moves from primary to secondary to tertiary alcohols with the same backbone, the hydrogen bond strength, the boiling point, and the acidity typically decrease.

==Applications==
[[File:Alcohol by Country.png|thumb|200px|Total recorded [[alcohol consumption by country|alcohol per capita consumption]] (15+), in litres of pure alcohol<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_2004_overview.pdf |title=Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref>]]
Alcohol has a long history of several uses worldwide. It is found in beverages for adults, as fuel, and also has many scientific, medical, and industrial uses. The term '''alcohol-free''' is often used to describe a product that does not contain alcohol. Some consumers of some commercially prepared products may view alcohol as an undesirable ingredient, particularly in products intended for children.

===Alcoholic beverages===
[[Alcoholic beverage]]s, typically containing <1% to 50% plus [[ethanol]] by volume, have been produced and consumed by humans since pre-historic times.

===Antifreeze===
A 50% [[Volume fraction|v/v]] (by volume) solution of [[ethylene glycol]] in water is commonly used as an [[antifreeze]].

===Antiseptics===
Ethanol can be used as an [[antiseptic]] to disinfect the skin before injections are given, often along with [[iodine]]. Ethanol-based [[soap]]s are becoming common in restaurants and are convenient because they do not require drying due to the volatility of the compound. Alcohol based gels have become common as [[hand sanitizer]]s.

===Fuels===
Some alcohols, mainly [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]], can be used as an [[alcohol fuel]]. Fuel performance can be increased in [[forced induction]] [[internal combustion engine]]s by injecting alcohol into the air intake after the [[turbocharger]] or [[supercharger]] has pressurized the air. This cools the pressurized air, providing a denser air charge, which allows for more fuel, and therefore more power.

===Preservative===
Alcohol is often used as a [[preservative]] for [[Biological specimen|specimens]] in the fields of science and medicine.

===Solvents===
Hydroxyl groups (-OH), found in alcohols, are [[Chemical polarity|polar]] and therefore [[hydrophilic]] (water loving) but their carbon chain portion is [[non-polar]] which make them [[hydrophobic]]. The molecule increasingly becomes overall more nonpolar and therefore less soluble in the polar water as the carbon chain becomes longer.<ref>[http://www.chem.latech.edu/~deddy/chem121/Alcohols.htm Alcohols, Phenols, Thiols, and Ethers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Methanol have the shortest carbon chain of all alcohols (one carbon atom) followed by ethanol (two carbon atoms.)

Alcohols have applications in industry and science as reagents or [[solvent]]s. Because of its relatively low toxicity compared with other alcohols and ability to dissolve [[non-polar]] substances, ethanol can be used as a solvent in medical drugs, [[perfume]]s, and vegetable essences such as [[vanilla]]. In [[organic synthesis]], alcohols serve as versatile intermediates.

==Production==
===Ziegler and Oxo Processes===
In the Ziegler process,  alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.<ref name=Falbe>Jürgen Falbe, Helmut Bahrmann, Wolfgang Lipps, Dieter Mayer "Alcohols, Aliphatic" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology'' Wiley-VCH Verlag; Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a01_279}}</ref>  An idealized synthesis of [[octanol]] is shown:
:Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>  +  9 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>   →  Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
:Al(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>3</sub> +  3 O  +  3 H<sub>2</sub>O  →  3 HOC<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>  +  Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>
The process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]].

Many higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation.  When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically obtains a linear alcohol:<ref name=Falbe/>  
:RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>  +  H<sub>2</sub>  +  CO   →  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO
:RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO +  3 H<sub>2  →  RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH
Such processes give [[fatty alcohol]]s, which are useful for detergents.

===Hydration reactions===
Low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes.  Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method.  Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods.  The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts.  In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the [[sulfate ester]], which is subsequently hydrolyzed.  The direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]] using [[ethylene]] ([[Ethanol#Ethylene hydration|ethylene hydration]])<ref name="ECT4 820">{{cite book | author=Lodgsdon J.E. |year=1994 |chapter=Ethanol |editor= Kroschwitz J.I. | title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology| edition=4th| volume= 9 |page= 820 |location= New York |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |isbn=0-471-52677-0 }}</ref> or other alkenes from [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]].

Hydration is also used industrially to produce the diol [[ethylene glycol]] from [[ethylene oxide]].

===Biological routes===
Ethanol is obtained [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37&nbsp;°C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of [[sucrose]] by the enzyme [[invertase]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], then the conversion of [[glucose]] by the enzyme [[zymase]] into [[ethanol]] (and carbon dioxide).

Several of the benign bacteria{{Which|date=January 2012}} in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product, just like [[aerobic respiration]] produces [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water (molecule)|water]]. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient to cause "[[auto-brewery syndrome]]" in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01873798?LI=true |title=Endogenous alcohol production by intestinal fermentation in sudden infant death |author=P.

===Laboratory synthesis===<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->
Several methods exist for the preparation of alcohols in the laboratory.

====Substitution====
Primary [[alkyl halide]]s react with aqueous [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] mainly to primary alcohols in [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]]. (Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].

====Reduction====
[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of β-keto-esters.

====Hydrolysis====
[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:

==Reactions==<!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] -->

===Deprotonation===
Alcohols can behave as weak acids, undergoing [[deprotonation]]. The deprotonation reaction to produce an [[alkoxide]] salt is performed either with a strong base such as sodium hydride or [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] or with sodium or potassium metal.

: 2 R-OH + 2 [[Sodium hydride|NaH]] → 2 R-O<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + 2[[Hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]]↑

: 2 R-OH + 2 [[Sodium|Na]] → 2 R-O<sup>−</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>

: 2 [[Ethanol|CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>-OH]] + 2 Na → 2 CH<sub>3</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-O<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>↑

Water is similar in [[pKa|pK<Sub>a</sub>]] to many alcohols, so with [[sodium hydroxide]] there is an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] set-up, which usually lies to the left:

: R-OH + NaOH ⇌ R-O<sup>-</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub>O (equilibrium to the left)

It should be noted, however, that the bases used to deprotonate alcohols are strong themselves. The bases used and the alkoxides created are both highly moisture-sensitive chemical reagents.

The acidity of alcohols is also affected by the overall stability of the alkoxide ion. [[Electron-withdrawing group]]s attached to the carbon containing the hydroxyl group will serve to stabilize the alkoxide when formed, thus resulting in greater acidity. On the other hand, the presence of [[electron-donating group]] will result in a less stable alkoxide ion formed. This will result in a scenario whereby the unstable alkoxide ion formed will tend to accept a proton to reform the original alcohol.

With [[alkyl halide]]s alkoxides give rise to [[ether]]s in the [[Williamson ether synthesis]].

===Nucleophilic substitution===
The OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].<sup>[1]</sup>

[[File:Alcohol reaction examples.gif|700px|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]

Alcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:

: 3 R-OH + PBr<sub>3</sub> → 3 RBr + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>

In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.

===Dehydration===
Alcohols are themselves nucleophilic, so R−OH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> can react with ROH to produce [[ether]]s and water in a [[dehydration reaction]], although this reaction is rarely used except in the manufacture of [[diethyl ether]].

More useful is the E1 [[elimination reaction]] of alcohols to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethene]]:

[[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|550px]]

A more controlled elimination reaction is the [[Chugaev elimination]] with [[carbon disulfide]] and [[iodomethane]].

===Esterification===
To form an [[ester]] from an alcohol and a [[carboxylic acid]] the reaction, known as [[Fischer esterification]], is usually performed at [[reflux]] with a [[catalyst]] of concentrated sulfuric acid:

: R-OH + R'-COOH → R'-COOR + H<sub>2</sub>O

In order to drive the equilibrium to the right and produce a good [[yield (chemistry)|yield]] of ester, water is usually removed, either by an excess of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or by using a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]]. Esters may also be prepared by reaction of the alcohol with an [[acid chloride]] in the presence of a base such as [[pyridine]].

Other types of ester are prepared in a similar manner – for example, [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.

===Oxidation===
{{Main|Alcohol oxidation}}
Primary alcohols (R-CH<sub>2</sub>-OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO<sub>2</sub>H), while the oxidation of secondary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R<sup>1</sup>R<sup>2</sup>R<sup>3</sup>C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.

The direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.

[[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|500px|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]

Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]]. These include [[Collins reagent]] and [[Dess-Martin periodinane]]. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using [[potassium permanganate]] or the [[Jones reagent]].

==Occurrence in nature==
Alcohol has been found outside the [[Solar System]]. It can be found in low densities in star and planetary-system-forming regions of space.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Charnley|first=S.
