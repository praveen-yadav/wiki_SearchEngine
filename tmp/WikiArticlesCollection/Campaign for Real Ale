The '''Campaign for Real Ale''' ('''CAMRA''') is an independent voluntary [[consumer organisation]] based in [[St Albans]], England, whose main aims are promoting [[real ale]], [[cider|real cider]] and the traditional British [[public house|pub]]. It is now the largest single-issue consumer group in the UK,<ref>

==History==
[[File:Camra bar towel.JPG|thumb|right|CAMRA logo on a bar towel]]
[[File:1975-CAMRA.JPG|thumb|1975, 9–13 September- First National CAMRA Beer Festival held at Covent Garden, London.]]
The organisation was founded in 1971 in [[Dún Chaoin]], Kerry, Ireland<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Events in CAMRA's History|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/camrahistory|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> by Graham Lees, Bill Mellor, Michael Hardman, and Jim Makin, who were opposed to the growing mass production of beer and the homogenisation of the British [[brewing]] industry.  Other early influential members included Christopher Hutt, author of ''Death of the English Pub'', who succeeded Hardman as chairman, Frank Baillie, author of ''The Beer Drinker's Companion'', and later the current ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'' editor, [[Roger Protz]]. The original name was the Campaign for the Revitalisation of Ale.<ref>

==Aims==
CAMRA's stated aims are to:
# Protect and improve consumer rights.
# Promote quality, choice and value for money.
# Support the public house as a focus of community life.
# Campaign for greater appreciation of traditional beers, ciders and perries as part of our national heritage and culture.
# Seek improvements in all licensed premises and throughout the brewing industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us - CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/about|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>

CAMRA's campaigns include promoting small brewing and pub businesses, reforming licensing laws, reducing tax on beer, and stopping continued consolidation among local British brewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaigns - CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/campaigns|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> It also makes an effort to promote less common varieties of beer, including [[Stout beer|stout]], [[Porter (beer)|porter]], and [[Mild beer|mild]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Different Styles|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> as well as traditional [[cider]] and [[perry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Cider - CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>  

CAMRA does not support the promotion and sale of keg based [[craft beer]] in the UK. CAMRA's Internal Policy document states that real ale can only be served from cask without the use of additional carbonation. This policy means that "any beer brand which is produced in both cask and keg versions" are not admitted to CAMRA festivals or supported by CAMRA <ref>{{cite web|title=Cromarty, CAMRA and crazy cask cancellation|url=http://refreshingbeer.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/cromarty-and-camra-we-are-not-all-idiots.html}}</ref>

==Organisation==
[[File:CamraBuildingHatfieldRoadStAlbans.jpg|thumb|The CAMRA office building in St Albans]]
In 2009, CAMRA announced that it had reached the 100,000 members mark and subsequently went on to pass the 150,000 members mark in 2013.<ref>{{citation

|accessdate=2012-04-04
|publisher=CAMRA}}</ref> Member benefits include a monthly newspaper, ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly ''BEER'' magazine, and free or reduced price admission to CAMRA-organised [[beer festival]]s.

CAMRA is organised on a federal basis, with numerous independent local branches, each covering a particular geographical area of the UK, that contribute to the central body of the organisation based in [[St Albans]]. It is governed by a voluntary unpaid national executive, elected by the membership.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is CAMRA?|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110110102015/http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=181063 |publisher=CAMRA |accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref> The local branches are grouped into 16 regions across the UK, such as the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] or [[Wessex]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CAMRA Near You|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/branches |publisher=CAMRA|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>

The current National Chairman is Colin Valentine, who took over from Paula Waters in February 2010. The Chief Executive is Mike Benner.<ref>{{cite press release  | title = CAMRA appoints new National Chairman  | publisher = CAMRA  | date = 15 February 2010  | url = http://www.camra.org.uk/article.php?group_id=811  | accessdate = 22 July 2013 }}</ref>

CAMRA has established influence at national government level, including [[English Heritage]], and has been designated by the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] as a "super-complainant" to the [[Office of Fair Trading]].<ref>{{citation

==Events and publications==
CAMRA publishes the ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'', an annually compiled directory of its recommended pubs and brewers; the ''[[Good Cider Guide]]'', an occasionally compiled directory of pubs that sell real [[Cider]]; the ''[[Good Bottled Beer Guide]]'', an occasionally compiled review of [[real ale]] in a bottle.
CAMRA members receive a monthly newspaper called ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly colour magazine called ''Beer''.
They also run the [[Great British Beer Festival]], a yearly event held in London at which a large selection of [[cask ale]]s and ciders are tasted.  It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs.

==Festivals==
[[File:GBBF 2.jpg|thumb|Great British Beer Festival 2004]]
CAMRA supports and promotes numerous beer and cider festivals around the country each year, which are organised by local CAMRA branches around the UK. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which varies depending upon the area, and either covers entry only or includes a commemorative ⅓, ½ or 1 [[pint glass]] sporting the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, listing the drinks available for tasting and providing a brief description of each beverage.<ref>[http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals]</ref>

The Campaign also organises the annual Great British Beer Festival in August, held in the Great Hall Kensington Olympia, London, having been a few years at Earl's Court .<ref>[http://www.gbbf.org.uk/ Great British Beer Festival]</ref>

==Awards==
CAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]], in which approximately 4,000 active CAMRA members from 200 local branches vote for their favourite pub of the year. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who select the ones they like best. There are also the [[Pub Design Awards]], which are held in association with [[English Heritage]] and [[The Victorian Society]].  These comprise several categories, including new build, refurbished and converted pubs.  The best known CAMRA award is the [[Champion Beer of Britain]],<ref>{{citation
|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/cbob
|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale
|title=Champion Beer of Britain
|accessdate=25 July 2013
}}</ref> which is selected at the [[Great British Beer Festival]], other awards include the [[Champion Beer of Scotland]] and the [[Champion Beer of Wales]].

==National Beer Scoring Scheme==
CAMRA developed the "National Beer Scoring Scheme"<ref>{{citation
|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/nbss
|title=National Beer Scoring Scheme
|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale
|date=12 January 2006
|first=Brett|last=Laniosh
|accessdate=25 July 2013
}}</ref> (NBSS) as an easy to use scheme for judging beer quality in pubs, to assist CAMRA branches in selecting pubs for the ''Good Beer Guide''. The person filling in the form records their name, date, the pub, the beer and the score.
The scores range from 0, meaning that no real ale is available; increasing in increments of 0.5 through 2, which signifies an average beer that is drunk without calling attention to itself in either a positive or negative manner; up to 5, which signifies a perfect beer.

==Pub heritage group==
The "CAMRA Pub Heritage Group" is a group established to identify, record and help protect [[pub]] interiors of historic and/or architectural importance, and seeks to get them [[Listed building|listed]], if not already.<ref>{{citation
|url=http://www.heritagepubs.org.uk
|title=Heritage Pubs - An Overview
|publisher=Campaign for Real Ale <!-- black link i.e. same page -->
|accessdate=2009-05-05
}}</ref>

The group maintains two inventories of "Heritage pubs", the National Inventory (NI), which contains only those pubs that have been maintained in their original condition (or have been modified very little) for at least 30 years, but usually since at least [[World War II]]. The second, larger inventory is the Regional Inventory (RI), which is broken down by [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] and contains both those pubs listed in the NI and other pubs that are not eligible for the NI, for reasons such as having been overly modified, but are still considered historically important, or have particular architectural value.

The NI contains 289 pubs {{as of|2009|6|lc=on}}.<ref>

</ref>

==LocAle==
With the main aims in mind, the group launched the ''LocAle'' scheme in 2007 which was developed by Steve Westby<ref name="WB-Aug-Loc">'' 'Check your beers urges LocAle creator' '', What's Brewing, August 2010 issue</ref><ref name="WB-Sep-Loc"/> of the [[Nottingham]] branch<ref name="LocAle1">[http://www.camra.org.uk/locale CAMRA LocAle] (accessed 25 July 2013)</ref> to help promote locally brewed beers and also help with environmental issues. The scheme functions slightly differently in each area, and is managed by each branch, but the overall rule is that each participating pub is allowed to purchase beer from whatever brewery they wish, but if the beer is to be promoted as a 'LocAle' it must come from a brewery within a predetermined number of miles (which is set by each CAMRA branch, but generally is around 20 or 25 miles,<ref name="LocAle2">[http://www.camra.org.uk/page.php?id=141 LocAle - More Information & Downloads for Licensees] (accessed 25 July 2013)</ref> although, the North [[London]] branch has set it at 30 miles<ref name="CAM-NL-Loc">[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110527155308/http://www.camranorthlondon.org.uk/locale.html CAMRA North London - LocAle] (accessed 6 September 2010)</ref>) from brewery to pub door,<ref name="WB-Sep-Loc">'LocAle boosts local tourism', ''What's Brewing'', September 2010 issue</ref> even if it comes from a distribution centre further away;<ref name="LocAle2"/> in addition, each participating pub must keep at least one LocAle for sale at all times.<ref name="LocAle2"/><ref name="CAM-NL-Loc"/>
