'''Aedui''', Haedui  or Hedui ({{lang-grc|Αἰδούοι}}), were a [[Gauls|Gallic]] people of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], who inhabited the country between the Arar ([[Saône]]) and Liger ([[Loire]]), in today's France. Their territory thus included the greater part of the modern departments of [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Côte-d'Or]] and [[Nièvre]].

==Geography==
The country of the Aedui is defined by reports of them in the ancient writers. The upper [[Loire]] formed their western border,<ref>{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book vii, Section 5}}.</ref> separating them from the [[Bituriges]]. The [[Saône]] formed their eastern border, separating them from the [[Sequani]].<ref>{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 12}}.</ref> The Sequani did not reside in the region of the confluence of the [[Doubs]] into the Saône and of the latter into the [[Rhône]], as Caesar says that the [[Helvetii]], following the pass between the [[Jura Mountains]] and the Rhône southwards, which belonged to the Sequani, plundered the territory of the Aedui.<ref>{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 11}}.</ref> These circumstances explain an apparent contradiction in [[Strabo]], who in one sentence says that the Aedui lived between the Saône and the Doubs, and in the next, that the Sequani lived across the Saône (eastward).<ref>{{harvnb|Strabo|Geography|loc=Book 4, Chapter 3, Section 2}}.</ref> Both statements are true, the first in the south, and the second to the north.

==History==

According to [[Livy]] (v. 34), they took part in the expedition of [[Bellovesus]] into Italy in the 6th century BC.

Before [[Julius Caesar|Caesar's]] time they had attached themselves to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and were honoured with the title of brothers and kinsmen of the Roman people.<ref>{{harvnb|Caesar|BG|loc=Book I, Section 33}}.</ref>  When the [[Sequani]], their hereditary rivals, with the assistance of a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] chieftain named [[Ariovistus]] defeated and massacred the Aedui at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]], the Aedui sent [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Diviciacus]], the [[Druidry|druid]], to Rome to appeal to the [[Roman Senate|senate]] for help.  But his mission was unsuccessful.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

On his arrival in [[Gaul]] (58 BC), Caesar restored their independence.  In spite of this, the Aedui joined the Gallic coalition against Caesar (''B. G.'' vii. 42), but after the surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] at [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]] were glad to return to their allegiance.  [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] dismantled{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} their native capital [[Bibracte]] on [[Mont Beuvray]], and substituted a new town with a half-Roman, half-Gaulish name, Augustodunum (modern [[Autun]]).

In 21, during the reign of [[Tiberius]], they revolted under [[Julius Sacrovir]], and seized [[Augustodunum]], but were soon put down by Gaius Silius ([[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' iii. 43-46).  The Aedui were the first of the Gauls to receive from the emperor [[Claudius]] the distinction of ''[[jus honorum]]''; thus being the first Gauls permitted to become senators.<ref name="test">Peoples, Nations and Cultures.

The oration of [[Eumenius]], in which he pleaded for the restoration of the schools of his native place Augustodunum, shows that the district was neglected.  The chief magistrate of the Aedui in Caesar's time was called [[Vergobretus]] (according to [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], "judgment-worker"), who was elected annually, possessed powers of life and death, but was forbidden to go beyond the frontier. Certain clientes, or small communities, were also dependent upon the Aedui. 

It is possible that the Aedui adopted many of the governmental practices of the Romans, such as the electing of magistrates and other officials. Or perhaps this was a natural development in their political system. It is thought other Celtic tribes, such as the Remi and the Baiocasses, also elected their leaders.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
