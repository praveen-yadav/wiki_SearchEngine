'''Chastity''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] of a man or woman that is acceptable to the [[morals|moral]] standards and guidelines of their culture, civilization or [[religion]]. In the Western world, the term has become closely associated (and is often used interchangeably) with [[sexual abstinence]], especially [[Premarital sex|before marriage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chastity |title=Chastity &#124; Define Chastity at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref> 
== Etymology ==
The words "chaste" and "chastity" stem from the [[Latin]] adjective ''castus'' meaning "pure". The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century; at that time they meant slightly different things. "Chaste" meant "virtuous or pure from unlawful sexual intercourse" (referring to [[extramarital sex]]),<ref name=etymonlineChaste>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chaste Chaste at etymonline.com]</ref><ref name=podDictEtym>[http://podictionary.com/?p=605 podictionary.com]</ref>
while "chastity" meant "virginity".<ref name="podDictEtym" /><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=chastity Chastity at etymonline.com]</ref> It was not until the late 16th century that the two words came to have the same basic meaning as a related adjective and noun.<ref name="etymonlineChaste" /><ref name="podDictEtym" />

== In religions ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}
In Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and Baha'i beliefs, acts of sexual nature are restricted to marriage. For unmarried persons, chastity is identified with [[sexual abstinence]]. Sexual acts outside or apart from marriage, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]] and [[prostitution]], are considered [[sin]]ful.

=== In Christianity===

In the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition, chastity is synonymous with sexual purity. Chastity means not having any sexual relations before marriage. It also means fidelity to husband or wife during marriage. In [[Catholicism|Catholic]] morality, chastity is placed opposite the [[Seven deadly sins|deadly sin]] of [[lust]], and is classified as one of [[seven virtues]]. The moderation of sexual desires is required to be virtuous. Reason, will and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

In [[marriage]], the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship which excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. Within marriage, various Abrahamic religions consider several practices to be considered unchaste, such as sexual intimacy during or shortly after [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]] or [[childbirth]].<ref>[[Leviticus]] 12:2, 15:24, 20:18.</ref> After marriage, a third form of chastity, often called "vidual chastity", is expected of a woman while she is in mourning for her late husband. For example, [[Jeremy Taylor]] defined 5 rules in ''Holy Living'' (1650), including abstaining from marrying "so long as she is with child by her former husband" and "within the year of mourning".<ref>{{cite book | title = Holy Living |chapter = Chapter II, Section III, Of Chastity | author = [[Jeremy Taylor]] | year = 1650 | url = http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/taylor/holyliving/index.htm }}</ref>

The particular ethical system may not prescribe each of these. For example, Roman Catholics view sex within marriage as chaste, but prohibit the use of artificial contraception as an offense against chastity, seeing contraception as unnatural, contrary to God's will and design of human sexuality. Many [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] communities allow for artificial contraception, seeing the restriction of family size as possibly not contrary to God's will. A stricter view is held by the [[Shakers]], who prohibit marriage (and [[sexual intercourse]] under any circumstances) as a violation of chastity. The [[Catholic Church]] has set up various rules regarding [[clerical celibacy]], while most Protestant communities allow clergy to marry.

Celibacy is required of [[Monasticism|monastic]]s—monks, nuns and friars—even in a rare system of [[double cloister]]s, in which husbands could enter the (men's) monastery while their wives entered a (women's) sister monastery. Required celibacy among the clergy is a relatively recent practice: it became Church policy at the [[Second Lateran Council]] in 1139. It was not uniformly enforced among the clergy until 200 years later.<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, 'Reformation', Penguin Books, 2003, pg 28</ref> Certain Latin-Rite Catholic priests may receive a dispensation to be married before ordination, and all Eastern Catholic priests outside the [[United States]] are also permitted to be married, provided they are so before ordination.

''Vows of chastity'' can also be taken by laypersons, either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic [[Beguines and Beghards]]) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to [[contemplation]]), or both. The voluntary aspect has led it to being included among the [[counsels of perfection]]. Chastity is a central and pivotal concept in Christian [[Christian theological praxis|praxis]]. Chastity's importance in traditional Christian teaching stems from the fact that it is regarded as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being.<ref>Cathechism of the Catholic Church, 1999, Geoffrey Chapman, p.500</ref> It is also regarded as fundamental to the practise of the Christian life because it involves an ''apprenticeship in self-mastery''.<ref>''ibid'' p.501</ref> By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.

== In Eastern religions ==

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism]]'s view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of the stages of [[life]]. The first of these stages, known as ''[[Brahmacharya]],'' roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy is considered the appropriate behavior for both [[male]] and [[female]] [[students]] during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder. Many [[Sadhus]] (Hindu monks) are also celibate as part of their [[asceticism|ascetic]] discipline.

===Jainism===
Although the [[Digambara]] followers of [[Jainism]] are celibate monks, most Jains belong to the [[Shvetambara]] sect, which allows spouses and children. The general Jain code of [[ethics]] requires that one do no harm to any living being in thought, action, or word. Adultery is clearly a violation of a moral agreement with one's spouse, and therefore forbidden, and fornication too is seen as a violation of the state of chastity.

===Buddhism===
The teachings of [[Buddhism]] include the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], comprising a division called [[Noble Eightfold Path#Right action|right action]]. Under the [[Five Precepts]] ethical code, [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā]] lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while [[Bhikkhu]] and [[Bhikkhuni]] monastics should practice strict chastity.

===Daoism===
The [[Five Precepts (Taoism)|Five Precepts]]  of the [[Daoist]] religion include No Sexual Misconduct, which is interpreted as prohibiting extramarital sex for lay practitioners and marriage or sexual intercourse for monks and nuns.
