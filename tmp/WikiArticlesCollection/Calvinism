[[File:ReformationsdenkmalGenf1.jpg|thumb|Reformation wall in [[Geneva]]]]

'''Calvinism''' (also called the '''Reformed tradition''' or the '''Reformed faith''') is a major branch of [[Protestantism]] that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice of [[John Calvin]] and other [[Reformation]]-era theologians.  Calvinists broke with the [[Roman Catholic]] church but differed with [[Lutherans]] on the [[real presence]] of Christ in the [[Lord's supper]], [[regulative principle of worship|theories of worship]], and the [[Law and Gospel#Lutheran and Reformed differences|use of God's law for believers]], among other things.<ref>{{cite book |last= Schaff |first= Philip |title= New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge |chapter= Protestantism |pages= 297–299 |volume= IX |chapter-url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc09.protestantism.html#protestantism-p89.1}}</ref><ref name=muller/>

Calvinism can be a misleading term because the religious tradition it denotes is and has always been diverse, with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder. The movement was first called "Calvinism" by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word ''Reformed''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hägglund|first=Bengt|title=Teologins Historia|language=German|trans_title=History of Theology|others=Translated by Gene J. Lund|edition=Fourth Revised|year=2007|location=Saint Louis|publisher=Concordia Publishing House}}</ref>{{sfn|Muller|2004|p=130}} Since the [[Arminian controversy]], the Reformed (as a branch of [[Protestantism]] distinguished from Lutheranism) are divided into [[Arminians]] and Calvinists, however it is now rare to call Arminians Reformed, as many see these two schools of thought as opposed, making the terms Calvinist and Reformed synonymous.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reformed Churches|work=[[Christian Cyclopedia]]|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=r&word=REFORMEDCHURCHES}}</ref><ref>Gonzalez, Justo L.

While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word ''Calvinism'' is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on [[Christian soteriology|soteriology]] and [[predestination]], which are summarized in part by the [[five points of Calvinism]]. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the [[omnipotence|sovereignty]] or rule of [[God]] in all things – in salvation but also in all of life.

Early influential Reformed theologians include [[John Calvin]], [[Ulrich Zwingli]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Heinrich Bullinger]], [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], [[Theodor Beza]], and [[John Knox]]. In the twentieth century, [[Abraham Kuyper]], [[Herman Bavinck]], [[B. B. Warfield]], [[Karl Barth]], and [[Cornelius Van Til]] were influential, while contemporary Reformed theologians include [[J. I. Packer]], [[R. C. Sproul]], [[David F. Wells]], and [[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]].

The biggest Reformed association is the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]] with more than 80 million members in 211 member denominations around the World.<ref>http://wcrc.ch/theology/</ref><ref>http://wcrc.ch/wcrc-member-churches/</ref> There are more conservative Reformed federations like the [[World Reformed Fellowship]] and the [[International Conference of Reformed Churches]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Calvinism}}

[[File:Geneva Cathedral.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Calvin preached at [[St. Pierre Cathedral]], the main church in Geneva.]]

First-generation Reformed theologians include [[Huldrych Zwingli]] (1484–1531), [[Martin Bucer]] (1491–1551), [[Wolfgang Capito]] (1478–1541), [[John Oecolampadius]] (1482–1531), and [[Guillaume Farel]] (1489–1565). These reformers came from diverse academic backgrounds, but later distinctives of Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially the priority of [[Bible|scripture]] as a source of authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a [[covenantal theology]] of the [[sacraments]] of [[baptism]] and the [[Lord's supper]] as visible signs of the [[covenant of grace]]. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|presence of Christ in the Lord's supper]]. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of [[unconditional election|particular election]] (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for [[salvation]]). [[Martin Luther]] and his successor [[Phillip Melanchthon]] were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of [[justification by faith alone]] was a direct inheritance from Luther.{{sfn|Muller|2004|pp=131-132}}

[[John Calvin]] (1509–64), [[Heinrich Bullinger]] (1504–1575), [[Wolfgang Musculus]] (1497–1563), [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]] (1500-1562), and [[Andreas Hyperius]] (1511–1564) belong to the second generation of Reformed theologians. Calvin's ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (1536–59) was one of the most influential theologies of the era.{{sfn|Muller|2004|p=132}} Toward the middle of the 16th century, the Reformed began to commit their beliefs to [[confessions of faith]], which would shape the future definition of the Reformed faith. The 1549 ''[[Consensus Tigurinus]]'' brought together those who followed Zwingli and Bullinger's [[memorialist]] theology of the Lord's supper, which taught that the supper simply serves as a reminder of Christ's death, and Calvin's view that the supper serves as a [[means of grace]] with Christ actually present, though spiritually rather than bodily. The document demonstrates the diversity as well as unity in early Reformed theology. The remainder of the 16th century saw an explosion of confessional activity. The stability and breadth of Reformed theology during this  period stand in marked contrast to the bitter controversy experienced by Lutherans prior to the 1579 [[Formula of Concord]].{{sfn|Muller|2004|p=135}}

Due to Calvin's missionary work in France, his programme of reform eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was adopted in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] under [[Frederick III, Elector Palatine|Frederick III]], which led to the formulation of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] in 1563. This and the [[Belgic Confession]] were adopted as confessional standards in the [[Synod of Emden|first synod]] of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in 1571. Leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, [[Pietro Martire Vermigli|Peter Martyr]], and [[Jan Laski]]) and Scotland ([[John Knox]]). During the [[English Civil War]], the Calvinistic [[Puritan]]s produced the [[Westminster Confession]], which became the confessional standard for [[Presbyterians]] in the English-speaking world. Having established itself in Europe, the movement continued to spread to other parts of the world including North America, South Africa, and Korea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holder|2004|pp=246–256}}; {{Harvnb|McGrath|1990| pp=198–199}}</ref>

Calvin did not live to see the foundation of his work grow into an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas to break out of their city of origin, to succeed far beyond their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettegree|2004|p=222}}</ref>

=== Spread ===
[[File:Interior of the Oude kerk in Amsterdam (south nave), by Emanuel de Witte.jpg|thumb|Calvinism has been known at times for its simple, unadorned churches and lifestyles, as depicted in this painting by [[Emmanuel de Witte]] c.1661]]
Although much of Calvin's work was in Geneva, his publications spread his ideas of a "correctly" reformed church to many parts of Europe. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in [[Scotland]] (see [[John Knox]]), the [[Netherlands]], with men such as [[William Ames]], [[T. J. Frelinghuysen]] and [[Wilhelmus à Brakel]] and parts of [[Germany]] (especially those adjacent to the Netherlands) with the likes of [[Olevianus]] and his colleague [[Zacharias Ursinus]]. In Hungary and then independent [[Transylvania]] Calvinism was a significant religion. In the 16th century the Reformation gained many supporters especially in Eastern Hungary and Transylvania. In these parts the Reformed nobles protected the faith. Today more than 3,5 million Hungarian Reformed people live worldwide from the Carpathian Basin to Australia. <ref>[http://www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=12216&lg=eng www.reformiert-online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=12216&lg=eng]</ref>It was influential in France, [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]. Calvinism gained some popularity in [[Scandinavia]], especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of [[Lutheranism]] after the [[Synod of Uppsala]] in 1593.<ref>''Renaissance and Reformation'' by William Gilbert, [http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/gilbert/12.html Chapter 12 The Reformation in Germany and Scandinavia]</ref>

Most settlers in the American Mid-Atlantic and [[New England]] were Calvinists, including the English [[Puritan]]s, the French [[Huguenot]] and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam (New York), and the [[Ulster Scots people|Scotch-Irish]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] of the Appalachian back country. Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of [[South Africa]], beginning in the 17th century, who became known as [[Boer]]s or [[Afrikaner Calvinism|Afrikaners]].

[[Sierra Leone]] was largely colonized by Calvinist settlers from [[Nova Scotia]], who were largely [[Black Loyalist]]s, blacks who had fought for the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. [[John Marrant]] had organized a congregation there under the auspices of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion|Huntingdon Connection]]. Some of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century [[missionary|missionaries]]. Especially large are those in [[Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Korea]] and [[Nigeria]]. In [[South Korea]] there are 20,000 [[Presbyterian]] congregations in about 9-10 million church members, scattered in more than 100 Presbyterian denominations. In Korea [[Presbyterianism]] is far the biggest Christian denomination.<ref>[http://www.crcna.org/news-and-views/touched-devotion-south-korea www.crcna.org/news-and-views/touched-devotion-south-korea]</ref>

A 2011 report of the [[Pew Forum]] on Religious and Public Life estimated that members of Presbyterian or Reformed churches make up 7% of the 801 million Protestants globally, or approximately 56 million people.<ref name="Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life 21, 70">{{citation|author=[[Pew Research Center]]'s Forum on Religion and Public Life|date=December 19, 2011|url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Christian/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf|title=Global Christianity|pages=21, 70.}}</ref> Today, the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], which includes some [[United Churches]], has 80 million believers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcrc.ch/node/260|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110707005807/http://www.wcrc.ch/node/260|archivedate=2011-07-07|title=WCRC History|accessdate=7 July 2011|work=World Communion of Reformed Churches |quote= The World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) and the Reformed Ecumenical Council (REC) have merged to form a new body representing more than 80 million Reformed Christians worldwide.}}</ref>

== Theology ==

=== Scripture ===
{{main|Sola scriptura}}

[[Image:GenevaBible.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Geneva Bible]] was popular among early Calvinists, especially [[Puritans]]]]

Calvinists believe that the [[Bible]] (not including the [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonicals]]) is the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]], and contains all the [[revelation]]s of God which he designed to be a rule of faith and practice for his [[Christian Church|Church]]. The Calvinist doctrine of perspicuity teaches that everything necessary for salvation is taught in the Scriptures plainly enough that special training is not required for interpretation. Church officers are given the authority to preach what is contained within the Scriptures, but this does not permit them to bind Christians to their own interpretation. Christians are to compare interpretations with one another, and even give deference to other Christians and especially the officers ordained above them, but they are always free to personally interpret Scripture.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodge|first=Charles|title=Systematic Theology|year=1940|publisher=WM. B. EERDMANS PUBLISHING CO|pages=151–185|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology1.iii.vi.i.html|volume=1}}</ref>

==== Law and Gospel ====
{{main|Law and Gospel}}

Following [[Lutheran theologians]], the Reformed sharply contrast the [[law and gospel]] as "the chief and general divisions of the holy scriptures." The law contains the moral requirements of God, and is equated with the [[Ten commandments|decalogue]], while the [[Good news (Christianity)|gospel]] is the [[free offer]] of [[forgiveness of sin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ursinus|first=Zacharias|title=The commentary of Dr. Zacharias Ursinus on the Heidelberg catechism|year=1888|publisher=Elm Street Printing Co|page=2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hNpDAAAAYAAJ&pg=pa2|edition=4th}}</ref> As one author nicely put it, being under Law amounts to approaching God through Mount Sinai, whereas being under grace amounts to approaching God through Mount Calvary. (John 1:17) While there may be subtle differences between the Reformed and Lutheran presentations of this doctrine, it has a prominent place in Reformed theology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Michael|title=The Distinction between Law and Gospel in Reformed Faith and Practice|volume=19|issue=5|pages=12–14|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&var1=ArtRead&var2=1164&var3=main|work=Modern Reformation|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2010}}</ref>

The law is given three uses: the political or civil use which is a restraint on sin and stands apart from the work of salvation, the elenctical or pedagogical use which confronts sin and points one to Christ for forgiveness of sin, and the didactic use which teaches believers the way of righteousness, but does not have any power to condemn.<ref name=muller>{{cite book|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|title=Dictionary of Latin and Greek Theological Terms: Drawn Principally from Protestant Scholastic Theology|year=2006|publisher=Baker Book House|isbn=978-0801020643|pages=320–321|edition=1st}}</ref> Lutheran and Reformed theologians differed primarily on the way in which the third use functions for believers. The Reformed emphasized the third use (''tertius usus legis'') because the redeemed are expected to bear [[good works]]. Some Lutherans saw here the danger of works-righteousness, and argued that the third use should always return believers to the second use and again to Christ rather than being the ultimate norm.<ref name=muller />

==== Covenant theology ====
{{Main|Covenant theology}}

Although the doctrines of grace have generally received the greater focus in contemporary Calvinism, covenant theology is the historic superstructure that unifies the entire system of doctrine.<ref>{{cite book |author = [[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] |title=God of Promise, Introducing Covenant Theology |year=2006 |isbn=0-8010-1289-9 |publisher = Baker Books |location = Grand Rapids, Mich.}}</ref>

Calvinists take God's [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] to mean that the relationship between God and his creation must be by voluntary condescension on God's part. This relationship he establishes is [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]]al: the terms of the relationship are unchangeably decreed by God alone.{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER VII Of God's Covenant with Man.|VII.I]]}}

Reformed writings commonly refer to an intra-[[Trinity|Trinitarian]] covenant of redemption. The greater focus is the relationship between God and man, which in historic Calvinism is seen as bi-covenantal, reflecting the early [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] distinction between [[Law and Gospel]]. The covenant of works encompasses the moral and [[natural law]], dictating the terms of creation. By its terms, man would enjoy eternal life and blessedness based on his continued personal and perfect righteousness. With the [[fall of man]], this covenant continues to operate, but only to condemn sinful man.{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XIX. Of the Law of God.|XIX.I,II]]}} The covenant of grace is instituted at the fall, and administered through successive historic [[covenant theology#Biblical covenants|covenants]] seen in Scripture for the purpose of redemption. By its terms, salvation comes not by any personal performance, but by promise. Peace with God comes only through a mediator, the fulfillment of which is found in the person and work of [[Jesus Christ]]. Christ is seen as the [[federal head]] of his elect people, and thus the covenant is the basis of the doctrines of the [[substitutionary atonement]] and the [[imputed righteousness|imputation]] of the [[active obedience]] of Christ.{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER VII Of God's Covenant with Man.|VII.III]]}}{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XIII. Of Sanctification.|XIII]]}}

=== Salvation ===

==== Sovereign grace ====

Calvinism teaches that people are [[total depravity|totally depraved]] or totally inadequate in their ethical nature, necessitating the sovereign [[Divine grace|grace]] of God for [[salvation]]. It states that [[Fall of Man|fallen]] people are morally and spiritually incapable of following God or redeeming themselves.<ref>{{cite book |last= Calvin |first= John |title= Commentaries to the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians |others= Translated by Rev. William Pringle. |chapter= Ephesians Ch 2:1. |chapter-url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom41.iii.iv.i.html}}</ref> They see redemption as the work of God; God changes their unwilling [[heart (Symbolism and Metaphor)|hearts]] from rebellion to eager obedience.

In this view, people are at the complete and total mercy of God, who would be just in condemning all people for their [[sin]]s, though God has chosen to show mercy to some, not all. (That God saves some but not all, is agreed upon by Arminians, too.  Only Universalists would dispute that.  The debate amongst Arminians and Calvinists here does not revolve around the [limited] ''number'' of men saved, but rather the ''reason'' why some are saved while others are not.) Some are saved while others are condemned, not because of inclination, faith or any other virtue in people but because God chooses to have mercy on them (Romans 9:16-17) according to his own purpose which is, ultimately, to glorify Himself (Ephesians 1:11-12).<ref>{{cite book |last=Calvin |first= John |title=Commentaries on the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans |others= Translated by John Owen |chapter= Ch 9:10–13 |chapter-url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom38.xiii.iii.html}}</ref> A person must believe the gospel and repent to be saved, but this compliance of faith is a gift from God (Philippians 1:29; Ephesians 2:8), and thus God completely and sovereignly achieves the salvation of sinners, including the chief (1 Timothy 1:15). In other words, faith is a fruit of regeneration, not the cause of it.  God saves sinners ''so that'' they will believe, not ''because'' they believe out of their own resources.  Many Reformed theologians teach that people are predestinated to [[damnation]] (as the doctrine of [[reprobation]]). There is less agreement among the Reformed regarding reprobation than predestination to salvation (the doctrine of election).

In practice, Calvinists teach sovereign grace mostly for encouragement of the church because Calvinists believe the doctrine validates the extent of God's love for saving those who are not able to follow him, or choose not to do so, as well as defeating pride and self-reliance and stressing Christians' total need for and dependence on the grace of God. In a similar way, [[sanctification]] in the Calvinist view involves a frequent dependence on God to gain victory over sin, and experience the joy of the Lord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernreformation.org/default.php?page=articledisplay&var1=ArtRead&var2=270&var3=authorbio&var4=AutRes&var5=42|title=Gospel-Driven Sanctification|author=Bridges, Jerry|accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

Most objections to and attacks on Calvinism focus on the "five points of Calvinism," also called the doctrines of grace, and remembered by the [[mnemonic]] "TULIP."<ref>{{citation|last=Horton|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Horton (theologian)|title=For Calvinism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ezoDtwAACAAJ|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=18 October 2011|publisher=[[Zondervan|Zondervan Books]]|isbn=978-0-310-32465-2|page=15}}</ref> The five points are popularly said to summarize the [[Canons of Dort]],<ref>{{Citation|last = Sproul|first = R C|authorlink = R.

Steele and Curtis C. Thomas.

The central assertion of these points is that God saves every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.

* "[[Total depravity]]," also called "total inability," asserts that as a consequence of the [[Fall of Man|fall of man into sin]], every person is enslaved to sin. People are not by nature inclined to love God but rather to serve their own interests and to reject the rule of God. Thus, all people by their own faculties are morally unable to choose to follow God and be saved because they are unwilling to do so out of the necessity of their own natures. (The term "total" in this context refers to sin affecting every part of a person, not that every person is as evil as they could be).<ref>{{cite book|first1=David|last1=Steele|first2=Curtis|last2=Thomas|title=The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented|page=25|quote=The adjective 'total' does not mean that each sinner is as totally or completely corrupt in his actions and thoughts as it is possible for him to be.

ISBN 9780192802903.</ref> While the phrases "totally depraved" and "utterly perverse" were used by Calvin, what was meant was the inability to save oneself from sin rather than being absent of goodness. Phrases like "total depravity" cannot be found in the Canons of Dort, and the Canons as well as later Reformed orthodox theologians arguably offer a more moderate view of the nature of fallen humanity than Calvin.<ref>{{cite book|title=Calvin and the Reformed Tradition|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2012|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|chapter=Was Calvin a Calvinist?|page=51|edition=Ebook|authorlink=Richard A. Muller (theologian)|isbn=978-1-4412-4254-9}}</ref>

* "[[Unconditional election]]" asserts that God has chosen from eternity those whom he will bring to himself not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in those people; rather, his choice is unconditionally grounded in his mercy alone. God has chosen from eternity to extend mercy to those he has chosen and to withhold mercy from those not chosen. Those chosen receive salvation through Christ alone. Those not chosen receive the just wrath that is warranted for their sins against God.{{sfn |WCF|1646}}

* "[[Limited atonement]]," also called "particular redemption" or "definite atonement", asserts that Jesus's [[substitutionary atonement]] was definite and certain in its purpose and in what it accomplished. This implies that only the sins of the elect were [[penal substitution|atoned]] for by Jesus's death. Calvinists do not believe, however, that the atonement is limited in its value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is intended for some and not all. Some Calvinists have quipped, "The atonement is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect,"<ref>[http://www.calvinistcorner.com/tulip.htm The Five Points of Calvinism]. The Calvinist Corner. Retrieved 2011-11-12.</ref> while other Calvinists find such wording confusing rather than helpful.{{Who|date=November 2013}}  All Calvinists would affirm that the blood of Christ was sufficient to pay for every single human being ''IF'' it were God's intention to save every single human being.  But Calvinists are also quick to point out that Jesus did not spill a drop of blood in vain (Galatians 2:21), and therefore, we can only be sure that His blood sufficed for those for whom it was intended, however many (Matthew 26:28) or few (Matthew 7:14) that may be.  Some Calvinists also teach that the atonement accomplished certain benefits for all mankind, albeit, not their eternal salvation.<ref>See John Gill's commentary on 1 Timothy 4:10.</ref>  The doctrine is driven by the Calvinistic concept of the sovereignty of God in salvation and their understanding of the nature of the atonement.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} At the Synod of Dort, both sides agreed that the atonement of Christ's death was sufficient to pay for all sin and that it was only efficacious for some (it only actually saved some). The controversy centered on whether this limited efficacy was based on God's election (the view of the Synod and of later Reformed theologians) or on the choice of each person and God's foreknowledge of that choice (the view of Arminius).<ref>{{cite book|title=Calvin and the Reformed Tradition|last=Muller|first=Richard A.|year=2012|location=Grand Rapids, MI|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|pages=51–52|edition=Ebook|authorlink=Richard A. Muller (theologian)|isbn=978-1-4412-4254-9}}</ref>

* "[[Irresistible grace]]," also called "efficacious grace", asserts that the saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has determined to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to a saving faith.  This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual certainly will be saved.  The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's [[Holy Spirit]] cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, "graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ."<ref>[http://www.the-highway.com/compare.html Comparison of Calvinism and Arminianism]. The-highway.com. Retrieved 2011-11-12.</ref>{{verify credibility|failed=y|date=January 2013}}  This is not to deny the fact that the Spirit’s outward call (through the proclamation of the Gospel) can be, and often is, rejected by sinners; rather, it’s that inward call which cannot be rejected.  In fact, every saved person can testify how, at some point in their life, they “felt overwhelmingly compelled” to believe on Christ, as if they “had no choice but to follow Him.”  This is what is meant by the effectual calling of God.

* "[[Perseverance of the saints]]" (or perseverance of God with the saints) (the word "saints" is used to refer to all who are set apart by God, and not of those who are exceptionally [[holy]], [[Canonization|canonized]], or in heaven) asserts that since God is sovereign and his will cannot be frustrated by humans or anything else, those whom God has called into communion with himself will continue in faith until the end. Those who apparently fall away either never had true faith to begin with (1 John 2:19), or, if they are saved but not presently walking in the Spirit, they will be divinely chastened (Hebrews 12:5-11) and will repent (1 John 3:6-9).<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/boettner/predest.iv.vi.html |chapter=The Perseverance of the Saints |title=The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination |author=[[Loraine Boettner]] |accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>

An additional point of disagreement with Arminianism implicit in the five points is the Calvinist understanding of the doctrine of Jesus's [[substitutionary atonement]] as a punishment for the sins of the elect, which was developed by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and especially [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]] and Calvin himself. Calvinists argue that if Christ takes the punishment in the place of a particular sinner, that person must be saved since it would be unjust for him then to be condemned for the same sins.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calvin |first=John |title=Institutes of the Christian Religion |at=Book 2 Ch 16 |year=1536 |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.xvii.html |accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> The definitive and binding nature of this [[Atonement (Satisfaction view)|satisfaction model]] has strong implications for each of the five TULIP points, and it has led some Arminians to subscribe instead to the [[governmental theory of atonement]]. Under that theory, no particular sins or sinners are in view, but all of humanity are included in those whose sins have been taken away. The atonement was not the penalty of the law, but a substitute for the penalty, which allows God to remit the penalty by his grace when any sinner repents and believes in Jesus as the Christ.<ref>{{Bibleref2|John|3:16}}</ref>

[[Image:Bay1640.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bay Psalm Book]] was used by [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]]]

The regulative principle of worship is a teaching shared by some Calvinists and Anabaptists on how the Bible orders public worship. The substance of the doctrine regarding worship is that God institutes in the Scriptures everything he requires for worship in the Church and that everything else is prohibited. As the regulative principle is reflected in Calvin's own thought, it is driven by his evident antipathy toward the Roman Catholic Church and its worship practices, and it associates musical instruments with [[icon]]s, which he considered violations of the [[Ten Commandments]]' prohibition of graven images.<ref name="Barber">{{cite journal |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/joh_barber/PT.joh_barber.Luther.Calvin.Music.Worship.html |journal=Reformed Perspectives Magazine |volume=8 |issue=26 |date=25 June 2006 |title=Luther and Calvin on Music and Worship |author=John Barber |accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>

On this basis, many early Calvinists also eschewed musical instruments and advocated [[a capella]] [[exclusive psalmody]] in worship,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm |accessdate=2007-11-16 |year=1998 |title= Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God |author=Brian Schwertley}}</ref> though Calvin himself allowed other scriptural songs as well as psalms,<ref name="Barber" /> and this practice typified [[presbyterian worship]] and the worship of other Reformed churches for some time.  The original Lord's Day service designed by John Calvin was a highly liturgical service with the Creed, Alms, Confession and Absolution, the Lord's supper, Doxologies, prayers, Psalms being sung, the Lords prayer being sung, Benedictions.<ref>{{cite book |first= William D. |last= Maxwell |title= An Outline of Christian Worship: Its Development and Forms |location= London |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1936}}</ref>

Since the 19th century, however, some of the Reformed churches have modified their understanding of the regulative principle and make use of musical instruments, believing that Calvin and his early followers went beyond the biblical requirements<ref name="Barber" /> and that such things are circumstances of worship requiring biblically-rooted wisdom, rather than an explicit command. Despite the protestations of those who hold to a strict view of the regulative principle, today [[hymn]]s and musical instruments are in common use, as are [[contemporary worship music]] styles and [[worship band]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author=John Frame |title=Worship in Spirit and Truth |year=1996 |isbn=0-87552-242-4 |publisher=P&R Pub. |location=Phillipsburg, N.J.}}</ref>

=== Sacraments ===
{{see also|Sacraments#Reformed teaching|l1=Reformed teaching on sacraments}}

The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] limits the sacraments to baptism and the Lord's Supper. Sacraments are denoted "signs and seals of the covenant of grace."{{sfn|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XVIII. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation.|XXVII.I]]}} Westminster speaks of "a sacramental relation, or a sacramental union, between the sign and the thing signified; whence it comes to pass that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other."{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XXVII. Of the Sacraments.|XXVII.II]]}} Baptism is for infant children of believers as well as believers, as it is for all the Reformed except  [[Baptists]] and some [[Congregationalists]]. Baptism admits the baptized into the [[visible church]], and in it all the benefits of Christ are offered to the baptized.{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XXVII. Of the Sacraments.|XXVII.II]]}} On the Lord's supper Westminster, takes a position between Lutheran sacramental union and Zwinglian memorialism: "the Lord's supper really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death: the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the bread and wine; yet, as really, but spiritually, present to the faith of believers in that ordinance as the elements themselves are to their outward senses."{{sfn|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XVIII. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation.|XXVII.I]]}}

The [[1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith]] does not use the term sacrament, but describes baptism and the Lord's supper as ordinances, as do most Baptists Calvinist or otherwise. Baptism is only for those who "actually profess repentance towards God," and not for the children of believers.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|anchor=Chapter 28: Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper|at=Ch. 28 Sec. 2}}</ref> Baptists also insist on immersion or dipping, in contradistinction to other Reformed Christians.<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|anchor=#Chapter 28: Of Baptism and the Lord's Supper |at= Ch. 28 Sec. 4}}</ref> The Baptist Confession, describes the Lord's supper as "the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance," similarly to the Westminster Confession.{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER XXIX. Of the Lord's Supper.|XXIX.VII]]}} There is significant latitude in Baptist congregations regarding the Lord's supper, and many hold the Zwinglian view.

=== Logical order of God's decree ===
{{Main|Logical order of God's decree}}

There are two schools of regarding the logical order of God's decree to ordain the fall of man: [[supralapsarianism]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''supra'', "above", here meaning "before" + ''lapsus'', "fall") and [[infralapsarianism]] (from the Latin: ''infra'', "beneath", here meaning "after" + ''lapsus'', "fall"). The former view, sometimes called "high Calvinism", argues that the Fall occurred partly to facilitate God's purpose to choose some individuals for salvation and some for damnation. Infralapsarianism, sometimes called "low Calvinism", is the position that, while the Fall was indeed planned, it was not planned with reference to who would be saved.

Supralapsarians believe that God chose which individuals to save logically prior to the decision to allow the race to fall and that the Fall serves as the means of realization of that prior decision to send some individuals to hell and others to heaven (that is, it provides the grounds of condemnation in the reprobate and the need for salvation in the elect). In contrast, infralapsarians hold that God planned the race to fall logically prior to the decision to save or damn any individuals because, it is argued, in order to be "saved", one must first need to be saved from something and therefore the decree of the Fall must precede predestination to salvation or damnation.

These two views vied with each other at the Synod of Dort, an international body representing Calvinist Christian churches from around Europe, and the judgments that came out of that council sided with infralapsarianism (Canons of Dort, First Point of Doctrine, Article 7). The Westminster Confession of Faith also teaches (in Hodge's words "clearly impl[ies]") the infralapsarian<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.ii.html|title=Systematic Theology – Volume II – Supralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> view, but is sensitive to those holding to supralapsarianism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.iii.html|title=Systematic Theology – Volume II – Infralapsarianism|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library|author=Hodge, Charles|year=1871|accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> The Lapsarian controversy has a few vocal proponents on each side today, but overall it does not receive much attention among modern Calvinists.

== Variants ==

=== Amyraldism ===
{{Main|Amyraldism}}

Amyraldism (or sometimes Amyraldianism, also known as the School of Saumur, hypothetical universalism,<ref>[[Charles Hodge]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.i.iv.html ''Systematic Theology'', II, pp. 321-324].</ref> post redemptionism,<ref>[[B. B. Warfield|Benjamin B. Warfield]], ''Works'' vol. V,''Calvin and Calvinism'', pp. 364-365, and vol. VI, ''The Westminster Assembly and Its Work'', pp. 138-144.</ref> moderate Calvinism,<ref>[[Michael Horton (theologian)|Michael Horton]] in J. Matthew Pinson (ed.), ''Four Views on Eternal Security'', 113.</ref> or four-point Calvinism) is the belief that [[God]], prior to his decree of election, decreed [[Atonement in Christianity|Christ's atonement]] for all alike if they believe, but seeing that none would believe on their own, he then [[predestination|elected]] those whom he will bring to [[Faith in Christianity|faith in Christ]], thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of [[unconditional election]]. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe.

Named after its formulator [[Moses Amyraut]], this doctrine is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement. However, detractors like [[B. B. Warfield]] have termed it "an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism."<ref>[[B. B. Warfield|Warfield, B. B.]], ''The Plan of Salvation'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1973)</ref>

=== Hyper-Calvinism ===
{{Main|Hyper-Calvinism}}

Hyper-Calvinism first referred to a view that appeared among the early English [[Strict Baptist|Particular Baptists]] in the 18th century. Their system denied that the call of the gospel to "[[repentance|repent]] and believe" is directed to every single person and that it is the duty of every person to trust in Christ for salvation. The term also occasionally appears in both [[theological]] and secular controversial contexts, where it usually connotes a negative opinion about some variety of [[theological determinism]], [[predestination]], or a version of Evangelical Christianity or Calvinism that is deemed by the critic to be unenlightened, harsh, or extreme.

The Westminster Confession of Faith says that the gospel is to be freely offered to sinners, and the Larger Catechism makes clear that the gospel is offered to the non-elect.{{sfn |WCF|1646|loc=[[s:Westminster Confession of Faith#CHAPTER VII Of God's Covenant with Man.|VII.III]]}}<ref>{{cite wikisource |title=Westminster Larger Catechism|anchor=Q. 51-100|at=Question 68}}</ref>

=== Neo-Calvinism ===
{{Main|Neo-Calvinism}}

Neo-Calvinism, a form of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Calvinism, is the movement initiated by the theologian and former Dutch prime minister [[Abraham Kuyper]]. [[James Bratt]] has identified a number of different types of Dutch Calvinism: The Seceders&mdash;split into the Reformed Church "West" and the Confessionalists; and the Neo-Calvinists&mdash;the Positives and the Antithetical Calvinists. The Seceders were largely infralapsarian and the Neo-Calvinists usually supralapsarian.<ref>James Bratt, ''Dutch Calvinism in Modern America.'' Wipf and Stock; original Eerdmans (1984)</ref>

Kuyper wanted to awaken the church from what he viewed as its pietistic slumber. He declared:

<blockquote>No single piece of our mental world is to be sealed off from the rest and there is not a square inch in the whole domain of human existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry: 'Mine!'<ref>James E. McGoldrick, ''Abraham Kuyper: God's Renaissance Man.'' (Welwyn, UK: Evangelical Press, 2000).</ref> </blockquote>

This refrain has become something of a rallying call for Neo-Calvinists.

== Social and economic influences ==

=== Usury and capitalism ===

One school of thought attributes Calvinism with setting the stage for the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of [[usury]] and, implicitly, of profit in general.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Such a connection was advanced in influential works by [[R. H. Tawney]] (1880–1962) and by [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

Calvin expressed himself on usury in a 1545 letter to a friend, Claude de Sachin, in which he criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of [[Aristotle]]) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.<ref>The letter is quoted in {{cite book | last = Le Van Baumer | first = Franklin, editor | title = Main Currents of Western Thought: Readings in Western Europe Intellectual History from the Middle Ages to the Present | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-300-02233-6 }}</ref>

He qualified his view, however, by saying that money should be lent to people in dire need without hope of interest, while a modest interest rate of 5% should be permitted in relation to other borrowers.<ref>See {{cite book | last = Haas | first = Guenther H. | title = The Concept of Equity in Calvin's Ethics | publisher = [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]] | location = Waterloo, Ont., Canada | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-88920-285-0 | pages = 117ff }}</ref>

==Politics and society==
Calvin's concept of God and man contained strong elements of freedom that were gradually put into practice after his death, in particular in the fields of politics and society. 
After the successful fight for independence from Spain (1579), the [[Netherlands]], under Calvinist leadership, became, besides England, the freest country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, e.g. French [[Huguenots]], English [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] ([[Congregationalists]]), and [[Jews]] from Spain and Portugal. The ancestors of philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] were Portuguese Jews. Aware of the trial against [[Galileo]], [[René Descartes]] lived in the Netherlands, out of reach of the [[Inquisition]].<ref>Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, ''Descartes, René'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band II, col. 88</ref> [[Pierre Bayle]], a Reformed Frenchman, also felt safer in the Netherlands than in his home country. He was the first prominent philosopher who demanded tolerance for atheists. [[Hugo Grotius]] was able to publish a rather liberal interpretation of the Bible and his ideas about [[natural law]].<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), p. 396-397</ref><ref>H. Knittermeyer, ''Bayle, Pierre'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band I, col. 947</ref> Moreover, the Calvinist Dutch authorities allowed the printing of books that could not be published elsewhere, e.g. Galileo’s ''Discorsi''.<ref>[[Bertolt Brecht]], ''Leben des Galilei'', Bild 15</ref>

Even more important than the liberal development of the Netherlands was the rise of modern [[democracy]] in England and North America. In the Middle Ages state and church had been closely connected. [[Martin Luther]]’s [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]] separated state and church in principle.<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI, col. 941</ref> His doctrine of the [[priesthood of all believers]] raised the laity to the same level as the clergy.<ref>B. Lohse, ''Priestertum'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 579-580</ref> Going one step further, Calvin included elected laymen ([[church elder]]s, [[presbyters]]) in his concept of [[church government]]. The Huguenots added [[synod]]s whose members were also elected by the congregations. The other Reformed churches took over this system of church self-government which was essentially a representative democracy.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', p. 325</ref> [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Methodists]] are organized in a similar way. These denominations and the [[Anglican Church]] were influenced by Calvin’s theology in varying degrees.<ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', pp. 329-330, 382, 422-424</ref>

Another precondition for the rise of democracy in the Anglo-American world was the fact that Calvin favored a mixture of democracy and aristocracy as the best form of government([[mixed government]]). He appreciated the advantages of democracy.<ref>Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3. Auflage (1958), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> The aim of his political thought was to safeguard the rights and freedoms of ordinary men and women. In order to minimize the misuse of political power he suggested dividing it among several institutions in a system of checks and balances ([[separation of powers]]). Finally, Calvin taught that if worldly rulers rise up against God they should be put down. In this way, he and his followers stood in the vanguard of resistance to political [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and furthered the cause of democracy.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 10</ref> The [[Congregationalists]] who founded [[Plymouth Colony]] (1620) and [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] (1628) were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.<ref>M.

Gaustad (1999), ''Liberty of Conscience: Roger Williams in America'', Judson Press, Valley Forge</ref>

In England, Baptists [[Thomas Helwys]] and [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] influenced the liberal political thought of Presbyterian poet and politician [[John Milton]] and philosopher [[John Locke]], who in turn had both a strong impact on the political development in their home country ([[English Civil War]], [[Glorious Revolution]]) as well as in North America.<ref>G. Müller-Schwefe, ''Milton, John'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band IV, col. 954-955</ref><ref>Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', p. 398</ref> The ideological basis of the [[American Revolution]] was largely provided by the radical [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who had been inspired by Milton, Locke, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Algernon Sidney]], and other thinkers. The Whigs’ "perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestantism that had always verged on [[Puritanism]]."<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789'', Revised and Enlarged Edition, Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y., ISBN 978-0-19-531588-2, pp. 52, 136</ref> The [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution]] and (American) [[Bill of Rights]] initiated a tradition of human and civil rights that was continued in the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] and the constitutions of numerous countries around the world, e. g. [[Latin America]], [[Japan]], [[Germany]], and other European countries. It is also echoed in the [[United Nations Charter]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>Douglas K. Stevenson (1987), ''American Life and Institutions'', Stuttgart (Germany), p. 34</ref>

In the nineteenth century, the churches that were based on Calvin’s theology or influenced by it were deeply involved in social reforms, e.g. the [[abolition of slavery]] ([[William Wilberforce]], [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and others), [[women suffrage]], and [[prison reform]]s.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 353-375</ref><ref>M. Schmidt, ''Kongregationalismus'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band III, col. 1769-1771</ref> Members of these churches formed [[co-operatives]] to help the impoverished masses.<ref>Wilhelm Dietrich, ''Genossenschaften'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', 3.

Auflage, col. 407-408</ref><ref>R. Pfister, ''Schweiz'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 1614-1615</ref>

Throughout the world, the Reformed churches operate hospitals, homes for handicapped or elderly people, and educational institutions on all levels. For example, American Congregationalists founded [[Harvard]] (1636), [[Yale]] (1701), and about a dozen other colleges.<ref>Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', pp. 80, 89, 257</ref> [[Princeton University|Princeton]] was a Presbyterian foundation.
