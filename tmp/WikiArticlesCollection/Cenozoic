The '''Cenozoic''' [[Era (geology)|Era]] ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|ɛ|n|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|.|ɨ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|n|ə|ˈ|z|oʊ|.|ɨ|k}}; also '''Cænozoic''', '''Caenozoic''' or '''Cainozoic'''; meaning "new life", from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|καινός}} ''kainos'' "new", and {{lang|grc|ζωή}} ''zoe'' "life"<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=Cenozoic|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Cenozoic&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref>) is the current and most recent of the three [[Phanerozoic]] [[geological era]]s, following the [[Mesozoic Era]] and covering the period from {{ma|Cenozoic|million years ago}} to the present. 

The era began in the wake of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] (K-Pg event) at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] that saw the demise of the last non-avian [[dinosaur]]s (as well as many other terrestrial and marine flora and fauna) at the end of the Mesozoic. The Cenozoic is also known as the '''Age of Mammals''', because the extinction of many groups allowed mammals to greatly diversify. 

Early in the Cenozoic, following the K-Pg event, the planet was dominated by relatively small fauna, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the large reptiles that had dominated during the Mesozoic. Some birds grew larger than the average human. This group became known as the "[[terror bird]]s," and were formidable predators. Mammals came to occupy almost every available [[ecological niche|niche]] (both marine and terrestrial), and some also grew very large, attaining sizes not seen in most of today's mammals. 

Climate-wise, the Earth had begun a drying and cooling trend, culminating in the [[Quaternary glaciation|glaciations]] of the [[Pleistocene Epoch]], and partially offset by the [[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]]. The continents also began looking roughly familiar at this time and moved into their current positions.

==Subdivisions==
The Cenozoic is divided into three periods: The [[Paleogene]], [[Neogene]], and [[Quaternary]]; and seven epochs: The [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], [[Oligocene]], [[Miocene]], [[Pliocene]], [[Pleistocene]], and [[Holocene]]. The Quaternary Period was officially recognized by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] in June 2009,<ref name=Gibbard>{{cite doi|10.1002/jqs.1338}}</ref> and the former [[Tertiary Period]] was officially disused in 2004.<ref name="International Stratigraphic Chart">[http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2009.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart]</ref> The common use of epochs during the Cenozoic helps [[paleontologist]]s better organize and group the many significant events that occurred during this comparatively short interval of time. There is also more detailed knowledge of this era than any other because of the relatively young strata associated with it.

==Tectonics==
[[Geology|Geologically]], the Cenozoic is the era when the [[continent]]s moved into their current positions. [[Australia (continent)|Australia-New Guinea]], having split from [[Pangea]] during the early Cretaceous, drifted north and, eventually, collided with [[South-east Asia]]; [[Antarctica]] moved into its current position over the [[South Pole]]; the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened and, later in the era, [[South America]] became attached to [[North America]].

India collided with Asia {{Ma|55|45}}; Arabia collided with Eurasia, closing the [[Tethys ocean]], around {{Ma|35}}.<ref name=Allen2008>{{cite doi|10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.04.021 }}</ref>

==Climate==
The [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] of {{Ma|55.8}} was a significant global warming event.  However, since the [[Azolla event]] of {{Ma|49}}, the Cenozoic Era has been a period of long-term cooling. After the tectonic creation of [[Drake Passage]], when South America fully detached from Antarctica during the [[Oligocene]], the climate cooled significantly due to the advent of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] which brought cool deep Antarctic water to the surface. The cooling trend continued in the [[Miocene]], with relatively short warmer periods. When South America became attached to North America creating the [[Isthmus of Panama]], the Arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]] and [[Gulf Stream]] currents,<ref>http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508</ref> eventually leading to the glaciations of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary ice age]], the current [[interglacial]] of which is the [[Holocene]] Epoch.

==Life==
During the Cenozoic, [[Mammal evolution#Expansion of ecological niches in the Mesozoic|mammals proliferated]] from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[Marine mammal|marine]], and [[bat|flying]] animals, giving this period its other name, the Age of Mammals, despite the fact that [[bird]]s still outnumbered mammals two to one.  The Cenozoic is just as much the age of [[savanna]]s, the age of co-dependent [[flowering plant]]s and [[insect]]s, and the age of birds. [[Grass]] also played a very important role in this era, shaping the evolution of the birds and mammals that fed on it. One group that diversified significantly in the Cenozoic as well were the [[snake]]s. Evolving in the Cenozoic, the variety of snakes increased tremendously, resulting in many [[colubrids]], following the evolution of their current primary prey source, the [[rodent]]s.

In the earlier part of the Cenozoic, the world was dominated by the [[Gastornithiformes|gastornid]] birds, terrestrial [[Crocodilia|crocodile]]s like ''[[Pristichampsus]]'', and a handful of primitive large mammal groups like [[uintathere]]s, [[mesonychid]]s, and [[pantodont]]s. But as the forests began to recede and the climate began to cool, other mammals took over. The Cenozoic is full of mammals both strange and familiar, including [[chalicothere]]s, [[creodont]]s, [[whale]]s, [[primates]], [[entelodont]]s, [[saber-toothed cats]], [[mastodon]]s and [[mammoth]]s, [[three-toed horse]]s, giant [[rhinoceros]] like ''[[Indricotherium]]'', and [[brontothere]]s.
