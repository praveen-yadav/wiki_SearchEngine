The '''economy of [[Costa Rica]]''' is very stable, and depends essentially on [[tourism]], [[agriculture]], and [[electronics]] exports. 

According to a study conducted by ADEN Business School (which included 18 other countries in the region), Costa Rica is the fourth most competitive country in Latin America in 2012 and is part of a bloc of countries rated as having a "very good competitive level, with advances and developments in infrastructure, technology and [[macroeconomic]] stability".<ref name="ADEN Business School Study">[http://www.camtic.org/actualidad-tic/costa-rica-ocupa-el-cuarto-lugar-en-ranking-de-competitividad-latinoamericano/], Spanish.</ref> The nation scored a 71,8 out of 100 on a study which measured competitiveness based on 10 criteria. Compared to the 2011 rank, Costa Rica went up by one position (form 5<sup>th</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup>).<ref name="ADEN Business School Study" />

The [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html CIA World Factbook] states that Costa Rica's GDP per capita is [[United States dollar|US$]]11,900 (2011 est.); however, poverty has remained around 15-20% for nearly 20 years, and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures.

It also states that foreign investors remain attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high education levels, as well as the incentives offered in the free-trade zones. According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America. However, many business impediments remain such as high levels of bureaucracy, legal uncertainty due to overlapping and at times conflicting responsibilities between agencies, difficulty of enforcing contracts, and weak investor protection.

Inflation rose to 22.5% in 1995, dropped to 11.1% in 1997, 12% in 1998, 11% in 1999 and 13% in 2008. Measures taken by the Central Bank have reduced inflation substantially to 4.3% in 2009, and a projected 5.8% for 2010. Curbing [[inflation]], reducing the deficit, and improving public sector efficiency through an anti-corruption drive, remain key challenges to the government. Previous political resistance to [[privatization]] had stalled liberalization efforts. However, after the signing of [[CAFTA]], Costa Rica is now opened to competition in its insurance and telecommunications markets.

Costa Rica's economy emerged from recession in 1997 and has shown strong aggregate growth since then. After 6.2% growth in 1997, GDP grew a substantial 8.3% in 1999, led by exports.

The strength in the nontraditional export and tourism sector is masking a relatively lackluster performance by traditional sectors, including agriculture. The central government deficit decreased to 3.2% of GDP in 1999, down from 3.3% from the year before. On a consolidated basis, including Central Bank losses and parastatal enterprise profits, the public sector deficit was 2.3% of GDP.

Controlling the budget deficit remains the single biggest challenge for the country's economic policy makers, as interest costs on the accumulated central government debt consumes the equivalent of 30% of the government's total revenues. This limits the resources available for investments in the country's deteriorated public infrastructure, investments in many cases that would result in higher quality infrastructure if they were better planned.

==Natural resources==
{{See also|Ecotourism in Costa Rica}}
Costa Rica's rainfall, its well-educated population, and its location in the Central American isthmus, which provides easy access to North and South American markets and direct ocean access to the European and Asian Continents. Costa Rica has two seasons, both of which have their own agricultural resources: the tropical wet and dry seasons. One-fourth of Costa Rica's land is dedicated to national forests, often adjoining beaches, which has made the country a popular destination for affluent retirees and [[Ecotourism|ecotourists]]. It has one of the best economies in Latin America. Because of the ocean acess 23.7% of costa ricas people fish and trade their catches to fish companies.
In terms of the 2012 [[Environmental Performance Index]] ranking, Costa Rica is 5th in the world, and first among the Americas.<ref name=EPI2012>{{cite web|title=2010 EPI Rankings|url= http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings|accessdate=2012-01-25|author=Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy / Center for International Earth Science Information Network at Columbia University}}</ref>

==Tourism==

{{Main|Tourism in Costa Rica}}
With a $1.92-billion-a-year [[tourism]] industry, Costa Rica stands as the most visited nation in the Central American region, with 1.9 million foreign visitors in 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/diciembre/19/economia1358245.html|language=Spanish|publisher=Nación|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2007-03-16|title=País cierra el año con llegada de 1,9 millones de turistas}}</ref> thus reaching a rate of foreign tourists per capita of 0.46, one of the highest in the Caribbean Basin, and above other popular destinations such as Mexico (0.21), Dominican Republic (0.38), and Brazil (0.03).

[[Ecotourism]] is extremely popular with the many tourists visiting the extensive [[national parks]] and [[protected area]]s around the country. Costa Rica was a pioneer in this type of tourism and the country is recognized as one of the few with real ecotourism.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Honey | first = Martha | year = 1999 | title = Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns Paradise?| page = 5| publisher = Island Press; 1 edition , Washington, D.C. | quote= ...during the 1980s, ...the country transform itself from a low-key destination for nature lovers into the foremost ecotourism destination in the Americas. | postscript = <!--None--> | isbn = 1-55963-582-7}}</ref> Other important market segments are adventure, and sun and beaches.

==Agriculture==
{{Main|Agriculture in Costa Rica}}

Costa Rica's economy was historically based on agriculture, and this has had a large cultural impact through the years. Costa Rica's main [[cash crops]], both historically and up to modern times, were [[Coffee]] and [[Banana]]s. Coffee, especially, had much cultural and political importance during the 1800s, being the crop that brought a newfound wealth to the nation's elite.

Agriculture also plays a profound part in that country’s [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). It makes up about 6.5% of [[Costa Rica]]’s GDP, and 14% of the [[labor force]].<ref>CIA - ''The World Factbook''. (2011). Retrieved from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cs.html</ref> Depending on location and altitude, many regions differ in agricultural crops and techniques. The main exports from the country include: [[banana]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[coffee]], [[sugar]], [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, [[tropical fruit]]s, [[ornamental plant]]s, [[corn]], and [[potato]]es.

Livestock activity consists of cattle, pigs and horses, as well as poultry. Meat and dairy produce being leading exports.<ref>http://www.museosdecostarica.com/infocostarica4.htm</ref>

==Exports, jobs, and energy==
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Costa Rica.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Graphical depiction of Costa Rica's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]

[[Image:Intel Costa 12 2007 SJO 105b.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Intel]] microprocessor facility in Costa Rica is responsible for 25% of exports and 4,9% of the country's [[GDP]].]]
Costa Rica used to be known principally as a producer of [[banana]]s and [[coffee]]. Even though coffee, bananas, [[pineapple]], [[sugar]], [[lumber]], [[wood]] products and beef are still important exports, in recent times [[electronics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], financial outsourcing, software development, and [[ecotourism]] have become the prime industries in Costa Rica's [[economy]]. High levels of [[education]] among its residents make the country an attractive [[investing]] location.

The country has successfully attracted important investments by such companies as [[Intel|Intel Corporation]], which employs nearly 3,500 people at its custom built $300 million microprocessor plant; [[Procter & Gamble]], which is establishing its administrative center for the Western Hemisphere in Costa Rica; and Abbott Laboratories and Baxter Healthcare from the health care products industry likewise. Manufacturing and industry's contribution to GDP overtook agriculture over the course of the 1990s, led by foreign investment in Costa Rica's free trade zones. Well over half of that investment has come from the U.S. In 2006 [[Intel]]'s microprocessor facility alone was responsible for 20% of Costa Rican exports and 4.9% of the country's [[GDP]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eleconomista.es/empresas-finanzas/noticias/81837/10/06/Intel-supone-el-49-por-ciento-del-PIB-de-Costa-Rica.html |title=Intel supone el 4,9 por ciento del PIB de Costa Rica|date=2006-10-06|publisher=El Economista|accessdate=2008-04-13|language=Spanish }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/premium/publica/publica?COMPID=53410660334&ID_PAGINA=22088&ID_FORMATO=9&turbourl=false|title=Intel fabrica el procesador "más veloz del mundo" en Costa Rica|date=2007-11-13|publisher=La Vanguardia|accessdate=2008-04-13|language=Spanish }}</ref>

Trade with [[South East Asia]] and [[Russia]] has boomed during 2004 and 2005, and the country obtained full [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum]] (APEC) membership by 2007 (the country became an observer in 2004). In 2011 the [[Financial Times]] Intelligent Unit awarded Costa Rica with the fDi’s Caribbean and Central American Country of the Future 2011/12 for its successful record in attracting FDI into the country, and being  the number one destination country in the region in terms of [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) project numbers since 2003.

[[Tourism]] is booming, with the number of visitors up from 780,000 in 1996, through 1 million in 1999, to 2.089 million foreign visitors in 2008, allowing the country to earn $2.144-billion in that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/diciembre/19/economia1358245.html|language=Spanish|date=2007-12-19|accessdate=2008-04-13|publisher=La Nación|title=País cierra el año con llegada de 1,9 millones de turistas|author=Hassel Fallas}} Translation: Country closes year with the arrival of 1,9 million tourists</ref> Tourism now earns more foreign exchange than bananas and coffee combined.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2004/diciembre/29/economia0.html |language=Spanish |date=2004-12-29|accessdate=2008-04-13|publisher=La Nación|title= Turismo, principal motor de la economía durante el 2004 |author=José Enrique Rojas}}</ref> In 2005, tourism contributed with 8,1% of the country's GDP and represented 13,3% of direct and indirect employment.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Altés | first = Carmen | year = 2006 | title = El Turismo en América Latina y el Caribe y la experiencia del BID| page = 9 and 47| publisher = Inter-American Development Bank; Sustainable Development Department, Technical Paper Series ENV-149, Washington, D.C.

The country has not discovered sources of fossil fuels—apart from minor [[coal]] deposits—but its mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall have permitted the construction of a dozen [[hydroelectric power]] plants, making it self-sufficient in all energy needs, except oil for transportation. Costa Rica exports electricity to Central America and has the potential to become a major electricity exporter if plans for new generating plants and a regional distribution grid are realized. Mild climate and trade winds make neither heating nor cooling necessary, particularly in the highland cities and towns where some 90% of the population lives.

==Infrastructure==
Costa Rica's infrastructure has suffered from a lack of maintenance and new investment. The country has an extensive road system of more than 30,000 kilometers, although much of it is in disrepair. Most parts of the country are accessible by road. The main highland cities in the country's Central Valley are connected by paved all-weather roads with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and by the [[Pan American Highway]] with [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]], the neighboring countries to the North and the South. Costa Rica's [[port]]s are struggling to keep pace with growing trade. They have insufficient capacity, and their equipment is in poor condition. The railroad didn't function for several years, until recent government effort to reactivate it for city transportation.

The government hopes to bring foreign investment, technology, and management into the telecommunications and electrical power sectors, which are monopolies of the state. However, political opposition to opening these sectors to private participation has stalled the government's efforts.

Costa Rica has a reputation as one of the most stable, prosperous, and among the least corrupt in Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Report 2007 |url=http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr/download_gcr|accessdate=2008-03-11| author=Transparency International}} Costa Rica ranks 3rd among Latin American countries, and the 55th position worldwide.</ref> However, in fall 2004, three former Costa Rican presidents ([[Jose Maria Figueres]], [[Miguel Angel Rodríguez]], and [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier|Rafael Angel Calderon]]) were investigated on [[Political corruption|corruption]] charges related to the issuance of government contracts. After extensive legal proceedings Calderon and Rodriguez have been sentenced; however, the inquiry on Figueres has since been dismissed by the competent judicial party and no charges were ever raised against him.

== Trade policy ==

Costa Rica has sought to widen its economic and trade ties, both within and outside the region. Costa Rica signed a bilateral trade agreement with Mexico in 1994, which was later amended to cover a wider range of products. Costa Rica joined other Central American countries, plus the Dominican Republic, in establishing a Trade and Investment Council with the United States in March 1998.

* [[Costa Rica]] has bilateral free trade agreements with the following countries and blocs which took effect on (see date):
