'''Buckingham Palace''' is the official London residence and principal workplace of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].<ref>By tradition, the [[British Royal Court]] is still officially resident at [[St. James's Palace]], which means that, while foreign [[ambassador]]s assuming their new position are received by the [[British sovereign]] at Buckingham Palace, they are accredited to the "Court of St. James's Palace". This anomaly continues for the sake of tradition as Buckingham Palace is to all intents and purposes the official residence. See [http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/History.aspx History of St James's Palace] (Official website of the British Monarchy).</ref> Located in the [[City of Westminster]], the [[palace]] is a setting for state occasions  and royal hospitality. It has been a focus for the [[British people]] at times of national rejoicing.

Originally known as '''Buckingham House''', the building which forms the core of today's palace was a large [[townhouse]] built for the [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1705 on a site which had been in private ownership for at least 150 years. It was subsequently acquired by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1761<ref name="rob14">Robinson, p. 14</ref> as a private residence for [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], and known as "The Queen's House". During the 19th century it was enlarged, principally by architects [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and Edward Blore, forming three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the East front, which contains the well-known balcony on which the royal family traditionally congregates to greet crowds outside. However, the palace chapel was destroyed by a German bomb in World War II; the [[Queen's Gallery]] was built on the site and opened to the public in 1962 to exhibit works of art from the [[Royal Collection]].

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of Sir Charles Long. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a ''[[Belle Époque]]'' cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese [[Chinoiserie|regency]] style with furniture and fittings brought from the [[Royal Pavilion]] at [[Brighton]] and from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]]. The [[Buckingham Palace Garden]] is the largest private garden in London.

The state rooms, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public each year for most of August and September, as part of the Palace's Summer Opening.

==History==
[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|300px|Buckingham House, c.1710, was designed by [[William Winde]] for the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.<!--note - "Normanby" is correct spelling, do not change please --> This façade evolved into today's Grand Entrance on the west (inner) side of the quadrangle, with the Green Drawing Room above.]]

===The site===
In the [[Middle Ages]], Buckingham Palace's site formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river [[Tyburn (stream)|Tyburn]], which still flows below the courtyard and south wing of the palace.<ref>Goring, P.15</ref> Where the river was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included [[Edward the Confessor]] and his [[queen consort]] [[Edith of Wessex]] in late Saxon times, and, after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[William the Conqueror]]. William gave the site to [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], who bequeathed it to the monks of [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>The topography of the site and its ownership are dealt with in Wright, chapters 1–4</ref>

In 1531, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] acquired the Hospital of St James (later [[St. James's Palace]])<ref>Goring, p.28</ref> from [[Eton College]], and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.<ref>Goring, p.18</ref> These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier.<ref>''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41820 The Acquisition of the Estate]'', ''[[Survey of London]]'': volume 39: The Grosvenor Estate in Mayfair, Part 1 (General History) (1977), pp. 1–5. Retrieved 3 February 2009</ref>

Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the [[Fee simple|freehold]] was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.<ref>Wright, pp. 76–8</ref> Needing money, [[James VI and I|James I]] sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.)<ref>Goring, pp. 31&36</ref> [[Clement Walker]] in ''Anarchia Anglicana'' (1649) refers to "new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir [[Hugh Audley]] by the great heiress Mary Davies.<ref>Audley and Davies were key figures in the development of Ebury Manor and also the Grosvenor Estate (see [[Duke of Westminster|Dukes of Westminster]]), which still exists today. (They are remembered in the streetnames North Audley Street, South Audley Street, and Davies Street, all in [[Mayfair]].)</ref>

===First houses on the site===

====Goring House====
Possibly the first house erected within the site was that of a Sir William Blake, around 1624.<ref>Wright, p. 83</ref> The next owner was [[George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich|Lord Goring]], who from 1633 extended Blake's house and developed much of today's garden, then known as Goring Great Garden.<ref>Goring, Chapter V</ref><ref name="Harris, p.21">Harris, p.21</ref> He did not, however, manage to obtain freehold interest in the mulberry garden. Unbeknown to Goring, in 1640 the document "failed to pass the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] before [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] fled London, which it needed to do for [[Capital punishment|legal execution]]".<ref>Wright, p. 96</ref> (It was this critical omission that helped the British royal family regain the freehold under [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].)<ref>Goring, p.62</ref>

====Arlington House====
The improvident Goring defaulted on his rents;<ref>Goring, p.58</ref> [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington]] obtained the mansion and was occupying it, now known as Goring House, when it burned down in 1674.<ref name="Harris, p.21" /> Arlington House rose on the site—the southern wing of today's palace—the next year,<ref name="Harris, p.21" /> and its freehold was bought in 1702.

====Buckingham House====
The house which forms the architectural core of the present palace was built for the first [[John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby|Duke of Buckingham and Normanby]]<!--note - "Normanby" is correct spelling, do not change please --> in 1703 to the design of [[William Winde]]. The style chosen was of a large, three-floored central block with two smaller flanking service wings.<ref>Harris, p.22</ref> Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's descendant, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761<ref name="rob14" /> to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] for [[Pound (currency)|£]]21,000<ref>Nash, p. 18, although the purchase price is given by Wright p. 142 as £28,000</ref> (£{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|21000|1761|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

Like his grandfather, George II, George III refused to sell the mulberry garden interest, so that Sheffield had been unable to purchase the full freehold of the site. When Sheffield sold Buckingham House it came into the hands of the royal family.

[[File:Buckingham palace 1897.jpg|thumb|300px| Buckingham Palace and Gardens in 1897.]]

===From Queen's House to palace===
The house was originally intended as a private retreat, and in particular for [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]], and was known as The Queen's House<ref>In 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte, in exchange for her rights to [[Somerset House]] (see ''Old and New London'' (below)</ref>—14 of their 15 children were born there. [[St. James's Palace]] remained the official and ceremonial royal residence.<ref>''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45183 Westminster: Buckingham Palace]'', ''Old and New London'': Volume 4 (1878), pp. 61–74. Date accessed: 3 February 2009. The tradition persists of foreign ambassadors being formally accredited to "the [[Court of St. James's]]", even though it is at Buckingham Palace that they present their credentials and staff to the Queen upon their appointment.</ref>

Remodelling of the structure began in 1762.<ref>Harris, p.24</ref> After his accession to the throne in 1820, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]].<ref>Harris, pp.30–31</ref> Some furnishings were transferred from [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution.<ref>Jones, p. 42</ref> The external façade was designed in the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically and by 1829, the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] hired Edward Blore to finish the work.<ref>Harris, p.33</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/History.aspx|title=The Royal Residences > Buckingham Palace > History|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref> At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the [[Palace of Westminster|existing namesake]] by fire in 1834.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ziegler|first=Phillip|title=King William IV|publisher=Collins|year=1971|page=280|isbn=0-00-211934-X.}}</ref>

==Home of the monarch==
[[File:Buckingham Palace engraved by J.Woods after Hablot Browne & R.Garland publ 1837 edited.jpg|thumb|300px|The palace c. 1837, depicting the [[Marble Arch]], which served as the ceremonial entrance to the Palace [[precinct]]s. It was moved to make way for the east wing, built in 1847, which enclosed the quadrangle.]]

Buckingham Palace finally became the principal royal residence in 1837, on the accession of [[Queen Victoria]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx|title=The Royal Residences > Buckingham Palace|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref> who was the first monarch to reside there as her predecessor William IV had died before its completion.<ref>Hedley, p. 10</ref> While the [[state room]]s were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence.<ref name="ws249">Woodham-Smith, p. 249</ref> Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when a decision was taken to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty.<ref name="ws249"/> Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], concerned himself with a reorganisation of the [[Royal Household|household]] offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.

By 1847, the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family,<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 33</ref> and consequently the new wing, designed by Edward Blore, was built by [[Thomas Cubitt]],<ref>''Holland & Hannen and Cubitts – The Inception and Development of a Great Building Firm'', published 1920, p. 35</ref> enclosing the central quadrangle. The large East Front facing [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] is today the "public face" of Buckingham Palace and contains the balcony from which the [[royal family]] acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and annually after [[Trooping the Colour]]. The [[ballroom]] wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period, designed by Nash's student [[James Pennethorne|Sir James Pennethorne]].

Before Prince Albert's death, the palace was frequently the scene of musical entertainments,<ref>Hedley, p. 19</ref> and the greatest contemporary musicians entertained at Buckingham Palace. The composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]] is known to have played there on three occasions.<ref>Healey, pp.137–138</ref> [[Johann Strauss II]] and his orchestra played there when in England.<ref>Healey, p.122</ref> Strauss's "Alice Polka" was first performed at the palace in 1849 in honour of the Queen's daughter, [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Alice]].<ref>Allen's Indian Mail, and Register of British and Foreign India, China, and all parts of the East. 1850, Vol. VIII. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=axgYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=%22Alice+polka%22&num=30&client=firefox-a#PPA117,M1 Google Book link]</ref> Under Victoria, Buckingham Palace was frequently the scene of lavish costume balls, in addition to the routine royal ceremonies, investitures and presentations.

Widowed in 1861, the grief-stricken Queen withdrew from public life and left Buckingham Palace to live at [[Windsor Castle]], [[Balmoral Castle]], and [[Osborne House]]. For many years the palace was seldom used, and even neglected. In 1864 a note was found pinned to the fence of Buckingham Palace saying: 'These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the occupant's declining business.' Eventually, public opinion forced her to return to London, though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible. Court functions were still held at Windsor Castle rather than at the palace, presided over by the sombre Queen habitually dressed in mourning black while Buckingham Palace remained shuttered for most of the year.<ref name="rob9">Robinson, p. 9</ref>

===Interior===
[[File:Plan of Buckingham palace.gif|thumb|300px|''[[Piano nobile]]'' of Buckingham Palace.

''On the ground floor'': R:&nbsp;Ambassador's Entrance; T:&nbsp;Grand Entrance. The areas defined by shaded walls represent lower minor wings. '''Note''': This is an unscaled sketch plan for reference only. Proportions of some rooms may slightly differ in reality.]]

The Palace measures 108 metres by 120 metres, is 24 metres high and contains over {{convert|77000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of floorspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/40factsaboutBuckinghamPalace.aspx|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|title=40 facts about Buckingham Palace|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> The principal rooms of the palace are contained on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and {{convert|55|yd|m}} long.<ref name="Harris, p.41">Harris, p.41</ref> The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by [[Rembrandt]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]];<ref>Harris, pp.78–79</ref><ref>Healey, pp.387–388</ref> other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the [[Throne room|Throne Room]] and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the [[throne]] from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase.<ref name="Harris, p.41" /> The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a [[Tribune (architecture)|tribune]] lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer.

Directly underneath the [[State room|State Apartments]] is a suite of slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private [[Head of state|audiences]]. Some of the rooms are named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the ''1844 Room'', which was decorated in that year for the State visit of [[Tsar|Emperor]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] of Russia, and, on the other side of the Bow Room, the ''1855 Room'', in honour of the visit of Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]].<ref>Harris, p.81</ref> At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's [[Garden party|Garden Parties]] in the Gardens beyond.<ref>Harris, p.40</ref> The Queen uses privately a smaller suite of rooms in the North wing.
[[File:Salon de musica.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Albert's music room, one of the smaller less formal rooms at the palace, in 1887]]
Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the [[Royal Pavilion|Brighton Pavilion]] was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms, but has a chimney piece designed by W.M. Feetham. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper which had been supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and the chimney piece in this room is a European vision of what the Chinese equivalent would look like, complete with nodding [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarins]] in [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s and fearsome winged [[Chinese dragon|dragons]], designed by Robert Jones.<ref>Healey, pp.159–160</ref>

[[File:Pynequeensbreakfastroombuckinghamhouse edited.jpg|thumb|The Queen's Breakfast Room]]
At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony, with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer [[Charles Allom|Sir Charles Allom]], created a more "binding"<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 93</ref> Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the [[lacquer]] doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the ''piano nobile'' of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle.<ref>Harris, de Bellaigue & Miller, p. 91</ref> It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting [[porcelain]] pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.

The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured [[scagliola]] and blue and pink [[Lapis lazuli|lapis]], on the advice of Sir Charles Long. [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] oversaw a partial redecoration in a [[Belle Époque|Belle epoque]] cream and gold colour scheme.<ref name=Jones43>Jones, p. 43</ref>

When paying a state visit to Britain, foreign [[Head of state|heads of state]] are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated at the foot of the Minister's Staircase, on the ground floor of the North-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one given extra height and perspective by [[Dome|saucer dome]]s designed by Nash in the style of Soane.<ref name="harrisp82">Harris, p.82.</ref> A second corridor in the suite has Gothic influenced [[Vault (architecture)|cross over vaulting]].<ref name="harrisp82" /> The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert's uncle [[Leopold I of Belgium|Léopold I]], first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by [[Edward VIII]].<ref name="fact"/>

===Court ceremonies===

====Court dress====
Formerly, men not wearing [[military uniform]] would wear knee [[breeches]] of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included obligatory trains and [[tiara]]s or feathers in their hair (or both).

The dress code governing formal [[court uniform and dress]] has progressively relaxed. After World War I, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts a few inches from the ground, she requested a [[Lady-in-waiting|Lady-in-Waiting]] to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the King's reaction. King George V was horrified and her hemline remained unfashionably low.<ref>Healey, p.233, quoting ''The Memoirs of Mabell, Countess of Airlie'', edited and arranged by Jennifer Ellis, London:Hutchinson, 1962.</ref> Subsequently, [[George VI|King George VI]] and his consort, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], allowed daytime skirts to rise.

Today, there is no official dress code.<ref name="fact"/> Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear [[Uniform|service uniform]] or lounge suits,<ref name="fact"/> a minority wear [[Tailcoat|morning coats]], and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, [[black tie]] or [[white tie]].

====Presentation of debutantes====
Court presentations of [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]ic girls to the monarch took place in the [[throne room|Throne Room]]. These girls were known as [[Debutante|débutante]]s, and the occasion—termed their "coming out"—represented their first entrée into society. Débutantes wore full court dress, with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair. They entered, curtsied, performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy, while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length. (The ceremony, known as evening courts, corresponded to the "[[Drawing room|court drawing rooms]]" of earlier reigns.)

In 1958, the Queen abolished the presentation parties for débutantes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5299.asp |title=Mailbox|work=Royal Insight Magazine|accessdate=23 January 2008 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080123231607/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page5299.asp|archivedate=23 January 2008}}</ref> replacing them with Garden Parties.<ref>The late [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] is reputed to have remarked of the débutante presentations: "We had to put a stop to it, every tart in London was getting in."  See Blaikie, Thomas (2002). ''You look awfully like the Queen: Wit and Wisdom from the House of Windsor''. London: Harper Collins. ISBN 0-00-714874-7</ref> Today, the Throne Room is used for the reception of formal addresses such as those given to the Queen on her Jubilees. It is here on the throne dais that royal wedding portraits and family photographs are taken.

====Investitures====
[[File:Louis Haghe The New Ballroom 1856.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Ballroom is the largest room at Buckingham Palace. It was added by Queen Victoria and is used for ceremonies such as investitures and state banquets. This picture dates from 1856. The polychrome colour scheme has been replaced by mainly white decoration with gold details and red upholstery.]]
[[Investiture]]s, which include the conferring of [[knight]]hoods by dubbing with a sword, and other awards take place in the palace's Ballroom, built in 1854. At {{convert|36.6|m|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|18|m|2|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|13.5|m|2|abbr=on}} high<ref name="fact">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Factfiles/40factsaboutBuckinghamPalace.aspx|title=Fact files > 40 facts about Buckingham Palace|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> (120' × 59' × 44' 3.5"), it is the largest room in the palace. It has replaced the throne room in importance and use. During investitures, the Queen stands on the throne dais beneath a giant, domed velvet canopy, which is known as a shamiana or a [[baldachin]] and was used at the coronation [[Delhi Durbar|Durbar]], [[Delhi]] in 1911.<ref>Harris, p.72</ref> A military band plays in the musicians' gallery as award recipients approach the Queen and receive their [[honour]]s, watched by their families and friends.<ref name="Healey, p.364">Healey, p.364</ref>

====State banquets====
[[File:Buckingham Palace Grand Staircase The Graphic 1870.jpg|thumb|Guests ascending the Grand Staircase in 1870.]]
State [[banquet]]s also take place in the Ballroom; these formal dinners take place on the first evening of a state visit by a visiting Head of State.<ref name="Healey, p.364" /> On these occasions, 150 or more guests in formal "white tie and decorations", including tiaras for women, may dine off gold plate. The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November, when the Queen entertains members of the foreign diplomatic corps resident in London.<ref>Healey, p.362</ref> On this occasion, all the state rooms are in use, as the royal family proceed through them<ref>Hedley, p. 16</ref> beginning through the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, causing a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.

====Other ceremonies and functions====
Smaller ceremonies such as the reception of new ambassadors take place in the "1844 Room". Here too the Queen holds small lunch parties, and often meetings of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. Larger lunch parties often take place in the curved and domed Music Room, or the State Dining Room. On all formal occasions the ceremonies are attended by the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] in their historic uniforms, and other officers of the court such as the [[Lord Chamberlain]].<ref>Healey, pp. 363–365</ref>

Since the bombing of the palace chapel in World War II, royal christenings have sometimes taken place in the Music Room. The Queen's first three children were all baptised here.<ref>Robinson, p. 49</ref>

The largest functions of the year are the Queen's Garden Parties for up to 8,000 invitees in [[Buckingham Palace Garden|the Garden]].<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/GardenParties/TheGuests.aspx The Guests]</ref>

==Modern history==
[[File:Buckingham palace 1909.jpg|thumb|right|400px||Buckingham Palace panorama, 1909]]
[[File:Bird Eye Pictures of London Buckingham Palace 1909.jpg|400px|alt=B&W photo of Buckingham Palace from the air|thumb|Bird's eye picture of Buckingham Palace in 1909]]
In 1901 the accession of [[Edward VII]] saw new life breathed into the palace. The new King and his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] had always been at the forefront of London high society, and their friends, known as "the [[Marlborough House]] Set", were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age. Buckingham Palace—the Ballroom, Grand Entrance, Marble Hall, Grand Staircase, vestibules and galleries redecorated in the Belle epoque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today—once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale. Many people feel King Edward's heavy redecoration of the palace does not complement Nash's original work.<ref>Robinson (Page 9) asserts that the decorations, including plaster swags and other decorative motifs, are "finicky" and "at odds with Nash's original detailing".</ref> However, it has been allowed to remain for over one hundred years.

The last major building work took place during the reign of [[George V|King George V]] when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part [[Giacomo Leoni]]'s [[Lyme Park]] in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of [[Portland stone]]) was designed to be the backdrop to the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]], a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates.<ref>Harris, p.34</ref> George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties.<ref>Healey, p.185</ref> He arranged a series of [[Royal Command Performance|command performances]] featuring [[jazz]] musicians such as the [[Original Dixieland Jazz Band]] (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, [[Sidney Bechet]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a [[Brecon Jazz Festival#(Kind of) Blue Plaque|(Kind of) Blue Plaque]] by the [[Brecon Jazz Festival]] as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23727267-buckingham-palace-hits-right-note-with-jazz-fans.do |title=Buckingham Palace hits right note with jazz fans|work=London Evening Standard|date=3 August 2009)|location=UK|accessdate=11 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Stephen Bates |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/03/buckingham-palace-jazz-plaque-brecon|title=By royal approval: Buckingham Palace's place in jazz history|work=The Guardian|date=3 August 2009|accessdate=11 August 2010|location=London}}</ref>  George V's wife [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] was a [[connoisseur]] of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble [[Empire style|Empire-style]] chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.<ref>Healey pp. 221–222</ref> This room, {{convert|69|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.<ref>Harris, p.63</ref>

A 1999 book published by the Royal Collection Department reported that the palace contained 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.<ref>Robinson, p. 11</ref> While this may seem large, it is small when compared to the [[Russian Empire|Russian imperial]] palaces in [[Saint Petersburg]] and at [[Tsarskoye Selo|Tsarskoe Selo]], the [[Apostolic Palace|Papal Palace]] in Rome, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]], the [[Stockholm Palace]], or indeed the former [[Palace of Whitehall]], and tiny compared to the [[Forbidden City]] and [[Potala Palace]]. The relative smallness of the palace may be best appreciated from within, looking out over the inner quadrangle. A minor change was made in 1938, in which the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory and altered in 1911–13 to a racquets court, was converted into a swimming pool.
[[File:victoria.memorial.london.arp.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]] was created by sculptor Sir [[Thomas Brock]] in 1911 and erected in front of the main gates at Buckingham Palace on a surround constructed by architect Sir Aston Webb.]]
During World War I the palace, then the home of King George V and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more valuable contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained ''in situ''. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much to the dismay of his guests and household.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|isbn=0-297-78245-2|pages=176–177}}</ref> To the King's later regret, [[David Lloyd George]] persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence.<ref>Rose, pp. 178–179</ref>

The palace fared worse during World War II; it was bombed no less than seven times, the most serious and publicised of which resulted in the destruction of the palace chapel in 1940. Coverage of this event was played in cinemas all over the UK to show the common suffering of rich and poor. One bomb fell in the palace quadrangle while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were in residence, and many windows were blown in and the chapel destroyed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Feud|last=Thornton|first=Michael|year=1984|publisher=M.Joseph|page=216}}</ref> War-time coverage of such incidents was severely restricted, however. The King and Queen were filmed inspecting their bombed home, the smiling Queen, as always, immaculately dressed in a hat and matching coat seemingly unbothered by the damage around her. It was at this time the Queen famously declared: "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the [[East End of London|East End]] in the face". The royal family were seen as sharing their subjects' hardship, as ''[[Sunday Graphic|The Sunday Graphic]]'' reported:

{{quote|By the Editor: The King and Queen have endured the ordeal which has come to their subjects. For the second time a German bomber has tried to bring death and destruction to the home of Their Majesties...When this war is over the common danger which King George and Queen Elizabeth have shared with their people will be a cherished memory and an inspiration through the years.<ref>The Sunday Graphic, 18 September 1939, p. 1</ref>}}

The damaged Palace was carefully restored after the War by [[Mowlem|John Mowlem & Co.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1351908/Sir-Edgar-Beck.html|title=Sir Edgar Beck|work=The Telegraph|date=9 August 2000|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref>

On 15 September 1940, known as the [[Battle of Britain Day]], an RAF pilot, [[Ray Holmes]] of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF]] rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick choice to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the [[Dornier Do 17]] bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, [[Feldwebel]] Robert Zehbe, landed only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of [[London Victoria station]].<ref>[[Alfred Price|Price, Alfred]].

Aurum Press, London, 2000, p. 325.</ref> The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London. The British pilot became a [[Queen's Messenger|King's Messenger]] following the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4398484.stm|title=Pilot who 'saved Palace' honoured|date=2 November 2005|work=BBC news website|accessdate=18 March 2009}}</ref>

On [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]]—8 May 1945—the palace was the centre of British celebrations, with the King, Queen and the Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen, and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] appearing on the balcony, with the palace's blacked-out windows behind them, to the cheers from a vast crowd in [[The Mall, London|the Mall]].<ref>''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_3580000/3580163.stm 1945: Rejoicing at end of war in Europe]'' (BBC ''On this day''.) Retrieved 3 February 2009.</ref>

[[The boy Jones]] was an intruder who gained entry to the palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841 as recorded by [[Charles Dickens]] some 40 years later.<ref name=dickens>[[Charles Dickens|Dickens, Charles]] (5 July 1885) "[http://john-adcock.blogspot.com/2008/10/boy-jones.html The boy Jones]", ''[[All the Year Round]]'', pp. 234–37.</ref> In 1982, [[Michael Fagan incident|Michael Fagan]] was able to break into the palace twice, and conversed with the Queen on one of these occasions.<ref>''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,922952,00.html God Save the Queen, Fast]'' Spencer Davidson and Arthur White ''Time Magazine'' 26 July 1982 Retrieved 3 February 2009</ref> Reportedly, Her Majesty maintained her composure while the palace police were en route and Fagan made no threatening motions towards the Queen.

At the rear of the palace is the large and park-like garden, which together with its lake is the largest private garden in London.<ref>''[http://web.archive.org/web/20080502231028/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1381/1092/ Buckingham Palace]'' ([[Museum of London]].) Retrieved 2 May 2009.</ref> Here the Queen hosts her annual garden parties each summer, and also holds large functions to celebrate royal milestones, such as jubilees. It covers {{convert|40|acres|0|abbr=on}}, and includes a helicopter landing area, a lake, and a tennis court.<ref name="fact"/>

Adjacent to the palace is the [[Royal Mews]], also designed by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the [[Gold State Coach]], are housed. This [[rococo]] gilt coach, designed by Sir [[Sir William Chambers|William Chambers]] in 1760, has painted panels by [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani|G. B. Cipriani]]. It was first used for the State Opening of Parliament by George III in 1762 and has been used by the monarch for every coronation since George IV. It was last used for the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/5000048/gold-state-coach|title=The Gold State Coach|publisher=Royal Collection|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> Also housed in the mews are the carriage horses used in royal ceremonial processions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/TheRoyalMews/TheRoyalMews.aspx|title=The Royal Residences > The Royal Mews|publisher=www.royal.gov.uk|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref>

[[The Mall, London|The Mall]], a ceremonial approach route to the palace, was designed by Sir Aston Webb and completed in 1911 as part of a grand memorial to [[Queen Victoria]]. It extends from [[Admiralty Arch]], across [[St James's Park]] to the [[Victoria Memorial (London)|Victoria Memorial]]. This route is used by the cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual [[Trooping the Colour]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholson, Louise|authorlink=Louise Nicholson|year=1998|title=London|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|page=56|isbn=0-7112-1187-6}}</ref>

===21st century: Royal use and public access===
[[File:Buckinghampalacebalcony.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The royal family on the balcony in 1986]]

Every year some 50,000 invited guests are entertained at garden parties, receptions, audiences and banquets. The [[Garden party|Garden Parties]], usually three, are held in the summer, usually in July. The Forecourt of Buckingham Palace is used for [[Changing the Queen's Life Guard|Changing of the Guard]], a major ceremony and tourist attraction (daily during the summer months; every other day during the winter).

The palace, like Windsor Castle, is owned by the British state. It is not the monarch's personal property, unlike [[Sandringham House]] and [[Balmoral Castle]].<ref>There is no reliable public information about the formal ownership of Windsor castle and Buckingham palace. The official Internet site of the Royal Family only says they are "held in trust". They are however not among properties listed to belong to the Queen personally or to the Crown Estate. State ownership is widely assumed.</ref> Many of the contents from Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, [[Kensington Palace]] and St. James's Palace are known collectively as the Royal Collection; owned by the Sovereign, they can, on occasions, be viewed by the public at the [[Queen's Gallery]], near the Royal Mews. Unlike the palace and the castle, the gallery is open continually and displays a changing selection of items from the collection. The rooms containing the Queen's Gallery are on the site of the former chapel, which was damaged by one of the seven bombs to fall on the palace during World War II. The palace's [[state room]]s have been open to the public during August and September since 1993. The money raised in entry fees was originally put towards the rebuilding of Windsor Castle following the [[1992 Windsor Castle fire|1992 fire]] which destroyed many of its state rooms.

In May 2009, in response to a request from the royal family to the government for money for a backlog of repairs to the palace, a group of MPs on the Public Accounts Committee proposed that in return for the extra £4&nbsp;million in annual funds requested, the palace be open to the public more than the 60 days it is now, as well as when members of the royal family are in residence.<ref name="MPs 60 days">{{cite news|title=Queen must open palace more in return for extra funds|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|date=30 May 2009|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/5407953/Queen-must-open-palace-more-in-return-for-extra-funds.html |accessdate=4 June 2009|first=Andrew|last=Pierce}}</ref> The British Government currently provides £15&nbsp;million yearly for the palace's upkeep.

Thus, Buckingham Palace is a symbol and home of the British monarchy, an art gallery and tourist attraction. Behind the gilded railings and gates which were completed by the [[Bromsgrove Guild]] in 1911<ref name="rob9"/> and Webb's famous façade, which has been described in a book published by the Royal Collection as looking "like everybody's idea of a palace";<ref name="rob9"/> is not only the weekday home of the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] but also the London residence of the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl]] and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]]. The palace also houses the offices of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] and is the workplace of 450 people.
