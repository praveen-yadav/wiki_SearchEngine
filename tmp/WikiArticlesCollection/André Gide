'''André Paul Guillaume Gide''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe pɔl ɡijom ʒid|lang}}; 22 November 1869 – 19 February 1951) was a [[French literature|French]] author and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1947. Gide's career ranged from its beginnings in the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] movement, to the advent of [[Anti-imperialism|anticolonialism]] between the two World Wars.

Known for his [[fiction]] as well as his [[autobiography|autobiographical]] works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation between the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straitlaced education and a narrow social [[moralism]]. Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and [[puritanical]] constraints, and gravitates around his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as suggested by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his 1936 voyage to the [[USSR]].

==Early life==
[[File:Gide 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|André Gide in 1893]]Gide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class [[Protestant]] family. His father was a [[University of Paris|Paris University]] professor of law who died in 1880. His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]].

Gide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andre Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'André Walter''), in 1891.

In 1893 and 1894, Gide traveled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.<ref>''If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir'' by André Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: "but when Ali – that was my little guide's name – led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country"..."As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back"..."I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation"..."I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground." [p. 251]</ref>

He befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in [[Algiers]]. Wilde had the impression that he had introduced Gide to [[homosexuality]],  but, in fact, Gide had already discovered this on his own.<ref>Out of the past, Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the present (Miller 1995:87)</ref><ref>''If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir'' by André Gide (first edition 1920) (Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: "I should say that if Wilde had begun to discover the secrets of his life to me, he knew nothing as yet of mine; I had taken care to give him no hint of them, either by deed or word."..."No doubt, since my adventure at Sousse, there was not much left for the Adversary to do to complete his victory over me; but Wilde did not know this, nor that I was vanquished beforehand or, if you will"..."that I had already triumphed in my imagination and my thoughts over all my scruples." [p. 286])</ref>

==The middle years==
In 1895, after his mother's death, he married his cousin Madeleine Rondeaux, but the marriage remained unconsummated. In 1896, he became mayor of [[La Roque-Baignard]], a [[Communes of France|commune]] in Normandy.

In 1901, Gide rented the property [[Maderia]] in [[Saint Brelade|St. Brelade's Bay]] and lived there while residing in [[Jersey]]. This period, 1901–07, is commonly seen as a period of apathy and unsettlement in his life.

In 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'' (''The New French Review'').<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html André Biography]. nobelprize.org</ref> In 1916, [[Marc Allégret]], only 15 years old, became his lover. Marc was the son of Elie Allégret, best man at Gide's wedding. Of Allégret's five children, André Gide adopted Marc. The two fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence – "the best part of myself," he later commented. In 1918, he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.

In the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended [[pederasty]] in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.

In 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Théo van Rysselberghe]]. This would cause the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between Allégret and Gide and damaged the relation with Van Rysselberghe. This was possibly Gide's only sexual liaison with a woman, and it was brief in the extreme; but his daughter Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth "La Dame Blanche" ("The White Lady"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each of them on the rue Vavin). She worshipped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship. Gide's legal wife, Madeleine, died in 1938. Later he used the background of his unconsummated marriage in his novel ''Et Nunc Manet in Te''.

In 1924, he published an autobiography, ''Unless the seed dies'' (French: ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'').

After 1925, he began to demand more humane conditions for criminals.

==Africa==
From July 1926 to May 1927, he travelled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] colony with his lover [[Marc Allégret]]. Gide went successively to [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), [[Oubangui-Chari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly to [[Chad]] and then to [[Cameroun]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''[[Return from Chad]]'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform. In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''régime des Grandes Concessions''), ''i.e.,'' a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their exploitation to [[slavery]]. The book had important influence on [[anti-colonialism]] movements in France and helped re-evaluate the [[Impact and evaluation of colonialism and colonization|impact of colonialism]].<ref>[http://www.lire.fr/critique.asp/idC=31184/idR=219/idTC=3/idG=2 Voyage au Congo suivi du Retour du Tchad], in ''[[Lire]]'', July–August 1995 {{fr icon}}</ref>

==Russia==
During the 1930s, he briefly became a [[communist]], or more precisely, a [[fellow traveler]] (he never formally joined the Communist Party). As a distinguished writer sympathizing with the cause of communism, he was invited to tour the [[Soviet Union]] as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers. The tour disillusioned him and he subsequently became quite critical of Soviet Communism. This criticism of Communism caused him to lose socialist friends, especially when he made a clean break with it in ''Retour de L'U.R.S.S.'' in 1936. He was also a contributor to ''[[The God That Failed]]''.

==The 1940s==
Gide left France for Africa in 1942 and lived in [[Tunis]] until the end of World War II. In 1947, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He devoted much of his last years to publishing his Journal.<ref>{{cite web
