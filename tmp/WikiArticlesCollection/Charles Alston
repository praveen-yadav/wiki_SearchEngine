==Personal life==

===Early life===

Charles Henry Alston was born on November 28, 1907 in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] to [[Reverend]] Primus Priss Alston and Anna Elizabeth Miller Alston, and was the youngest of five children.<ref name="Wardlaw">{{cite book |last=Wardlaw |first=Alvia J. |coauthors=|title=Charles Alston |publisher=Pomegranate |year=2007 |month=|isbn=978-0-7649-3766-8}}</ref><ref name="Hollis">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Charles Henry Alston | work=Artists | publisher=Hollis Taggart Galleries | url=http://www.hollistaggart.com/artists/biography/charles_henry_alston/ | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}</ref><ref name="Pierce">{{cite journal |last1=Pierce |first1=Lemoine |last2= |first2= |year=2004 |title=Charles Alston – An Appreciation |journal=The International Review of African American Art |volume= |issue=4 |pages=33–38 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> Only three survived past infancy: His sister Rousmaniere, and his brothers Wendell and Charles.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Schwartzman">{{cite book |last=Schwartzman |first=Myron |coauthors=|title=Romare Bearden: His Life and Art |publisher=[[Abrams Books]] |year=1990 |month=|isbn=978-0-8109-3108-4}}</ref> His father was born into slavery in 1851 in [[Pittsboro, North Carolina]]; after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he graduated from [[St. Augustine's College (North Carolina)|St. Augustine's College]] and became a prominent minister and founder of St. Michael's Episcopal Church.  He was described as a "race man": an African American who dedicated his skills to the furtherance of the black race.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Pierce"/> Reverend Alston met his wife when she was a student at his school. Charles was nicknamed "Spinky" by his father, and kept the nickname as an adult. In 1910, when Charles was three, his father died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Locals described him in admiration as the "[[Booker T. Washington]] of Charlotte".<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> 

In 1913 Anna Alston married Harry Bearden. Through the marriage, the future artist [[Romare Bearden]] became Charles’ cousin. The two Bearden families lived across the street from each other; the friendship between Romare and Charles would last a lifetime.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Schwartzman"/> As a child Alston was inspired by his older brother Wendell's drawings of trains and cars, which the young artist copied.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Interview1">{{cite audio |people=Murray, Al (interviewer) |date=19 October 1968 |title=Oral History Interview with Charles Alston |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-charles-henry-alston-11460 |format=mp3 |medium=  |trans_title= |publisher=Archives of American Art |location= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Charles also played with clay, creating a sculpture of [[North Carolina]]. As an adult he reflected on his memories of sculpting with clay as a child: "I’d get buckets of it and put it through strainers and make things out of it. I think that's the first art experience I remember, making things."<ref name="Wardlaw"/> His mother was a gifted [[embroidery|embroiderer]] and took up painting at the age of 75. His father was gifted at drawing as well, wooing Alston's mother with small sketches in the medians of letters he wrote her.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/>

In 1915 the family moved to New York, as many African-American families did during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Wintz">{{cite book |last=Wintz|first=Cary|last=Finkelman|first=Paul|coauthors=|title=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance |publisher=Routledge|year=2004|month=|isbn=1-57958-457-8}}</ref> Alston's step-father, Henry Bearden, left before his wife and children to secure a job overseeing [[elevator]] operations and the [[newsstand]] staff at the [[Bretton Hall, Manhattan|Bretton Hotel]] in the [[Upper West Side]]. The family lived in [[Harlem]] and was considered [[middle-class]]. During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the people of Harlem suffered economically.  The "stoic strength" seen within the community was later expressed in Charles’ fine art.<ref name="Wardlaw"/> At Public School 179 in [[Manhattan]], the boy's artistic abilities were recognized and he was asked to draw all of the school posters during his years there.<ref name="Pierce"/>

===Higher education===

Alston graduated from [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was nominated for academic excellence and was the art editor of the school's magazine, ''The Magpie''. He was a member of the [[Arista - National Honor Society]] and also studied drawing and anatomy at the Saturday school of the [[National Academy of Design|National Academy of Art]] .<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Pierce"/> In high school he was given his first [[oil paint]]s and learned about his aunt [[Bessye J. Bearden|Bessye Bearden's]] art salons, which stars like [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Langston Hughes]] attended. After graduating in 1925, he attended [[Columbia University]], turning down a scholarship to the [[Yale School of Fine Arts]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Interview1"/> Alston entered the pre-architectural program only to lose interest upon seeing the lack of success many African American architects had in the field. After also experimenting with [[pre-med]], he decided that math, physics and chemistry "was not just my bag" and he entered the fine arts program. During his time at Columbia he joined [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], worked on the university's ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' and drew cartoons for the school's magazine ''[[Jester of Columbia|Jester]]''.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> He also hung out in Harlem restaurants and clubs, where his love for jazz and black music would be fostered. In 1929 he graduated and received a fellowship to study at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], where he obtained his Master's in 1931.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/>

===Later life===
For the years 1942–1943 Alston was stationed in the army at [[Fort Huachuca]] in [[Arizona]]. Upon returning to New York on April 8, 1944, he married Dr. Myra Adele Logan, an intern at the [[Harlem Hospital]].  They met when he was working on a [[Charles Alston#Murals|mural project]] at the hospital. Their home, including his studio, as on Edgecombe Avenue near [[Highbridge Park]]. The couple lived close to family; at their frequent gatherings Alston enjoyed cooking and Myra played piano. During the 1940s Alston also took occasional art classes studying under [[Alexander Kostellow]]. 

In January 1977 Myra Logan died.  Months later on April 27, 1977, Charles ''Spinky'' Alston died after a long bout with [[cancer]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> His memorial service was held at St. Martins Episcopal Church on May 21, 1977 in New York City.<ref name="Funeral">Charles Henry Alston Memorial Service. 21 May 1977.

==Professional career==
[[File:CARTER G. WOODSON - TEACHER, HISTORIAN, PUBLISHER - NARA - 535622.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carter G. Woodson]] illustration for the Office of War]]
While obtaining his master's degree, Alston was the boys’ work director at the Utopia Children's House, started by [[James Lesesne Wells]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Wintz"/> He also began teaching at the [[Harlem Arts Workshop]], founded by [[Augusta Savage]] in the basement of what is now the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Wintz"/> Alston's teaching style was influenced by the work of [[John Dewey]], [[Arthur Wesley Dow]], and [[Thomas Munro]]. During this period, Alston began to teach the 10-year old [[Jacob Lawrence]], whom he strongly influenced.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Sentinel">{{cite news |title=First publication of the migration series captures A defining moment in American history. |author= |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/369369766?accountid=11243 |newspaper=Sentinel |year=1993 |accessdate=10 April 2011}}</ref> Alston was introduced to [[African art]] by the poet [[Alain Locke]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Interview1"/><ref name="Wintz"/> In the late 1920s Alston joined Bearden and other black artists who refused to exhibit in [[William E. Harmon Foundation]] shows, which featured all-black artists in their traveling exhibits.  Alston and his friends thought the exhibits were curated for a white audience, a form of segregation which the men protested.  They did not want to be set aside but exhibited on the same level as art peers of every skin color.<ref name="Pierce"/>

In 1938 the [[Rosenwald Fund]] provided money for Alston to travel to the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the [[Farm Security Administration]], gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Wintz"/> These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits' depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed ''Tobacco Farmer'', the portrait of a young black farmer in white [[overalls]] and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, sitting in front of the landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at [[Atlanta University]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/> 

During the 1930s and early 1940s, Alston created illustrations for magazines such as ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and others.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> He also designed album covers for artists such as [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]].<ref name="Pierce"/> Alston became staff artist at the Office of War Information and Public Relations in 1940, creating drawings of notable African Americans. These images were used in over 200 [[black newspapers]] across the country by the government to "foster goodwill with the black citizenry,".<ref name="Wintz"/><ref name="Germany">{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Charles H. Alston | work=Images | publisher=AAGE  | url=http://www.aacvr-germany.org/AACVR.ORG/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90&Itemid=60 | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}</ref> 

Eventually Alston left commercial work to focus on his own artwork. In 1950, he became the first African-American instructor at the [[Art Students League]], where he remained on faculty until 1971.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Wintz"/> In 1950, his ''Painting'' was exhibited at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and his artwork was one of few purchased by the museum.<ref name="Wintz"/> He landed his first solo exhibition in 1953 at the [[John Heller Gallery]], who represented artists such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. He exhibited there five times from 1953–1958. 

In 1956, he became the first African-American instructor at the Museum of Modern Art, where he taught for a year before going to Belgium on behalf of MOMA and the State Department.  He coordinated the children's community center at [[Expo 58]]. In 1958 he was awarded a grant from and was elected as a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Pierce"/>

In 1963, Alston co-founded [[Spiral (arts alliance)|Spiral]] with Romare Bearden and Hale Woodruff.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Wintz"/> Spiral served as a collective of conversation and artistic exploration for a large group of artists who "addressed how black artists should relate to American society in a time of segregation." Artists and arts supporters gathered for Spiral, such as [[Emma Amos (painter)|Emma Amos]], [[Perry Ferguson]] and [[Merton Simpson]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Interview1"/> 
<ref name="Patton">{{cite book |last=Patton |first=Sharon|coauthors=|title=African-American Art|publisher=Oxford|year=1998|month=|isbn=0-19-284213-7}}</ref> This group served as the 1960s version of 306, and Alston was described as an "intellectual activist." In 1968, he spoke at Columbia about his activism and in the mid-1960s Spiral created an exhibition of black and white artworks.  But, the exhibition was never officially sponsored by the group due to inner-group disagreements.<ref name="Wardlaw"/>

In 1968, Alston received a presidential appointment from [[Lyndon Johnson]] to the National Council of Culture and the Arts. Mayor [[John Lindsay]] appointed him to the [[New York City Art Commission]] in 1969.<ref name="Wintz"/> He was made full professor at [[City College of New York]] in 1973 where he had taught since 1968.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/> In 1975 he was awarded the first Distinguished Alumni Award from Teachers College.<ref name="Wardlaw"/> The Art Student's League created a 21-year merit [[scholarship]] in 1977 under Alston's name to commemorate each year of his tenure.<ref name="Pierce"/>

===Painting a person and a culture===

Alston shared studio space with [[Henry Bannarn]] at 306 W. 141st St, which served as an open space for artists, photographers, musicians, writers and the like. Other artists held studio space at 306, such as Jacob Lawrence, [[Addison Bate]] and his brother Leon.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Wintz"/><ref name="Patton"/> During this time Alston founded the [[Harlem Artists’ Guild]] with Savage and [[Elba Lightfoot]] to work towards equality in [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] art programs in New York. During the early years of 306, Alston focused on mastering [[Portrait painting|portraiture]]. Early works such as ''Portrait of a Man'' (1929) show Alston's detailed and realistic style depicted through [[pastel]]s and charcoals, inspired by the style of [[Winold Reiss]]. In his ''Girl in a Red Dress'' (1934) and ''The Blue Shirt'' (1935), he used modern and innovative techniques for his portraits of young individuals in Harlem. ''Blue Shirt'' is thought to be a portrait of Jacob Lawrence. During this time he also created ''Man Seated with Travel Bag'' (c. 1938–40), showing the seedy and bleak environment, contrasting with work like the racially charged ''Vaudeville'' (c. 1930) and its [[caricature]] style of a man in [[blackface]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/>

Inspired from his trip South, Alston began his "family series" in the 1940s.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> Intensity and angularity come through in the faces of the youth in his portraits ''Untitled (Portrait of a Girl)'' and ''Untitled (Portrait of a Boy)''. These works also show the influence that [[African sculpture]] had on his portraiture, showing, with ''Portrait of a Boy'' showing more [[cubist]] features. Later family portraits show Alston's exploration of [[religious symbolism]], color, form and space. His family group portraits are often faceless, which Alston states is the way that white America views blacks. Paintings such as ''Family'' (1955) show a woman seated and a man standing with two children – the parents seem almost solemn while the children are described as hopeful and with a use of color made famous by [[Cézanne]]. In ''Family Group'' (c. 1950) Alston's use of grey and [[ochre]] tones brings together the parents and son as if one with geometric patterns connecting them together as if a [[puzzle]]. The simplicity of the look, style and emotion upon the family is reflective and probably inspired by Alston's trip south. His work during this time has been described as being "characterized by his reductive use of form combined with a sun-hued". During this time he also started to experiment with [[ink and wash painting]] seen in work like ''Portrait of a Woman'' (1955) as well as creating portraits to illustrate the music surrounding him in Harlem. ''Blues Singer #4'' shows a female singer on stage with a white flower on her shoulder and a bold red dress, reminiscent of [[Ella Fitzgerald]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> ''Girl in a Red Dress'' is thought to may be [[Bessie Smith]], for whom he drew many times when she was recording and performing. Jazz was an important influence in Alston's work and social life, representing itself in other works like ''Jazz'' (1950) and ''Harlem at Night''.<ref name="Wardlaw"/>

The 1960s civil rights movement influenced his work heavily with artworks influenced by inequality and race relations in the United States. One of his few religious artworks was created in 1960, ''Christ Head'', with an angular "[[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]]esque" portrait of [[Jesus Christ]]. Seven years later he created ''You never really meant it, did you, Mr. Charlie?'' which, in a similar style as ''Christ Head'' shows a black man standing against a red sky "looking as frustrated as any individual can look", according to Alston.<ref name="Wardlaw"/>

====Modernism====

Experimenting with the use of [[negative space]] and organic forms in the late 1940s, by the mid-1950s Alston began creating notably [[modernist]] style paintings. ''Woman with Flowers'' (1949) has been described as a tribute to [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] and African art makes another strong appearance in ''Ceremonial'' (1950). Untitled works during the era show his use of color overlay using muted colors to create simple layered abstracts of still live. ''Symbol'' (1953) relates to [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', which was a favorite work of Alston's.<ref name="Wardlaw"/> His final work of the 1950s, ''Walking'' serves as a precursor to the 1960s: [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]]. The painting, which was inspired by the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], has come to represent "the surge of energy among African Americans to organize in their struggle for full equality."<ref name="Burton">{{cite web | author=Sharon J. Burton | year=2010 | title=Celebrating African American History Through Art: The Reginald F. Lewis Museum of African American History & Culture | work=Blog | publisher=Authentic Art Visions Blog | url=http://authenticartonline.com/art/tag/charles-alston | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}</ref> About the artwork, Alston is quoted "The idea of a march was growing...It was in the air...and this painting just came. I called it ''Walking'' on purpose. It wasn't the militancy that you saw later. It was a very definite walk-not going back, no hesitation."<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="BeardernHistory">{{cite book |last=Bearden |first=Romare|last=Henderson|first=Henry|coauthors=|title=A History of African-American Artists: From 1792 to the Present  |publisher=Pantheon |year=1993 |month=|isbn=978-0-394-57016-7}}</ref>

====Black and white====

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] of the 1960s was a major influence on Alston. Considered to be one of his most powerful and impressive periods in the late 1950s he began working in black and white up until the mid-1960s. Some of the works are simple abstracts of black ink on white paper, similar to a [[Rorschach test]]. ''Untitled'' (c. 1960s) shows a [[boxing]] match in great simplicity with an attempt to express the drama of the fight through few brushstrokes. Alston worked with oil-on-[[Masonite]] during this period as well, utilizing [[impasto]], cream and ochre to create a moody [[cave]]-like artwork. ''Black and White #1'' (1959) is one of Alston's more "monumental" works. Gray, white and black come together to fight for space on an [[abstract art|abstract]] canvas, in a softer form than the more harsh [[Franz Kline]]. Alston continued to explore the relationship between [[monochromatic]] hues throughout the series which Wardlaw describes as "some of the most profoundly beautiful works of twentieth-century American art."<ref name="Wardlaw"/>

===Murals===

In the beginning Charles Alston's mural work was inspired by the work of [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]], the latter who he met when they did mural work in New York.<ref name="Pierce"/> In 1943 Alston was elected to the [[board of directors]] of the [[National Society of Mural Painters]]. He created murals for the Harlem Hospital, Golden State Mutual, [[American Museum of Natural History]], Public School 154, the Bronx Family and Criminal Court and the [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/>

====Harlem Hospital Murals====
[[File:Modern Medicine Alston.jpg|thumb|left|''Modern Medicine'' (1936) at the [[Harlem Hospital]]]]
Originally hired as an easel painter, in 1935 Alston became the first African American supervisor to work for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] in New York, which would also serve as his first mural work.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Wintz"/><ref name="Patton"/> At this time he was awarded WPA Project Number 1262 – an opportunity to oversee a group of artists creating [[mural]]s and to supervise their painting for the Harlem Hospital.<ref name="Wardlaw"/> The first government commission ever awarded to African American artists including [[Beauford Delaney]], [[Seabrook Powell]] and [[Vertis Hayes]].<ref name="Pierce"/> He also had the chance to create and paint his own contribution to the collection: ''Magic in Medicine'' and ''Modern Medicine''.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Hollis"/><ref name="Wintz"/> These paintings were part of a diptych completed in 1936 depicting the history of [[medicine]] in the African American community and [[Beauford Delaney]] served as assistant.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Patton"/> When creating the murals Alston was inspired by the work of [[Aaron Douglas]], who a year earlier had created the [[public art]] piece ''Aspects of Negro Life'' for the [[New York Public Library]], and researched traditional [[African culture]], including [[traditional African medicine]]. ''Magic in Medicine'', which depicts African culture and [[holistic]] healing, is considered one of "America's first public scenes of Africa". All of the murals sketches submitted were accepted by the FAP, however, four were denied creation by the hospital superintendent Lawrence T. Dermody and commissioner of hospitals S.S. Goldwater due to the excessive amount of African-American representation in the works.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Wintz"/><ref name="ColumbiaMural">{{cite web | author= | year=2006 | title=The Controversy | work=Harlem Hospital WPA Murals | publisher=Columbia University | url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/iraas/wpa/controversy/index.html | accessdate= 9 April 2010}}</ref> The artists fought the response through letter writing and four years later succeeded in gaining the right to complete the murals.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/> The sketches for ''Magic in Medicine'' and ''Modern Medicine'' were exhibited in the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s "New Horizons in American Art".<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/><ref name="Patton"/>

=====Condition=====

Alston's murals were hung in the Women's Pavilion of the hospital over uncapped [[radiator]]s which caused the paintings to deteriorate from the steam. Plans failed to recap the radiators. In 1959 Alston estimated, in a letter to the [[New York State Department of Public Works|Department of Public Works]], that the conservation would cost $1,500 but the funds were never acquired. In 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr.'s death, Alston was asked to create another mural for the hospital to be placed in a pavilion named after the assassinated [[civil rights]] leader titled ''Man Emerging from the Darkness of Poverty and Ignorance into the Light of a Better World".'' After Alston's death in 1977 a committee was formed, unable to raise funds for conservation on the original murals. In 1991 the [[Municipal Art Society]]'s Adopt-a-Mural program was launched and the Harlem Hospital murals were chosen. A grant from Alston's sister Rousmaniere Wilson and step-sister Aida Bearden Winters assisted in completing a restoration of the works in 1993.<ref name="Pierce"/> In 2005 Harlem Hospital announced a $2 million project to [[art conservation|conserve]] Alston's murals and three other pieces in the original commissioned project as part of a $225 million hospital expansion.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Pierce"/>

====Golden State Mutual Murals====

In the late 1940s Alston became involved in a mural project commissioned by [[Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company]] which asked the artists to create work involving African American contributions to the settling of [[California]]. Alston worked with [[Hale Woodruff]] on the murals in a large studio space in New York where they utilized ladders to reach the upper parts of the canvas.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Patton"/> The artworks, which are considered "priceless contributions to American narrative art", consists of two panels: ''Exploration and Colonization'' by Alston and ''Settlement and Development'' by Woodruff. Alston's piece covers the [[post-colonial]] period of 1527 to 1850. Images of [[James Beckworth]], [[Biddy Mason]], and [[William Leidesdorff]] are portrayed in the well detailed historical mural. While both artists kept in contact with African Americans on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] during its creation, influencing the content and depictions. The murals, which were unveiled in 1949, have been on display in the lobby of the Golden State Mutual Headquarters.<ref name="Wardlaw"/><ref name="Patton"/> Due to [[economic downturn]] Golden State was forced to sell their entire art collection to ward off its mounting debts and as of spring 2011 the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] had offered $750,000 to purchase the artworks which led to a controversy regarding the importance of the artworks which have been estimated to be worth at least $5 million. It was requested that the murals be covered by city landmark protections by the [[Los Angeles Conservancy]]. The state of [[California]] had declined philanthropic proposals to keep the murals in their original location and the Smithsonian withdrew their offer. The murals are currently awaiting their fate in California courts.<ref name="Kahn">{{cite news |title=Smithsonian Plan to Remove Murals From Los Angeles Lobby Is Criticized |author=Eve M.

===Sculpture===

Alston also created sculptures. ''Head of a Woman'' (1957) shows his move towards a "reductive and modern approach to sculpture....where facial features were suggested rather than fully formulated in three dimensions,".<ref name="Wardlaw"/> In 1970 Alston was commissioned by the Community Church of New York to create a bust of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] for $5,000, with limited copies produced.<ref name="Minutes1">Special Committee on the Martin Luther King Bust.

Art critic [[Emily Genauer]] stated that Alston "refused to be pigeonholed", regarding his varied exploration in his artwork.<ref name="Wardlaw"/> Patron Lemoine Pierce said of Alston's work: "Never thought of as an innovative artist, Alston generally ignored popular art trends and violated many mainstream art conventions; he produced abstract and figurative paintings often simultaneously, refusing to be stylistically consistent, and during his 40-year career he worked prolifically and unapologetically in both commercial and fine art." Romare Bearden described Alston as "...one of the most versatile artists whose enormous skill led him to a diversity of styles..." Bearden also describes the professionalism and impact that Alston had on Harlem and the African American community: "'was a consummate artist and a voice in the development of African American art who never doubted the excellence of all people's sensitivity and creative ability. During his long professional career, Alston significantly enriched the cultural life of Harlem. In a profound sense, he was a man who built bridges between Black artists in varying fields, and between other Americans."<ref name="Pierce"/> Writer [[June Jordan]] described Alston as "an American artist of first magnitude, and he is a Black American artist of undisturbed integrity."<ref name="Jordan1">Jordan, June.
