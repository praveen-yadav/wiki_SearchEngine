'''Comparative law''' is the study of differences and similarities between the [[law]] of different countries.  More specifically, it involves study of the different legal systems in existence in the world, including the [[common law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[socialist law]], [[Sharia|Islamic law]], [[Hindu law]], and [[Chinese law]]. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken.  The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, economic globalization and democratization.

==History==
The origins of modern comparative law can be traced back to 18th century Europe, although, prior to that, legal scholars had always practiced comparative methodologies.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Butler|first=William E.|title=Russia and the Law of Nations in Historical Perspective:  Collected Essays|location=London |publisher=Wildy, Simmonds and Hill |year=2008 |isbn=1-884445-42-X |pages=124}}</ref>

[[Montesquieu]] is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, ''[[De l'esprit des lois]]'' (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):<ref>{{cite book|title=The Spirit of the Laws|author=Baron De Montesquieu|place=New York |publisher=Hafner |year=1949}}</ref>

{{quote|[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.

They should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.

They should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.}}

Also, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that "to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety." Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:

[[Image:HSMaine.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Sir [[Henry James Sumner Maine]], British jurist and first professor of comparative law at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].]]
{{quote|As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.}}

The modern founding figure of comparative and [[legal anthropology|anthropological]] jurisprudence was Sir [[Henry Maine]], a British jurist and legal historian.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iEk-Fpdw4MYC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Sir Henry Maine: A Study in Victorian Jurisprudence|author=Raymond Cocks|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34}}</ref> In his 1861 work ''[[Ancient Law|Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas]]'', he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of [[Far East|Eastern]] and [[West]]ern legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in it's historical context and was widely read and influential.  

The first university course on the subject was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.

Comparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, [[Rudolf Schlesinger]].  Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at [[Cornell Law School]] helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.

==Purpose==
Comparative law is an academic study of separate legal systems, each one analysed in its constitutive elements; how they differ in the different legal systems, and how their elements combine into a system.

Several disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative [[constitutional law]], comparative [[administrative law]], comparative [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] (in the sense of the law of [[tort]]s, [[delict]]s, [[contract]]s and [[Law of obligations|obligations]]), comparative [[commercial law]] (in the sense of [[Companies law|business organisations]] and trade), and comparative [[criminal law]]. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. It appears today the principal purposes of comparative law are:

* to attain a deeper knowledge of the legal systems in effect
* to perfect the legal systems in effect
* possibly, to contribute to a unification of legal systems, of a smaller or larger scale (cf. for instance, the [[UNIDROIT]] initiative)

==Importance==
Comparative law is a very important discipline in communication between legal systems. It may provide the basis for the production of bilingual dictionaries that include the information necessary to make legal communication across borders successful. It also helps mutual understanding and the dispelling of prejudice and misinterpretation. In this globalising world, comparative law is important for it provides a platform for intellectual exchange in terms of law and it cultivates a culture of understanding in a diverse world. Furthermore, comparative law helps in broadening horizons for law reformers and legislators around the world. It can also be helpful in international relations in shaping foreign policies.

==Relationship with other legal subjects==
Comparative law is different from the fields of general [[jurisprudence]] (legal theory), [[international law]], including both [[public international law]] and [[private international law]] (also known as [[conflict of laws]]).

Despite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the [[United Nations System]], in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of [[legal transplants]], i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of [[legal transplants]] was coined by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Alan Watson]], one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.

Also, the usefulness of comparative law for [[sociology of law]] (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law may help comparative law answer questions, such as: How do regulations in different legal systems really function in the respective societies? Are certain legal rules comparable? How do the similarities and differences between legal systems get explained?

==Classifications of legal systems==
===Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff===

Arminjon, Nolde, and Wolff<ref>''Traité de droit comparé'' - in French; Paris 1950-1952</ref> believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems ''per se'' get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the
*[[Law of France|French group]], under which they also included the countries that codified their law either in 19th or in the first half of the 20th century, using the [[Napoleonic code|Napoleonic ''code civil'']] of year 1804 as a model; this includes countries and jurisdictions such as [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Louisiana]], states of [[South America]] (such as [[Brazil]]), [[Quebec]], [[Santa Lucia]], [[Romania]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Egypt]], and [[Lebanon]]
*[[Law of Germany|German group]]
*[[Scandinavia]]n group (comprising the laws of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Iceland]])
*[[Common law|English group]] (incl. [[England]], the [[United States law|United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] ''inter alia'')
*[[Russia]]n group
*[[Sharia|Islamic group]] (used in the [[Muslim world]])
*[[Hindu law|Hindu group]]

===David===

David<ref>''Traité élémentaire de droit civile comparé: Introduction à l'étude des droits étrangers et à la méthode comparative'' - in French; Paris, 1950</ref> proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:
*[[Western world|Western]] Laws, a group subdivided into the:
**[[Romano-Germanic law|Romano-Germanic subgroup]] (comprising those legal systems where legal science was formulated according to [[Roman Law]] - see also [[Civil law (legal system)]])
**[[Common law|Anglo-Saxon subgroup]]
*[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Law
*[[Sharia|Muslim Law]]
*[[Hindu law|Hindu Law]]
*[[Chinese law|Chinese Law]]

Especially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas [[common law]] countries are those where law was created from the [[judge]]s. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are
*liberal democracy
*capitalist economy
*Christian religion

===Zweigert and Kötz===
Zweigert and Kötz<ref>''An Introduction to Comparative Law'', translation from the German original: T. Weir, 3rd edition; Oxford, 1998</ref> propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:

*[[Roman law|Roman family]]
*[[Law of Germany|German family]]
*[[Common law|Common law family]]
*[[Scandinavia|Nordic]] family
*Family of the laws of the [[Far East]] ([[Chinese law|China]] and [[Japan]])
*Religious family ([[Sharia|Muslim]] and [[Hindu law|Hindu]] law)
