The '''Kennedy family''' is a prominent family in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] and government, descending from Irish farmer John Kennedy and wife Bridget Shallow. John and Bridget's son James Kennedy inherited his father's farm. James and his wife Maria were the parents of four children, including [[Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858)|Patrick Kennedy]]. Patrick, also a farmer, met his wife Bridget Murphy while they were sailing from Ireland to America. Patrick and Bridget were the parents of businessman/politician [[P. J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph "P.J." Kennedy]]. P.J. and his wife Mary Augusta Hickey were the parents of U.S. England Ambassador [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.|Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy, Sr.]]. Joe and [[Rose Kennedy|Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald]] were the parents of World War II casualty [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joseph Patrick "Joe" Kennedy, Jr.]], President [[John F. Kennedy|John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy]], Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy]], and longtime Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Moore "Ted" Kennedy]]. The Kennedy's political involvement has revolved around the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. [[Harvard University]] educations have been common among them, and they have contributed heavily to that university's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. The wealth, glamor, and photogenic quality of the family members, as well as their extensive and continuing involvement in public service, has elevated them to [[Cultural icon|iconic]] status over the past half-century, with the Kennedys sometimes referred to as "America's Royal Family".

Joe Sr. originally pinned his hopes on eldest son Joe Jr. to enter politics and be elected president. After Joe Jr. was killed in [[World War II]], those hopes then fell on his second eldest son Jack, to become president. Soon after Jack was elected President in November 1960, he, Bobby, and Ted all held prominent positions in the federal government. They received intense publicity, often emphasizing their relative youth, allure, education, and future in politics. From 1947, when Jack became a member of Congress, to 2011, when Ted's son [[Patrick J. Kennedy|Patrick Joseph Kennedy II]] departed Congress, there were 64 years with a Kennedy in elective office in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] (excluding a short gap of less than a month in between Jack resigning his Senate seat prior to his inauguration as President). This spans more than a quarter of the nation's existence.<ref name="bg021310">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2010/02/13/pondering_a_congress_without_kennedys/ |title=Pondering a Congress without Kennedys |first=Michael |last=Levenson |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=February 13, 2010 }}</ref>

The family has suffered numerous tragedies, contributing to the idea of "[[Kennedy tragedies|the Kennedy curse]]". [[Rosemary Kennedy|Rose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy]] suffered a failed [[lobotomy]]. [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Jack]] and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby]] were both assassinated. Ted was involved in the [[Chappaquiddick incident]]. [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joe, Jr.]], [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Kathleen Agnes "Kick" Kennedy]] and [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.|John Fitzgerald "John-John" Kennedy, Jr.]] were killed in plane crashes (Ted was also involved in a plane crash, but survived). Most recently, [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.|Robert Francis Kennedy, Jr.]]'s second wife Mary Kathleen Richardson committed suicide on May 16, 2012.
