An '''armoured fighting vehicle''' (or '''armored fighting vehicle''' - [[American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-our.2C_-or|see spelling differences]])  '''AFV''' is a [[combat vehicle]], protected by strong [[vehicle armour|armour]] and armed with [[weapon]]s, which combines [[operational mobility]], [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], and [[defense (military)|defensive]] capabilities. AFVs can be wheeled or tracked. It is not uncommon for AFVs to be simply referred to as "armour" (or "armor").

Armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics. This classification is not absolute; at different times different countries will classify the same vehicle in different roles. For example, [[armoured personnel carrier]]s were generally replaced by [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s in a similar role, but the latter has some capabilities lacking in the former. There may also be hybrid vehicles, such as the [[Stryker]] family of AFVs; the [[M1128 Mobile Gun System]], an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]] which mounts a large 105mm gun normally used in [[tank destroyer]]s, but can theoretically be reconfigured to the [[M1126 Infantry Carrier Vehicle]].

Successful general-purpose armoured fighting vehicles often also serve as the base of a whole family of specialized vehicles, for example, the [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] and [[MT-LB]] tracked carriers, and the [[MOWAG Piranha]] wheeled AFV.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}
Prior to the invention of the internal combustion engine, there were numerous examples of 'armoured fighting vehicles' - that is to say protected machines used for war fighting. Some examples were powered by man-power alone, whereas others used the horse to provide motive power.

=== Human-powered AFVs ===
{{main|Siege engines}}
The '''siege engine''' were amongst the first armoured machines - [[battering rams]] would often be armoured in order to protect the crews from the defenders, who might use incendiaries, chemicals, explosives, and other projectile attacks to try to prevent the attack. In [[History of China|Ancient China]], the '''Dongwu Che''' (Chinese: 洞屋车) was a kind of mobile armoured cart used from the 5th century BCE. It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield - a sort of early APC.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed a form of AFV in the 15th century -  his drawings of what some describe as a "tank" show a man-powered, wheeled vehicle with cannons all around it.<ref>{{citation |title=The Art of War: Leonardo's War Machines |url=http://leonardo-war-machines.com}}{{Self-published inline|date=May 2012}}</ref> However the human crew would not have enough power to move it over larger distance, and usage of animals was problematic in a space so confined.

=== Horse-drawn AFVs===
{{main|Carriage|Chariot|Tachanka|War elephant|War wagon}}
The earliest successful AFVs were a wide range of "armoured carriages" whose designs historically struggled between exposed-lightweight rapid-mobility, and cumbersome-yet-effective protection.

The '''chariot''' was used for war as "battle taxis" and mobile archery platforms, as well as more peaceable pursuits such as hunting or racing for sport, and as a chief vehicle of many ancient peoples, when speed of travel was desired rather than how much weight could be carried. The original chariot was a fast, light, open, two-wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more [[horses]] that were hitched side by side. The car was little more than a floor with a waist-high semicircular guard in front. The chariot, driven by a charioteer, was used for [[ancient warfare]] during the [[Bronze Age|bronze]] and the [[Iron Age|iron]] ages.  Armor was limited to a shield. The vehicle was used for [[travel]], in [[parade|processions]], [[game]]s, and [[Chariot racing|races]] after it had been superseded by other vehicles for military purposes.

The '''war wagon''' was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] development during the [[Hussite Wars]] around 1420 by [[Hussite]] forces rebelling in [[Bohemia]]. It was a heavy wagon given protective sides with firing slits and heavy firepower from either a cannon or a force of hand-gunners and crossbowmen, supported by [[infantry]] using pikes and flails.  Groups of them could form defensive works, but they also were used as hardpoints for Hussite formations or as firepower in pincer movements. This early use of gunpowder and innovative tactics helped a largely peasant infantry stave off attacks by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] larger forces of mounted knights.

The war wagon is similar to the [[Korea]]n [[Hwacha]], which was first produced in 1407 by the order of ''[[King Sejong]] the Great'' {{fact|date=September 2013}} during the early [[Joseon Dynasty]].

The [[tachanka]] was a horse-drawn [[machine gun]] platform, usually a cart or an open wagon with a [[heavy machine gun]] installed in the back.  A tachanka could be pulled by two to four horses and required a crew of two or three (one driver and a machine gun crew). A number of sources attribute its invention to [[Nestor Makhno]].<ref>William Henry Chamberlin, ''Russia's Iron Age'', Ayer Publishing, 1970, p201; V. Rapoport, Y. Alekseev, V. G.

===Modern AFVs===
{{main|:Category:Armoured fighting vehicles before World War I}}
The first modern AFVs were [[armored car (military)|armoured cars]], dating back virtually to the invention of the [[motor car]].  The [[Davidson Automobile Battery armored car]], [[Davidson-Duryea gun carriage]] and [[Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902]] were early attempts to make a machine gun mobile and provide some degree of protection for the vehicle and occupants. Armoured cars were largely used as scouting vehicles, and were armoured to protect the crew. The development of the AFV continued into [[World War I]], when the tracked [[tank]] was introduced on the Western Front - a machine that was armoured because it had to cross ground under fire from machine guns, had  guns to engage the same machine guns and tracks to cross ground broken up by shellfire and trenches. The tank proved highly successful, and as technology improved the tank became a weapon that could cross large distances at much higher speeds than supporting [[infantry]] and [[artillery]]. The need to provide the units that would fight alongside the tank led to the development of the wide range of AFVs that exist today, with most armies having vehicles to carry infantry, artillery and [[anti-aircraft weapon]]ry by the end of [[World War II]]. Most modern AFVs are superficially similar in design to their World War II counterparts, with significantly better armour, weapons, engines and suspension - however with an increase in the capacity of [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] allowing AFVs to be practically transported by air, many armies are replacing some or all of their traditional heavy vehicles with lighter airmobile versions, often with wheels instead of tracks.

== Design ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

=== Armour ===
{{Main|Aramid|Bulletproof glass|Twaron|Vehicle armour}}
The level of armour protection between AFVs varies greatly - a [[main battle tank]] will normally be designed to take hits from other tank guns and anti-tank [[missile#Anti-tank|missiles]], whilst light [[reconnaissance]] vehicles are often only armoured "just in case". Whilst heavier armour provides better protection, it makes vehicles less mobile (for a given engine power), limits its air-transportability, increases cost, uses more fuel and may limit the places it can go - for example, many bridges may be unable to support the weight of a main battle tank. A trend toward [[composite armour]] is taking place in place of steel - composites are stronger for a given weight, allowing the tank to be lighter for the same protection as steel armour, or better protected for the same weight. Armour is being supplemented with [[active protection system]]s on a number of vehicles, allowing the AFV to protect itself from incoming projectiles.

The level of protection also usually varies considerably throughout the individual vehicle too, depending on the role of the vehicle and the likely direction of attack. For example, a main battle tank will usually have the heaviest armour on the hull front and the turret, lighter armour on the sides of the hull and the thinnest armour on the top and bottom of the tank. Other vehicles - such as the [[MRAP]] family - may be primarily armoured against the threat from [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and so will have heavy, [[sloped armour]] on the bottom of the hull.

=== Weaponry ===
Weaponry varies by a very wide degree between AFVs - lighter vehicles for infantry carrying, reconnaissance or specialist roles may have only a [[machine gun]] for self-defence (or no armament at all), whereas heavy [[self propelled artillery]] will carry large guns, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] or [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]] launchers. These weapons may be mounted on a [[weapon mount#Pintle|pintle]], affixed directly to the vehicle or placed in a [[gun turret|turret]] or cupola.

The greater the recoil a weapon on an AFV is, the larger the turret ring needs to be. A larger turret ring necessitates a larger vehicle. To avoid listing to the side, turrets are usually located at the centre of the vehicle on vehicles that are capable of amphibious operations.<ref name="Brassey's">{{cite book|title=Brassey's encyclopedia of land forces and warfare|year=1996|publisher=Brassey's|isbn=1-57488-087-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ipz0AzERg_MC&dq=%22Main+battle+tank%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor=Franklin D. Margiotta|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Grenade launcher]]s provide a versatile launch platform for a plethora of munitions including, [[Smoke grenade|smoke]], phosphorus, tear gas, illumination, anti-personnel, infrared and radar-jamming rounds.<ref name="Brassey's" />

Turret stabilization is an important capability because it enables firing on the move and prevents crew fatigue.

===Engine===
Modern AFVs have primarily used either petrol (gasoline) or diesel piston engines. More recently gas turbines have been used. Most early AFVs used [[petrol engine]]s, as they offer a good [[power-to-weight ratio]].  However, they fell out of favour during [[World War Two]] due to the flammability of the fuel.

Most current AFVs are powered by a [[diesel engine]]; modern technology including the use of [[turbocharger|turbo-charging]] help to overcome the lower power-to-weight ratio of diesel engines compared to petrol.

[[Gas turbine]] (turboshaft) engines offer a very high power-to-weight ratio and were starting to find favour in the late 20th century - however they offer very poor fuel consumption and as such some armies are switching from gas turbines back to diesel engines (i.e. the Russian [[T-80]] used a gas turbine engine, whereas the later [[T-90]] does not).  The US [[M1 Abrams]] is a notable example of a gas turbine powered tank.

== Modern classification by type and role ==
Notable armoured fighting vehicles extending from post-World War I to today.

=== Tank ===

{{Main|Main battle tank|Tank classification}}

The [[tank]] is an all terrain AFV designed primarily to engage enemy forces by the use of [[indirect fire|direct fire]] in the frontal assault role. Though several configurations have been tried, particularly in the early experimental days of tank development, a standard, mature design configuration has since emerged to a generally accepted pattern. This features a main [[artillery]] [[gun]], mounted in a fully rotating [[turret]] atop a tracked automotive hull, with various additional machine guns throughout.

Philosophically, the tank is, by its very nature, an offensive weapon.  Being a protective encasement with at least one gun position, it is essentially a [[Pillbox (military)|pillbox]] or small [[fortress]] (though these are static fortifications of a purely defensive nature) that can move toward the enemy - hence its offensive utility.

Historically, tanks are divided into three categories: 
* [[Light tank]]s - small, thinly armoured, weakly gunned; superior Tactical/Strategic mobility tanks intended for the armoured reconnaissance role; many are losing favor to cheaper, faster, lighter [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] and [[tank destroyer]]s, however light tanks (or similar vehicles with other names) are still in service with a number of forces as reconnaissance vehicles, most notably the [[Russian Marines]] with the [[Pt76]], [[British Army]] with the [[FV107 Scimitar|Scimitar]] and the [[Chinese Army]] with the [[Type 63 (tank)|Type 63]].
* [[Medium tank]]s - mid-sized, adequately armoured, respectably gunned, fairly mobile tanks; intended to provide an optimum balance of characteristics for maneuver combat; primarily used against hostile tanks and other AFV's.
* [[Heavy tank]]s - large, thickly armoured, powerfully gunned, but barely mobile "[[Siegeworks]]" tanks; intended for the breakthrough role against fortified lines, particularly in support of infantry formations.

[[Cavalry tank]], [[cruiser tank]], [[infantry tank]], and [[breakthrough tank]] have been used by various countries to classify tanks by operational role. [[Tankette]] is used to describe particularly small one or two-man vehicles, typically armed with a machine gun and/or anti-air weapons.

A modern [[Main battle tank#Main battle tank (late twentieth century)|main battle tank]] incorporates advances in automotive, artillery, and armour technology to combine the best characteristics of the historic medium and heavy tanks into a single, all around type. It is distinguished by its high level of firepower, mobility and armour protection relative to other vehicles of its era. It can cross comparatively rough terrain at high speeds, but its heavy-dependency on fuel, maintenance, and ammunition-hungry makes it [[Military logistics|logistically]] demanding. It has the heaviest [[Vehicle armour|armour]] of any IFV on the battlefield, and carries a powerful [[precision-guided munition]] weapon systems that may be able to engage a wide variety of both ground targets and air targets. It is among the most versatile and fearsome weapons on the battlefield, valued for its [[fear|shock action]] against other troops and high [[survivability]], although it can be still be vulnerable to [[anti-tank warfare]].

==== Tankette ====

{{Main|Tankette}}

A tankette is a tracked armed and armoured vehicle<ref>''[http://www.tedescos.com/Pages/VJ/monograph2.pdf The Revolution After Next: Making Vertical Envelopment by Operationally Significant Mobile Protected Forces a Reality in the First Decade of the 21st Century]'', Tedesco, Vincent J.

Colloquially it may also simply mean a  "small tank".<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=c-Xv836lmxgC&pg=PA221&dq=tankette&lr=&as_brr=3&sig=bTAJf-EZEtasWlvgTNCBCy2jIlQ#PPA221,M1 ''War Slang: American Fighting Words and Phrases Since the Civil War''] (book excerpt via Google Books), Dickson, Paul; [[Brassey's]], 2004, Page 221)</ref>
 
Tankettes were designed and built by several nations between the 1920s and 1940s. They were very popular with smaller countries. Some saw some combat (with limited success) in [[World War II]]. However, the vulnerability of their light armour eventually caused the concept to be abandoned.
{{clear}}

==== Super-heavy tanks ====

{{Main|Super-heavy tank|Landship}}
[[Image:T-28-1.jpg|thumb|American [[T28 Super Heavy Tank]]]]

The term "super-heavy tank" has been used to describe armoured fighting vehicles of extreme size, generally over 75 tonnes. Programs have been initiated on several occasions with the aim of creating an invincible [[siegeworks]]/[[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] vehicle for penetrating enemy formations and fortifications without fear of being destroyed in combat. Examples were designed in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], along with a few in the [[Cold War]]. However, the immense size made most designs impracticable, few examples have ever been built, and there is no clear evidence any of these vehicles saw combat. 
{{clear}}

==== Flame tank ====
[[File:Churchill Crocodile 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Churchill Crocodile]] flame tank]]

{{Main|Flame tank}}
A ''' flame tank''' is a [[tank]] equipped with a [[flamethrower]], most commonly used to supplement [[combined arms]] attacks against [[fortifications]], confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the [[Second World War]], during which the United States, [[Soviet Union]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Italy]], Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks.

A number of production methods were used. The flamethrowers used were either modified versions of existing infantry flame weapons (Flammpanzer I and II) or specially designed (Flammpanzer III). They were mounted externally (Flammpanzer II), replaced existing machine gun mounts, or replaced the tank's main armament (Flammpanzer III). Fuel for the flame weapon was either carried inside the tank, in armoured external storage, or in some cases in a special trailer behind the tank ([[Churchill Crocodile]]).

Flame tanks have been superseded by [[thermobaric weapons]] such as the Russian [[TOS-1]].

=== Armoured car ===
{{main|Armored car (military)}}

The military's armoured car is a wheeled armoured vehicle, generally lighter than other armoured fighting vehicles, primarily being armoured and/or armed for self-defence of the occupants. Other multi-axled wheeled military vehicles can be quite large, and actually be superior to some smaller tracked vehicles in terms of armour and armament. They usually do not have attached weaponry. Armoured cars are often used in military marches and processions, or for the escorting of important figures.
{{clear}}

==== Aerosani ====
{{main|Aerosani}}

An ''aerosani'' ({{lang-ru |aэросани}}, literally "aerosled") is a type of propeller-driven [[snowmobile]], running on skis, used for communications, mail deliveries, medical aid, emergency recovery and border patrolling in northern [[Russia]], as well as for recreation. Aerosanis were used by the Soviet [[Red Army]] during the [[Winter War]] and [[World War II]].

The first aerosanis may have been built by young [[Igor Sikorsky]] in 1909–10, before he built multi-engine airplanes and helicopters. They were very light [[plywood]] vehicles on skis, propelled by old airplane engines and propellers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/propsleigh/propsleigh.htm |title=The Propeller-Driven Sleigh |publisher=SelfSite |date=26 July 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-11}}</ref>
{{clear}}

==== Scout car ====
{{main|Scout car}}

A '''scout car''' is a of military armored [[reconnaissance vehicle]], capable of off-road mobility and often carrying mounted weapons such as [[machine gun]]s for offensive capabilities and crew protection. They often only carry an operational crew aboard, which differentiates them from wheeled [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs) and [[Infantry Mobility Vehicle]]s (IMVs), but early scout cars, such as the open-topped US [[M3 Scout Car]] could carry a crew of seven. The term is often used synonymously with the more general term [[Armored car (military)|armored car]], which also includes armored civilian vehicles. They are also differentiated by being designed and built for purpose, as opposed to improved [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]] which might serve in the same role.
{{clear}}

==== Internal security vehicle ====
{{main|Internal security vehicle}}

An internal security vehicle (ISV), also known as an armoured security vehicle (ASV), is a combat vehicle used for supporting contingency operations. Security vehicles are typically armed with a turreted [[heavy machine gun]] and auxiliary [[medium machine gun]]. The vehicle is designed to minimize firepower dead space and the vehicles weapons can be depressed to a maximum of 12°. [[Non-lethal weapon|Non-lethal]] [[water cannon]]s and [[tear gas]] cannons can provide suppressive fire in lieu of unnecessary deadly fire.<ref name="Brassey's">{{cite book|title=Brassey's encyclopedia of land forces and warfare|year=1996|publisher=Brassey's|isbn=1-57488-087-X|pages=56, 57|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ipz0AzERg_MC&vq=isbn&dq=%22internal+security+vehicle%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Franklin D. Margiotta|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref>

The vehicle must be protected against weapons typical of riots. Protection from [[incendiary device]]s is achieved though coverage of the air intake and exhaust ports as well as a strong locking mechanism on the fuel opening. Turret and door locks prevent access to the interior of the vehicle by rioters. Vision blocks, ballistic glass and window shutters and outside [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance cameras]] allow protected observation from within the vehicle. Wheeled 4x4 and 6x6 configurations are typical of security vehicles. Tracked security vehicles are often cumbersome and leave negative political connotations for being perceived as an imperial invading force.
{{clear}}

==== Improvised fighting vehicle ====
{{main|Improvised vehicle armour|Improvised fighting vehicle|Gun truck|Technical (vehicle)}}

An improvised fighting vehicle is a combat vehicle resulting from modifications to a civilian or military non-combat vehicle in order to give it a fighting capability. Such modifications usually consist of the grafting of [[Vehicle armour|armour plating]] and [[weapon systems]]. Various militaries have procured such vehicles, ever since the introduction of the first [[automobile]]s into military service.

During the early days, the absence of a doctrine for the military use of automobiles or of an industry dedicated to producing them, lead to much improvisation in the creation of early [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]s, and other such vehicles. Later, despite the advent of [[arms industry|arms industries]] in many countries, several armies still resorted to using ad hoc contraptions, often in response to unexpected military situations, or as a result of the development of new [[Military tactics|tactics]] for which no available vehicle was suitable. The construction of improvised fighting vehicles may also reflect a lack of means for the force that uses them. This is especially true in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where various armies and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces have used them, as they are more affordable than military-grade combat vehicles.

Modern examples include '''military gun truck''' used by units of regular armies or other official government armed forces, based on a conventional cargo [[truck]], that is able to carry a large weight of weapons and armour. They have mainly been used by regular armies to escort military convoys in regions subject to ambush by [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces. "[[Narco tank]]s", used by [[Mexico|Mexican]] drug cartels in the [[Mexican Drug War]], are built from such trucks, which combines [[operational mobility]], [[Military tactics|tactical]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], and [[defense (military)|defensive]] capabilities.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13488620</ref><ref>http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2011/05/narco-tank-vehicles-cartels-drug-war-mexico.html</ref><ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110606/wl_afp/mexicocrimedrugweapons</ref><ref>http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/01/18/mexican-cartels-moving-drugs-in-armored-vehicles/</ref>

=== Troop Carriers===

Troop-carrying AFVs are divided into two main types - armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). The main difference between the two is down to their intended role - the APC is designed purely to transport troops and is armed for self-defence only - whereas the IFV is designed to provide fire support to the infantry it carries.

==== Infantry fighting vehicle ====

{{Main|Infantry fighting vehicle}}

An '''infantry fighting vehicle''' ('''IFV'''), also known as a '''mechanized infantry combat vehicle''' ('''MICV'''), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry [[infantry]] into battle and provide [[Direct fire|direct]] [[fire support]].<ref name=McNab>{{cite book|title=Combat Techniques: An Elite Forces Guide to Modern Infantry Tactics|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-36824-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f3YaVQR7x5QC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Martin J. Dougherty, Chris McNab |accessdate=5 March 2011}}</ref> The first example of an IFV was the West German [[Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30]] which served in the [[Bundeswehr]] from 1958 until the early 1980s..

IFVs are similar to [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs) and [[infantry carrier vehicle]]s (ICVs), designed to transport a [[Section (military unit)|section]] or [[squad]] of infantry (generally between five and ten men) and their equipment.  They are differentiated from APCs— which are purely "troop-transport" vehicles armed only for self-defense— because they are designed to give direct fire support to the dismounted infantry and so usually have significantly enhanced armament. IFVs also often have improved [[vehicle armour|armour]] and some have firing ports (allowing the infantry to fire [[firearms|personal weapons]] while mounted).

They are typically armed with an [[autocannon]] of 20 to 40mm calibre, 7.62mm machine guns, [[anti-tank missile]]s (ATGMs) and/or [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAGMs).  IFVs are usually [[Caterpillar track|tracked]], but some wheeled vehicles fall into this category.  IFVs are generally less heavily armed and armoured than [[main battle tank]]s. They sometimes carry [[anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] missiles to protect and support infantry against armoured threats, such as the NATO [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missile and Soviet [[9M117 Bastion|Bastion]], which offer a significant threat to tanks. Specially-equipped IFVs have taken on some of the roles of light tanks; they are used by reconnaissance organizations, and light IFVs are used by airborne units which must be able to fight without the heavy firepower of tanks.
{{clear}}

==== Armoured personnel carrier ====

{{Main|Armoured personnel carrier}}

[[Armoured personnel carrier]]s are intended to carry infantry quickly and relatively safely to point where they are deployed. In 1918, the British [[Mk V tank#Mark V series|Mk V tank]] was capable of carrying a small number of troops. In the US the term "Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV)" is used. In 1944, the Canadian general [[Guy Simonds]] ordered the conversion of redundant armoured vehicles to carry troops (generically named "[[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroo]]s"). This proved highly successful, even without training, and the concept was widely used in the [[21st Army Group]]. Post-war, specialised designs were built, such as the Soviet [[BTR-60]] and US [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]].
{{clear}}

==== Infantry mobility vehicle ====

{{Main|Infantry mobility vehicle|MRAP}}

An infantry mobility vehicle (IMV) or protected patrol vehicle (PPV) is a wheeled [[armored personnel carrier]] (APC) serving as a military patrol, reconnaissance or security vehicle.  Examples include the [[ATF Dingo]], [[AMZ Dzik]], [[AMZ Tur]], [[Mungo ESK]], and [[Bushmaster IMV]]. This term also applies to the vehicles currently being fielded as part of the [[MRAP|MRAP program]].

IMVs were developed in response to the threats of modern counter insurgency warfare, with an emphasis on [[Ambush]] Protection and [[Improvised Explosive Device|Mine]]-Resistance. Similar vehicles existed long before the term IMV was coined, such as the French [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé|VAB]] and South African [[Buffel]]. The term is coming more into use to differentiate light 4x4 wheeled APCs from the traditional 8x8 wheeled APCs. It is a [[neologism]] for what might have been classified in the past as an armoured [[scout car]], such as the [[BRDM]], but the IMV is distinguished by having a requirement to carry dismountable infantry. The up-armoured [[M1114]] Humvee variant can be seen as an adaptation of the unarmoured Humvee to serve in the IMV role.

=== Amphibious vehicles ===

[[File:AAV-australia.jpg|thumb|right|Two U.S. Marine Corps [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle]]s emerge from the surf onto the sand of [[Freshwater Beach]], Australia.]]
{{Main|Amphibious vehicle#Armored|Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault|Landing craft}}

Many modern military vehicles, ranging from light wheeled command and reconnaissance, through [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and [[tanks]], are manufactured with amphibious capabilities. Contemporary wheeled armoured amphibians include the French [[Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé]] and [[Véhicule Blindé Léger]]. The latter is a small, lightly armoured [[4x4]] all-terrain vehicle that is fully amphibious and can swim at 5.4&nbsp;km/h. The VAB (''Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé'' - "Armoured Vanguard Vehicle") is a fully amphibious [[armoured personnel carrier]] powered in the water by two water jets, that entered service in 1976 and produced in numerous configurations, ranging from basic personnel carrier, anti-tank missile platform.

During the [[Cold War]] the [[Soviet bloc]] states developed a number of amphibious APCs, fighting vehicles and tanks, both wheeled and tracked. Most of the vehicles the Soviets designed were amphibious, or could ford deep water. Wheeled examples are the [[BRDM-1]] and [[BRDM-2]] [[4x4]] armoured scout cars, as well as the [[BTR-60]], [[BTR-70]], [[BTR-80]] and [[BTR-94]] [[8x8]] armoured personnel carriers and the [[BTR-90]] infantry fighting vehicle.

The United States started developing a long line of [[Landing Vehicle Tracked]] (LVT) designs from ca. 1940. The US Marine Corps currently uses the AAV7-A1 [[Assault Amphibious Vehicle]], which was to be succeeded by the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], which was capable of planing on water and can achieve water speeds of 37–46&nbsp;km/h.  The EFV project has been cancelled.

A significant amount of tracked armoured vehicles that are primarily intended for land-use, have some amphibious cability, tactically useful inland, reducing dependence on bridges. They use their tracks, sometimes with added propeller or water jets for propulsion. As long as the banks have a shallow enough slopes to enter or leave the water they can cross rivers and water obstacles.

Some heavy tanks can operate amphibiously with a fabric skirt to add [[buoyancy]]. The [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] [[DD tank]] used in the [[Normandy landings]] had this setup. When in water the waterproof float screen was raised and propellers deployed. Some modern vehicles use a similar skirt.

=== Armoured engineering vehicle ===
{{Main|Military engineering vehicle}}
Typically based on the platform of a main battle tank, these vehicles go by different names depending upon the country of use or manufacture.  In the US the term "combat engineer vehicle (CEV)" is used, in the UK the term "[[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]] (AVRE)" is used, while in Canada and other commonwealth nations the term "armoured engineer vehicle (AEV)" is used.  There is no set template for what such a vehicle will look like, yet likely features include a large dozer blade or mine ploughs, a large calibre demolition cannon, augers, winches, excavator arms and cranes, or lifting booms.

These vehicles are designed to directly conduct obstacle breaching operations and to conduct other earth-moving and engineering work on the battlefield.  Good examples of this type of vehicle include the UK [[Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|Trojan AVRE]], the Russian IMR, and the US [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].

It should be noted that while the term "armoured engineer vehicle" is used specifically to describe these multi-purpose tank-based engineering vehicles, that term is also used more generically in British and Commonwealth militaries to describe all heavy tank-based engineering vehicles used in the support of mechanized forces.  Thus, "armoured engineer vehicle" used generically would refer to AEV, AVLB, Assault Breachers, and so on.

==== Assault breacher vehicle ====
{{Main|Assault Breacher Vehicle}}

An '''assault breacher vehicle (ABV)''', also known as a '''explosive ordnance disposal vehicle (EODV)''', or simply '''Breacher''', is especially designed to clear pathways for troops and other vehicles through [[minefields]] and along [[roadside bomb]]s and [[Improvised Explosive Device]]s. These vehicles are based on a tank-chassis with 1,500+ horsepower engines, but fitted with a 50-caliber machine gun and a front-mounted 5-meter-wide plow, supported by metallic skis that glide on the dirt and typically equipped with at least 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms) of [[Mine Clearing Line Charge]]s: rockets carrying [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] explosives up to 100–150 meters forward, detonating hidden bombs at a safe distance, so that troops and vehicles can pass through safely.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021101755.html "Marines push 'The Breacher' against Taliban lines"]</ref> They were called ''"the answer"'' to the deadliest threat facing NATO troops in modern asymmetrical conflict.

==== Armoured bulldozer ====
{{Main|Armored bulldozer}}

The '''armored [[bulldozer]]''' is a basic tool of [[combat engineering]]. These [[combat engineering vehicle]]s combine the earth moving capabilities of the bulldozer with armor which protects the vehicle and its operator in or near combat. Most are civilian bulldozers modified by addition of [[vehicle armor]]/military equipment, but some are [[tank]]s stripped of armament and fitted with a dozer blade. Some tanks have bulldozer blades while retaining their armament, but this does not make them armored bulldozers as such, because combat remains the primary role — earth moving is a secondary task.
{{clear}}

==== Armoured recovery vehicle ====
{{Main|Armoured recovery vehicle}}

An '''armoured recovery vehicle''' ('''ARV''') is a type of [[Vehicle recovery (military)|vehicle recovery]] armoured fighting vehicle used to repair battle- or mine-damaged as well as broken-down armoured vehicles during combat, or to tow them out of the danger zone for more extensive repairs. To this end the term ''"Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle" (ARRV)'' is also used.

ARVs are normally built on the [[chassis]] of a [[main battle tank]] (MBT), but some are also constructed on the basis of other armoured fighting vehicles, mostly [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs). ARVs are usually built on the basis of a vehicle in the same class as they are supposed to recover; a tank-based ARV is used to recover tanks, while an APC-based one recovers APCs, but does not have the power to tow a much heavier tank.

==== Armoured vehicle-launched bridge ====
{{Main|Armoured vehicle-launched bridge}}

An '''armoured vehicle-launched bridge''' ('''AVLB''') is a combat support vehicle, sometimes regarded as a subtype of [[combat engineering vehicle]], designed to assist militaries in rapidly deploying [[tank]]s and other armoured fighting vehicles across rivers. The AVLB is usually a tracked vehicle converted from a tank chassis to carry a folding metal bridge instead of  weapons. The AVLB's job is to allow armoured or infantry units to cross water, when a river too deep for vehicles to wade through is reached, and no bridge is conveniently located (or sufficiently sturdy, a substantial concern when moving 60-ton tanks).

The bridge layer unfolds and launches its cargo, providing a ready-made bridge across the obstacle in only minutes. Once the span has been put in place, the AVLB vehicle detaches from the bridge, and moves aside to allow traffic to pass. Once all of the vehicles have crossed, it crosses the bridge itself and reattaches to the bridge on the other side. It then retracts the span ready to move off again. A similar procedure can be employed to allow crossings of small chasms or similar obstructions. AVLBs can carry bridges of 60 feet (19 metres) or greater in length. By using a tank chassis, the bridge layer is able to cover the same terrain as [[main battle tank]]s, and the provision of armour allows them to operate even in the face of enemy fire. However, this is not a universal attribute: some exceptionally sturdy 6x6 or 8x8 truck chassis have lent themselves to bridge-layer applications.

==== Combat engineer section carriers ====
The '''combat engineer section carriers''' are used to transport [[sapper]]s ([[combat engineer]]s) and can be fitted with a [[bulldozer]]'s blade and other mine-breaching devices. They are often used as APCs because of their carrying ability and heavy protection. They are usually armed with [[machine gun]]s and grenade launchers and usually tracked to provide enough tractive force to push blades and rakes. Some examples are the U.S. [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M113 APC]], [[IDF Puma]], [[Nagmachon]], Husky, and U.S. [[M1132 Engineer Support Vehicle|M1132 ESV]] (a [[Stryker]] variant).

=== Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon ===
[[File:Gepard 1a2 overview.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flakpanzer Gepard]], Germany]]
{{Main|Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon}}

An anti-aircraft vehicle, also known as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon (SPAA) or self-propelled air defense system (SPAD), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. The Russian equivalent of SPAAG is ZSU (from ''zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka''  - "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount"). Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, larger guns, or missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment. Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly-traversing turret with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.

=== Self-propelled artillery ===
{{Main|Self-propelled artillery|Self-propelled gun}}

Self-propelled [[artillery]] vehicles give mobility to [[artillery]]. Within the term are covered [[self-propelled gun]]s (or [[howitzer]]s) and [[rocket artillery]]. They are highly mobile, usually based on tracked chassis carrying either a large howitzer or other field gun or alternatively a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range [[indirect-fire|indirect]] bombardment support on the battlefield.

In the past, self-propelled artillery has included direct fire vehicles such as [[assault gun]]s and [[tank destroyer]]s (also known as self-propelled anti-tank guns). These have been heavily armoured vehicles, the former providing close fire-support for infantry and the latter acting as specialized anti-tank vehicles.

Modern self-propelled artillery vehicles may superficially resemble tanks, but they are generally lightly armoured, too lightly to survive in direct-fire combat. However, they protect their crews against [[shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and small arms and are therefore usually included as armoured fighting vehicles. Many are equipped with [[machine gun]]s for defence against enemy infantry.

The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster.  Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought — usually towed — to the new location. By comparison self-propelled artillery in combination with modern communications can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.

Conversely, towed artillery was and remains cheaper to build and maintain. It is also lighter and can be taken to places that self-propelled guns cannot reach, so despite the advantages of the self-propelled artillery, towed guns remain in the [[arsenal]]s of many modern armies.

==== Assault gun carriage ====
[[Image:Su76 nn.jpg|thumb|The Soviet [[SU-76]] was easily constructed in small factories incapable of producing proper tanks.]]
{{Main|Assault gun}}

An assault gun is a gun or howitzer mounted on a motor vehicle or armoured chassis, designed for use in the [[direct fire]] role in support of [[infantry]] when attacking other infantry or [[fortified]] positions.

Historically the custom-built fully armored assault guns usually mounted the gun or howitzer in a fully enclosed [[casemate]] on a tank chassis. The use of a casemate instead of a [[gun turret]] limited these weapons [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]], but allowed a larger gun to be fitted relative to the chassis, more armour to be fitted for the same weight, and provided a cheaper construction. The increased space and reduced weight of the turretless design also allowed for the mounting of a larger weapon and heavier frontal armour on any given chassis. In most cases, these turretless vehicles also presented a lower profile as a target for the enemy.

==== Mortar carrier ====
[[File:Stryker MCV-B.jpg|thumb|An American [[M1129 Mortar Carrier]]]]
{{Main|Mortar carrier}}

A mortar carrier is a [[self-propelled artillery]] vehicle carrying a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] as its primary weapon. Mortar carriers cannot be fired while on the move and some must be dismounted to fire. In U.S. Army doctrine, mortar carriers provide close and immediate indirect fire support for maneuver units while allowing for rapid displacement and quick reaction to the tactical situation. The ability to relocate not only allows fire support to be provided where it is needed faster but also allows these units to avoid [[counter-battery fire]]. Mortar carriers have traditionally avoided direct contact with the enemy. Many units report never using secondary weapons in combat.

Prior to the [[Iraq War]], American 120mm mortar platoons reorganized from six [[M1064 mortar carrier]]s and two M577 fire direction centers (FDC) to four M1064 and one FDC.<ref>https://www.knox.army.mil/center/armormag/currentissues/2006/ja06/4ward06c.pdfMortar Platoon Training Focus to Meet the Evolving Battlefield</ref> The urban environment of Iraq made it difficult to utilize mortars. New technologies such as mortar ballistic computers and communication equipment and are being integrated. Modern era combat is becoming more reliant on [[direct fire]] support from mortar carrier [[machine guns]].

==== Multiple rocket launcher ====
[[Image:9a52 smerch.jpg|thumb|right|[[BM-30 Smerch]] 300mm rocket launcher in raised position]]
{{Main|Multiple rocket launcher}}

A multiple rocket launcher is a type of unguided [[rocket artillery]] system. Like other [[rocket]] artillery, multiple rocket launchers are less accurate and have a much lower (sustained) rate of fire than batteries of traditional [[artillery]] guns. However, they have the capability of simultaneously dropping many hundreds of kilograms of explosive, with devastating effect.

The Korean [[Hwacha]] is an example of an early weapon system with a resemblance to the modern-day multiple rocket launcher{{fact|date=September 2013}}. The first modern multiple rocket launcher was the German ''[[Nebelwerfer]]'' of the 1930s, a small towed artillery piece. Only later in [[World War II]] did the Allies deploy similar weapons in the form of the [[Mattress (rocket)|Land Mattress]].

The first self-propelled multiple rocket launchers — and arguably the most famous — were the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Katyusha rocket launcher|BM-13 Katyusha]]s, first used during World War II and exported to Soviet allies afterwards. They were simple systems in which a rack of launch rails was mounted on the back of a truck. This set the template for modern multiple rocket launchers. The Americans mounted tubular launchers atop [[M4 Sherman]] tanks to create the [[T34 Calliope]] rocket launching tank, only used in small numbers, as their closest equivalent to the Katyusha.

==== Tank destroyer ====
[[Image:NM142 x 3.jpg|thumb|right|A Norwegian anti-tank platoon equipped with [[NM142]] TOW missile launchers]]
{{main|Tank destroyer|Anti-tank warfare}}
Tank destroyers are armed with an [[anti-tank gun]] or missile launcher, and are designed specifically to engage enemy armoured vehicles. Many have been based on a tracked tank chassis, while others are wheeled. Since World War II, main battle tanks have largely replaced gun-armed tank destroyers although lightly armoured anti tank guided missile (ATGM) carriers are commonly used for supplementary long-range anti-tank work.

The resurgence of [[expeditionary warfare]] after the [[Cold War]] has seen the emergence of gun-armed wheeled vehicles, sometimes called "protected gun systems", which may bear a superficial resemblance to tank destroyers, but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low intensity operations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  These have the advantage of easier deployment, as only the largest air transports can carry a main battle tank, and their smaller size makes them more effective in urban combat.

Many forces' IFVs carry anti-tank missiles in every infantry platoon, and attack helicopters have also added anti-tank capability to the modern battlefield. But there are still dedicated anti-tank vehicles with very heavy long-range missiles, or intended for airborne use. There have also been dedicated anti-tank vehicles built on ordinary armoured personnel carrier or armoured car chassis. Examples include the U.S. M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) and the Norwegian NM142, both on an [[M113]] chassis, several Soviet ATGM launchers based on the [[BRDM-2|BRDM reconnaissance car]], the British FV438 [[Swingfire]] and [[FV102 Striker]] and the German Raketenjagdpanzer series built on the chassis of the HS 30 and Marder IFV.

=== Armoured train ===
[[Image:Pancierovy vlak-Zvolen.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the [[Armored train Hurban|'Hurban' Armoured train]] located in Zvolen, Slovakia.]]
{{Main|Armoured train}}

An '''armoured train''' is a railway train protected with [[vehicle armour|armour]]. They are usually equipped with railroad cars armed with [[artillery]] and [[machine gun]]s. They were mostly used during the late 19th and early 20th century, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of firepower. Their use was discontinued in most countries when road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and because armoured trains were too vulnerable to track sabotage as well as attacks from the air. However, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] used improvised armoured trains in the [[Second Chechen War]] in the late 1990s and 2000s.

The railroad cars on an armoured train were designed for many tasks such as carrying guns and machine guns, infantry units, anti-aircraft guns. During World War II, the Germans would sometimes put a ''Fremdgerät'' (such as a captured French [[Somua S-35]] or Czech [[PzKpfw 38(t)]] light tank, or [[Panzer II]] light tank) on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s

Different types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.

Armoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a [[draisine]]. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm [[MG-13|MG13]] machine gun turrets from [[Panzer I]] light tanks.
