A '''cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM)''' is an abnormal connection between the [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s in the [[human brain|brain]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The most frequently observed problems related to an AVM are [[headache]]s and [[seizure]]s while at least 15% of the population at detection have no symptoms at all.<ref name="pmid11571210"/> Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive [[weakness]] and [[numbness]] and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain.<ref name="Mayo-Symptoms">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Symptoms |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref><ref name="Medline"/>

In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain ([[intracranial hemorrhage]]). Nevertheless in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.<ref name="Medline"/> Symptoms due to bleeding include loss of consciousness, sudden and severe headache, nausea, vomiting, [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]], and blurred vision, amongst others.<ref name="Mayo-Symptoms"/> Impairments caused by local brain tissue damage on the bleed site are also possible, including seizure, one-sided weakness ([[hemiparesis]]), a loss of touch sensation on one side of the body and deficits in language processing ([[aphasia]]).<ref name="Mayo-Symptoms"/>  Minor bleeding can occur with no noticeable symptoms. Following the bleed's cessation, most AVM victims return to normal, after the blood vessel has had time to repair itself.

AVMs in certain critical locations may stop the circulation of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], causing accumulation of the fluid within the skull and giving rise to a clinical condition called [[hydrocephalus]].<ref name="Medline">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000779.htm |title=Arteriovenous malformation - cerebral |author=David C. Dugdale, Daniel B. Hoch |month=10 |year=2008|publisher=ADAM |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> A stiff neck can occur as the result of increased pressure within the skull and irritation of the [[meninges]].

==Diagnosis==

An AVM diagnosis is established by [[neuroimaging]] studies after a complete neurological and physical examination.<ref name="Medline"/><ref name="Mayo-Diagnosis">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Tests and diagnosis |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> Three main techniques are used to visualize the brain and search for AVM: [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[cerebral angiography]].<ref name="Mayo-Diagnosis"/> A CT scan of the head is usually performed first when the subject is symptomatic. It can suggest the approximate site of the bleed.<ref name="pmid11571210"/> MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of AVMs and provides better information about the exact location of the malformation.<ref name="Mayo-Diagnosis"/> More detailed pictures of the tangle of blood vessels that compose an AVM can be obtained by using radioactive agents injected into the blood stream. If a CT is used in conjunction of dye this is called a computerized tomography angiogram while if MRI is used it is called [[magnetic resonance angiogram]].<ref name="pmid11571210"/><ref name="Mayo-Diagnosis"/>  The best images of an AVM are obtained through [[cerebral angiography]]. This procedure involves using a [[catheter]], threaded through an artery up to the head, to deliver a contrast agent into the AVM.  As the contrast agent flows through the AVM structure, a sequence of [[X-ray]] images are obtained.<ref name="Mayo-Diagnosis"/>

==Grading==
A common method of grading cerebral AVMs is the Spetzler-Martin grade.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spetzler|first=R|coauthors=Martin N|journal=J Neurosurg|year=1986|volume=65|pages=476–83|pmid=3760956|doi=10.3171/jns.1986.65.4.0476|title=A proposed grading system for arteriovenous malformations|issue=4}}</ref>  This system was designed to assess the patient's risk of neurological deficit after open surgical resection, based on characteristics of the AVM itself. Based on this system, AVMs may be classified as grades 1 - 5.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! AVM size !! Adjacent eloquent cortex !! Draining veins
|-
| Under 3&nbsp;cm = 1 || Non-eloquent = 0  || Superficial only = 0
|-
| 3–6&nbsp;cm = 2 || Eloquent* = 1|| Deep veins = 1
|-
| Over 6&nbsp;cm = 3 ||  ||
|}

"[[Eloquent cortex]]" is a name used by neurologists for areas of cortex that, if removed will result in loss of sensory processing or linguistic ability, minor paralysis, or paralysis.

The risk of post-surgical neurological deficit (difficulty with language, motor weakness, vision loss) increases with increasing Spetzler-Martin grade.

==Pathophysiology==
AVMs are an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the human brain. Arteriovenous malformations are most commonly of [[prenatal]] origin.<ref name="Mayo-Causes">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=causes |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Causes |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> The cause of AVMs remains unknown.<ref name="Mayo-Causes"/> In a normal brain [[oxygen]] enriched blood from the heart travels in sequence through smaller blood vessels going from arteries, to [[arterioles]] and then [[capillary|capillaries]].<ref name="Mayo-Causes"/> Oxygen is removed in the latter vessel to be used by the brain.<ref name="Mayo-Causes"/> After the oxygen is removed blood reaches [[venules]] and later veins which will take it back to the heart and lungs.<ref name="Mayo-Causes"/> On the other hand when there is an AVM blood goes directly from arteries to veins through the abnormal vessels disrupting the normal circulation of blood.<ref name="Mayo-Causes"/>

==Prognosis==
The main risk is [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. This risk is difficult to quantify since many patients with asymptomatic AVMs will never come to medical attention. Small AVMs tend to bleed more often than do larger ones, the opposite of cerebral aneurysms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=PM|coauthors=et al|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=49|pages=1–10|pmid=3958721|doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.1.1|title=Arteriovenous malformations of the brain: natural history in unoperated patients|issue=1|pmc=1028639}}</ref>  If a rupture or bleeding incident occurs, the blood may penetrate either into the brain tissue ([[cerebral hemorrhage]]) or into the [[subarachnoid space]], which is located between the sheaths ([[meninges]]) surrounding the brain ([[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]). Bleeding may also extend into the [[ventricular system]] ([[intraventricular hemorrhage]]). Cerebral hemorrhage appears to be most common.
<ref name="pmid11571210"/>
One long-term study (mean follow up greater than 20 years) of over 150 symptomatic AVMs (either presenting with bleeding or seizures) found the risk of cerebral hemorrhage to be approximately 4% per year, slightly higher than the 2-3% seen in other studies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ondra|first=SL|coauthors=et al|journal=J Neurosurgery|year=1990|volume=73|pages=387–391|pmid=2384776|doi=10.3171/jns.1990.73.3.0387|title=The natural history of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations of the brain: A 24-year follow-up assessment|issue=3}}</ref> A simple, rough approximation of a patient's lifetime bleeding risk is 105 - (patient age in years).<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Mark|title=Handbook of Neurosurgery (7th ed)|year=2010|publisher=Thieme|pages=1100}}</ref>  This equation assumes a 3% yearly bleeding risk. For example, a healthy 30 year old patient would have approximately a 75% lifetime risk of at least one bleeding event.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the location and size of the AVM and whether there is bleeding or not.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Treatments and drugs |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>

The treatment in the case of sudden bleeding is focused on restoration of vital function.  Anticonvulsant medications such as [[phenytoin]] are often used to control seizure; medications or procedures may be employed to relieve intracranial pressure.  Eventually, curative treatment may be required to prevent recurrent hemorrhage. However, any type of intervention may also carry a risk of creating a neurological deficit.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Preventive treatment of as yet unruptured brain AVMs has been controversial, as several studies suggested favorable long-term outcome for unruptured AVM patients not undergoing intervention. The NIH-funded longitudinal ARUBA study ("A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs) compares the risk of stroke and death in patients with preventive AVM eradication versus those followed without intervention.<ref name="aruba01" /> Interim results suggest that fewer strokes occur as long as patients with unruptured AVM do not undergo intervention. Because of the higher than expected event rate in the interventional arm of the ARUBA study, NIH/NINDS has stopped patient enrollment in April 2013, while continuing to follow all participants to determine whether the difference in stroke and death in the two arms changes over time.<ref name="aruba02" />

Surgical elimination of the blood vessels involved is the preferred curative treatment for many types of AVM.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/> Surgery is performed by a [[neurosurgeon]] who temporarily removes part of the skull ([[craniotomy]]), separates the AVM from surrounding brain tissue, and resects the abnormal vessels.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/> While surgery can result in an immediate, complete removal of the AVM, risks exist depending on the size and the location of the malformation. The preferred treatment of Spetzler-Martin grade 1 and 2 AVMs in young, healthy patients is surgical resection due to the relatively small risk of neurological damage compared to the high lifetime risk of hemorrhage. Grade 3 AVMs may or may not be amenable to surgery. Grade 4 and 5 AVMs are not usually surgically treated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Starke|first=RM|coauthors=et al|journal=Br J Neurosurg|year=2009|volume=23|pages=376–86|pmid=19637008|doi=10.1080/02688690802562663|title=Treatment guidelines for cerebral arteriovenous malformation microsurgery|issue=4}}</ref>

[[Radiosurgery]] has been widely used on small AVMs with considerable success.  The [[Gamma Knife]] is an apparatus used to precisely apply a controlled radiation dosage to the volume of the brain occupied by the AVM. While this treatment does not require an incision and craniotomy (with their own inherent risks), three or more years may pass before the complete effects are known, during which time patients are at risk of bleeding.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/> Complete obliteration of the AVM may or may not occur after several years, and repeat treatment may be needed. Radiosurgery is itself not without risk. In one large study, nine percent of patients had transient neurological symptoms, including headache, after radiosurgery for AVM. However, most symptoms resolved, and the long-term rate of neurological symptoms was 3.8%.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flickinger|first=JC|coauthors=et al|journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys|year=1998|volume=40|pages=273–278|pmid=9457809|doi=10.1016/S0360-3016(97)00718-9|title=Analysis of neurological sequelae from radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations: How location affects outcome|issue=2}}</ref>

[[Embolization]] is the occlusion of blood vessels most commonly with a glue-like substance introduced by a [[Radiology|radiographically]] guided [[catheter]].<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/> Such glue blocks the vessel and reduces blood flow into the AVM.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/>  Embolization is frequently used as an adjunct to either surgery or radiation treatment.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/> Before other treatments it reduces the size of the AVM while during surgery it reduces the risk of bleeding.<ref name="Mayo-Treatment"/> However, embolization alone may completely obliterate some AVMs. In high flow intranidal fistula we can use balloon to reduce the flow so that embolization can be done safely.<ref>Huded V. Endovascular balloon-assisted glue embolization of intranidal high flow fistula in brain AVM. J Neurosci Rural Pract 2013;4, Suppl S1:148-9</ref>

==Epidemiology==
The annual new detection rate [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of AVMs is approximately 1 per 100,000 a year. The [[point prevalence]] in adults is approximately 18 per 100,000.<ref name="pmid11571210">{{Cite journal|author=Al-Shahi R, Warlow C |title=A systematic review of the frequency and prognosis of arteriovenous malformations of the brain in adults |journal=Brain |volume=124 |issue=Pt 10 |pages=1900–26 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11571210 |doi= 10.1093/brain/124.10.1900|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/10/1900?view=long&pmid=11571210 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref> AVMs are more common in males than females, although in females [[pregnancy]] may start or worsen symptoms due the increase in [[blood flow]] and [[blood volume|volume]] it usually brings.<ref name="Mayo-RF">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=risk-factors |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Risk factors |author=Mayo Clinic staff |month=02 |year=2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>
