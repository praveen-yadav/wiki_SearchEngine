<!--first para&nbsp;— general note on etymology and importance and severity of condition -->
'''Major depressive disorder''' ('''MDD''') (also known as '''clinical depression''', '''major depression''', '''unipolar depression''', or '''unipolar disorder'''; or as '''recurrent depression''' in the case of repeated episodes) is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by a pervasive and persistent [[depression (mood)|low mood]] which is accompanied by low [[self-esteem]] and by a [[anhedonia|loss of interest or pleasure]] in normally enjoyable activities. This cluster of symptoms ([[syndrome]]) was named, described and classified as one of the [[mood disorder]]s in the 1980 edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostic manual]]. The term "depression" is ambiguous. It is often used to denote this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or to lower mood states lacking [[clinical significance]]. Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit [[suicide]], and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder.<ref name="IntegrativeSuicide"/>

<!-- diagnosis -->
The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the patient's self-reported experiences, behavior reported by relatives or friends, and a [[mental status examination]]. There is no laboratory test for major depression, although physicians generally request tests for physical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is between the ages of 20 and 30 years, with a later peak between 30 and 40 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.am/psy/major-depressive-disorder/|title=Major Depressive Disorder|publisher=American Medical Network, Inc.|accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>

<!--treatment and course -->
Typically, patients are treated with [[antidepressant]] [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]] and, in many cases, also receive [[psychotherapy]] or counseling, although the effectiveness of medication for mild or moderate cases is questionable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT |title=Initial severity and antidepressant benefits: a meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration |journal=PLoS Med. |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=e45 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18303940 |pmc=2253608 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 |url=}}</ref> Hospitalization may be necessary in cases with associated [[self-neglect]] or a significant risk of harm to self or others. A minority are treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting weeks to a lifelong disorder with recurrent [[major depressive episode]]s. Depressed individuals have shorter [[Life expectancy|life expectancies]] than those without depression, in part because of greater susceptibility to medical illnesses and suicide. It is unclear whether or not medications affect the risk of suicide. Current and former patients may be [[Social stigma|stigmatized]].

<!-- history and discussion of nature and causes-->
The understanding of the nature and causes of depression has evolved over the centuries, though this understanding is incomplete and has left many aspects of depression as the subject of discussion and research. Proposed causes include [[Psychology|psychological]], psycho-social, [[heredity|hereditary]], [[evolution]]ary and [[biology|biological]] factors. Long-term [[substance abuse]] may cause or worsen depressive symptoms. Psychological treatments are based on theories of [[Personality theory|personality]], [[Communication theory|interpersonal communication]], and [[learning theory (education)|learning]]. Most biological theories focus on the [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine]] chemicals [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], which are naturally present in the [[Human brain|brain]] and assist communication between [[Neuron|nerve cells]].

A person having a [[major depressive episode]] usually exhibits a very low mood, which pervades all aspects of life, and an [[anhedonia|inability to experience pleasure]] in activities that were formerly enjoyed.

===Comorbidity===
Major depression frequently [[Comorbidity|co-occurs]] with other psychiatric problems. The 1990–92 ''[[National Comorbidity Survey]]'' (US) reports that 51% of those with major depression also suffer from lifetime [[anxiety]].<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Kessler RC, Nelson C, McGonagle KA |year=1996 |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=168 |issue=suppl 30 |pages=17–30 |title=Comorbidity of DSM-III-R major depressive disorder in the general population: results from the US National Comorbidity Survey|pmid=8864145}}</ref> Anxiety symptoms can have a major impact on the course of a depressive illness, with delayed recovery, increased risk of relapse, greater disability and increased suicide attempts.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Hirschfeld RMA |year=2001 |journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=244–254 |title=The Comorbidity of Major Depression and Anxiety Disorders: Recognition and Management in Primary Care|pmid=15014592 |pmc=181193}}</ref> American neuroendocrinologist [[Robert Sapolsky]] similarly argues that the relationship between stress, anxiety, and depression could be measured and demonstrated biologically.<ref>{{vcite book|author = Sapolsky Robert M|year = 2004|title = Why zebras don't get ulcers|pages = 291–98|publisher = Henry Holt and Company, LLC|isbn = 0-8050-7369-8}}</ref> There are increased rates of alcohol and drug abuse and particularly dependence,<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Grant BF |year=1995|title=Comorbidity between DSM-IV drug use disorders and major depression: Results of a national survey of adults |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse |volume=7|issue=4 |pages=481–87 |pmid=8838629 |doi=10.1016/0899-3289(95)90017-9}}</ref> and around a third of individuals diagnosed with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] develop comorbid depression.<ref>{{vcite book |title=Delivered from distraction: Getting the most out of life with Attention Deficit Disorder |author=Hallowell EM, Ratey JJ|year=2005 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York|isbn=0-345-44231-8 |pages=253–55}}</ref> [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] and depression often co-occur.<ref name="NIMHPub"/>

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur. One or more pain symptoms are present in 65% of depressed patients, and anywhere from 5 to 85% of patients with pain will be suffering from depression, depending on the setting; there is a lower prevalence in general practice, and higher in specialty clinics. The diagnosis of depression is often delayed or missed, and the outcome worsens. The outcome can also worsen if the depression is noticed but completely misunderstood.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Bair MJ, Robinson RL, Katon W |year=2003|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=163 |issue=20 |pages=2433–45|title=Depression and Pain Comorbidity: A Literature Review |url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/20/2433(fulltext)|accessdate=08–11–11 |doi=10.1001/archinte.163.20.2433 |pmid=14609780 |last1=Bair |first1=MJ |last2=Robinson |first2=RL|last3=Katon |first3=W |last4=Kroenke |first4=K}}</ref>

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity. People with major depression are less likely to follow medical recommendations for treating cardiovascular disorders, which further increases their risk. In addition, cardiologists may not recognize underlying  depression that complicates a cardiovascular problem under their care.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Schulman J and Shapiro BA |year=2008|journal=Psychiatric Times|volume=25 |issue=9 |title=Depression and Cardiovascular Disease: What Is the Correlation?|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/article/10168/1171821}}</ref>

==Causes==
The [[biopsychosocial model]] proposes that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a role in causing depression.<ref>{{vcite web |author=Department of Health and Human Services |year=1999 |url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/pdfs/c2.pdf |title=The fundamentals of mental health and mental illness |work=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General |accessdate=2008-11-11| format=PDF}}</ref> The [[diathesis–stress model]] specifies that depression results when a preexisting vulnerability, or diathesis, is activated by stressful life events.

Depression may be directly caused by damage to the [[cerebellum]] as is seen in [[cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome]].<ref>Schmahmann JD. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15377747 Disorders of the cerebellum: ataxia, dysmetria of thought, and the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome] J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2004 Summer;16(3):367-78.</ref><ref>Konarski JZ, et al.

These interactive models have gained [[empirical]] support. For example, researchers in New Zealand took a [[Prospective cohort study|prospective approach]] to studying depression, by [[Longitudinal study|documenting over time]] how depression emerged among an initially [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] of people. The researchers concluded that variation among the [[serotonin transporter]] (5-HTT) gene [[Moderation (statistics)|affects the chances]] that people who have dealt with very stressful life events will go on to experience depression. To be specific, depression may follow such events, but seems more likely to appear in people with one or two short [[allele]]s of the 5-HTT gene.<ref name="Caspi"/> In addition, a Swedish study estimated the [[heritability]] of depression—the degree to which individual differences in occurrence are associated with genetic differences—to be around 40% for women and 30% for men,<ref name="pmid16390897">{{vcite journal |author=Kendler KS, Gatz M, Gardner CO, Pedersen NL |title=A Swedish national twin study of lifetime major depression |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=109–14 |year=2006  |pmid=16390897 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.109}}</ref> and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have proposed that the genetic basis for depression lies deep in the history of [[natural selection|naturally selected]] [[adaptation]]s.

===Biological===
{{Main|Biology of depression}}

====Monoamine hypothesis====
[[Image:Synapse Illustration2 tweaked.svg|thumb|250px|Of approx. 30 [[neurotransmitters]] that have been identified, researchers have discovered associations between clinical depression and the function of three major [[neurochemicals]]. These substances are [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]]. Antidepressants influence the overall balance of these three neurotransmitters within structures of the brain that regulate emotion, reactions to stress, and the physical drives of sleep, appetite, and sexuality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutdepression.com/cau_02.html|title=All About Depression: Causes|work=All About Self Help, LLC.|date=Friday, December 3, 2010|accessdate=Friday, December 3, 2010}}</ref>]]

Most [[antidepressant]] medications increase the levels of one or more of the monoamines&nbsp;— the neurotransmitters [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]&nbsp;— in the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]] between [[neuron]]s in the brain. Some medications affect the monoamine receptors directly.

Serotonin is hypothesized to regulate other neurotransmitter systems; decreased serotonin activity may allow these systems to act in unusual and erratic ways.<ref name="IntegrativeSerotonin">{{Harvnb|Barlow|2005| p=226}}</ref> According to this "permissive hypothesis", depression arises when low serotonin levels promote low levels of norepinephrine, another monoamine neurotransmitter.<ref>{{vcite web |author=Shah N, Eisner T, Farrell M, Raeder C|year=1999 |month=July/August |url=http://www.pswi.org/professional/pharmaco/depression.pdf |title=An overview of SSRIs for the treatment of depression |work=Journal of the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin |accessdate=2008-11-10| format=PDF}}</ref> Some antidepressants enhance the levels of norepinephrine directly, whereas others raise the levels of dopamine, a third monoamine neurotransmitter. These observations gave rise to the [[monoamine hypothesis]] of depression. In its contemporary formulation, the monoamine hypothesis postulates that a deficiency of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for the corresponding features of depression: "Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; [lack of] serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life."<ref name="pmid18494537">{{vcite journal |author=Nutt DJ |title=Relationship of neurotransmitters to the symptoms of major depressive disorder |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=69 Suppl E1 |pages=4–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18494537}}</ref> The proponents of this theory recommend the choice of an antidepressant with mechanism of action that impacts the most prominent symptoms. Anxious and irritable patients should be treated with [[SSRI]]s or [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s, and those experiencing a loss of energy and enjoyment of life with norepinephrine- and dopamine-enhancing drugs.<ref name="pmid18494537"/>

Besides the clinical observations that drugs that increase the amount of available monoamines are effective antidepressants, recent advances in [[psychiatric genetics]] indicate that [[phenotypic variation]] in central monoamine function may be marginally associated with vulnerability to depression. Despite these findings, the cause of depression is not simply monoamine deficiency.<ref name=nature08/> In the past two decades, research has revealed multiple limitations of the monoamine hypothesis, and its explanatory inadequacy has been highlighted within the psychiatric community.<ref name="pmid10775017">{{vcite journal |author=Hirschfeld RM |title=History and evolution of the monoamine hypothesis of depression |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=61 Suppl 6|pages=4–6 |year=2000 |pmid=10775017}}</ref> A counterargument is that the mood-enhancing effect of MAO inhibitors and SSRIs takes weeks of treatment to develop, even though the boost in available monoamines occurs within hours. Another counterargument is based on experiments with pharmacological agents that cause depletion of monoamines; while deliberate reduction in the concentration of centrally available monoamines may slightly lower the mood of unmedicated depressed patients, this reduction does not affect the mood of healthy people.<ref name=nature08>{{cite journal |author=Krishnan V, Nestler EJ |title=The molecular neurobiology of depression |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7215 |pages=894–902 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18923511 |pmc=2721780 |doi=10.1038/nature07455 |bibcode=2008Natur.455..894K}}</ref> The monoamine hypothesis, already limited, has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public as a mass marketing tool, usually phrased as a "[[chemical imbalance]]".<ref name="PLoS">{{vcite journal |author=Lacasse J, Leo J |title=Serotonin and depression: A disconnect between the advertisements and the scientific literature |journal=[[PLoS Medicine|PLoS Med]] |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages=e392 |year=2005 |pmid=16268734 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392 |url=http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392|accessdate=2008-10-30 |pmc=1277931 | laysummary=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/516262 | laysource=[[Medscape]] | laydate=Nov. 8, 2005}}</ref>

In 2003 a [[gene-environment interaction]] (GxE) was hypothesized to explain why life stress is a predictor for depressive episodes in some individuals, but not in others, depending on an allelic variation of the serotonin-transporter-linked promoter region ([[5-HTTLPR]]);<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Caspi A, Sugden K, Moffitt TE, ''et al.'' |title=Influence of life stress on depression: moderation by a polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene |journal=Science |volume=301 |issue=5631 |pages=386–9 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12869766 |doi=10.1126/science.1083968|bibcode = 2003Sci...301..386C }}</ref> a 2009 [[meta-analysis]] showed stressful life events were associated with depression, but found no evidence for an association with the 5-HTTLPR genotype.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Risch N, Herrell R, Lehner T, ''et al.'' |title=Interaction between the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR), stressful life events, and risk of depression: a meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=301 |issue=23 |pages=2462–71 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=19531786 |pmc=2938776 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.878}}</ref> Another 2009 meta-analysis agreed with the latter finding.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Munafò MR, Durrant C, Lewis G, Flint J |title=Gene X environment interactions at the serotonin transporter locus |journal=Biol.

There is some evidence that major depression may be caused in part by an overactive [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) that results in an effect similar to the neuro-endocrine response to stress. Investigations reveal increased levels of the hormone [[cortisol]] and enlarged pituitary and adrenal glands, suggesting disturbances of the [[endocrine system]] may play a role in some psychiatric disorders, including major depression.

[[Attachment theory]], which was developed by English psychiatrist [[John Bowlby]] in the 1960s, predicts a relationship between depressive disorder in adulthood and the quality of the earlier bond between the infant and the adult caregiver. In particular, it is thought that "the experiences of early loss, separation and rejection by the parent or caregiver (conveying the message that the child is unlovable) may all lead to insecure internal working models ... Internal cognitive representations of the self as unlovable and of attachment figures as unloving [or] untrustworthy would be consistent with parts of Beck's cognitive triad".<ref name = "Ma_attachment"/> While a wide variety of studies has upheld the basic tenets of attachment theory, research has been inconclusive as to whether self-reported early attachment and later depression are demonstrably related.<ref name = "Ma_attachment">{{vcite journal |author=Ma, K |title=Attachment theory in adult psychiatry.

The theory of attachment developed by [[John Bowlby]] has been rigorously tested and validated over decades of research. A pioneering film by [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] ("A Two Year Old goes to Hospital",1952) found that children as young as two years old entered into what resembled a depressive state when they were separated from their mothers. Until that time it had been believed that the lack of emotional responsiveness of such children had indicated an emotionally comfortable state. Since that time scientific research into attachment has repeatedly demonstrated important links between early attachment factors and mental health in later life.-->

Depression can be caused by prejudice. This can occur when people hold negative self-stereotypes about themselves. This "deprejudice" can be related to a group membership (e.g., Me-Gay-Bad) or not (Me-Bad). If someone has prejudicial beliefs about a stigmatized group and then becomes a member of that group, they may internalize their prejudice and develop depression. For example, a boy growing up in the United States may learn the negative stereotype that gay men are immoral. When he grows up and realizes he is gay, he may direct this prejudice inward on himself and become depressed. People may also show prejudice internalization through self-stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse.<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/>

===Evolutionary===
{{Main|Evolutionary approaches to depression}}
From the standpoint of evolutionary theory, major depression is hypothesized, in some instances, to increase an individual's [[Reproduction|reproductive]] [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. [[Evolutionary approaches to depression]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] posit specific mechanisms by which depression may have been genetically incorporated into the human gene pool, accounting for the high [[heritability]] and prevalence of depression by proposing that certain components of depression are adaptations,<ref name="Panksepp02">{{vcite journal |author=Panksepp J, Moskal JR, Panksepp JB, Kroes RA |title=Comparative approaches in evolutionary psychology: Molecular neuroscience meets the mind |journal=Neuroendocrinology Letters |volume=23 |issue= Supplement 4 |pages=105–15 |year=2002  |pmid=12496741|url=http://www.nel.edu/pdf_w/23s4/NEL231002R11_Panksepp_.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> such as the behaviors relating to [[attachment theory|attachment]] and [[Social class|social rank]].<ref name="Sloman2003">{{vcite journal |author=Sloman L, Gilbert P, Hasey G |title=Evolved mechanisms in depression: The role and interaction of attachment and social rank in depression |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=107–21 |year=2003  |pmid=12706512 |doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00116-7}}</ref> Current behaviors can be explained as adaptations to regulate relationships or resources, although the result may be maladaptive in modern environments.<ref name="tooby">{{vcite book|year=2005|title=Conceptual foundations of evolutionary psychology.

From another viewpoint, a counseling therapist may see depression not as a biochemical illness or disorder but as "a species-wide evolved suite of emotional programs that are mostly activated by a perception, almost always over-negative, of a major decline in personal usefulness, that can sometimes be linked to guilt, shame or perceived rejection".<ref name="Carey05">{{vcite journal |title=Evolution, depression and counselling |journal=Counselling Psychology Quarterly|year=2005 |author=Carey TJ |volume=18|issue=3 |pages=215–22 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccpq/2005/00000018/00000003/art00005 |doi=10.1080/09515070500304508}}</ref> This suite may have manifested in aging hunters in humans' [[foraging]] past, who were marginalized by their declining skills, and may continue to appear in [[Social alienation|alienated members]] of today's society.

Very high levels of substance abuse occur in the psychiatric population, especially alcohol, sedatives and cannabis.

A diagnostic assessment may be conducted by a suitably trained [[general practitioner]], or by a [[psychiatrist]] or [[psychologist]],<ref name="NIMHPub" /> who  [[psychiatric history|records]] the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms and family history. The broad clinical aim is to formulate the relevant biological, psychological and social factors that may be impacting on the individual's mood. The assessor may also discuss the person's current ways of regulating their mood (healthy or otherwise) such as alcohol and drug use. The assessment also includes a [[mental state examination]], which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or pessimism, [[self-harm]] or suicide, and an absence of positive thoughts or plans.<ref name="NIMHPub" /> Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas, and thus diagnosis and management is left largely to [[primary care|primary-care]] clinicians.<ref>{{vcite journal|author=Kaufmann IM |date= September 1, 1993 |title=Rural psychiatric services.

Both DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 mark out typical (main) depressive symptoms. ICD-10 defines three typical depressive symptoms (depressed mood, anhedonia, and reduced energy), two of which should be present to determine depressive disorder diagnosis.<ref>World Health Organization. The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioral disorders.  Clinical description and diagnostic guideline. Geneva: World Health Organization, 1992</ref> According to DSM-IV-TR, there are two main depressive symptoms—depressed mood and anhedonia. At least one of these must be present to make a diagnosis of major depressive episode.<ref>American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Revised. Text revision. Psychiatric Press, Inc., Washington, DC: 2000</ref>

Major depressive disorder is classified as a mood disorder in DSM-IV-TR.<ref name=APA345>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=345}}</ref> The diagnosis hinges on the presence of single or recurrent [[major depressive episode]]s.<ref name=APA349/> Further qualifiers are used to classify both the episode itself and the course of the disorder. The category [[Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified]] is diagnosed if the depressive episode's manifestation does not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. The [[ICD-10]] system does not use the term ''major depressive disorder'', but lists very similar criteria for the diagnosis of a depressive episode (mild, moderate or severe); the term ''recurrent'' may be added if there have been multiple episodes without mania.<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online2005/fr-icd.htm?gf30.htm |title=Mood (affective) disorders |accessdate=2008-10-19 |work=ICD-10, Chapter V, Mental and behavioural disorders |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |year=2004}}</ref>

====Major depressive episode====
{{Main|Major depressive episode}}

A major depressive episode is characterized by the presence of a severely depressed mood that persists for at least two weeks.<ref name=APA349/> Episodes may be isolated or recurrent and are categorized as mild (few symptoms in excess of minimum criteria), moderate, or severe (marked impact on social or occupational functioning).

====Subtypes====
The DSM-IV-TR recognizes five further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:

*'''[[Melancholic depression]]''' is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| pp=419–20}}</ref>
*'''[[Atypical depression]]''' is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421–22}}</ref>
*'''[[Catatonia|Catatonic]] depression''' is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms. Here the person is mute and almost stuporous, and either remains immobile or exhibits purposeless or even bizarre movements. Catatonic symptoms also occur in [[schizophrenia]] or in manic episodes, or may be caused by [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| pp=417–18}}</ref>
*'''[[Postpartum depression]]''', or '''mental and behavioral disorders associated with the [[wiktionary:puerperium|puerperium]], not elsewhere classified''',<ref>
{{vcite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf50.htm+f530

</ref> refers to the intense, sustained and sometimes disabling depression experienced by women after giving birth. Postpartum depression has an incidence rate of 10–15% among new mothers. The DSM-IV mandates that, in order to qualify as postpartum depression, onset occur within one month of delivery. It has been said that postpartum depression can last as long as three months.<ref>{{vcite web |author=Nonacs, Ruta M |url=http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3408.htm |publisher=eMedicine |title=Postpartum depression|date=December 4, 2007|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>
*'''[[Seasonal affective disorder]]''' (SAD) is a form of depression in which depressive episodes come on in the autumn or winter, and resolve in spring. The diagnosis is made if at least two episodes have occurred in colder months with none at other times, over a two-year period or longer.<ref>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| p=425}}</ref>

===Differential diagnoses===
{{Main|Depression (differential diagnoses)}}

To confer major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other [[Differential diagnosis|potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood or bipolar disorder. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''double depression'').<ref name="harvnb"/> [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.<ref name="psychiatric355"/> [[Bipolar disorder]], also known as ''manic–depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or [[hypomania]]. Although depression is currently categorized as a separate disorder, there is ongoing debate because individuals diagnosed with major depression often experience some hypomanic symptoms, indicating a mood disorder continuum.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Akiskal HS, Benazzi F |year=2006  |title=The DSM-IV and ICD-10 categories of recurrent [major] depressive and bipolar II disorders: Evidence that they lie on a dimensional spectrum |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |pmid=16488021 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2005.12.035}}</ref>

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, [[medications]], and [[substance abuse]]. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a [[mood disorder]] due to a general medical condition. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or [[physical examination]]. When the depression is caused by a substance abused including a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a [[toxin]], it is then diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080715124733/http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/major_depression.htm| title=Major Depressive Episode|work=psychnet-uk.com|accessdate= 2010-07-16}}</ref> In such cases, a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Prevention==
Behavioral interventions, such as [[interpersonal therapy]] and [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]], are effective at preventing new onset depression.<ref name=Munoz2012>{{cite journal|last=Muñoz|first=RF|coauthors=Beardslee, WR; Leykin, Y|title=Major depression can be prevented|journal=The American Psychologist|date=2012 May-Jun|volume=67|issue=4|pages=285–95|pmid=22583342|doi=10.1037/a0027666}}</ref><ref name=Cuijpers2012>{{cite report|author=Cuijpers, P.|date=September 20, 2012|title=Prevention and early treatment of mental ill-health|url=http://congres.efpa.eu/downloads/Pim-Cuijpers_Prevention-and-early-treatment-of-mental-ill-health-EFPASep%202012.pdf|VU university medical center}}</ref><ref name=Cuijpers2008>{{vcite journal |author=Cuijpers P, van Straten A, Smit F, Mihalopoulos C, Beekman A |title=Preventing the onset of depressive disorders: a meta-analytic review of psychological interventions |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=165 |issue=10 |pages=1272–80 |year=2008 |pmid=18765483 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.07091422}}</ref> Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the [[Internet]].<ref>{{vcite web |author=Christensen H; Griffiths KM.|year=2002 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_07_071002/chr10370_fm.pdf |title=The prevention of depression using the Internet |work=Medical Journal of Australia |accessdate=2009-04-02 |format=PDF}}</ref> 

However, an earlier meta-analysis found preventive programs with a competence-enhancing component to be superior to behaviorally oriented programs overall, and found behavioral programs to be particularly unhelpful for older people, for whom social support programs were uniquely beneficial. In addition, the programs that best prevented depression comprised more than eight sessions, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were provided by a combination of lay and professional workers, had a high-quality research design, reported [[Churn rate|attrition rates]], and had a well-defined intervention.<ref>{{vcite web |author=Jané-Llopis E; Hosman C; Jenkins R; Anderson P.|year=2003 |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/183/5/384.pdf |title=Predictors of efficacy in depression prevention programmes |work=British Journal of Psychiatry |accessdate=2009-04-02 |format=PDF}}</ref> 

The Netherlands mental health care system provides preventive interventions, such as the "Coping with Depression" course (CWD) for people with sub-threshold depression. The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.<ref name=Munoz2012/><ref name=Cuijpers2009>{{vcite journal |author=Cuijpers P, Muñoz RF, Clarke GN, Lewinsohn PM |title=Psychoeducational treatment and prevention of depression: the "Coping with Depression" course thirty years later. |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=449–458 |year=2009 |pmid=19450912 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.04.005}}</ref> Preventative efforts may result in a decreases in rates of the condition of between 22 and 38%.<ref name=Cuijpers2008/>  A stepped-care intervention (watchful waiting, [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and medication for some) achieved a 50% lower incidence rate in a patient group aged 75 or older.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid = 19255379 | doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2008.555 | volume=66 | issue=3 | title=Stepped-care prevention of anxiety and depression in late life: a randomized controlled trial | year=2009 | month=March | author=van't Veer-Tazelaar PJ, van Marwijk HW, van Oppen P, ''et al.'' | journal=Arch.

==Management==
{{Main|Management of depression}}
The three most common treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy.
Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for people under 18, while electroconvulsive therapy is used only as a last resort. Care is usually given on an [[Psychiatry#Outpatient treatment|outpatient]] basis, whereas treatment in an [[Psychiatry#Inpatient treatment|inpatient]] unit is considered if there is a significant risk to self or others.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult. Development of mental health services is minimal in many countries; depression is viewed as a phenomenon of the developed world despite evidence to the contrary, and not as an inherently life-threatening condition.<ref name=Patel04>{{vcite journal |author=Patel V, Araya R, Bolton P |year=2004|title=Editorial: Treating depression in the developing world|journal=Tropical Medicine & International Health|format=Subscription required|volume=9|issue=5 |pages=539–41|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01243.x |pmid=15117296 |last1=Patel |first1=V |last2=Araya |first2=R |last3=Bolton |first3=P}}</ref> [[Physical exercise]] is recommended for management of mild depression,<ref name="nice2007">{{vcite web |url= http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG023fullguideline.pdf|format=PDF|title= Management of depression in primary and secondary care|accessdate=2008-11-04 |work=National Clinical Practice Guideline Number 23 |publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] |year=2007}}</ref> but it has only a moderate, statistically insignificant effect on symptoms in most cases of major depressive disorder.<ref name=Mead>{{cite journal |author=Mead GE, Morley W, Campbell P, Greig CA, McMurdo M, Lawlor DA |title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD004366 |year=2009 |pmid=19588354 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub4 |editor1-last=Mead |editor1-first=Gillian E |chapter=Exercise for depression }}</ref> It is equivalent to the use of medications in most people.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cooney|first=GM|coauthors=Dwan, K; Greig, CA; Lawlor, DA; Rimer, J; Waugh, FR; McMurdo, M; Mead, GE|title=Exercise for depression|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2013 Sep 12|volume=9|pages=CD004366|pmid=24026850|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub6|editor1-last=Mead|editor1-first=Gillian E}}</ref> In the older people it does appear to decrease depression.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bridle C, Spanjers K, Patel S, Atherton NM, Lamb SE |title=Effect of exercise on depression severity in older people: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=201 |issue=3 |pages=180–5 |year=2012 |month=September |pmid=22945926 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.111.095174 |url=}}</ref>

To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried.

Recurrence is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment. Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six&nbsp;months after remission to prevent relapse.

The Ancient Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] described a syndrome of melancholia as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms; he characterized all "fears and despondencies, if they last a long time" as being symptomatic of the ailment.<ref>Hippocrates, ''Aphorisms'', Section 6.23</ref> It was a similar but far broader concept than today's depression; prominence was given to a clustering of the symptoms of sadness, dejection, and despondency, and often fear, anger, delusions and obsessions were included.<ref name="Radden2003">{{vcite journal |author=Radden, J |year=2003 |title=Is this dame melancholy?

Retrieved June 30, 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/depress Dictionary.com]</ref> From the 14th&nbsp;century, "to depress" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits.

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.<ref name="Davison2006">{{vcite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}</ref>

Sigmund Freud likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]. Such loss results in severe melancholic symptoms more profound than mourning; not only is the outside world viewed negatively but the ego itself is compromised.<ref name="Carhart-Harris08"/> The patient's decline of self-perception is revealed in his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.<ref name="Radden2003"/> Meyer put forward a mixed social and biological framework emphasizing ''reactions'' in the context of an individual's life, and argued that the term ''depression'' should be used instead of ''melancholia''.<ref name="Lewis1934">{{vcite journal |author=Lewis, AJ| year=1934|title=Melancholia: A historical review |journal=Journal of Mental Science |volume=80 |pages=1–42|doi= 10.1192/bjp.80.328.1}}</ref> The first version of the DSM (DSM-I, 1952) contained ''depressive reaction'' and the DSM-II (1968) ''depressive neurosis'', defined as an excessive reaction to internal conflict or an identifiable event, and also included a depressive type of manic-depressive psychosis within Major affective disorders.<ref name="DSMII">{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-II |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=1968 |chapter=Schizophrenia |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/DSMPDF/dsm-ii.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-03 |pages= 36–37, 40}}</ref>

In the mid-20th century, researchers theorized that depression was caused by a [[chemical imbalance theory|chemical imbalance]] in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of [[reserpine]] and [[isoniazid]] in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.<ref>{{vcite journal|author = Schildkraut, JJ|year=1965|title = The catecholamine hypothesis of affective disorders: A review of supporting evidence |journal = American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=122 |issue=5| pages = 509–22|pmid=5319766 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.122.5.509}}</ref>

The term ''Major depressive disorder'' was introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s as part of proposals for diagnostic criteria based on patterns of symptoms (called the "Research Diagnostic Criteria", building on earlier [[Feighner Criteria]]),<ref>{{vcite web |author=Spitzer RL, Endicott J, Robins E|year=1975 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1989/A1989U309700001.pdf |title=The development of diagnostic criteria in psychiatry |accessdate=2008-11-08| format=PDF}}</ref> and was incorporated into the DSM-III in 1980.<ref name="Philipp1991">{{vcite journal |author=Philipp M, Maier W, Delmo CD |title=The concept of major depression.

People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. "Because of the lack of scientific certainty," one commentator has observed, "the debate over depression turns on questions of language. What we call it—'disease,' 'disorder,' 'state of mind'—affects how we view, diagnose, and treat it."<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2129377|title=The Depression Wars: Would Honest Abe Have Written the Gettysburg Address on Prozac? |author=Maloney F|date= November 3, 2005|work= Slate magazine |publisher= Washington Post|accessdate=2008-10-03}}</ref> There are cultural differences in the extent to which serious depression is considered an illness requiring personal professional treatment, or is an indicator of something else, such as the need to address social or moral problems, the result of biological imbalances, or a reflection of individual differences in the understanding of distress that may reinforce feelings of powerlessness, and emotional struggle.<ref name="Karasz05">{{vcite journal |author=Karasz A |title=Cultural differences in conceptual models of depression |journal=Social Science in Medicine |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=1625–35 |year=2005  |pmid=15652693 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.08.011}}</ref><ref>{{vcite journal|author=Tilbury, F|year=2004|title=There are orphans in Africa still looking for my hands': African women refugees and the sources of emotional distress|journal=Health Sociology Review|volume=13|issue=1|pages=54–64|url=http://www.atypon-link.com/EMP/doi/abs/10.5555/hesr.2004.13.1.54|accessdate=2008-10-03|doi=10.5555/hesr.2004.13.1.54}}</ref>

The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It has been argued that the Chinese traditionally deny or [[Somatization|somatize]] emotional depression (although since the early 1980s, the Chinese denial of depression may have modified drastically).<ref>{{vcite journal |author=[[Gordon Parker|Parker, G]] |year=2001|title=Depression in the planet's largest ethnic group: The Chinese |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=857–64 |pmid=11384889 |last2=Gladstone |first2=G |last3=Chee |first3=KT |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.6.857}}</ref> Alternatively, it may be that Western cultures reframe and elevate some expressions of human distress to disorder status.

Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Nevertheless, analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings or statements of family and friends of some historical personalities has led to the presumption that they may have had some form of depression.
