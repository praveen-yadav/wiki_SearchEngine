'''Delphinus''' {{IPAc-en|d|ɛ|l|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, close to the [[celestial equator]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[dolphin]]. Delphinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains among the 88 modern constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size.

Delphinus' brightest stars form a distinctive [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that can easily be recognized. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by [[Vulpecula]] the fox, [[Sagitta]] the arrow, [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] the eagle, [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] the water-carrier, [[Equuleus]] the foal and [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] the flying horse.

===Stars===
Delphinus does not have any bright stars; its brightest star is of magnitude 3.8. The main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in Delphinus is [[Job's Coffin]], formed from the four brightest stars: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini. Alpha and Beta Delphini are named Sualocin and Rotanev, respectively. When read backwards, they read as Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized name of [[Palermo Astronomical Observatory|Palermo Observatory]]'s former director, [[Niccolò Cacciatore]]. However, Delphinus is in a rich Milky Way star field.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=138-139}}

[[Alpha Delphini]], called Sualocin, is a blue-white hued [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 3.8, 241 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Delphini]], called Rotanev, is a close [[binary star]] and the brightest in Delphinus, divisible in only large amateur telescopes. To the unaided eye, it appears to be a white star of magnitude 3.6. It has a period of 27 years and is 97 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Delphini]] is a celebrated binary star among amateur astronomers. The primary is a gold-colored star of magnitude 4.3 and the secondary is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 5.1. 102 light-years away, the components of Gamma Delphini are divisible in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=138-139}} The secondary, also described as green, is 10 arcseconds from the primary. [[Struve 2725]], called the "Ghost Double", is a pair that appears similar to a dimmer Gamma Delphini. Its components of magnitudes 7.6 and 8.4 are separated by 6 arcseconds and are 15 arcminutes from Gamma Delphini itself.<ref name="S&T"/>

There are several dimmer stars in Delphinus. [[Delta Delphini]] is a type A7&nbsp;IIIp star of magnitude 4.43. [[Epsilon Delphini]], called Deneb Dulfim, meaning "tail of the Dolphin", is a star of [[spectral class]] B6&nbsp;III and magnitude 4.

Delphinus is also home to several variable stars. [[R Delphini]] is a [[Mira variable|Mira-type variable star]] with a period of 285.5 days. Its magnitude ranges between a maximum of 7.6 and a minimum of 13.8.

[[Rho Aquilae]] moved across the border into Delphinus in 1992.

On 14 August 2013, a possible [[nova]] was discovered by [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]] Koichi Itagaki, initially labelled PNV J20233073+2046041, now labelled Nova Delphini 2013.<ref>{{cite web

===Deep-sky objects===
Because it is in a rich [[Milky Way]] star field, Delphinus has several deep-sky objects. [[NGC 6891]] is a [[planetary nebula]] of magnitude 10.5. [[NGC 6934]] is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 9.75. At a distance of about 185,000 light-years, the globular cluster [[NGC 7006]] is extremely remote. It is also fairly dim at magnitude 11.5.

==Mythology==
Delphinus is associated with two stories from [[Greek mythology]].

According to the first Greek god [[Poseidon]] wanted to marry [[Amphitrite]], a beautiful [[nereid]]. She, however, wanting to protect her virginity, fled to the Atlas mountains. Her suitor then sent out several searchers, among them a certain Delphinus. Delphinus accidentally stumbled upon her and was able to persuade Amphitrite to accept Poseidon's wooing. Out of gratitude the god placed the image of a dolphin among the stars.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The second story tells of the Greek poet [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] (7th century BC), who was saved by a dolphin.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=138-139}} He was a court musician at the palace of Periander, ruler of Corinth. Arion had amassed a fortune during his travels to Sicily and Italy. On his way home from [[Taranto|Tarentum]] his wealth caused the crew of his ship to conspire against him. Threatened with death, Arion asked to be granted a last wish which the crew granted: he wanted to sing a dirge.<ref>Herodotus, ''Histories'' I.23-24;<br>''also'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' XVI.19; [[Plutarch]], ''Conv. sept. sap.'' 160-62; [[Shakespeare]], ''Twelfth Night'' (Act I, Sc 2, line 16)</ref> This he did, and while doing so, flung himself into the sea.  There, he was rescued by a dolphin which had been charmed by Arion's music. The dolphin carried Arion to the coast of Greece and left.<ref name="S&T">{{cite journal |title = The Celestial Dolphin |last = Schaaf |first = Fred |page = 47 |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}</ref>

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Delphinus are located within ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|the Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').<ref>{{zh icon}}  [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060704.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 4 日]</ref>

In [[Polynesia]], two cultures recognized Delphinus as a constellation. On [[Pukapuka]], it was called ''Te Toloa'' and in the [[Tuamotus]], it was called ''Te Uru-o-tiki''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=283}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Delphinus (AF-24)]] and [[USS Delphinus (PHM-1)]], two [[United States]] Navy ships, are named after the constellation.
