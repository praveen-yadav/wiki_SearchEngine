The '''Admiralty''' was the authority responsible for the command of the [[Royal Navy]] in the [[Kingdom of England]], and later in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and until 1964 in the [[United Kingdom]]. Originally exercised by a single person, the [[List of Lord High Admirals and First Lords of the Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]], the Admiralty was from the early 18th century onwards almost invariably put "in commission" and exercised by the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]], who sat on the Board of Admiralty.

In 1964, the functions of the Admiralty were transferred to a new [[Admiralty Board (United Kingdom)|Admiralty Board]], which is a committee of the tri-service [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom]] and part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. The new Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a [[Navy Board]] (not to be confused with the historical Navy Board described later in this article). It is common for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to as simply ''The Admiralty''.

The title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom was vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] from 1964 to 2011. The title was awarded to [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] by the Queen on his 90th birthday.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13730067 |title=New title for Duke of Edinburgh as he turns 90 |work=BBC news |publisher=BBC |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> There also continues to be a [[Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom]] and a [[Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom]], both of which are honorary offices.

==Function and organisation==

===History===
[[Image:Flag of the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the Lord High Admiral]]
The office of ''Admiral of England'' (or ''Lord Admiral'' and later ''Lord High Admiral'') was created around 1400, though there were before this Admirals of the Northern and Western Seas. In 1546, King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] established the Council of the Marine, later to become the [[Navy Board]], to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the Navy remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine [[Great Officers of State]].

In 1628, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the Board of Admiralty. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until 1709, after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] in the early 19th century).

In 1831, the Navy Board was abolished as a separate entity and its duties and responsibilities were given over to the Admiralty.

In 1964, the Admiralty was subsumed into the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] along with the [[War Office]] and the [[Air Ministry]]. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new ''Admiralty Board'', ''Army Board'' and ''Air Force Board'', each headed by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]]. As mentioned above, there is also a new Navy Board in charge of the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy.

===The Board of Admiralty===

[[File:Board Room of Admiralty Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|right|Board of admiralty about 1810. The same board room is still used today]]

When the office of Lord High Admiral was in commission, as it was for most of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries until it reverted to [[the Crown]], it was exercised by a Board of Admiralty, officially known as the ''Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &c.'' (alternatively of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] or the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] depending on the period).

The Board of Admiralty consisted of a number of [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]]. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of [[admiral]]s, known as [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|Naval Lords or Sea Lords]], and Civil Lords, normally politicians. The [[quorum]] of the Board was two commissioners and a secretary.

The president of the Board was known as the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a member of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. After 1806, the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian, while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the [[First Sea Lord]].

==Admiralty buildings==

The Admiralty complex lies between [[Whitehall]], [[Horse Guards Parade]] and [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] and includes five buildings. Since the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these are now used as an "office bank" by the British government:

===The Admiralty===
The oldest building was long known simply as ''The Admiralty'', and is now referred to popularly as the ''Old Admiralty'' and officially as the [[Thomas Ripley (architect)|Ripley Building]].

It is a three storey U-shaped brick building completed in 1726. [[Alexander Pope]] implied the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the [[baroque]] style which was fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the [[Palladian]] style which was just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose built office building in Great Britain. It contained a board room, other state rooms and offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. [[Robert Adam]] designed the screen which was added to the entrance front in 1788. Nowadays the Ripley Building is allocated to the [[Department for International Development]].

===Admiralty House===
[[Admiralty House (London)|Admiralty House]] is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, serving that purpose until 1964. [[Winston Churchill]] was one of its occupants. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall, and is entered through the Ripley Building. It is a three-storey building in yellow brick with [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classicistic]] interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade. The architect was [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]]. There are now three ministerial flats in the building.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03367.pdf Ministerial Residences] {{deadlink|date=March 2013}}</ref>

===Old Admiralty Building (or Admiralty Extension or OAB)===
[[Image:Admiralty Extension from Horse Guards Parade - Sept 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Admiralty Extension (which is also one of the two buildings which are sometimes referred to as the "Old Admiralty") dates from the turn of the 20th century.]]
This is the largest of the Admiralty Buildings. It was begun in the late 19th century and redesigned while the construction was in progress to accommodate the extra offices needed due to the naval arms race with the [[German Empire]]. It is a red brick building with white stone detailing in the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]] with French influences. It is now used by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].

Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff refer to the building as the OAB (Old Admiralty Building).

===Admiralty Arch===

[[Admiralty Arch]] is linked to the Old Admiralty Building by a bridge and is part of the ceremonial route from Trafalgar Square to [[Buckingham Palace]]. It contains further office space currently used by the Cabinet Office.

===The Admiralty Citadel===
This is a squat windowless [[World War II]] fortress north west of Horse Guards Parade, now covered in ivy. See [[Military citadels under London]] for further details.

=="Admiralty" as a metonym for "sea power"==
[[File:Admiralty Citadel2008.jpg|thumb|right|Admiralty citadel|Bomb proof citadel constructed 1940 for Admiralty headquarters]]
In some cases, the term ''admiralty'' is used in a wider sense, as meaning ''[[Naval warfare|sea power]]'' or ''rule over the seas'', rather than in strict reference to the institution exercising such power. For example, the well-known lines from [[Kipling]]'s ''[[Song of the Dead]]'':
