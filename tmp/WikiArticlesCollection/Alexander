'''Alexander''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|k|s|ˈ|æ|n|d|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ə|k|s|ˈ|ɑː|n|d|ər}}) is a common male first name, and less common [[Alexander (surname)|surname]] derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "Αλέξανδρος" (Aléxandros). The most famous is [[Alexander the Great]], who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.

==Origin==
[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "Αλέξανδρος" (Aléxandros), meaning "defending men"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29le%2Fcandros ἀλέξανδρος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> or "protector of men", a compound of the verb "ἀλέξω" (alexō), "to ward off, to avert, to defend"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29le%2Fcw ἀλέξω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and the noun "ἀνδρός" (andros), genitive of "ἀνήρ" (anēr), "man".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29nh%2Fr ἀνήρ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek (or Indo-European more generally) names expressing "battle-prowess", in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy [[shield wall|battle line]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] feminine noun ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'' (transliterated as ''[[Alexandra]]''), written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=217 a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Alexandra)] Palaeolexicon,
Word study tool of ancient languages</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080627021042/http://www.geocities.com/kurogr/linearb.pdf Mycenaean (Linear B)&nbsp;– English Glossary]</ref><ref>''The Mycenaean World'', [[John Chadwick]], New York: Cambridge University Press, 1976, 1999</ref>

The name was one of the titles ("epithets") given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". In the [[Iliad]], the character [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is known also as Alexander.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*%29ale%2Fcandros Ἀλέξανδρος],
Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of [[Alexander the Great|King Alexander III, commonly known as "Alexander the Great"]]. Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named for him.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
