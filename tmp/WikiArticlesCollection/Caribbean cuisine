'''[[Caribbean]] cuisine''' is a fusion of [[African cuisine|African]],<ref name="bahama">[http://www.bahamabreeze.com/menus/cuisine/ "Cuisine."] (Caribbean.) [http://www.bahamabreeze.com Bahamabreeze.com]. Accessed July 2011.</ref> [[Amerindian cuisine|Amerindian]], [[European cuisine|European]],<ref name="bahama"/> [[Indian cuisine|East Indian]], and [[Chinese cuisine]]. These traditions were brought from the many homelands of this region's population.<ref name="bahama"/> In addition, the population has created styles that are unique to the region.

Traditional dishes are so important to regional culture that, for example, the local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of [[Montserrat]] and is also one of the signature dishes of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. Another popular dish in the Anglophone Caribbean is called "Cook-up", or Pelau. Ackee and Salt Fish is another popular dish that is unique to Jamaica. [[Callaloo]] is a dish containing leafy vegetables and sometimes [[okra]] amongst others, widely distributed in the Caribbean, with a distinctively mixed African and indigenous character. Ingredients which are common in most islands' dishes are [[rice]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[bean]]s, [[cassava]], [[cilantro]], [[bell pepper]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, [[coconut]], and any of various meats that are locally available (beef, poultry, pork or fish) as well as curries.

The variety of dessert dishes in the area also reflects the mixed origins of the recipes. In some areas, [[Black Cake]], a derivative of English Christmas pudding may be served, especially on special occasions.
