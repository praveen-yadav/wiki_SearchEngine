'''Brass''' is an [[alloy]] made of [[copper]] and [[zinc]]; the proportions of zinc and copper can be varied to create a range of brasses with varying properties.<ref>Engineering Designer 30(3): 6–9, May–June 2004</ref> 

By comparison, [[bronze]] is principally an alloy of copper and [[tin]].<ref>''Machinery Handbook'', Industrial Press Inc, New York, Edition 24, p. 501</ref> Bronze does not necessarily contain tin, and a variety of alloys of copper, including alloys with [[arsenic]], [[phosphorus]], [[aluminium]], [[manganese]], and [[silicon]], are commonly termed "bronze". The term is applied to a variety of brasses and the distinction is largely historical,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Bearings and bearing metals|publisher = The Industrial Press|year = 1921|page = 29|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=nopKAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA29}}</ref> both terms having a common antecedent in the term [[latten]]. 

Brass is a substitutional alloy. It is used for decoration for its bright gold-like appearance; for applications where low [[friction]] is required such as locks, gears, bearings, [[doorknobs]], [[ammunition]] casings and valves; for plumbing and electrical applications; and extensively in [[Brass instrument|musical instruments]] such as horns and bells for its acoustic properties. It is also used in [[zipper]]s. Brass is often used in situations where it is important that [[spark (fire)|spark]]s not be struck, as in fittings and tools around explosive gases.<ref>[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/hand_tools/nonsparking.html OSH Answers: Non-sparking tools].

==Properties==
[[File:Macrostructure of rolled and annealed brass; magnification 400X.jpg|thumb|right|[[Microstructure]] of rolled and annealed brass (400X magnification)]]
The [[Ductility|malleability]] and [[acoustics|acoustic]] properties of brass have made it the metal of choice for [[musical instrument]]s such as the [[trombone]], [[tuba]], [[trumpet]], [[cornet]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]], [[tenor horn]], and [[French horn]] which are collectively known as the brass within an [[orchestra]]. Even though the [[saxophone]] is classified as a [[woodwind instrument]] and the [[harmonica]] is a [[free reed aerophone]], both are also often made from brass. In [[Reed pipe|organ pipes]] of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the [[reed pipe|shallot]] (or beat "through" the shallot in the case of a "free" reed). Although not part of the brass section, [[snare drum]]s are also sometimes made of brass.

Brass has higher malleability than bronze or zinc. The relatively low [[melting point]] of brass (900 to 940&nbsp;°C, 1652 to 1724&nbsp;°F, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast. By varying the proportions of copper and zinc, the properties of the brass can be changed, allowing hard and soft brasses. The density of brass is approximately .303&nbsp;lb/cubic inch, 8.4 to 8.73&nbsp;grams per cubic centimetre.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.simetric.co.uk/si_metals.htm|title = Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Different Metals|accessdate = 2009-01-09|last = Walker|first = Roger|work = Density of Materials|publisher = SImetric.co.uk|location = United Kingdom|quote = brass – casting, 8400–8700... brass – rolled and drawn, 8430–8730}}</ref> 

Today almost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled.<ref>{{cite book|author1=M. F. Ashby|author2=Kara Johnson|title=Materials and design: the art and science of material selection in product design|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-RN57euC7x8C&pg=PA223|accessdate=12 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-5554-5|pages=223–}}</ref> Because brass is not [[ferromagnetic]], it can be separated from ferrous scrap by passing the scrap near a powerful magnet. Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry where it is melted and recast into [[billet (semi-finished product)|billet]]s. Billets are heated and extruded into the desired form and size.

Aluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of [[aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in [[seawater]] applications (naval brasses). Combinations of iron, aluminium, silicon and manganese make brass [[wear and tear]] resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/brass/downloads/117/117-section-6-types-of-brass.pdf|title = Pub 117 The Brasses – Properties & Applications|accessdate = 2012-05-09|author = Copper Development Association}}</ref>

==Lead content==
To enhance the machinability of brass, [[lead]] is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower [[melting point]] than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the grain boundaries in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stagnation Time, Composition, pH, and Orthophosphate Effects on Metal Leaching from Brass|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency|date = September 1996|location = Washington DC|page = 7|id = EPA/600/R-96/103}}</ref>

[[Silicon]] is an alternative to lead; however, when silicon is used in a brass alloy, the scrap must never be mixed with leaded brass scrap because of contamination and safety problems.<ref>[https://www.chasebrass.com/productline/index_greendot.jsp Chase Brass & Copper Company, Inc]. Chasebrass.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-09.</ref>

In October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content. In laboratory tests, state researchers found the average brass key, new or old, exceeded the [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]] limits by an average factor of 19, assuming handling twice a day.<ref name="ca_ag">[http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=529 News & Alerts – California Dept. of Justice – Office of the Attorney General], October 12, 1999</ref> In April 2001 manufacturers agreed to reduce lead content to 1.5%, or face a requirement to warn consumers about lead content. Keys plated with other metals are not affected by the settlement, and may continue to use brass alloys with higher percentage of lead content.<ref>[http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/print_release.php?id=1077 News & Alerts – California Dept. of Justice – Office of the Attorney General], April 27, 2001</ref><ref>San Francisco Superior Court, People v. Ilco Unican Corp., et a. (No. 307102) and Mateel Environmental Justice Foundation v. Ilco Unican Corp., et al. (No. 305765)</ref>

Also in California, lead-free materials must be used for "each component that comes into contact with the wetted surface of pipes and [[Piping and plumbing fittings|pipe fittings]], plumbing fittings and fixtures." On January 1, 2010, the maximum amount of lead in "lead-free brass" in California was reduced from 4% to 0.25% lead. The common practice of using pipes for electrical grounding is discouraged, as it accelerates lead corrosion.<ref name="info.sen.ca.gov">[http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_1951-2000/ab_1953_cfa_20060818_134053_sen_floor.html AB 1953 Assembly Bill – Bill Analysis].

==Corrosion-resistant brass for harsh environments==

[[File:00 BMA Automation Sampling cock.JPG|thumb|200px|Brass sampling cock with stainless steel handle.]] The so-called dezincification resistant ([[Selective leaching#Leaching of zinc|DZR]] or DR) brasses are used where there is a large corrosion risk and where normal brasses do not meet the standards. Applications with high water temperatures, [[chloride]]s present, or deviating water qualities ([[soft water]]) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water [[boiler]] systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.

==Germicidal and antimicrobial applications==
{{Main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}

{{See also|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Copper alloys in aquaculture}}

The [[copper]] in brass makes brass [[Antiseptic|germicidal]]. Depending upon the type and concentration of [[pathogens]] and the medium they are in, brass kills these [[microorganisms]] within a few minutes to hours of contact.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name=r6/><ref name=r7/>

The [[bactericidal]] properties of brass have been observed for centuries and were confirmed in the laboratory in 1983.<ref name=r25/> Subsequent experiments by research groups around the world reconfirmed the antimicrobial efficacy of brass, as well as copper and other copper alloys (see [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces]]).<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name=r6/><ref name=r7/> Extensive structural membrane damage to [[bacteria]] was noted after being exposed to copper.

In 2007, [[U.S. Department of Defense]]’s [[Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (United States Army)|Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC)]] began to study the antimicrobial properties of copper alloys, including four brasses (C87610, C69300, C26000, C46400) in a multi-site clinical hospital trial conducted at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] (New York City), the [[Medical University of South Carolina]], and the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center (South Carolina).<ref name=r1/><ref name=r10/> Commonly touched items, such as bed rails, over-the-bed tray tables, chair arms, nurse's call buttons, IV poles, etc. were retrofitted with antimicrobial copper alloys in certain patient rooms (i.e., the “coppered” rooms) in the [[Intensive Care Unit]] (ICU). Early results disclosed in 2011 indicate that the coppered rooms demonstrated a 97% reduction in surface [[pathogens]] versus the non-coppered rooms. This reduction is the same level achieved by “terminal” cleaning regimens conducted after patients vacate their rooms. Furthermore, of critical importance to health care professionals, the preliminary results indicated that patients in the coppered ICU rooms had a 40.4% lower risk of contracting a [[hospital acquired infection]] versus patients in non-coppered ICU rooms.<ref name=r1/><ref>[http://www.coppertouchsurfaces.org/press/releases/20110701.html TouchSurfaces Clinical Trials: Research Proves]. Coppertouchsurfaces.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-09.</ref><ref>World Health Organization’s 1st International Conference on Prevention and Infection Control (ICPIC) in Geneva, Switzerland on July 1st, 2011</ref> The U.S. Department of Defense investigation contract, which is ongoing, will also evaluate the effectiveness of copper alloy touch surfaces to prevent the transfer of [[microbe]]s to patients and the transfer of microbes from patients to touch surfaces, as well as the potential efficacy of copper-alloy based components to improve [[indoor air quality]].

In the U.S., the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] regulates the registration of antimicrobial products. After extensive antimicrobial testing according to the Agency’s stringent test protocols, 355 [[copper alloys]], including many brasses, were found to kill more than 99.9% of [[methicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' O157:H7, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Enterobacter aerogenes]]'', and vancomycin-resistant ''[[Enterococci]]'' (VRE) within two hours of contact.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name=r20/> Normal tarnishing was found not to  impair antimicrobial effectiveness.

Antimicrobial tests have also revealed significant reductions of MRSA as well as two strains of epidemic MRSA (EMRSA-1 and EMRSA-16) on brass (C24000 with 80% Cu) at room temperature (22 °C) within three hours. Complete kills of the pathogens were observed within {{frac|4|1|2}} hours. These tests were performed under wet exposure conditions. The kill timeframes, while impressive, are nevertheless longer than for pure copper, where kill timeframes ranged between 45 to 90 minutes.<ref name=r7/>

A novel [[assay]] that mimics dry bacterial exposure to touch surfaces was developed because this test method is thought to more closely replicate real world touch surface exposure conditions.  In these conditions, copper alloy surfaces were found to kill several million Colony Forming Units of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' within minutes.<ref name=r8/> This observation, and the fact that kill timeframes shorten as the percentage of copper in an alloy increases, is proof that copper is the ingredient in brass and other copper alloys that kills the microbes.<ref name=r22/>

The mechanisms of antimicrobial action by copper and its alloys, including brass, is a subject of intense and ongoing investigation.<ref name=r6/><ref name=r8/><ref name=r9/> It is believed that the mechanisms are multifaceted and include the following: 1) [[Potassium]] or [[glutamate]] leakage through the outer membrane of bacteria; 2) [[Osmotic]] balance disturbances; 3) Binding to [[proteins]] that do not require or utilize copper; 4) [[Oxidative stress]] by [[hydrogen peroxide]] generation.

Research is being conducted at this time to determine whether brass, copper, and other copper alloys can help to reduce cross contamination in public facilities and reduce the incidence of [[nosocomial infections]] (hospital acquired infections) in healthcare facilities.

Also, owing to its antimicrobial/algaecidal properties that prevent [[biofouling]], in conjunction with its strong structural and [[corrosion-resistant]] benefits for [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environments, brass alloy netting cages are currently being deployed in commercial-scale [[Copper alloys in aquaculture|aquaculture]] operations in Asia, South America, and the USA.

==Season cracking==
[[File:BrassSCC1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cracking in brass caused by [[ammonia]] attack]]

Brass is susceptible to [[stress corrosion cracking]], especially from [[ammonia]] or substances containing or releasing ammonia. The problem is sometimes known as [[season cracking]] after it was first discovered in brass [[cartridge case]]s used for [[rifle]] [[ammunition]] during the 1920s in the [[Indian Army]]. The problem was caused by high [[residual stress]]es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.

==Brass types==
*'''Admiralty brass''' contains 30% zinc, with 1% tin to inhibit [[Dezincification resistant brass|dezincification]] in many environments.
*'''Aich's alloy''' typically contains 60.66% copper, 36.58% zinc, 1.02% tin, and 1.74% iron. Designed for use in marine service owing to its corrosion resistance, hardness and toughness. A characteristic application is to the protection of ships' bottoms, but more modern methods of cathodic protection have rendered its use less common. Its appearance resembles that of gold.<ref>Simons, E.N. (1970). ''A Dictionary of Alloys'', Cornell University</ref>
*'''Alpha brasses''' with less than 35% zinc, are malleable, can be worked cold, and are used in pressing, forging, or similar applications. They contain only one phase, with [[face-centered cubic]] [[crystal structure]].

Npi.gov.au. Retrieved on 2011-12-09.</ref> The alloy was named after [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]].
*'''Alpha-beta brass''' ([[Muntz metal]]), also called '''duplex brass''', is 35–45% zinc and is suited for hot working. It contains both α and β' phase; the β'-phase is [[body-centered cubic]] and is harder and stronger than α. Alpha-beta brasses are usually worked hot.
*'''Aluminium brass''' contains [[aluminium]], which improves its corrosion resistance. It is used for seawater service<ref>[http://www.makeitfrom.com/data/?material=Aluminum_Brass Material Properties Data: Aluminum Brass]. Makeitfrom.com.

==History==
Although forms of brass have been in use since [[prehistory]],<ref>Thornton, C. P. (2007) [http://www.safarmer.com/Indo-Eurasian/Brass2007.pdf "Of brass and bronze in prehistoric southwest Asia"] in La Niece, S. Hook, D. and Craddock, P.T. (eds.) ''Metals and mines: Studies in archaeometallurgy'' London: Archetype Publications. ISBN 1-904982-19-0</ref> its true nature as a copper-zinc alloy was not understood until the post medieval period because the zinc [[vapor]] which reacted with copper to make brass was not recognised as a [[metal]].<ref>de Ruette, M.

===Early copper zinc alloys===
In [[West Asia]] and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] early copper zinc alloys are now known in small numbers from a number of third Millennium BC sites in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Iraq]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kalmykia]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and from 2nd Millennium BC sites in [[West India]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], Iraq and [[Israel]].<ref>Thornton 2007, pp. 189–201</ref> However, isolated examples of copper-zinc [[alloy]]s are known in [[China]] from as early as the 5th Millennium BC.<ref name=r5/>

The compositions of these early "brass" objects are very variable and most have zinc contents of between 5% and 15% wt which is lower than in brass produced by cementation.<ref name="Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217">Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p. 217</ref> These may be "[[natural alloys]]" manufactured by smelting zinc rich copper ores in [[redox]] conditions. Many have similar tin contents to contemporary bronze [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] and it is possible that some copper-zinc alloys were accidental and perhaps not even distinguished from copper.<ref name="Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217"/> However the large number of copper-zinc alloys now known suggests that at least some were deliberately manufactured and many have zinc contents of more than 12% wt which would have resulted in a distinctive golden color.<ref name="Craddock and Eckstein 2003 p.217" /><ref>Thornton, C.P and Ehlers, C.B. (2003) "Early Brass in the ancient Near East" in IAMS Newsletter 23 pp. 27–36</ref>

By the 8th–7th century BC [[Assyria]]n [[cuneiform]] tablets mention the exploitation of the "copper of the mountains" and this may refer to "natural" brass.<ref>Bayley 1990, p. 8</ref> ''[[Oreichalkos]]'', the [[Ancient Greek]] translation of this term, was later adapted to the [[Latin]] ''[[aurichalcum]]'' meaning "golden copper" which became the standard term for brass.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, p. 169</ref> In the 4th century BC [[Plato]] knew ''oreichalkos'' as rare and nearly as valuable as gold<ref name=r11/> and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes how ''aurichalcum'' had come from [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] ore deposits which had been exhausted by the 1st century AD.<ref>Pliny the Elder ''Historia Naturalis'' XXXIV 2</ref>

===Brass making in the Roman World===
During the later part of first millennium BC the use of brass spread across a wide geographical area from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]<ref name=r12/> and [[Spain]]<ref name=r13/> in the west to [[Iran]], and [[India]] in the east.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, pp. 216–7</ref> This seems to have been encouraged by exports and influence from the [[Middle-East]] and eastern Mediterranean where deliberate production of brass from metallic copper and zinc ores had been introduced.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 217</ref> The 4th century BC writer [[Theopompus]], quoted by [[Strabo]], describes how heating earth from [[Andeira]] in [[Turkey]] produced "droplets of false silver", probably metallic zinc, which could be used to turn copper into oreichalkos.<ref>Bayley 1990, p. 9</ref> In the 1st century BC the Greek [[Dioscorides]] seems to have recognised a link between zinc [[minerals]] and brass describing how [[Cadmia]] ([[zinc oxide]]) was found on the walls of [[furnaces]] used to heat either zinc ore or copper and explaining that it can then be used to make brass.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, pp. 222–4. Bayley 1990, p. 10.</ref> 

By the first century BC brass was available in sufficient supply to use as [[coin]]age in [[Phrygia]] and [[Bithynia]],<ref name=r14/> and after the Augustan [[currency reform]] of 23 BC it was also used to make Roman ''[[dupondius|dupondii]]'' and ''[[sestertii]]''.<ref name=r15/> The uniform use of brass for coinage and military equipment across the [[Roman world]] may indicate a degree of state involvement in the industry,<ref>Bayley 1990, p. 21</ref><ref name=r16/> and brass even seems to have been deliberately boycotted by [[Jewish]] communities in Palestine because of its association with Roman authority.<ref name=r17/>
 
Brass was produced by the cementation process where copper and zinc ore are heated together until zinc vapor is produced which reacts with the copper. There is good archaeological evidence for this process and [[crucibles]] used to produce brass by cementation have been found on [[Roman period]] sites including [[Xanten]]<ref name=r18/> and [[Nidda, Hesse|Nidda]]<ref name=r19/> in [[Germany]], [[Lyon]] in [[France]]<ref name="ReferenceA">Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 170–1</ref> and at a number of sites in Britain.<ref>Bayley 1990</ref> They vary in size from tiny acorn sized to large [[amphorae]] like vessels but all have elevated levels of zinc on the interior and are lidded.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> They show no signs of [[slag]] or metal [[prills]] suggesting that zinc minerals were heated to produce zinc vapor which reacted with metallic copper in a [[solid state reaction]]. The fabric of these crucibles is porous, probably designed to prevent a build up of pressure, and many have small holes in the lids which may be designed to release pressure<ref name="ReferenceA"/> or to add additional zinc minerals near the end of the process. Dioscorides mentioned that zinc minerals were used for both the working and finishing of brass, perhaps suggesting secondary additions.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 224</ref> 

Brass made during the early Roman period seems to have varied between 20% to 28% wt zinc.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 224</ref> The high content of zinc in coinage and brass objects declined after the first century AD and it has been suggested that this reflects zinc loss during [[recycling]] and thus an interruption in the production of new brass.<ref>Caley 1964</ref> However it is now thought this was probably a deliberate change in composition<ref name=r21/> and overall the use of brass increases over this period making up around 40% of all [[copper alloys]] used in the Roman world by the 4th century AD.<ref>Craddock 1978, p. 14</ref>

===Brass making in the medieval period===

Little is known about the production of brass during the centuries immediately after the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]]. Disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from [[Western Europe]] may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the 6th–7th centuries AD over 90% of [[copper alloy]] artefacts from [[Egypt]] were made of brass.<ref>Craddock, P.T. La Niece, S.C and Hook, D. (1990) "Brass in the Medieval Islamic World" in Craddock, P.T. (ed.) ''2000 Years of Zinc and Brass'' London: British Museum p. 73</ref> However other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the [[Islamic]] and [[Byzantine]] world.<ref name=r4/> Conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in Western Europe during this period in favour of [[gunmetal]]s and other mixed alloys<ref>Bayley 1990, p. 22</ref> but by the end of the first Millennium AD brass artefacts are found in [[Scandinavia]]n graves in [[Scotland]],<ref name=r24/> brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in [[Northumbria]]<ref>Gilmore, G.R. and Metcalf, D.M (1980) "The alloy of the Northumbrian coinage in the mid-ninth century" in Metcalf, D and Oddy, W. ''Metallurgy in Numismatics'' 1 pp. 83–98</ref> and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of brass in Germany<ref>Rehren 1999</ref> and [[The Low Countries]]<ref>Day 1990, pp. 123–150</ref> areas rich in [[calamine]] ore which would remain important centres of brass making throughout the [[medieval]] period,<ref>Day 1990, pp. 124–33</ref> especially [[Dinant]] – brass objects are still collectively known as ''dinanterie'' in French. The [[baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] in modern [[Belgium]] (before 1117) is an outstanding masterpiece of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] brass casting.

The cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both Europe and the [[Islamic world]] seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took places in open-topped crucibles.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, pp. 224–5</ref> Islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as ''tutiya'' or [[tutty]] rather than zinc ores for brass making resulting in a metal with lower [[iron]] impurities.<ref>Craddock et al 1990, 78</ref> A number of Islamic writers and the 13th century [[Italians|Italian]] [[Marco Polo]] describe how this was obtained by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] from zinc ores and [[Condensation|condensed]] onto [[clay]] or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at [[Hindu Kush|Kush]] in Iran.<ref>Craddock et al 1990, pp. 73–6</ref> It could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. In 10th century [[Yemen]] [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī|al-Hamdani]] described how spreading [[al-iglimiya]], probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal.<ref>Craddock et al 1990, p. 75</ref> The 13th century Iranian writer [[al-Kashani]] describes a more complex process whereby ''tutiya'' was mixed with [[raisin]]s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.<ref>Craddock et al 1990, p. 76</ref> 

In Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by [[Albertus Magnus]] in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology.<ref>Rehren, T (1999) "The same...but different: A juxtaposition of Roman and Medieval brass making in Europe" in Young, S.M.M. (ed.) ''Metals in antiquity'' Oxford: Archaeopress pp. 252–7</ref> The 12th century [[Germans|German]] monk [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and [[charcoal]] then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was [[casting|cast]], then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]].<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226</ref> Albertus Magnus noted that the "power" of both calamine and tutty could [[evaporate]] and described how the addition of powdered [[glass]] could create a film to bind it to the metal.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 176–8</ref> 
German brass making crucibles are known from [[Dortmund]] dating to the 10th century AD and from [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] and [[Schwerte]] in [[Westphalia]] dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although [[ceramic]] discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc [[evaporation]], and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.<ref>Rehren and Martinon Torres 2008, pp. 173–5</ref>

===Brass making in Renaissance and post-medieval Europe===
The [[Renaissance]] saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at [[Zwickau]] in Germany.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 95–111</ref> These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20&nbsp;kg of brass.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, pp. 105–6</ref> There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggesting that this was a lower temperature not entirely liquid process.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 103</ref> The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] in the final stages.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 104</ref> Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for [[casting]].<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2002, p. 100</ref> 

16th-century technical writers such as [[Biringuccio]], [[Ercker]] and [[Georg Agricola|Agricola]] described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added.<ref>Martinon Torres and Rehren 2008, 181–2, de Ruette 1995</ref> Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace By 1513 metallic zinc [[ingot]]s from India and China were arriving in [[London]] and pellets of zinc condensed in [[furnace]] flues at the [[Rammelsberg]] in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198</ref>

Eventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be [[alloyed]] with copper to make brass; a process known as speltering<ref name="Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228">Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228</ref> and by 1657 the German chemist [[Johann Glauber]] had recognised that calamine was "nothing else but unmeltable zinc" and that zinc was a "half ripe metal."<ref>de Ruette 1995, 198–9</ref> However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] from England may have been made by alloying copper with ''zinc'' and include traces of [[cadmium]] similar those found in some zinc ingots from China.<ref name="Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 228"/>
 
However the cementation process was not abandoned and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of [[Solid-state chemistry|solid-state]] cementation in a domed furnace at around 900–950 °C and lasting up to 10 hours.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, 226–7.</ref> The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of [[battery wares]].<ref name="Day 1990, 131">Day 1990, p. 131</ref> By 1559 the Germany city of [[Aachen]] alone was capable of producing 300,000 [[centum weight|cwt]] of brass per year.<ref name="Day 1990, 131"/> After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper [[smelted]] in the new [[coal]] fired [[reverberatory furnace]].<ref>Day 1991, pp. 135–44</ref> In 1723 [[Bristol]] brass maker [[Nehemiah Champion]] patented the use of [[granulated]] copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water.<ref>Day 1990, p. 138</ref> This increased the [[surface area]] of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.<ref>Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 227</ref> 

In 1738 Nehemiah's son [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patented a technique for the first industrial scale [[distillation]] of metallic zinc known as ''distillation per descencum'' or "the English process."<ref>Day 1991, pp. 179–81</ref><ref name=r3/> This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as [[scientific instruments]], [[clocks]], brass [[buttons]] and [[costume jewellery]].<ref name="Day 1991, 183">Day 1991, p. 183</ref> However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass<ref name="Day 1991, 183"/> and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at [[Warmley]].<ref name=r2/> By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as [[John-Jaques Dony]]'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc<ref>Day 1991, pp. 186–9</ref> as well as demand for [[corrosion]]-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.<ref>Day 1991, pp. 192–3, Craddock and Eckstein 2003, p. 228</ref>
