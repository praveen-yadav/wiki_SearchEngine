[[Dubstep]] producer [[Skream]],  is quoted in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in September 2011 as saying "The word dubstep is being used by a lot of people and there were a lot of people being tagged with the dubstep brush. They don't want to be tagged with it and shouldn't be tagged with it - that's not what they're pushing... When I say 'UK bass', it's what everyone UK is associated with so it would be a lot easier if it was called that."<ref>{{cite news|title=Skream: "I want to make sure once this fad dies out, I'm still standing"|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/09/13/skream-%E2%80%98i-want-to-make-sure-once-this-fad-dies-out-i%E2%80%99m-still-standing%E2%80%99/|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2011-09-13|accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref>
