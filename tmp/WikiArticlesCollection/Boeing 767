The '''Boeing 767''' is a mid- to large-size, [[flight duration|long-range]], [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] twin-engine [[jet airliner]] built by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]].  It was the manufacturer's first wide-body [[twinjet]] and its first airliner with a two-crew [[glass cockpit]]. The aircraft has two [[turbofan]] engines, a conventional [[tailplane|tail]], and, for reduced [[aerodynamic drag]], a [[supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]] design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747|747]], the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 persons and a [[Range (aircraft)|design range]] of {{Convert|3850|to|6385|nmi|km|lk=in}}, depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] twinjet, the [[Boeing 757|757]], resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common [[type rating]] to operate both aircraft.

The 767 is produced in three [[fuselage]] lengths. The original 767-200 entered service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an extended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a production [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, while military derivatives include the [[Boeing E-767|E-767]] [[Airborne early warning and control|surveillance]] aircraft, the [[Boeing KC-767|KC-767]] and [[Boeing KC-46|KC-46]] aerial [[aerial refueling|tankers]], and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 include the [[General Electric CF6]], [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D]] and [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000|PW4000]], and [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] turbofans.

[[United Airlines]] first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and [[Transcontinental flight across the United States|transcontinental]] routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] service on [[Flight length|medium- to long-haul]] intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the [[Boeing 777|777]], a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for [[transatlantic flight]]s between North America and Europe.

The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered.  As of May 2013, Boeing has received 1,108 orders for the 767 from 71 customers; 1,045 have been delivered.  A total of 838 of these aircraft were in service in July 2012; the most popular variant is the 767-300ER, with 552 delivered; [[Delta Air Lines]] is the largest operator, with 94 aircraft. Competitors have included the [[Airbus A300]], [[Airbus A310|A310]], and [[Airbus A330|A330-200]], while a successor, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]], entered service in October 2011.

==Development==

===Background===
In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.<ref name=Eden_p102/> The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutter|2006|p=103.}}</ref>  Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the [[Boeing 707|707]] and other early generation narrow-body jets.<ref name=n157/><ref name=saver/> The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] wide-bodies.<ref name=n157/> To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation [[Aeritalia]] and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.<ref name=n156>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=156.}}</ref> This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation.<ref name=n156/> The initial 7X7 was conceived as a [[STOL|short take-off and landing]] airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner.<ref name=n157>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=156–57.}}</ref> At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a [[T-tail]].<ref name=Eden_p102>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=102–03.}}</ref>

[[File:Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-232 Farnborough 1982 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|The 7X7 would make its [[Farnborough Airshow]] debut in 1982 as the 767-200.|alt=Side view of twin-engine jet touching down on runway, with deployed flaps and thrust reversers.]]

By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the [[Airbus A300]], became the baseline configuration.<ref name=no20/> The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants.<ref name=no20>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=20–21.}}</ref> While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous,<ref name=no20/> the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets.<ref name=Eden_p102/> As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities.<ref name=Eden_p103>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=103.}}</ref> Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including [[high-bypass turbofan|high-bypass-ratio turbofan]] engines, new flight deck systems, [[aerodynamic]] improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7.<ref name=n157/><ref name=no19>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=18–19.}}</ref> Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757.<ref name=no19/> Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.<ref name=davies103>{{harvnb|Davies|2000|p=103.}}</ref><ref name=n143/>

In January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett factory]]—which was then dedicated to the manufacture of the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=8.}}</ref> In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation,<ref>{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=24.}}</ref> and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a [[trijet]] 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes.<ref name=no20/><ref>{{harvnb|Donald|1997|page= 173.}}</ref> The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes.<ref name=n159>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=159–60.}}</ref> The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from [[American Airlines]] and Delta Air Lines later that year.<ref name=n159/> The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating,<ref name=n159/> while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.<ref name=no20/>

===Design effort===
In the late 1970s, [[operating cost]] replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases.<ref name=saver/> As a result, the 767's design process emphasized [[fuel efficiency]] from the outset.<ref name=n157/> Boeing targeted a 20 to 30&nbsp;percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology.<ref name=saver>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1981/1981%20-%202612.html |title=Boeing 767: The new fuel saver |date=August 8, 1981 |last=Velupillai |first=David |work=Flight International |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |pages=436–37, 439, 440–41, 445–48, 453}}</ref> As development progressed, engineers used [[computer-aided design]] for over one-third of the 767's design drawings,<ref name=saver/> and performed 26,000 hours of [[wind tunnel]] tests.<ref name=n159/> Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost.<ref name=no19/><ref name=n143>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=143.}}</ref> Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including [[avionics]], [[flight management system]]s, instruments, and handling characteristics.<ref name=no23/> Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=saver/>

[[File:Continental Airlines Boeing 767-400ER Wallner.jpg|thumb|left|Forward view of a [[Continental Airlines]] 767-400ER, showing fuselage profile, [[Dihedral (aircraft)|wing dihedral]], and [[General Electric CF6|CF6]] engines|alt=Forward view of aircraft, showing fuselage profile, two circular engines.]]

Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner.<ref name=no22/> Both jet engine models had a maximum output of {{convert|48000|lbf|kN}} of [[Jet engine#Thrust|thrust]].<ref name=Eden_p103/> The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets.<ref name=saver/> The larger wings were designed using an [[supercritical airfoil|aft-loaded]] shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed [[lift (force)|lift]] more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft.<ref name=saver/><ref name=n160/> The wings provided higher-altitude [[Cruise (flight)|cruise]] performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants.<ref name=n159/> The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic,<ref name=Sutter_p241>{{harvnb|Sutter|2006|pp=241–46.}}</ref> and would be capable of operating routes up to {{convert|3850|nmi|km}}.<ref name=h43>{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=43–44.}}</ref>

The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at {{convert|16.5|ft|m|sigfig=3}}.<ref name=n157/> While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag.<ref name=Eden_p103/><ref name=no22>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=21–22.}}</ref>  However, the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body [[unit load device]]s side-by-side.<ref name=Haenggi_p29>{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=29.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=14.}}</ref> As a result, a smaller container, the LD2,<ref name=767_airport_report/> was created specifically for the 767.<ref name=n158>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=158.}}</ref>  The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section,<ref name=no22/> providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.<ref name=saver/><ref name=no22/>

The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit.<ref name=no23>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=23.}}</ref> [[Cathode ray tube]] (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the [[flight engineer]] by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly.<ref name=no23/> Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft.<ref name=2crew/> The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a U.S. presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets.<ref name=2crew>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/pf/pf_fltdeck.html |title=History of the 767 Two-Crew Flight Deck |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=32.}}</ref> A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models.<ref name=becher33>{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=33.}}</ref> [[Ansett Australia]] ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured.<ref name=becher33/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p= 117.}}</ref> The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course,<ref name=n160>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=160.}}</ref> and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types.<ref name=intro/>

===Production and testing===
To produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC.<ref name=n156/> The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, [[Boeing Rotorcraft Systems|Boeing Vertol]] made the [[leading edge]] for the wings, and [[Spirit AeroSystems|Boeing Wichita]] produced the forward fuselage.<ref name=saver/> The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely [[Fuji Heavy Industries]] ([[Aircraft fairing|wing fairings]] and gear doors), [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] (center fuselage), and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] (rear fuselage, doors, and tail).<ref name=n156/> Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory.<ref name=saver/> For expedited production of wing [[Spar (aviation)|spars]], the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received [[robot]]ic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting [[fastener]]s.<ref name=saver/> This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747.<ref name=saver/> Final assembly of the first aircraft began on July 6, 1979.<ref name=Eden_p102/>

The prototype aircraft, [[aircraft registration|registered]] N767BA and equipped with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981.<ref name=Shaw_twins>{{harvnb|Shaw|1999|page = 64.}}</ref> By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including [[Air Canada]], [[All Nippon Airways]], [[Britannia Airways]], [[Transbrasil]], and [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA).<ref name=saver/> On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its [[maiden flight]] under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit.<ref name=n161/> The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the [[undercarriage|landing gear]] owing to a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] fluid leak.<ref name=n161/> The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.<ref name=b17/>

The 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built.<ref name=Eden_p102/><ref name=b17/> The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines.<ref name=Eden_p103/><ref name=b50>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=49–52.}}</ref> The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance,<ref name=b50/> while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights.<ref name=testing/> During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets.<ref name=testing>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200710.html |title= Boeing tests the twins |last=Sweetman |first=Bill |date=March 20, 1982 |work=Flight International |accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Following the successful completion of 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and the U.K. [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) in July 1982.<ref name=n161>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=161–62.}}</ref><ref name=b17>{{harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=16–18, 27.}}</ref> The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines.<ref name=n161/> The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.<ref name=Eden_p103/>

===Service entry and operations===
The 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982.<ref name=Haenggi_p31-5/> The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route.<ref name=Haenggi_p31-5>{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=31–5.}}</ref> The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines.<ref name=Eden_p102/> Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including U.S. transcontinental services.<ref name=b49/> American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while [[Air Canada]], [[China Airlines]], and [[El Al]] began operating the aircraft in 1983.<ref>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=55–58.}}</ref> The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] than prior jetliners.<ref name=smooth>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%200561.html |title=Boeing 767 moves smoothly into service |last=Lynn |first=Norman |date=April 2, 1983 |work=Flight International |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1&nbsp;percent rate of [[takeoff]] without delay due to technical issues, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft.<ref name=smooth/> Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance.<ref name=smooth/> Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an [[evacuation slide]] latch, and the repair of a [[tailplane]] pivot to match production specifications.<ref name=smooth/>

Seeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service.<ref name=no163>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=163.}}</ref> [[Ethiopian Airlines]] placed the first order for the type in December 1982.<ref name=no163/><ref name="Boe_767_back">{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/background.html |title=Boeing 767 Program Background |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> Featuring increased [[gross weight]] specifications and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier [[Payload (air and space craft)|payloads]] at distances up to {{convert|6385|nmi|km}},<ref name=762specs/> and was targeted at overseas customers.<ref name=Eden_p103/> The 767-200ER entered service with El Al on March 27, 1984.<ref name="Boe_767_back"/> The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.<ref name=Eden_p103/>

In the mid-1980s, the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards ([[ETOPS]]) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines.<ref name=no163/>  Before the 767, over-water flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from [[diversion airport]]s.<ref name=haenggi_p38-40>{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=38–40.}}</ref> In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria.<ref name=haenggi_p38-40/> This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land.<ref name=haenggi_p38-40/> The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines.<ref name=haenggi_p38-40/> The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration,<ref name=b49>{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=49–53.}}</ref> and all available engines received approval by 1993.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|pp= 150, 154–55.}}</ref> Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.<ref name=no163/><ref name=haenggi_p42>{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=42.}}</ref>

===Stretched derivatives===
Forecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984.<ref name=no163/><ref name=Eden_p104/> Both models offered a 20&nbsp;percent passenger capacity increase,<ref name=767_airport_report/> while the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to {{convert|5990|nmi|km}}.<ref name=763specs/> [[Japan Airlines]] placed the first order for the 767-300 in September 1983.<ref name=no163/> Following its first flight on January 30, 1986,<ref name=Eden_p104>{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=103–04.}}</ref> the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986.<ref name="Boe_767_back"/> The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986,<ref name="Boe_767_back"/> but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed.<ref name=Eden_p104/> The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988.<ref name="Boe_767_back"/> The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold.<ref name=no163/>

After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the "Hunchback of Mukilteo" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090601173533/http://www.aiaa.org/sections/cl/what/mckinzie.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2009 |url=http://www.aiaa.org/sections/cl/what/mckinzie.htm |title=How United Airlines Helped Design The World's Most Remarkable Airliner |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |last=McKinzie|first=Gordon |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pages= 11–13, 15.}}</ref> In 1986, the manufacturer announced the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest.<ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13/> By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the [[Boeing 777|777]] designation.<ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13/> Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.<ref name=Eden_p104/>
