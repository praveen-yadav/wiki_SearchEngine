The '''Denver Broncos''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. They are members of the [[AFC West|West Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] in the [[National Football League]]. The Broncos began play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger]] of 1970.

The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL, never making the playoffs.  They did not have a winning season until [[1973 Denver Broncos season|1973]]. However, four years later, they made the playoffs for the first time and advanced all the way to the [[Super Bowl]]. Since then, the Broncos have been a very successful team, having suffered only six losing seasons in the last 35 years.  They have won an additional five [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]] and won two Super Bowls. They play at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]] and have four players in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]: [[John Elway]], [[Floyd Little]], [[Gary Zimmerman]], and [[Shannon Sharpe]].

{{details|History of the Denver Broncos}}
{{Further|List of Denver Broncos seasons}}

===1960–69: AFL era===
The '''Denver Broncos''' were founded on August 14, 1959 when [[minor league baseball]] owner [[Bob Howsam]] was awarded an American Football League charter franchise.<ref name="profootballhof1">{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=10|title=Team – Pro Football Hall of Fame |work=Pro Football Hall of Fame |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>
The Broncos won the first-ever AFL game over the [[New England Patriots|Boston Patriots]] 13–10, on September 9, 1960. On August 5, [[1967 AFL season|1967]], they became the first ever AFL team to defeat an NFL team after beating the [[Detroit Lions]] 13–7, in a preseason game.<ref name="profootballhof1"/> However, the Broncos were not successful in the 1960s, compiling a record of 39–97–4 in the league.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/Broncos.htm |title=Denver Broncos: American Football League Charter Members |work=Conigliofamily.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref>

Denver came close to losing its franchise in [[1965 Denver Broncos season|1965]], but a local ownership group took control and rebuilt the team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/denver_broncos/team_history.html |title=Denver Broncos Team History |work=NFLteamhistory.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> The team's first superstar, "Franchise" [[Floyd Little]], due to his signing in [[1967 Denver Broncos season|1967]] and his Pro Bowl efforts on and off the field, was instrumental in keeping the team in Denver. They were the only original AFL team never to have played in the title game, as well as the only original AFL team never to have a winning season while a member of the AFL during the upstart league's 10-year history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den |title=Denver Broncos Team Encyclopedia – Pro Football Reference}}</ref>

===1970–82: "Orange Crush"===
In 1972, the Broncos hired former [[Stanford University]] coach [[John Ralston (coach)|John Ralston]] as their head coach. In [[1973 Denver Broncos season|1973]], he was [[UPI]]'s AFC Coach of the Year after Denver achieved its first winning season at 7–5–2. In 5 seasons with the Broncos, Ralston guided the team to winning seasons three times, the franchise's only three winning seasons up to that time. Although Ralston finished the [[1976 Denver Broncos season|1976]] season with a 9–5 record, the team, as was the case in Ralston’s previous winning seasons, still missed the playoffs. Following the season, several prominent players publicly voiced their discontent with Ralston, which soon led to his resignation.<ref name="BroncosSportsE-Cyclopedia">{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/denver/broncos.html |title=Sports E-Cyclopedia – Denver Broncos}}</ref>

[[Red Miller]], a long-time assistant coach was hired and along with the [[Orange Crush Defense]] (a nickname originating in the early '70s, also the brand of [[Orange Crush|a popular orange-flavored soft drink]]) and aging quarterback [[Craig Morton]], took the Broncos to their first playoff appearance in [[1977 Denver Broncos season|1977]], and ultimately first Super Bowl, where they were defeated by the [[1977 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], 27–10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/1977.htm |title=1977 Denver Broncos Statistics – Pro Footall Reference}}</ref>

In 1981 Broncos owner [[Gerald Phipps]], who had purchased the team in May 1961 from the original owner Bob Howsam, sold the team to Canadian Financier, [[Edgar Kaiser|Edgar Kaiser, Jr.]], grandson of shipbuilding industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Paton, James |title=Clock runs out for ex-Broncos owner |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/ex-broncos-owner-denied-chance-buy-back-team |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}</ref>

===1983–99: John Elway era===
Quarterback [[John Elway]], who played college football at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]], arrived in [[1983 Denver Broncos season|1983]]. Originally drafted by the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] as the first pick of the draft, Elway proclaimed that he would shun football in favor of [[baseball]] (he was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] to play [[center field]] and was also a pitching prospect), unless he was traded to a selected list of other teams, which included Denver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/elway/timeline.html |title=John Elway Timeline |work=The Sporting News |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> Prior to Elway, Denver had over 24 different starting quarterbacks in its 23 seasons to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football.com/nfl/denverbroncos/index.html|title=Denver Broncos|work=Football.com|accessdate=2008-11-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/<span class="ctt-uict-lnk"><span class="ctt-uict-lnk">20080605052411</span></span>/http://www.football.com/nfl/denverbroncos/index.html|archivedate=2008-06-05}}</ref>

Elway remained the quarterback through 5 Super Bowls, with the Broncos winning two of them. The Broncos lost [[Super Bowl XXI]] to the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], 39–20; [[Super Bowl XXII]] to the [[1987 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], 42–10; and [[Super Bowl XXIV]] to the [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], 55–10; the latter score remains, to the present day, the most lopsided scoring differential in Super Bowl history. In [[1995 Denver Broncos season|1995]], the Broncos debuted a new head coach, [[Mike Shanahan]], and a new rookie running back, [[Terrell Davis]]. In [[1996 Denver Broncos season|1996]], the Broncos were the top seed in the AFC with a 13–3 record, dominating most of the teams that year. The fifth-seeded [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], however, upset the Broncos 30–27 in the divisional round of the playoffs, ending the Broncos' 1996 run.<ref name="BroncosSportsE-Cyclopedia"/>

During the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|1997]] season, Elway and Davis helped guide the Broncos to their first Super Bowl victory, a 31–24 win over the defending champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Although Elway completed only 13 of 22 passes, throwing one interception and no touchdowns (he did, however, have a rushing touchdown), Davis rushed for 157 yards and a Super Bowl–record 3 touchdowns to earn the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]] – this while overcoming a severe migraine that caused him blurred vision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbxxxii |title=Super Bowl XXXII box score |work=NFL.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}</ref> The Broncos repeated as Super Bowl champions the following season, defeating the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] (led by Elway's longtime head coach [[Dan Reeves]]) in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], 34–19. Elway was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 18 of 29 passes for 421 yards, with an 80-yard touchdown to wide receiver [[Rod Smith (American football)|Rod Smith]] and one interception.

===1999–2012 Post-Elway Era===
[[File:Jaycutler.JPG|thumb|200px|Broncos' quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] in 2007.]]
John Elway retired following the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998]] season, and [[Brian Griese]] started at [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] for the next four seasons. After a 6–10 record in [[1999 Denver Broncos season|1999]], the Broncos recovered in [[2000 Denver Broncos season|2000]], earning a Wild Card playoff berth, but losing to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, former [[Arizona Cardinals]]' quarterback [[Jake Plummer]] replaced Griese in [[2003 Denver Broncos season|2003]], and led the Broncos to two straight 10–6 seasons, earning Wild Card playoff berths both years. However, the Broncos went on the road to face the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in back-to-back seasons and were blown out by more than 20 points in each game, allowing a combined 90 points.<ref name="BroncosSportsE-Cyclopedia"/>

After losing the [[2005 Denver Broncos season|2005]] season opener, the Broncos won five straight games. Plummer and the Broncos clinched their first [[AFC West]] division title since 1998 on December 24, and finished with an 8–0 home record and a 13–3 overall record. The Broncos entered the [[2005–06 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] for the third consecutive year with the momentum of a four-game winning streak. After a first round bye, the Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[New England Patriots]], 27–13, denying New England from becoming the first NFL team ever to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships. The Broncos' playoff run came to an end next week, after losing at home to the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the AFC Championship Game, 34–17. Denver turned the ball over four times and were outscored in the first half, 24–3. The Steelers went on to win [[Super Bowl XL]].

The Broncos' defense began the first five games of the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|2006]] season allowing only one touchdown, an NFL record, but struggled down the season stretch. Plummer led the team to a 7–2 record, only to lose two straight and be replaced by rookie quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]. Cutler went 2–3 as a starter, and the Broncos finished with a 9–7 record, losing the tiebreaker to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] for the final playoff spot. Cutler's first full season as a starter in [[2007 Denver Broncos season|2007]] became the Broncos' first losing season since 1999, with a 7–9 record.

The [[2008 Denver Broncos season|2008]] season ended in a 52–21 loss at the [[San Diego Chargers]], giving the Broncos an 8–8 record and their third straight season out of the playoffs. Shanahan, the longest-tenured and most successful [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]] in Broncos' franchise history, was fired on December 30, 2008, after 14 seasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shanahan, Broncos Part Ways |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Shanahan-Broncos-Part-Ways/d25552b8-7892-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9 |work=Denver Broncos |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>

On January 11, 2009, two weeks after Shanahan was fired, the Broncos hired former [[New England Patriots]]' offensive coordinator [[Josh McDaniels]] as the team's new head coach.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broncos Introduce McDaniels |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-Introduce-McDaniels/d228740c-7892-11df-ba56-acc8e62813e9 |work=Denver Broncos |date=January 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> Three months later, the team acquired [[quarterback]] [[Kyle Orton]] as part of a trade that sent [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] to the [[Chicago Bears]].
[[File:Tebow vs Chiefs 2012.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Tim Tebow]] playing against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in January 2012.]]

Under McDaniels and Orton, the Broncos jumped out to a surprising 6–0 start in [[2009 Denver Broncos season|2009]]. However, the team lost eight of their next ten games, finishing 8–8 for a second consecutive season and missing the playoffs. After the season, Pro Bowl [[wide receiver]] [[Brandon Marshall]] was traded to the [[Miami Dolphins]], and the Broncos set a new franchise record for losses in a single season, with a 4–12 record in [[2010 Denver Broncos season|2010]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Stapleton, Arnie |title=Broncos lose franchise-record 12th game as Chargers win 33–28 |url=http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-chargers-broncos-10211-txt,0,3858640.story |work=Fox 31 Denver |date=January 3, 2011 |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}</ref> On December 6, 2010, McDaniels was fired following a combination of the team's poor record and the fallout from a highly publicized [[Steve Scarnecchia|videotaping scandal]]. Running back coach [[Eric Studesville]] was named interim coach for the remaining four games of the 2010 season.<ref>{{cite web |author=Klis, Mike |title=McDaniels fired as Broncos coach after controversy, losses pile up |url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_16791509 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=December 6, 2010}}</ref> He chose to start rookie first-round draft choice [[Tim Tebow]] at quarterback for the final three games.

After the season, [[Joe Ellis (American football)|Joe Ellis]] was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to team president, while [[John Elway]] was named the team's Executive Vice President of Football Operations on January 5, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=Klis, Mike |title=Broncos officially announce Elway hire, promote Ellis to president |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_17015369 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2011}}</ref> In this capacity, Elway will report to Ellis and will oversee the position held by the General Manager ([[Brian Xanders]]) and head coach positions. On January 13, 2011, the Broncos hired former [[Carolina Panthers]]' coach [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] as the team's 14th head coach.<ref>{{cite news|author=Caldwell, Gray |title=Fox Takes the Reins |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Fox-Takes-the-Reins/b6952341-7bf3-4c0a-9ff7-855588e9c380 |work=Denver Broncos |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref>

After a 1–4 start to the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|2011]] season, it was announced on October 11, 2011, that Tebow would replace Kyle Orton as the Broncos' starting quarterback. In his first start, Tebow would lead the Broncos in a come-from-behind 18–15 overtime victory over the Dolphins, after being down 15–0 with under three minutes to go in the game.<ref>{{cite web |author=Klis, Mike |title=Tim Tebow named Broncos' starting quarterback |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_19087742 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> On November 22, 2011, Kyle Orton was waived and since the quarterback change, the Broncos went 7–4, including four consecutive game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime against [[2011 New York Jets season|the Jets]] in Week 11, the [[2011 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]] in Week 12, the [[2011 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] in Week 13 and the [[2011 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] in Week 14. Despite losing their last three games of the 2011 season, the Broncos clinched their first playoff berth and division title since [[2005 Denver Broncos season|2005]] (the Broncos finished in a three-way tie with the [[2011 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] and Chargers, but won tiebreakers over both teams).<ref>{{cite web |author=Zaas, Stuart |title=How the West was Won |url=http://blog.denverbroncos.com/denverbroncos/how-the-west-was-won |work=Denver Broncos |date=January 5, 2012 |accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref>

In the Wild Card round of the [[2011–12 NFL Playoffs]], the Broncos defeated the [[2011 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in overtime 29–23. After Denver built an early lead, the Steelers managed to tie the game late in the fourth quarter. The Broncos set the NFL overtime record (regular season or playoffs) for the fastest overtime ever, winning in 11 seconds on an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow to Demaryius Thomas, following a 20-yard touchback. This was also the first overtime win under the new rules that allow for sudden death only in touchdown or defensive point scenarios.<ref>{{cite web |author=Legan, Kenny |title=Thomas Shines in Overtime Victory |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Thomas-Shines-in-Overtime-Victory/737bb5a1-3d0f-4ad3-ade6-0ec47236b9b8 |work=Denver Broncos |date=January 8, 2012 |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> This game became known as the [[3:16 Game]] due to the wide range of stats, including 316 passing yards by Tebow, that correlated with the verse [[John 3:16]].

===2012–present: Arrival of Peyton Manning===

On March 20, 2012, the Broncos and [[quarterback]] [[Peyton Manning]] reached an agreement on a 5-year contract worth $96 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7713078/2012-nfl-free-agency-peyton-manning-denver-broncos-agree-96m-deal-source-says |title=Peyton Manning, Broncos OK deal |work=ESPN |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-peyton-manning-question-20120320,0,7718384.story?track=rss |title=How will Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos fare next season? |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref> The following day, the Broncos traded [[Tim Tebow]] and a seventh-round draft selection to the [[New York Jets]] in exchange for fourth- and sixth-round draft selections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7718133/new-york-jets-acquire-tim-tebow-4th-round-pick |title=Jets acquire Tim Tebow for draft pick |work=ESPN |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> Shortly after acquiring Manning, the Broncos also signed tight ends [[Joel Dreessen]] and [[Jacob Tamme]], as well as former [[Cleveland Browns]]' safety [[Mike Adams (safety)|Mike Adams]].

In the [[2012 NFL Draft|2012 draft]], the Broncos selected [[defensive tackle]] [[Derek Wolfe]] and quarterback [[Brock Osweiler]], both in the second round. [[Running back]] [[Ronnie Hillman]] was taken in the third round.

====2012 NFL Season====
{{main|2012 Denver Broncos season}}
After setting records for training camp fan attendance, the Broncos opened their season at home with a 31–19 win over the [[2012 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], with Manning throwing for 253 yards and two touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=<span class="ctt-uict-lnk"><span class="ctt-uict-lnk">320909007 </span></span>|title=Peyton Manning throws 400th career TD, wins in Broncos debut |work=ESPN |date=September 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>

The Broncos started the season 2–3, which included losses to the [[2012 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], [[2012 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]] and [[2012 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. In Week 6 (October 15), the Manning-led Broncos overcame a 24–0 halftime deficit to shock the [[2012 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 35–24, on a nationally televised [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] game. From this win, the Broncos closed out the season with an 11-game winning streak, finishing 13–3. The Broncos not only clinched a second consecutive [[AFC West]] division title, but also earned the [[American Football Conference|AFC]]'s No. 1 seed in the [[2012–13 NFL playoffs]]. However, they would lose to the eventual [[Super Bowl XLVII]] champion [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] in the AFC Divisional Round Game, by a double-overtime score of 38–35.

The loss was Manning's 11th loss in 20 playoff games. This ties him with [[Brett Favre]] for the most losses all time in the postseason.

====2013 NFL Season====
{{main|2013 Denver Broncos season}}
The Broncos made several key off-season moves including signing [[All-Pro]] slot receiver [[Wes Welker]], linebacker [[Shaun Phillips]] and cornerback [[Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie]], as well as drafting defensive tackle [[Sylvester Williams (American football)|Sylvester Williams]] and running back [[Montee Ball]] in the first and second rounds of the [[2013 NFL Draft|NFL draft]], respectively. Key departures for the Broncos include defensive end [[Elvis Dumervil]], linebacker [[D. J. Williams (linebacker)|D. J. Williams]], running back [[Willis McGahee]] and offensive coordinator [[Mike McCoy (American football coach)|Mike McCoy]].

The Broncos had to endure a tumultuous offseason that included the suspensions of front office executives [[Matt Russell]] and [[Tom Heckert, Jr.]] due to separate [[Driving under the influence|drunk-driving]] offenses, several injuries to the offensive line as well as the six-game suspension of All-Pro linebacker [[Von Miller]] due to violations of the NFL's drug policy.

Offensive tackle [[Ryan Clady]] was placed on the season ending injured reserve after suffering an injury to his [[Tarsometatarsal articulations|Lisfranc]]. The injury occurred in the final minutes of the week 2 match-up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]] when a fellow Bronco fell onto the back of his foot as he was walking away from the play.

==Rivalries==

===Divisional===
{{see also|American Football League}}
The Denver Broncos have three [[AFC West]] rivals — the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Oakland Raiders]], and [[San Diego Chargers]]. All teams, along with the Broncos, were charter members of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), with each team placed in the AFL Western division. The Broncos were barely competitive during the AFL years (1960–69), going a combined 10–45–1 against their fellow AFL West rivals.

====Kansas City Chiefs====
{{further|Broncos–Chiefs rivalry}}
The Broncos have had several memorable matchups with the Chiefs, particularly during the years in which [[John Elway]] was the Broncos' starting [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] (1983–98). The Broncos defeated the Chiefs at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in the divisional round of the [[1997–98 NFL playoffs|1997 NFL playoffs]], en route to their first [[Super Bowl XXXII|Super Bowl]] victory. The Chiefs currently hold a '''56–51''' series lead over the Broncos, including the aforementioned 1997 divisional playoff game.

====Oakland Raiders====
{{further|Broncos–Raiders rivalry}}
The rivalry with the Raiders was ignited in {{nfly|1977}}, when the Broncos advanced to their first [[Super Bowl XII|Super Bowl]] by defeating the Raiders in the [[1977–78 NFL playoffs|1977 AFC Championship]]. The rivalry intensified in the mid-1990s, when [[Mike Shanahan]] was hired as the Broncos' [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]] in [[1995 Denver Broncos season|1995]]. Shanahan coached the Raiders in {{nfly|1988}} before being fired four games into the {{nfly|1989}} season. The Raiders currently hold a '''60–46–2''' series lead over the Broncos, including 1–1 in the playoffs.

====San Diego Chargers====
{{Further|Broncos–Chargers rivalry}}
Unlike the Chiefs and Raiders, the Broncos currently have a winning a record against the Chargers, with a '''58–48–1''' series lead, though the two teams have never met in the playoffs. One of the most memorable games between the two teams occurred in the {{nfly|2012}} season, when [[Peyton Manning]] led the Broncos from a 24–0 halftime deficit to a 35–24 comeback win at [[Qualcomm Stadium]] on [[Monday Night Football]].

====Seattle Seahawks====
The Broncos had an old rivalry with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], who were members of the [[AFC West]] from 1977–2001, prior to the Seahawks' move to the [[NFC West]] as part of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s {{nfly|2002}} re-alignment.<ref>{{cite web |author=Banks, Don |title=Seattle moved to NFC in approved realignment plan |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2001/05/22/banks_realign/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=May 22, 2001 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref> During the 25 years that the Seahawks resided in the AFC West, the Broncos went 32–18 against the Seahawks (including a loss at Seattle in the [[1983–84 NFL playoffs|1983 NFL playoffs]]), and have since won two of three interconference meetings with the Seahawks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=den&tm2=sea&yr=all |title=Boxscore finder: Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks — Pro-Football-Reference}}</ref>

===Historical===
Aside from the aforementioned [[AFC West]] teams, the Broncos have had intra-conference rivalries over the years with the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[New England Patriots]].

====Cleveland Browns====
{{see also|The Drive|The Fumble}}
The Broncos had a brief rivalry with the Browns that arose from three [[American Football Conference|AFC]] championship matches from 1986–89. In the [[1986–87 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 23, Cleveland Browns 20 (OT)|1986 AFC Championship]], [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] [[John Elway]] led ''[[The Drive]]'' to secure a tie in the waning moments at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]; the Broncos went on to win in 23–20 in overtime.<ref>{{cite web |author=Carter, Bob |title=Elway led Broncos on "The Drive" |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_elway_john.html |work=ESPN |date=July 5, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> One year later, the two teams met again in the [[1987–88 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 38, Cleveland Browns 33|1987 AFC Championship]] at [[Mile High Stadium]]. Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns' quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Sammy Winder]] to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety [[Jeremiah Castille]] stripped Browns' running back [[Earnest Byner]] of the football at the 2-yard line — a play that has been called ''[[The Fumble]]'' by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33.<ref>{{cite web |author=Reilly, Rick |title=Byner's fumble spoils Browns shot at 1987 AFC Championship glory |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/painful_moments_in_sports/09/09/Earnest.Byner.Browns/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |date=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref> The two teams met yet again in the [[1989–90 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 37, Cleveland Browns 21|1989 AFC Championship]] at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21.<ref>{{cite web |author=Heisler, Mark |title=This Time, Just Call It Elway : AFC championship: Bronco quarterback is at his best in 37–21 victory over Browns as Denver earns its third trip to the Super Bowl in four seasons. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-15/sports/sp-257_1_super-bowl-xxiv |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 1990 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}</ref>

====Pittsburgh Steelers====
{{see also|3:16 Game}}
As of the {{nfly|2011}} season, the Broncos have met the Steelers in postseason play seven times, the most of any [[National Football League|NFL]] team.

==Logos and uniforms==
[[File:Broncos 1968-96 uniforms.png|thumb|left|150px|Denver Broncos uniform set from 1968–96. The team briefly wore orange pants with the away jerseys between 1969–1971 and 1978–1979.]]

[[Image:Denver Broncos alternate logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|Broncos alternate logo (1997–present).]]
When the Broncos debuted in {{nfly|1960}}, their original uniforms drew as much attention as their play on the field. It featured white and mustard yellow jerseys, with contrasting brown helmets, brown pants, and vertically striped socks.<ref>http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1434/<span class="ctt-uict-lnk"><span class="ctt-uict-lnk">660608396</span></span>_8eb6da94e0.jpg</ref> Two years later, the team unveiled a new logo featuring a bucking horse, and changed their team colors to orange, royal blue and white. The {{nfly|1962}} uniform, designed by Laura North-Allen, consisted of white pants, orange helmets, and either orange or white jerseys.
In {{nfly|1968}}, the Broncos debuted a design that became known as the "Orange Crush". Their logo was redesigned so that the horse was coming out of a "D." Additionally, the helmets were changed to royal blue, with thin stripes placed onto the sleeves, and other minor modifications were added. From 1969–1971, and again from 1978–79, the team wore orange pants with their white jerseys.<ref name="Endzone">{{cite web |url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/white-at-home-in-the-nfl/ |title=White at Home in the NFL – Uni Watch}}</ref>

The Broncos wore their white jerseys at home throughout the [[1971 NFL season|1971]] season, as well as for {{nfly|1980}} home games vs. the [[San Diego Chargers]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]], the latter in hopes to bring out the "blue jersey jinx" which has followed the Cowboys for decades (it worked, Denver won 41–20). Denver wore its white jerseys for {{nfly|1983}} home games vs. the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]], but would not wear white at home again for two decades ''(see below)''.<ref name="Endzone"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://endzonesportscharities.org/gunews.htm |title=Endzone's Denver Broncos Game-Used News & Price Guide Page}}</ref>

In {{nfly|1994}}, in honor of the 75th anniversary season of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the Broncos wore their {{nfly|1965}} [[throwback uniforms]] for two games — a Week 3 home game against the Raiders, as well a road game at the [[Buffalo Bills]] the following week.<ref name="Endzone"/>

The team radically changed their logo and uniforms in {{nfly|1997}}, a design that the team continues to use to this day. The new logo and uniform were unveiled on February 4, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/broncos/news/0204newuni.html|title=Broncos unveil new uniform and logo|date=4 February 1997|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=26 October 2013|archivedate=19 April 1997|location=Englewood, Colorado|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970419112211/http://www.nfl.com/broncos/news/0204newuni.html}}</ref> Navy blue replaced royal blue on the team's color scheme. The current logo is a profile of a charging horse's head, with an orange mane and navy blue outlines. They began wearing navy blue jerseys, replacing their longtime orange jerseys that had been the team's predominant home jersey color since 1962. This new uniform design features a new word mark, numbering font and a streak that runs up and down the sides of both the jerseys and the pants. On the navy blue jerseys, the streak is orange, with an orange collar and white numerals trimmed in orange, while on the road white jerseys, the streak is navy blue, with a thin orange accent strip on both sides, a navy collar and navy numerals trimmed in orange. When they debuted, these uniforms were, once again, vilified by the press and fans, until the Broncos won their first ever [[Super Bowl XXXII|Super Bowl]] in the new design that same season. The navy blue jerseys served as the team's primary home jersey until the end of the {{nfly|2011}} season ''(see below)''.<ref name="2012UniformChange">{{cite web |author=Legan, Kenny |title=Orange Crush |url=http://blog.denverbroncos.com/denverbroncos/orange-crush |work=Denver Broncos |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

In {{nfly|2002}}, the Broncos introduced an alternate orange jersey that is a mirror image of the aforementioned navy blue jerseys, but with orange and navy trading places. Like the road white jerseys, the white pants with the navy blue streaks running down the sides are worn with this uniform. This jersey was used only once in the 2002 and {{nfly|2004}} seasons, and were used twice per season from 2008–2011. Former [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]] [[Mike Shanahan]] was not a big fan of the alternate orange jerseys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Broncos' RBs turn in uneven performances |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_15671807 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref> The Broncos previously wore orange jerseys as a throwback uniform in a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] game at the Dallas Cowboys in {{nfly|2001}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://endzonesportscharities.org/history |title=ESC’s Denver Broncos Uniform History}}</ref>

The team also introduced navy blue pants in {{nfly|2003}}, with orange streaks to be worn with the navy blue jerseys. Though they were part of the uniform change in 1997 (in fact they were worn for a couple 1997 preseason games) and most players wanted to wear them, the only player who vetoed wearing them was [[John Elway]], thereby delaying their eventual introduction.<ref name="2003Uniforms">{{cite web |url=http://endzonesportscharities.org/PDFs/Uni_2003.pdf |title=End Zone Sports Charities}}</ref> Since 2003, these pants have primarily been used for select prime time and late-season home games, excluding the {{nfly|2008}} season.

[[File:Denver Broncos wordmark (c. 1997).png|thumb|right|300px|Broncos script logo (1997–present).]]
On November 16, 2003, the Broncos wore their white jerseys at home for the first time since 1983, in a game vs. the San Diego Chargers. This was compensation for a uniform mix-up, after the teams' first meeting at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]]'s [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in Week 2 earlier that season, when the Chargers were the team that was supposed to declare their uniform color. The Chargers were planning to wear their white jerseys, but the visiting Broncos came to the stadium in white, and were fined [[Dollar sign|$]]25,000 by the NFL as a result. When the two teams met at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|INVESCO Field at Mile High]] later that season (Week 11), the NFL allowed the visiting Chargers to choose their uniform color in advance, and they chose navy blue, forcing the Broncos to wear their white jerseys at home.<ref name="2003Uniforms"/>

In {{nfly|2009}}, in honor of their 50th anniversary season as one of the eight original [[American Football League]] teams, the Broncos wore their 1960 throwback uniforms (brown helmets, mustard yellow and brown jerseys) for games against two fellow AFL rivals — a Week 5 home game vs. the [[New England Patriots]], as well as the following week at the San Diego Chargers.<ref name="legacy">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81029dc6/article/nfl-announces-2009-afl-legacy-games |title=NFL announces 2009 AFL 'Legacy Games' |work=NFL.com |date=July 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2009}}</ref><ref name="post">{{cite web |author=Klis, Mike |url=http://www.denverpost.com/premium/broncos/ci_13530153 |title=Even if they win, the Broncos figure to look bad in their throwback uniforms Sunday |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref>

Beginning in {{nfly|2012}}, the orange jerseys that served as the alternate colored jerseys from 2002–2011 became the primary home jersey, while the navy blue jerseys that served as the primary home jersey from 1997–2011 switched to alternate designation. The change was made due to overwhelming popularity with the fans, who pressured the Broncos to return to orange as the team's primary home jersey color.<ref name="2012UniformChange"/> The navy blue jerseys (with the navy blue pants) were most recently used in an October 6, 2013 road game vs. the Dallas Cowboys.<ref>{{cite web |author=Klis, Mike |title=Broncos, Peyton Manning win Texas-sized shootout vs. Cowboys at Dallas |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_24253137/broncos-peyton-manning-win-shootout-dallas-cowboys |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 6, 2013 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref>

==Home field==
[[File:Invesco Field at Mile High.jpg|thumb|[[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]], when it was known as INVESCO Field at Mile High]]
For most of their history, the Denver Broncos played in [[Mile High Stadium]]. The AFL Broncos played at the [[University of Denver]]'s [[DU Stadium|Hilltop Stadium]] from time to time, including the first-ever victory of an [[American Football League|AFL]] team over an [[NFL]] team: The Broncos beat the [[Detroit Lions]] on August 5, 1967, in a preseason game. The team has sold out every home game (including post-season games) since the NFL merger in 1970, with the exception of two replacement games during the 1987 strike (but both were sold out before the strike).

During home games, the attendance is announced to the crowd, along with the number of no-shows (the fans subsequently boo the no-shows). The fans are also known to chant "IN-COM-PLETE" every time the visiting team throws an [[Forward pass|incomplete pass]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/footer/faq.html |title=FAQ |work=Denver Broncos}}</ref> The stadium's legendary home-field advantage is regarded as one of the best in the NFL, especially during the playoffs. The Broncos had the best home record in pro football over a 32-year span from 1974–2006 (191–65–1). Mile High Stadium was one of the NFL's loudest stadiums, with steel flooring instead of [[concrete]], which may have given the Broncos an advantage over opponents. In {{nfly|2001}}, the team moved into [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|INVESCO Field at Mile High]], built next to the former site of the since-demolished Mile High Stadium. Sportswriter [[Woody Paige]], along with many of Denver's fans, however, often refuse to call the new stadium by its full name, preferring to use "Mile High Stadium" because of its storied history and sentimental import. Additionally, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' had an official policy of referring to the stadium as simply "Mile High Stadium" in protest, but dropped this policy in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/guide/guide-to-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high/ |title=Guide To Sports Authority Field At Mile High |work=CBS Denver |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref>

On August 16, 2011, [[Colorado]]-based sporting goods retailer [[Sports Authority]] claimed the naming rights of Invesco Field, which became known as '''Sports Authority Field at Mile High'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Broncos stadium renamed Sports Authority Field at Mile High |url=http://www.denverpost.com/sports/ci_18693613 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref>

The Colorado altitude has also been attributed as part of the team's home success. The stadium displays multiple references to the stadium's location of {{convert|5280|ft|mi}} above sea level, including a prominent mural just outside the visiting team's locker room. The team training facility, Paul D. Bowlen Memorial Broncos Centre, is a state-of-the-art facility located in [[Dove Valley, Colorado]]. With 13.5 acres of property, the facility hosts three full-size fields, a complete weight and training facility, and a cafeteria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/team/training-facility.html |title=Training Facility |work=Denver Broncos}}</ref>

In their more than half-century of existence, the Broncos have never been shut out at home, a streak of nearly 400 games as of the 2012 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/ |title=Denver Broncos Franchise Encyclopedia – Pro Football Reference |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}</ref>

In late 2012, the Broncos announced that the stadium will receive $30 million upgrades including a new video board in the south end zone that is planned to be three times larger than the previous display. The renovations are expected to be finished before kickoff of the 2013 season.<ref>{{cite web |author=Caldwell, Gray |title=Broncos Announce Stadium Upgrades |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/Broncos-Announce-Stadium-Upgrades/96b5e3c9-991c-4e23-9a5c-438472ae6594 |work=Denver Broncos |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref>

The Broncos' flagship radio station is currently [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], 850AM, a 50,000-watt station owned by [[Clear Channel Communications]]. [[Dave Logan (American football)|Dave Logan]] is the play-by-play announcer, with former Broncos' wide receiver [[Ed McCaffrey]] serving as the color commentator beginning in 2012, replacing [[Brian Griese]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Jones, Lindsay |title=Ed McCaffrey joins KOA Broncos broadcast team |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2012/07/31/ed-mccaffrey-joins-koa-broncos-broadcast-team/14562 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref> Until 2010, preseason games not selected for airing on national television were shown on [[KCNC-TV|KCNC]], channel 4, which is a [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]], as well as other CBS affiliates around the [[Rocky Mountain]] region. On May 26, 2011, the Broncos announced that [[KUSA-TV|KUSA]] channel 9, an [[NBC]] affiliate also known as '''9NEWS''' in the [[Rocky Mountain]] region, will be the team's new television partner for preseason games.<ref name="BroadcastPartners">{{cite web |title=Broadcast Partners |url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/multimedia/broadcast-partners.html |work=Denver Broncos}}</ref>

In 2011, the Broncos began a partnership with [[KJMN]], 92.1 FM, a leading [[Spanish language]] radio station owned by [[Entravision|Entravision Communications]] (EVC). The partnership also includes broadcasting rights for a half-hour weekly TV show on [[KCEC (TV)|KCEC]], the local [[Univision]] affiliate operated by [[Entravision|Entravision Communications]].<ref name="BroadcastPartners"/>

==Notable fans and in the media==

* Tim McKernan, a.k.a. [[Barrel Man (Denver Broncos)|Barrel Man]], began wearing a barrel in 1977 after making a $10 bet with his brother, Scott, that by wearing one he could get on television. McKernan won the bet, and the barrel he had painted to look like an [[Orange Crush]] soda can became his signature costume, and resulted in him becoming one of the Broncos' most recognized fans and a popular mascot. McKernan died on December 5, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |author=Espinoza, Annette |title=Tim McKernan, "Barrel Man" to Broncos fans, dies at 69 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_13934615 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=December 5, 2009 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}</ref>

* The animated television show [[South Park]], set in [[Park County, Colorado]], often mentions the Denver Broncos; show creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] both grew up in Colorado as devout Broncos fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballbabble.com/football/fans/celebrity |title=Celebrity Football Fans – Celebrity NFL Fans – Football Celebrities}}</ref>

* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[You Only Move Twice]]", Hank Scorpio gives Homer Simpson the Denver Broncos as a thank-you gift for helping him.  Homer complains that he wanted to own the [[Dallas Cowboys]] (the Broncos are playing very sloppy football on his front lawn while he says this).  Incidentally, the Broncos were 13–3 that year, and won the Super Bowl the next 2 seasons.  In another episode, Homer picks the Broncos to win the Super Bowl (the second of which aired on Fox, home of ''The Simpsons'').

* Many former Broncos are now in broadcasting, including [[Shannon Sharpe]], [[Mark Schlereth]], [[Alfred Williams]], [[Tom Jackson (American football)|Tom Jackson]] and [[Terrell Davis]].
