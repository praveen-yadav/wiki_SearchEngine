'''Bundaberg Rum''' is a dark rum produced in [[Bundaberg]], Australia. It is often referred to as "Bundy".
The Bundaberg Distilling Company owns its own [[cola]]-producing facility, which supplies the cola for its [[Alcopop|ready-to-drink]] Bundaberg Rum and Cola products.

==History==

Bundaberg Rum originated because the local sugar mills had a problem with what to do with the waste [[molasses]] after the sugar was extracted (it was heavy, difficult to transport and the costs of converting it to stock feed were rarely worth the effort). Sugar men first began to think of the profits that could be made from distilling. The vital meeting was held at the Royal Hotel on 1 August 1885, W M C Hickson served as the chairman, and other notables in attendance included all the big sugar mill owners of that time, W G Farquhar, F L Nott, S McDougall, T Penny, S H Bravo and A H Young, all to become the first directors of the Company. They started with a capital of 5,000 pounds.<ref>Information from 'Bundy A Centenary History' by Keith Dunstan.</ref>

The Bundaberg Distilling Company began its operations in 1888.

Bundaberg rum was first produced in 1889, production ceased from 1907 to 1914 and from 1936 to 1939 after fires, the second of which caused rum from the factory to spill into the nearby [[Burnett River]].<ref>Julia Robinson. Voices of Queensland: words from the sunshine state. Oxford University Press, 2001.</ref>

H T Christsen Pty Ltd operated their own Bundaberg Rum bottling plant in Bourbong Street, Bundaberg at the rear of their large grocery and hardware business in the centre of town. The spirit was sold at UP and OP strength from their business. Spokesperson for the original family, Mr Rod Patch, recalls the origins of the shape of the current "Bundy Bottle". It originated from the Bushells Coffee Chicory bottle that Bundaberg folks sold to his grandfather at the firm for one penny a bottle, after which they were washed and filled with the famous spirit. The shape remains the same but the capacity has been increased to the current 700ml. Patch's great grandfather, Hans Truval Christsen, a  Danish immigrant from Copenhagen and his son Frederick Christsen had an employment policy of employing staff from the Salvation Army faith in the rum bottling process as they were less likely to be tempted to sample the spirit. The Christsen family supported settlement farming families through hard times and these good deeds were acknowledged with the naming of Christsen Park at Bargara Beach.

In 1961, the company introduced the [[polar bear]] as its unusual choice of mascot, to imply that the rum could ward off the coldest chill.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bundabergrum.com.au/flash/home.htm |title=Bundaberg Rum website – history section |accessdate=26 March 2008 |work=Bundaberg Rum website}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

==Advertising==

Bundaberg Rum has also been criticised for targeting its advertising towards young people and boys, through television commercials during [[National Rugby League|NRL]] broadcasts, and other promotions.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090331110022/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s720116.htm ABC Radio National, 3 Nov 2002 Program: Background briefing] Archived on 31 March 2009</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060820084415/http://www.caan.adf.org.au/newsletter.asp?ContentId=t20060612 Community Alcohol Action Network (CAAN) 'Grogwatch'] Archived on 20 August 2006</ref> The Bundaberg Rum Bear advertisements first appeared in 1994. They were designed to soften rum's aggressive image (below) and broaden its appeal from the traditional older male drinker to a more sociable audience.<ref>Greg Alder, Creative Director, Leo Burnett Connaghan & May, Bundaberg Rum advertising agency</ref> They have been cited as one of the favourite ads among Australia's youth.<ref>[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/archive/young-adults-are-a-paradox-for-marketers B&T Magazine, 20 December 2004 Story: "Young adults are a paradox for marketers"]</ref>

==Associations with aggressive drinkers==
Bundaberg Rum has been labelled the drink for [[yobbo]]s,<ref name = "yobs">[http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Bundy-drinkers-not-yobs/2005/03/07/1110160748101.html Bundy drinkers 'not yobs'] – [[The Age]], 7 March 2005</ref> after some bars reported that ''"bundy drinkers are a lot louder, and more disruptive than other patrons."'' In 2005, four bars in [[Brisbane]] banned the rum products, claiming it makes drinkers aggressive and attracts the wrong crowd.<ref name = "yobs"/> ''"They will abuse bar staff, half a dozen a night, normally [[gang]]s of [[bloke (word)|bloke]]s, the marketing is directed at [[yobbo]]s,"'' one bar owner told ''The Age'' newspaper.<ref name = "yobs"/> The Bundaberg Rum Distillery admitted it was aware its brand had a reputation of being associated with aggression, and said it may change its advertising to dispel its "yobbo" image.<ref name = "bundy_fights">[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/archive/bundy-fights-yobbo-claims Bundy fights yobbo claims] - B&T Magazine, 15 March 2005</ref>
