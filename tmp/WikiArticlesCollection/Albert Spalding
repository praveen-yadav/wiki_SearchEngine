'''Albert Goodwill Spalding''' (September 2, 1850 – September 9, 1915) was an American [[pitcher]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]] and executive in the early years of professional [[baseball]], and the co-founder of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|A.G. Spalding]] sporting goods company.

==Baseball career==
===Player===
Having played baseball throughout his youth, Spalding first played competitively with the [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] Pioneers, a youth team, which he joined in 1865. After pitching his team to a 26–2 victory over a local men's amateur team (the Mercantiles), he was approached at the age of 15 by another, the Forest Citys, for whom he played for two years.<ref name="Starr">{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Raymond|date=Winter 1986|title=Book review: A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=32|issue=1|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/86winter/spalding.htm}}</ref> In the autumn of 1867 he accepted a $40 per week contract, nominally as a clerk, but really to play professionally for the [[Chicago]] Excelsiors, not an uncommon arrangement used to circumvent the rules of the time, which forbade the hiring of professional players. Following the formation of baseball's first professional organization, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (which became known as the National Association, the Association, or NA) in 1871, Spalding joined the [[History of the Boston Braves#Boston years|Boston Red Stockings]] (precursor club to the modern [[Atlanta Braves]]) and was highly successful; [[win (baseball)|winning]] 206 games (and losing only 53) as a pitcher and [[batting average|batting]] .323 as a hitter. 

[[William Hulbert]], principal owner of the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago White Stockings]], did not like the loose organization of the National Association and the gambling element that influenced it, so he decided to create a new organization, which he dubbed the [[National League]] of Baseball Clubs. To aid him in this venture, Hulbert enlisted the help of Spalding. Playing to the pitcher's desire to return to his Midwestern roots and challenging Spalding's integrity, Hulbert convinced Spalding to sign a contract to play for the White Stockings (now known as the [[Chicago Cubs]]) in 1876. Spalding then coaxed teammates [[Deacon White]], [[Ross Barnes]] and [[Cal McVey]], as well as [[Philadelphia Athletics]] players [[Cap Anson]] and [[Bob Addy]], to sign with Chicago. This was all done under complete secrecy during the playing season because players were all free agents in those days and they did not want their current club and especially the fans to know they were leaving to play elsewhere the next year. News of the signings by the Boston and Philadelphia players leaked to the press before the season ended, and all of them suffered verbal abuse and physical threats from the kranks, as baseball fans were called at the time, in Beantown and the City of Brotherly Love.

He was "the premier pitcher of the 1870s", leading the league in victories for each of his six full seasons as a professional.<ref name = "fame" /> During each of those years he was his team's only pitcher.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/spalding_hi.html|title=Albert G. Spalding|work=Who Made America?|publisher=PBS|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> In 1876, Spalding won 47 games as the prime pitcher for the Chicago White Stockings and led them to win the first-ever National League pennant by a wide margin.<ref name = "fame" />

In 1877, Spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand. People had used gloves previously, but never had a star like Spalding used one. Of course, Spalding had an ulterior motive for doing so: he now owned a sporting goods store which sold baseball gloves, and wearing one himself was good for business.

Spalding retired from playing baseball in 1878 at the age of 27, although he continued as a major force as president and part owner of the White Stockings and a major influence on the National League. Spalding's .796 career winning percentage (from an era when teams played about once or twice a week) is the highest ever achieved by a baseball pitcher.

===Organizer and executive===
In the months after signing for Chicago, Hulbert and Spalding organized the National League by enlisting the four major teams in the East and the three other top teams in what was then considered to be the West. Joining Chicago initially were the leading teams from [[Cincinnati]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The owners of these western clubs accompanied Hulbert and Spalding to New York where they secretly met with owners from New York, Philadelphia, Hartford, and Boston. Each signed the league's constitution, and the National League was officially born. "Spalding was thus involved in the transformation of baseball from a game of gentlemen athletes into a business and a professional sport."<ref name = "Starr" /> Although the National Association held on for a few more seasons, it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball. Gradually, it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country.

In 1905, after [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the British sports of [[cricket]] and [[rounders]], Spalding called for a [[Abraham G. Mills#The Mills Commission|commission]] to find out the real source of baseball. The commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters. After three years of searching, on December 30, 1907, Spalding received a letter that (erroneously) declared baseball to be the invention of [[Abner Doubleday]]. The commission, though, was biased, as Spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the English sport of rounders. Just before the commission, in a letter to sportswriter [[Tim Murnane]], Spalding noted, "Our good old American game of baseball must have an American Dad." The project, later called the Mills Commission, concluded that "Base Ball had its origins in the United States" and "the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence available to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown, N.Y.]], in 1839."

Receiving the archives of Henry Chadwick in 1908, Spalding combined these records with his own memories (and biases) to write "[[America's National Game]]" (published 1911) which, despite its flaws, was probably the first scholarly account of the [[history of baseball]].<ref name = "PBS" />

===Businessman===
In 1874 while Spalding was playing and organizing the league, Spalding and his brother Walter began a sporting goods store in Chicago, which grew rapidly (14 stores by 1901) and expanded into a manufacturer and distributor of all kinds of sporting equipment. The company became "synonymous with sporting goods"<ref name = "Starr" /> and is still a going concern.

Spalding published the first official rules guide for baseball. In it he stated that only Spalding balls could be used (previously, the quality of the balls used had been subpar). Spalding also founded the "Baseball Guide," which at the time was the most widely read baseball publication.

In 1888–1889, Spalding took a group of major league players around the world to promote baseball and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding sporting goods]]. This was the first-ever world baseball tour.<ref name = "fame" /> Playing across the western U.S., the tour made stops in Hawaii (although no game was played), New Zealand, Australia, [[Ceylon]], Egypt, Italy, France, and England. The tour returned to grand receptions in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. The tour included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs Cap Anson and [[John Montgomery Ward]]. While the players were on the tour, the National League instituted new rules regarding player pay that led to a revolt of players, led by Ward, who started the [[Players League]] the following season (1890). The league lasted one year, partially due to the anti-competitive tactics of Spalding to limit its success.

In 1900 Spalding was appointed by [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] as the USA's Commissioner at that year's [[1900 Olympic Games|Summer Olympic Games]].<ref name = "PBS" /> 

==Other activities==
In 1900, Spalding moved to [[San Diego]] with his newly-acquired second wife<ref name = "Starr" /> and became a prominent member and supporter of the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|Theosophical]] community [[Lomaland]], which was being developed on [[Point Loma, California|Point Loma]] by [[Katherine Tingley]]. He built an estate in the [[Sunset Cliffs, San Diego|Sunset Cliffs]] area of Point Loma where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1907-1909 he was the driving force behind the development of a paved road, known as the "Point Loma boulevard", from downtown San Diego to Point Loma and [[Ocean Beach, San Diego|Ocean Beach]]; the road also provided good access to Lomaland. It later provided the basis for [[California State Route 209]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Street Work Pay is Puzzle | work=The San Diego Union and Daily Bee | date=April 23, 1909 | author=Staff | page=8}}</ref> He proposed the project, supervised it on behalf of the city, and paid a portion of the cost out of his own pocket. He joined with [[George Marston]] and other civic-minded businessmen to purchase the site of the original [[Presidio of San Diego]], which they developed as a historic park and eventually donated to the city of San Diego.<ref name="Marston">{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Michael J.|date=Summer-Fall 2004|title=George White Marston: Baseball Player|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=50|issue=3-4|page=93|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v50-3/baseball.pdf}}</ref> He ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States Senate]] in 1910.<ref name = "Marston" /> He helped to organize the 1915 [[Panama-California Exposition]], serving as second vice-president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/pancal/sdexpo30.htm|title=Panama-California Exposition, San Diego, 1915-1916|work=San Diego History Center|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>
