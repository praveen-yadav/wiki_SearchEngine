[[Image:binary tree.svg|right|192px|thumb|A simple binary tree of size 9 and height 3, with a root node whose value is 2. The above tree is unbalanced and not sorted.]]
In [[computer science]], a '''binary tree''' is a [[tree (data structure)|tree]] in which each node has at most two [[child node]]s (denoted as the ''left'' child and the ''right'' child).  Nodes with children are referred to as [[parent node]]s, and child nodes may contain references to their parents. Following this convention, you can define '''ancestral''' relationships in a tree: that is, for example, one node can be an '''ancestor''' of another node, a '''descendant''', or a great-grand-child of another node. The '''root''' node is the ancestor to all nodes of the tree, and any node in the tree can be reached from the root node. A tree which does not have any node other than root node is called a '''null tree'''. In a binary tree, the degree of every node can be at most two. A tree with ''n'' nodes has exactly ''n''&minus;1 branches or degree.

Binary trees are  used to implement [[binary search tree]]s and [[binary heap]]s, and is applied for efficient searching and [[Sorting_algorithm|sorting]]. A binary tree is a special case of a [[K-ary tree]] (that is, ''k=2'').

==Definitions for rooted trees==
* A '''directed edge''' refers to the link from the [[parent node|parent]] to the [[child node|child]] (the arrows in the picture of the tree).
* The [[root node]] of a tree is the [[node (computer science)|node]] with no parents.  There is at most one root node in a rooted tree.
* A [[leaf node]] has no children.
* The '''depth''' (or ''height'') of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a depth of zero.
* '''Siblings''' are those nodes that share the same parent node.
* A node ''p'' is an '''ancestor''' of a node ''q'' if ''p'' exists on the path from the root node to node ''q''. The node ''q'' is then termed as a '''descendant''' of ''p''.
* The '''size''' of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself.
* The '''in-degree''' of a node is the number of edges arriving at that node.
* The '''out-degree''' of a node is the number of edges leaving that node.
* The root is the only node in a tree with an in-degree of 0.
* All the leaf nodes have an out-degree of 0.

==Types of binary trees==
[[File:BinaryTreeRotations.svg|thumb|300px|[[Tree rotation]]s are very common internal operations on [[Self-balancing binary search tree|self-balancing binary trees]].]]
* A '''rooted binary tree''' is a [[tree data structure|tree]] with a [[root node]] in which every node has at most two children.
* A '''full binary tree''' (sometimes '''proper binary tree''' or '''2-tree''' or '''strictly binary tree''') is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.  Or, perhaps more clearly, every node in a binary tree has exactly (strictly) 0 or 2 children.  Sometimes a full tree is ambiguously defined as a ''perfect tree'' (see next). Physicists define a ''binary tree'' to mean a ''full binary tree''.<ref>''Unitary Symmetry'', James D. Louck, World Scientific Pub., 2008</ref> [[File:Waldburg Ahnentafel.jpg|thumb|An [[ancestry chart]] which maps to a perfect depth 4 binary tree]]. 
* A '''{{visible anchor|perfect binary tree}}''' is a ''full binary tree'' in which all ''leaves'' are at the same ''depth'' or same ''level'', and in which every parent has two children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/perfectBinaryTree.html|title=perfect binary tree | publisher = [[NIST]]}}</ref> (This is ambiguously also called a ''complete binary tree'' (see next).) An example of a perfect binary tree is the [[ancestry chart]] of a person to a given depth, as each person has exactly two biological parents (one mother and one father); note that this reverses the usual parent/child tree convention, and these trees go in the opposite direction from usual (root at bottom).
* A '''{{visible anchor|complete binary tree}}''' is a binary tree in which every level, ''except possibly the last'', is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/completeBinaryTree.html|title=complete binary tree| publisher = NIST}}</ref> A tree is called an almost complete binary tree or nearly complete binary tree if the exception holds, i.e. the last level is not completely filled. This type of tree is used as a specialized data structure called a [[Heap_(data_structure)|heap]]. <!--http://www.math.uic.edu/~leon/cs-mcs401-s08/handouts/nearly_complete.pdf-->
<!--"doubt please give correct perfect definition and example for full complete binary tree and also for depth ? and depth--> 
* An '''infinite complete binary tree''' is a tree with a [[countably infinite]] number of levels, in which every node has two children, so that there are  2<sup>''d''</sup> nodes at level ''d''. The set of all nodes is countably infinite, but the set of all infinite paths from the root is uncountable: it has the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. These paths correspond by an order preserving bijection to the points of the [[Cantor set]], or (through the example of the [[Stern–Brocot tree]]) to the set of positive [[irrational number]]s.
* A '''balanced binary tree'''  is commonly defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by 1 or less,<ref>Aaron M. Tenenbaum, et. al  Data Structures Using C, Prentice Hall, 1990  ISBN 0-13-199746-7</ref> although in general it is a binary tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf.   (Different balancing schemes allow different definitions of "much farther".<ref>Paul E. Black (ed.), entry for ''data structure'' in ''[[Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures]]. U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. 15 December 2004. [http://xw2k.nist.gov/dads//HTML/balancedtree.html Online version] Accessed 2010-12-19.</ref>)  Binary trees that are balanced according to this definition have a predictable depth (how many nodes are traversed from the root to a leaf, root counting as node 0 and subsequent as 1, 2, ..., depth). This depth is equal to the integer part of <math>\log_2(n)</math> where <math>n</math> is the number of nodes on the balanced tree.  Example 1: balanced tree with 1 node, <math>\log_2(1) = 0</math> (depth = 0).  Example 2: balanced tree with 3 nodes, <math>\log_2(3)=1.59</math> (depth=1).  Example 3: balanced tree with 5 nodes, <math>\log_2(5)=2.32</math> (depth of tree is 2 nodes).
* A '''degenerate tree''' is a tree where for each parent node, there is only one associated child node. This means that in a performance measurement, the tree will behave like a [[linked list]] data structure.

Note that this terminology often varies in the literature, especially with respect to the meaning of "complete" and "full".

==Properties of binary trees==
* The number of nodes ''n'' in a '''perfect binary tree''' can be found using this formula: ''n'' = 2<sup>''h''+1</sup>-1 where ''h'' is the depth of the tree.
* The number of nodes ''n'' in a binary tree of height ''h'' is at least ''n'' = ''h'' + 1 and at most ''n'' = 2<sup>''h''+1</sup>-1 where ''h'' is the depth of the tree.
* The number of leaf nodes ''l'' in a '''perfect binary tree''' can be found using this formula: ''l'' = 2<sup>''h''</sup> where ''h'' is the depth of the tree.
* The number of nodes ''n'' in a '''perfect binary tree''' can also be found using this formula: ''n'' = 2''l''-1 where ''l'' is the number of leaf nodes in the tree.
* The number of null links (i.e., absent children of nodes) in a '''complete binary tree''' of ''n'' nodes is (''n''+1).
* The number of internal nodes (i.e., non-leaf nodes or ''n''-''l'') in a '''complete binary tree''' of ''n'' nodes is &lfloor; ''n''/2 &rfloor;.
* For any non-empty binary tree with ''n''<sub>0</sub> leaf nodes and ''n''<sub>2</sub> nodes of degree 2, ''n''<sub>0</sub> = ''n''<sub>2</sub> + 1.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mehta | first=Dinesh | coauthors = [[Sartaj Sahni]]| title=Handbook of Data Structures and Applications|publisher=[[Chapman and Hall]]|isbn = 1-58488-435-5|year=2004 }}</ref>

== Common operations ==
There are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are [[mutator method|mutator]] operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree.

=== Insertion ===
Nodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after an [[external node]]. In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is.

==== External nodes ====
Say that the external node being added onto is node A. To add a new node after node A, A assigns the new node as one of its children and the new node assigns node A as its parent.

==== Internal nodes ====
[[File:Insertion of binary tree node.svg|thumb|360px|The process of inserting a node into a binary tree]] 
Insertion on [[internal node]]s is slightly more complex than on external nodes. Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. (If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node.

=== Deletion ===
Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree. Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.<ref name="rice">{{cite web |url=http://www.clear.rice.edu/comp212/03-spring/lectures/22/|title=Binary Tree Structure|author=Dung X. Nguyen|year=2003|work= |publisher=rice.edu|accessdate=December 28, 2010}} 
</ref>

==== Node with zero or one children ====
[[File:Deletion of internal binary tree node.svg|thumb|360px|The process of deleting an internal node in a binary tree]] 
Say that the node to delete is node A. If a node has no children ([[external node]]), deletion is accomplished by setting the child of A's parent to [[null pointer|null]]. If it has one child, set the parent of A's child to A's parent and set the child of A's parent to A's child.

==== Node with two children ====
In a binary tree, a node with two children cannot be deleted unambiguously.<ref name="rice"/> However, in certain binary trees (including [[binary search tree]]s) these nodes ''can'' be deleted.

==== Traversal ====
{{Main|Tree traversal}}

Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root.

==== Depth-first order ====
In depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root node that we can, but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited. Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles. Pre-order is a special case of this. See [[depth-first search]] for more information.

==== Breadth-first order ====
Contrasting with depth-first order is breadth-first order, which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited. See [[breadth-first search]] for more information. Also called a ''level-order traversal''.

In a complete binary tree, a node's breadth-index (''i - (2<sup>d</sup> - 1)'') can be used as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit ''d - 1'', where ''d'' is the node's distance from the root (''d = floor(log2(i+1))'') and the node in question is not the root itself (''d > 0''). When the breadth-index is masked at bit ''d - 1'', the bit values <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt> mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more. The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself.

==Type theory==

In [[type theory]], a binary tree with nodes of type A is defined [[inductive family|inductively]] as ''T''<sub>''A''</sub> = μα. 1 + ''A'' &times; α &times; α.

==Definition in graph theory==

For each binary tree data structure, there is equivalent rooted [[binary tree (graph theory)|binary tree]] in graph theory.

[[graph theory|Graph theorists]] use the following definition: A binary tree is a [[connected graph|connected]] [[Forest (graph theory)|acyclic graph]] such that the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of each [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] is no more than three. It can be shown that in any binary tree of two or more nodes, there are exactly two more nodes of degree one than there are of degree three, but there can be any number of nodes of degree two. A '''rooted binary tree''' is such a graph that has one of its vertices of degree no more than two singled out as the root.

With the root thus chosen, each vertex will have a uniquely defined parent, and up to two children; however, so far there is insufficient information to distinguish a left or right child. If we drop the connectedness requirement, allowing multiple [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] in the graph, we call such a structure a forest.

Another way of defining binary trees is a recursive definition on directed graphs. A binary tree is either:
* A single vertex.
* A graph formed by taking two binary trees, adding a vertex, and adding an edge directed from the new vertex to the root of each binary tree.
This also does not establish the order of children, but does fix a specific root node.

==Combinatorics==

In combinatorics one considers the problem of counting the number of full binary trees of a given size.  Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes (this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor), and trees are distinguished only by their structure; however the left and right child of any node are distinguished (if they are different trees, then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one). The size of the tree is taken to be the number ''n'' of internal nodes (those with two children); the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} of them. The number of such binary trees of size ''n'' is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} symbols (representing leaves) separated by ''n'' binary operators (representing internal nodes), so as to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator. For instance for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}} one has to parenthesize a string like {{nowrap| <math>X*X*X*X</math>}}, which is possible in five ways:
: <math>((X*X)*X)*X,\qquad (X*(X*X))*X,\qquad (X*X)*(X*X),\qquad X*((X*X)*X),\qquad X*(X*(X*X)).</math>
The correspondence to binary trees should be obvious, and the addition of redundant parentheses (around an already parenthesized expression or around the full expression) is disallowed (or at least not counted as producing a new possibility).

There is a unique binary tree of size 0 (consisting of a single leaf), and any other binary tree is characterized by the pair of its left and right children; if these have sizes ''i'' and ''j'' respectively, the full tree has size {{nowrap|''i'' + ''j'' + 1}}. Therefore the number <math>C_n</math> of binary trees of size ''n'' has the following recursive description <math>C_0=1</math>, and <math>\textstyle C_n=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}C_iC_{n-1-i}</math> for any positive integer ''n''. It follows that <math>C_n</math> is the [[Catalan number]] of index ''n''.

The above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2''n'' in the [[Dyck language]], which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced. The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description (each Dyck word of length 2''n'' is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial '(' and its matching ')' together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis, whose lengths 2''i'' and 2''j'' satisfy {{nowrap|''i'' + ''j'' + 1 {{=}} ''n''}}); this number is therefore also the Catalan number <math>C_n</math>. So there are also five Dyck words of length 10:
: <math>()()(),\qquad ()(()),\qquad (())(),\qquad (()()),\qquad ((()))</math>.
These Dyck words do not correspond in an obvious way to binary trees. A bijective correspondence can nevertheless be defined as follows: enclose the Dyck word in an extra pair of parentheses, so that the result can be interpreted as a  [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] list expression (with the empty list () as only occurring atom); then the [[Lisp (programming language)#S-expressions represent lists|dotted-pair]] expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression (with NIL as symbol and '.' as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is in fact the internal representation of the proper list).

The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a [[free magma]] on a singleton set.

== Methods for storing binary trees ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ahnentafel]] -->
Binary trees can be constructed from [[programming language]] primitives in several ways.

=== Nodes and references ===

In a language with [[record (computer science)|records]] and [[reference (computer science)|reference]]s, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special [[sentinel node]].

In languages with [[tagged union]]s such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]], a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a "leaf" node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers.

===Arrays===

Binary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an [[implicit data structure]] in [[array data structure|array]]s, and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index ''i'', its children are found at indices <math>2i + 1</math> (for the left child) and <math>2i +2</math> (for the right), while its parent (if any) is found at index ''<math>\left \lfloor \frac{i-1}{2} \right \rfloor</math>'' (assuming the root has index zero). This method benefits from more compact storage and better [[locality of reference]], particularly during a preorder traversal. However, it is expensive to grow and wastes space proportional to 2<sup>''h''</sup> - ''n'' for a tree of depth ''h'' with ''n'' nodes.

This method of storage is often used for [[binary heap]]s. No space is wasted because nodes are added in breadth-first order.

<center>[[Image:Binary tree in array.svg|300px|A small complete binary tree stored in an array]]</center>

== Encodings ==

=== Succinct encodings ===
A [[succinct data structure]] is one which occupies close to minimum possible space, as established by [[information theory|information theoretical]] lower bounds. The number of different binary trees on <math>n</math> nodes is <math>\mathrm{C}_{n}</math>, the <math>n</math>th [[Catalan number]] (assuming we view trees with identical ''structure'' as identical). For large <math>n</math>, this is about <math>4^{n}</math>; thus we need at least about <math>\log_{2}4^{n} = 2n</math> bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy <math>2n+o(n)</math> bits.

One simple representation which meets this bound is to visit the nodes of the tree in preorder, outputting "1" for an internal node and "0" for a leaf. [http://theory.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.897/spring03/scribe_notes/L12/lecture12.pdf] If the tree contains data, we can simply simultaneously store it in a consecutive array in preorder. This function accomplishes this:

 '''function''' EncodeSuccinct(''node'' n, ''bitstring'' structure, ''array'' data) {
     '''if''' n = ''nil'' '''then'''
         append 0 to structure;
     '''else'''
         append 1 to structure;
         append n.data to data;
         EncodeSuccinct(n.left, structure, data);
         EncodeSuccinct(n.right, structure, data);
 }

The string ''structure'' has only <math>2n + 1</math> bits in the end, where <math>n</math> is the number of (internal) nodes; we don't even have to store its length. To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this:

 '''function''' DecodeSuccinct(''bitstring'' structure, ''array'' data) {
     remove first bit of ''structure'' and put it in ''b''
     '''if''' b = 1 '''then'''
         create a new node ''n''
         remove first element of data and put it in n.data
         n.left = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)
         n.right = DecodeSuccinct(structure, data)
         '''return''' n
     '''else'''
         '''return''' nil
 }

More sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they're still in their succinct form.

=== Encoding general trees as binary trees ===
There is a one-to-one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees, which in particular is used by [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] to represent general ordered trees as binary trees. To convert a general ordered tree to binary tree, we only need to represent the general tree in left child-sibling way. The result of this representation will be automatically binary tree, if viewed from a different perspective. Each node ''N'' in the ordered tree corresponds to a node ''N' '' in the binary tree; the ''left'' child of ''N' '' is the node corresponding to the first child of ''N'', and the ''right'' child of ''N' '' is the node corresponding to ''N'' 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among the children of the parent of ''N''. This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a [[left child-right sibling binary tree]] (LCRS tree), or a [[doubly chained tree]], or a [[Filial-Heir chain]].

One way of thinking about this is that each node's children are in a [[linked list]], chained together with their ''right'' fields, and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list, through its ''left'' field.

For example, in the tree on the left, A has the 6 children {B,C,D,E,F,G}.  It can be converted into the binary tree on the right.

<center>
[[Image:N-ary to binary.svg|400x240px|An example of converting an n-ary tree to a binary tree]]
</center>

The binary tree can be thought of as the original tree tilted sideways, with the black left edges representing ''first child'' and the blue right edges representing ''next sibling''.  The leaves of the tree on the left would be written in Lisp as:

:(((N O) I J) C D ((P) (Q)) F (M))

which would be implemented in memory as the binary tree on the right, without any letters on those nodes that have a left child.
