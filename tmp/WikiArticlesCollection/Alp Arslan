'''Alp Arslan''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: آلپ ارسلان; [[full name]]: ''Diya ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Adud ad-Dawlah Abu Shuja Muhammad Alp Arslan ibn Dawud'') (20 January 1029 – 15 December 1072) was the second [[Sultan]] of the [[Seljuq Empire]] and great-grandson of [[Seljuq]], the [[eponym]]ous founder of the dynasty. His real name was ''Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri'', and for his military prowess, personal valour, and fighting skills he obtained the name ''Alp Arslan'', which means "Heroic Lion"<ref>"Alp Arslan." Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004. Encyclopedia.com. (September 5, 2011). http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404700163.html</ref> in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==Career==
Alp Arslan succeeded his father [[Çağrı Bey]] as governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in 1059. His uncle [[Tughril]] died and was succeeded by Suleiman, Arslan's brother. Arslan and his uncle [[Kutalmish]] both contested this succession. Arslan defeated Kutalmish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 1064 as sultan of [[Great Seljuq]], thus becoming sole monarch of [[Iran|Persia]] from the river [[Oxus]] to the [[Tigris]].

In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions, Arslan was ably assisted by [[Nizam ul-Mulk]], his [[vizier]], and one of the most eminent statesmen in early [[Muslim]] history.  With peace and security established in his dominions, Arslan convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son [[Malik Shah I]] his heir and successor.  With the hope of capturing [[Caesarea Mazaca]], the capital of [[Cappadocia]], he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the [[Euphrates]], and entered and invaded the city. He then marched into [[Armenia]] and [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]], which he conquered in 1064.

==Byzantine struggle==

En route to Syria in 1068, Alp Arslan Oush invaded the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Romanos IV]] Diogenes, assuming command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the Turks were defeated in detail and driven across the Euphrates in 1070. The first two campaigns were conducted by the emperor himself, while the third was directed by Manuel Comnenos, great-uncle of Emperor [[Manuel Comnenus|Manuel Comnenos]]. 

In 1071 Romanos again took the field and advanced into Armenia with possibly 30,000 men, including a contingent of [[Cuman]] Turks as well as contingents of [[Franks]] and [[Normans]], under [[Roussel de Bailleul|Ursel de Baieul]]. At [[Manzikert]], on the [[Murat River]], north of [[Lake Van]], Diogenes was met by Alp Arslan. The sultan proposed terms of peace, which were rejected by the emperor, and the two forces waged the [[Battle of Manzikert]].  The [[Cuman]] mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defected to the Turkish side. Seeing this, "the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle."<ref>{{cite book|title=The First Crusade|first= Steve|last= Runciman|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=1992}}</ref>  To be exact, Romanos was betrayed by general [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Romanos IV)|Andronikos Doukas]], son of the Caesar (Romanos's stepson), who pronounced him dead and rode off with a large part of the Byzantine forces at a critical moment.<ref>{{cite book|title=Byzantium: The Apogee|first=John Julius|last=Norwich|publisher=Penguin|year=1993|isbn=0-14-011448-3}}</ref> The Byzantines were totally routed.

Emperor Romanos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan. After a ritual humiliation, Arslan treated him with generosity. After peace terms were agreed to, Arslan dismissed the Emperor, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard. The following conversation is said to have taken place after Romanos was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan:<ref name="kings">Peoples, R.

:''Alp Arslan'': "What would you do if I was brought before you as a prisoner?"
:''Romanos'': "Perhaps I'd kill you, or exhibit you in the streets of Constantinople."
:''Alp Arslan'': "My punishment is far heavier.  I forgive you, and set you free."

Alp Arslan's victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the [[Seljuq Turks]] and [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly four more centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, the victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in [[Anatolia]]. Most historians, including [[Edward Gibbon]], date the defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen ended the themes in Anatolia that had furnished the Empire with men and treasure.

==State organization==
Alp Arslan's strength lay in the military realm.  Domestic affairs were handled by his able vizier, [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the founder of the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sultanate during the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son, Malik Shah. Military [[fiefdom|fiefs]], governed by Seljuq princes, were established to provide support for the soldiery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatolian agricultural scene.  This type of military fiefdom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Persians, Turks, and other established cultures within the Seljuq realm, and allowed Alp Arslan to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers.  He not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military, but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars.

According to the poet [[Saadi Shirazi]]: 
<blockquote>
''Arslan possessed a fort, which raised at the height of [[Alwand]],{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2012}} from all were those within its walls, for its roads were a labyrinth, like the curls of a bride. From a learned traveler Arslan once inquired: "Didst thou ever, in thy wanderings, see a fort as strong as this?" "Splendid it is," was the travelers reply, "but methinks not it confers much strength. Before thee, did not other kings possess it for a while, then pass away? After thee, will not other kings assume control, and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope?"''

''In the estimation of the wise, the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another.'' (the fort was sacked by the Mongols led by [[Hulagu]]).
</blockquote>

[[Suleyman I of Rûm|Suleiman ibn Kutalmish]] was the son of the contender for Arslan's throne; he was appointed governor of the north-western provinces and assigned to completing the invasion of Anatolia. An explanation for this choice can only be conjectured from [[Ibn al-Athir]]’s account of the battle between Alp-Arslan and [[Kutalmish]], in which he writes that Alp-Arslan wept for the latter's death and greatly mourned the loss of his kinsman.

==Death==
After Manzikert, the dominion of Alp Arslan extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march for the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, [[Yussuf el-Harezmi]], a [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmian]].  He was obliged to surrender, however, and was carried as a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to death.  Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan.  Alp Arslan, who took great pride in his reputation as the foremost archer of his time, motioned to his guards not to interfere. He drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast. Alp Arslan died from this wound four days later, on 25 November 1072, in his 42nd year, and he was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father, [[Chaghri Beg]]. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription:

:“''O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold! He is under the black soil now''...”

As he lay dying, Alp Arslan whispered to his son that his vanity had killed him.  "Alas," he is recorded to have said, "surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause, guarded night and day by them, I should have allowed them to do their job.  I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense.  I forgot those warnings, and here I lie, dying in agony.  Remember well the lessons learned, and do not allow your vanity to overreach your good sense..."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Legacy==
Alp Arslan's conquest of Anatolia from the Byzantines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the [[crusade]]s.

From 2002 to July 2008 under [[Renaming of Turkmen months and days of week, 2002|Turkmen calendar reform]], the month of August was named after Alp Arslan.
