'''Ankara''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈaŋ.ka.ɾa}}; historically known with the names '''Ancyra''' and '''Angora''') is the [[capital (political)|capital]] of [[Turkey]] since the [[Ottoman Empire|empire]]'s fall in 1923 and the country's [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second largest]] [[List of cities in Turkey|city]], [[Istanbul]] being the largest. The city has a mean elevation of {{convert|938|m|ft}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/68/Ankara.html Ankara, Turkey: Latitude, Longitude and Altitude]</ref>

Centrally located in [[Anatolia]], Ankara is an important commercial and industrial city. It is the center of the [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish Government]], and houses all foreign embassies. It is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the centre of Turkey's highway and railway networks, and serves as the marketing centre for the surrounding agricultural area. The city was famous for its long-haired [[Angora goat]] and its prized wool ([[mohair]]), a unique breed of cat ([[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]), [[Angora rabbit]]s and their prized wool ([[Angora wool]]), [[pear]]s, [[honey]], and the region's [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] [[grape]]s.

The historical center of Ankara is situated upon a rocky hill, which rises {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the plain on the left bank of the ''Ankara Çayı'', a tributary of the [[Sakarya River|Sakarya]] (Sangarius) river. The city is located at 39°52'30" North, 32°52' East ({{Coord|39.875|N|32.8333|E|type:city_region:TR|display=inline,title}}), about {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast of Istanbul, the country's largest city. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, which is 72&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> per head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ankara.bel.tr/AbbSayfalari/hizmet_birimleri/Cevre/kisi_basina_dusen_yesil_alan.aspx |title=Municipality of Ankara: Green areas per head |publisher=Ankara.bel.tr |date=|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

Ankara is a very old city with various [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Phrygia]]n, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[archaeological site]]s. The hill which overlooks the city is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which adds to the picturesqueness of the view, but only a few historic structures surrounding the old citadel have survived to the present day. There are, however, many well-preserved remains of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine architecture]], the most remarkable being the Temple of [[Augustus]] and Rome (20 BC) which is also known as the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html |title=LacusCurtius • Monumentum Ancyranum |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date=|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, as of 2012 the city of Ankara had a population of 4,338,620 and its [[metropolitan municipality]] 4,965,542.<ref name="Citypopulation.de - Turkey 2011"/><ref name="rapor.tuik.gov.tr"/>

As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages.

Following its annexation by the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as '''Angora''', a usage which continued until its official international renaming to '''Ankara''' under the Turkish Postal Service Law of 28 March 1930.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/ankara.htm |title=Ankara |publisher=I-cias.com |date=2004-09-03 |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Ankara}}
{{see also|Timeline of Ankara history}}
[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] artifacts on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]

The region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]], which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rûm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]].)

===Ancient history===
The oldest settlements in and around the city centre of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed ca. 2000–1700 BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., "Ancyra was actually older even than that."''</ref>

Phrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].

Another important expansion took place under the Greeks of [[Pontus|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading centre for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name ''Áγκυρα'' (''Ànkyra'', meaning ''[[Anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which in slightly modified form provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.

===Celtic history===
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230&nbsp;BC and 220&nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late third century BCE, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]

In 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centres, the headquarters of the [[Volcae|Tectosages]] tribe. Other centres were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, St. [[Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].

===Roman history===
[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|280px|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&nbsp;BC.]]

The city was subsequently conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC and passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. Now the capital city of the Roman province of Galatia, Ancyra continued to be a center of great commercial importance. Ankara is also famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments.

Augustus decided to make Ancyra one of three main administrative centres in central Anatolia. The town was then populated by Phrygians and Celts—the ''Galatians'' who spoke a language somewhat closely related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]. Ancyra was the center of a tribe known as the ''Tectosages'', and Augustus upgraded it into a major provincial capital for his empire. Two other Galatian tribal centres, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.

[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved in the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]

An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara Çayı]], ran through the centre of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Çankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the Çankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gençlik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Ancyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north-south and east-west intersected. The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of the most brilliant queens of the ancient world, the Arab empress [[Zenobia]] from [[Palmyra]] in the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.

The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284-305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eskişehir]]).

[[File:AnkaraRomanBaths1.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212-217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out 80m x 120m classical complex.]]

In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarised in response to the invasions and instability of the town. In this period, like other cities of central Anatolia, Ankara was also undergoing Christianisation.

Early martyrs, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown village of Kallippi, near Ancyra, and suffered repression under the emperor [[Trajan]] (98-117). In the 280s AD we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.

As in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off Işıklar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.

[[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|upright|The ''Column of Julianus'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.]]

However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]]; which considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church|Christian church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of 'lapsi'—Christians who had given in and conformed to [[paganism]] during these persecutions.

Three councils were held in the former capital of Galatia in Asia Minor, during the 4th century. The first, an orthodox plenary synod, was held in 314, and its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]]. Nine of them deal with conditions for the reconciliation of the lapsi; the others, with marriage, alienations of church property, etc.

Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.

The synod of 358 was a Semi-Arian [[conciliabulum]], presided over by [[Basil of Ancyra]]. It condemned the grosser Arian blasphemies, but set forth an equally heretical doctrine in the proposition that the Son was in all things similar to the Father, but not identical in substance.

In 362-363, the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men. The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as ''"Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations"'', can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]]. The modern Ankara, also known in some Western texts as ''Angora'', remains a Roman Catholic [[titular see]] in the former [[Roman province]] of [[Galatia]] in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]] of [[Laodicean Church|Laodicea]]. Its episcopal list is given in Gams, "Series episc. Eccl. cath."; also that of another Ancyra in [[Phrygia|Phrygia Pacatiana]].

In the late 4th century AD, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408-450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there. The city's military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]]. Although Ancyra temporarily fell into the hands of several Arab Muslim armies numerous times after the 7th century, it remained an important crossroads polis within the Byzantine Empire until the late 11th century. It was also the capital of the powerful [[Opsikion|Opsician Theme]], and after ca. 750 of the [[Bucellarian Theme]].

===Turkish history===
[[File:Atatürk TBMM'den çıkarken.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (center) and Prime Minister [[İsmet İnönü]] (left) leaving the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] during the 7th anniversary celebrations of the Turkish Republic in 1930.]]

In 1071, the Turkish [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] conquered much of [[Sultanate of Rum|eastern and central Anatolia]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. He then annexed Ankara, an important location for military transportation and [[natural resource]]s, to his territory in 1073. After the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, in which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] defeated the Seljuks, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Ankara as their independent city-state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356. [[Timur]] defeated the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

[[File:II. TBMM Binası.JPG|thumb|right|The second Turkish Parliament Building (1923), which is now the Republic Museum.]]

Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] defeat at [[World War I]], the Ottoman capital [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul) and much of [[Anatolia]] were occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Ankara in 1920 (see the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] and the [[Turkish War of Independence]].) After the War of Independence was won and the Treaty of Sèvres was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Ankara had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923.

After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yenişehir''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on ''[[Kızılay Meydanı|Kızılay Square]]'', has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital. It was "a small town of no importance"<ref>Columbia Lippincott Gazeteer</ref> when it was made the capital of Turkey. In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781.

Central Ankara has a population of 3,763,591 (2007) of which 1,870,831 are men and 1,892,760 are women. The metropolitan municipality, containing the central part of the city and the surrounding 8 districts under its jurisdiction, had a total population of 3,901,201 the same year.<ref name="Turkey pop 2007">[http://www.tuik.gov.tr/jsp/duyuru/upload/adnks_Harita_TR/HaritaTR.html Türkiye istatistik kurumu] Address-based population survey 2007. Retrieved on 2008-10-09.</ref>

When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]] forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[Güzelkent, Etimesgut|Güzelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.

Ankara is also famous for its [[pear]]s. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of [[honey]] (''Ankara Balı'') which is known for its light colour and is mostly produced by the [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

Exports to foreign countries from these defence and aerospace firms have steadily increased in the past decades. The [[International Defence Industry Fair|IDEF]] in Ankara is one of the largest international expositions of the global [[arms industry]]. A number of the global [[automotive industry|automotive companies]] also have production facilities in Ankara, such as the German bus and truck manufacturer [[MAN SE]].<ref>[http://www.man.com.tr/ MAN Türkiye]</ref> Ankara hosts the [[OSTIM Industrial Zone]], Turkey's largest [[industrial park]].

A large percentage of the employment in Ankara is provided by the state institutions; such as the [[ministry (government department)|ministries]], undersecretariats, and other administrative bodies of the Turkish [[government]]. There are also many foreign citizens working as [[diplomat]]s or clerks in the [[embassy|embassies]] of their respective countries.

===Shopping===
[[File:Botanik parkından Atakule.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Atakule Tower]] (1989)]]
[[File:Sheraton Ankara.jpg|thumb|[[Sheraton Ankara]] rising behind [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum shopping mall]] in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] quarter of the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] business and leisure district.]]

Foreign visitors to Ankara usually like to visit the old shops in ''Çıkrıkçılar Yokuşu'' (Weavers' Road) near Ulus, where myriad things ranging from traditional fabrics, hand-woven carpets and leather products can be found at bargain prices. ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce.

Modern shopping areas are mostly found in [[Kızılay, Ankara|Kızılay]], or on Tunalı Hilmi Avenue, including the modern [[shopping mall|mall]] of [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum]] (named after the ancient [[Assyria|Assyrian]] merchant colonies called [[Kültepe#Kârum Kaneš|''Kârum'']] that were established in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium BC]]) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]], the quarter with the highest elevation in the city.

The symbol of the [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Armada Shopping Mall]] is an [[anchor]], and there's a large anchor monument at its entrance, as a reference to the ancient Greek name of the city, Ἄγκυρα (Ánkyra), which means anchor. Likewise, the anchor monument is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, Armada, which means [[naval fleet]].

As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eskişehir]] Road. The ''Armada'' and ''CEPA'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'' in Ümitköy, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eskişehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''Ankamall'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region.

==Fauna==

===Angora cat===
{{Main|Turkish Angora}}
[[File:Odd-eyed Turkish Angora cat - 20080830.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora cat]]]]

Ankara is home to a world famous cat breed — the [[Turkish Angora]], called ''Ankara kedisi'' (Ankara cat) in Turkish. It is a [[cat breed|breed]] of domestic [[cat]]. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally-occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)

Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.

Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.

===Angora rabbit===
{{Main|Angora rabbit}}

[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|upright|Angora rabbit]]

The [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tavşanı}}) is a variety of domestic [[rabbit]] bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with [[France|French]] royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of [[Europe]] by the end of the century. They first appeared in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)

Angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called "wool block" is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds - How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit|accessdate=2009-01-29 |work=|publisher=|date=| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090125215910/http://joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml| archivedate= 25 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.

===Angora goat===
{{Main|Angora goat}}

[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|upright|Angora goat]]

The [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara keçisi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

This breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |date=|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref> The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.

The [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between five and eight kilograms of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high [[nutrition]]al requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The [[United States]], [[Turkey]], and [[South Africa]] are the top producers of mohair.

For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.

Angora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938–1952.<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].
