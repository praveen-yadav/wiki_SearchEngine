'''Alexander Emmanuel Rodolphe Agassiz''' (December 17, 1835 – March 27, 1910), son of [[Louis Agassiz]] and stepson of [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz]], was an [[United States|American]] scientist and engineer.<ref>{{cite book |author= |coauthors= |title=The Guide to Nature |year=1910 |publisher= |page= |quote=Alexander Emmanuel Rudolph Agassiz, better known to the world as Alexander Agassiz, simply, was for nearly half a century, in portions of the 19th and 20th, one of the most remarkable scientists of his time, but, unlike nearly all others who have devoted their lives to original research, he was a man of wealth which counted among the millions. | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7c4eAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=%22Rudolph+Agassiz%22+polo#v=onepage&q=%22Rudolph%20Agassiz%22%20polo&f=false |isbn= }}</ref>

==Biography==
Agassiz was born in [[Neuchâtel]], [[Switzerland]] and immigrated to the [[United States]] with his father in 1849. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1855, subsequently studying [[engineering]] and [[chemistry]], and taking the degree of [[bachelor of science]] at the [[Lawrence scientific school]] of the same institution in 1857; and in 1859 became an assistant in the [[United States Coast Survey]].<ref name="LeonardMarquis1908"/>

Thenceforward he became a specialist in marine [[ichthyology]], but devoted much time to the investigation, superintendence and exploitation of [[mining|mine]]s. 
[[E. J. Hulbert]], a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, [[Quincy Adams Shaw]], had discovered a rich copper lode known as the [[Calumet conglomerate]] on the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] [[Lake Superior]] in [[Michigan]]. He persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] based in [[Calumet, Michigan]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1862.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=6 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Up until the summer of 1866, Agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at Harvard. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise. 

Over the winter of 1866 and early 1867, mining operations began to falter due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines, and he returned to the mines in March 1867 with his wife and young son. At that time, Calumet was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations. 

Agassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progress in stabilising the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in 1868 before winter closed navigation.

The mines continued to prosper and in May 1871, several mines were consolidated to form the [[Calumet and Hecla Mining Company]] with Shaw as its first president. In August, 1871, Shaw "retired" to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death.

Agassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of 1,200&nbsp;metres (4,000&nbsp;ft). He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time year-round attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard.

Out of his copper fortune, he gave some US$500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative [[zoology]] and other purposes.

In 1875 he surveyed [[Lake Titicaca]], Peru, examined the copper mines of Peru and [[Chile]], and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], of which he was curator from 1874 to 1885. He assisted [[Charles Wyville Thomson]] in the examination and classification of the collections of the 1872 [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' Expedition]], and wrote the ''Review of the Echini'' (2 vols., 1872–1874) in the reports.

Between 1877 and 1880 he took part in the three [[Marine biology dredge|dredging]] expeditions of the steamer ''Blake'' of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes (1888). 

In 1896 Agassiz visited [[Fiji]] and [[Queensland]] and inspected the [[Great Barrier Reef]], publishing a paper on the subject in 1898.

Of Agassiz's other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology; but he published in 1865, with [[Elizabeth Cary Agassiz]], his stepmother, ''Seaside Studies in Natural History'', a work at once exact and stimulating, and in 1871 ''Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay''.

Agassiz served as a president of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], which since 1913 has awarded the [[Alexander Agassiz Medal]] in his memory. He died in 1910 on board the [[RMS Adriatic (1907)|RMS ''Adriatic'']] en route to New York from [[Southampton]].
