'''Alexis'''  ({{lang-grc|Ἄλεξις}}, c.375 BC &ndash; c.275 BC) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[comedian|comic]] [[poet]] of the [[Ancient Greek comedy|Middle Comedy]] period.  He was born at [[Thurii]] (in present day Calabria, Italy) in [[Magna Graecia]] and taken early to [[Athens]],<ref>[[Suda]]'' ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{lang|grc|Ἀλέξης}}</ref> where he became a citizen, being enrolled in the [[deme]] ''Oion'' ({{lang|grc|Οἶον}}) and the tribe Leontides.<ref>[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{lang|grc|Ἀλέξης}}</ref><ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Greenhill | first = William Alexander | authorlink = | title = Alexis (1) | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 128–129 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=demosthenes;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=143}}</ref> It is thought he lived to the age of 106 and died on the stage while being crowned. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th-century [[encyclopedia]], Alexis was the paternal uncle of the dramatist [[Menander]] and wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments now survive, including some 130 preserved titles.

==Life==
It was said he had a son, called Stephanus, who also wrote comedies.<ref>''Suda'' ''[[sub verbo|s.v.]]'' {{lang|grc|Ἀλέξης}}</ref> He appears to have been rather addicted to the pleasures of the table, according to [[Athenaeus]].<ref name="DGRBM"/><ref>Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophistae'' viii. p. 344''</ref>

He won his first [[Lenaean]] victory in the 350s BC, most likely, where he was sixth after [[Eubulus (poet)|Eubulus]], and fourth after [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]].  While being a Middle Comic poet, Alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of New Comedy, such as Philippides, [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]], [[Diphilus]], and even Menander. There is also some evidence that, during his old age, he wrote plays in the style of New Comedy.

[[Plutarch]] says that he lived to the age of 106 and 5 months, and that he died on the stage while being crowned victor.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Defect. Orac.'' p. 420 e</ref> He was certainly alive after 345 BC, for [[Aeschines]] mentions him as alive in that year. He was also living at least as late as 288 BC,<ref name="DGRBM"/> from which his birth date is calculated. According to the ''[[Suda]]'' he wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments including some 130 titles survive. His plays include ''Meropis'', ''Ankylion'', ''Olympiodoros'', ''Parasitos'' (exhibited in 360 BC, in which he ridiculed [[Plato]]), ''Agonis'' (in which he ridiculed Misgolas), and the ''Adelphoi'' and the ''Stratiotes'', in which he satirized [[Demosthenes]], and acted shortly after 343 BC.
Also ''Hippeis'' (316 BC) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} (in which he referred to the decree of [[Sophocles]] against the philosophers), ''Pyraunos'' (312 BC), ''Pharmakopole'' (306 BC) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, ''Hypobolimaios'' (306 BC), and ''Ankylion''.<ref name="DGRBM"/>

Because he wrote a lot of plays, the same passages often appear in more than 3 plays. It was said that he also borrowed from Eubulus and many other playwrights in some of his plays.<ref>Athenaeus, i. p.25, f.</ref> According to [[Carystius|Carytius of Pergamum]], Alexis was the first to use the part of the parasite.<ref>Athen. vi. p.235, f. This is incorrect, because [[Epicharmus of Kos|Epicharmus]] had already introduced it 250 years earlier. However, Alexis may have been the first to develop the part into its common form.</ref>  Alexis was known in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times; [[Aulus Gellius]] noted that Alexis' poetry was used by Roman comedians, including [[Turpilius]] and possibly [[Plautus]].

==Surviving titles and fragments==
Only fragments of any of the plays have survived - about 340 in all, totaling about 1,000 lines. They attest to the wit and refinement of the author, which Athenaeus praises.<ref>Athenaeus. ii. p.59, f.</ref>  The surviving fragments also show that Alexis invented a great deal of words, mostly compound words, that he used normal words in an unusual way, and made strange and unusual forms of common words. The main sources of the fragments of Alexis are [[Stobaeus]] and Athenaeus.
