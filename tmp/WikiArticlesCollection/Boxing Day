'''Boxing Day''' is traditionally the day following [[Christmas Day]], when servants and [[tradesmen]] would receive gifts from their bosses<ref name="(pseud.)1838">{{cite book|author=Parley, Peter (pseud.)|title=Tales about Christmas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UVcEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA323|accessdate=26 December 2011|year=1838|pages=323–8}}</ref> or employers, known as a "Christmas box". Today, Boxing Day is better known as a bank or public holiday that occurs on 26 December, or the first or second weekday after Christmas Day, depending on national or regional laws. It is observed in [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and some other Commonwealth nations.

In [[South Africa]], Boxing Day was renamed to Day of Goodwill in 1994. In Ireland, the day is known as [[St. Stephen's Day]] (Irish: ''Lá Fhéile Stiofáin)'' or the Day of the Wren ({{Lang-ga|Lá an Dreoilín}}). In many European countries, including notably [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Scandinavia]] <!-- please add only sourced countries/regions --> and the [[Netherlands]], 26 December is celebrated as the ''Second Christmas Day''.<ref name="Second Christmas Day">{{cite book|pages=21|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6w6u6YTsDdcC&pg=PA21|title=Christmas Facts, Figures & Fun: Facts, Figures and Fun|isbn=9781904332275|author1=Brown|first1=Cameron|date=28 August 2006}}</ref>

In Canada, Boxing Day takes place on 26 December and is a federal public holiday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1266366005340 |title=Public holidays in Canada |publisher=Canadian Heritage |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> In [[Ontario]], Boxing Day is a statutory holiday where all full-time workers receive time off with pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutoryholidays.com/index.php |title=Statutory holidays in Canada both national and provincial. |publisher=Statutory Holidays Canada |accessdate=26 December 2011}}</ref>

==Origins==
The exact etymology of the term "boxing day" is unclear. There are several competing theories, none of which is definitive.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/boxingday.asp Boxing Day]. [[Snopes.com]].</ref> The European tradition, which has long included giving money and other gifts to those who were needy and in service positions, has been dated to the [[Middle Ages]], but the exact origin is unknown. It is believed to be in reference to the Alms Box placed in places of worship in order to collect donations to the poor. In ancient, pre-Christian Rome, [[Saturnalia]] was a Roman celebration during which slave owners would switch roles with their slaves. Gift giving was a part of Saturnalia and benevolence to slaves was a practice which may have influenced the later December tradition of boxing and presenting of gifts to people of lesser status.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Also, it may come from a custom in the late Roman/early Christian era, wherein metal boxes placed outside churches were used to collect special offerings tied to the [[St. Stephen's Day|Feast of Saint Stephen]],<ref>Collins, 2003, p. 38.</ref> which in the [[Latin Church|Western Church]] falls on the same day as Boxing Day.

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], it was a custom for tradesmen to collect "Christmas boxes" of money or presents on the first weekday after Christmas as thanks for good service throughout the year.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, 1953 "Boxing day"</ref> This is mentioned in [[Samuel Pepys]]' diary entry for 19 December 1663.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1663/12/19/ |title=Saturday 19&nbsp;December&nbsp;1663 (Pepys' Diary) |publisher=Pepysdiary.com |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>
This custom is linked to an older English tradition: Since they would have to wait on their masters on Christmas Day, the servants of the wealthy were allowed the next day to visit their families. The employers would give each servant a box to take home containing gifts and bonuses, and sometimes leftover food.

==Date==
Boxing Day is a [[secular holiday]] that is traditionally celebrated on 26 December, the day after [[Christmas Day]], which is also [[St. Stephen's Day]], a [[religious holiday]].<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Fourth Edition – 'Boxing Day'</ref><ref>''Oxford English''</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/11_november/17/radio4_sun26.shtml |title=BBC Radio 4 schedule, 3&nbsp;December&nbsp;2004 |date = 17 November 2004 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> When 26 December falls on a Sunday, Boxing Day in many Commonwealth countries and former British dominions is moved to 27 December. In the UK, Boxing Day is a [[bank holiday]]. If Boxing Day falls on a Saturday, the following Monday is given as a substitute bank holiday. On the occasion when Christmas Day is on a Saturday – with Boxing Day on the Sunday – the following Monday (27) and Tuesday (28) of December both become bank holidays.

In [[Scotland]], Boxing Day has been specified as an additional bank holiday since 1974,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/46377/pages/9343 |title=London Gazette, 18&nbsp;October&nbsp;1974 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=18 October 1974 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> by [[Royal Proclamation]] under the [[Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971]].<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/bank-holidays/FAQs Scottish Government website – bank holidays]</ref>

In [[Ireland]]&nbsp;– when the island as a whole was part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]&nbsp;– the [[Bank Holidays Act 1871]] established the feast day of [[St. Stephen]] as a non-movable public holiday on 26 December. Since the creation of the [[Republic of Ireland]] following [[Partition of Ireland|partition in 1920]], only [[Northern Ireland]] officially continues to use the British name 'Boxing Day'.

In the [[Australia]]n state of [[South Australia]], 28 December is a public holiday known as [[Proclamation Day]] and Boxing Day is not normally a public holiday. The holiday for Proclamation Day is observed on the first weekday after Christmas Day or the Christmas Day holiday.<ref>[http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/show_page.jsp?id=2483 Public Holidays<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Nowadays Boxing Day is popular in Australia as the first day of a Test cricket match held at the [[MCG]]. A Test match is also often held in South Africa starting on Boxing Day.

In New Zealand Boxing Day is a statutory holiday; penalty rates and lieu time are provided to employees who work on the day.

In some Canadian provinces, Boxing Day is a statutory holiday<ref name="Manitoba">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mb.ca/labour/standards/doc,gen-holidays-after-april-30-07,factsheet.html#q13 |title = Fact Sheet |author = Manitoba Employment Standards Branch |date = 27 November 2009 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> that is always celebrated on 26 December. In Canadian provinces where Boxing Day is a statutory holiday, and it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, compensation days are given in the following week.<ref name="Manitoba"/>

It is a time where shops have sales, often with dramatic price reductions. For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest amount of returns. In the UK in 2009 it was estimated that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the [[VAT]] would revert to 17.5% from 1 January).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8432144.stm |title=Boxing Day sales attract 'record' number of shoppers |publisher=BBC News |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>

Many retailers open very early (typically 5&nbsp;am or even earlier) and offer [[doorbuster]] deals and [[loss leader]]s to draw people to their stores. It is not uncommon for long queues to form early in the morning of 26 December, hours before the opening of shops holding the big sales, especially at [[Big-box store|big-box]] [[consumer electronics]] retailers.<ref name="ctv.ca"/> Many stores have a limited quantity of big draw or deeply discounted items.<ref name="toronto.ctv.ca">{{cite web |url=http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20071213/boxing_day_071213?hub=EdmontonHome |title = How to become a Boxing Day shopping pro |date = 25 December 2007 |author = Ashleigh Patterson |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Because of the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, many choose to stay home and avoid the hectic shopping experience. The local media often cover the event, mentioning how early the shoppers began queueing up, providing video of shoppers queueing and later leaving with their purchased items.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20071226/Boxing_Day_071226/ |title=Boxing Day begins with early rush of bargain hunters |author = toronto.ctv.ca |date = 26 December 2007 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Many retailers have implemented practices aimed at managing large numbers of shoppers. They may limit entrances, restrict the number of patrons in a store at a time, provide tickets to people at the head of the queue to guarantee them a hot ticket item or canvass queued-up shoppers to inform them of inventory limitations.<ref name="toronto.ctv.ca"/>

In recent years, retailers have expanded deals to "[[Boxing Week]]." While Boxing Day is 26 December, many retailers will run the sales for several days before or after 26 December, often up to New Year's Eve. Notably, in [[Late 2000s recession|the recession of late 2008]], a record number of retailers were holding early promotions due to a weak economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20081221/Shopping_Deals_081222/ |title = Boxing Day comes early as shoppers search for deals |author = CTV.ca News Staff |date = 21 December 2008 |accessdate =17 December 2009}}</ref> Canada's Boxing Day has often been compared with the American [[Super Saturday]], the Saturday before Christmas.

In some areas of Canada, particularly in [[Atlantic Canada]] and parts of [[Northern Ontario]] (including [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.sault-ste-marie.on.ca/newsitem.aspx?ID=641 |title=Advisory – Boxing Day |author=www.city.sault-ste-marie.on.ca |year=2010 |accessdate=25 December 2010}}</ref> and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]), most retailers are prohibited from opening on Boxing Day, either by provincial law or municipal [[bylaw]], or instead by informal agreement among major retailers in order to provide a day of relaxation following Christmas Day. In these areas, sales otherwise scheduled for 26 December are moved to the 27th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soonews.ca/viewarticle.php?id=15342 |title=Boxing Day, The Debate Continues |author=soonews.ca |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hAtdtyDSIeYttaUmCcZLT_bGhGzg |title=Boxing Day madness: shoppers descend on stores looking for deals |author=The Canadian Press |date=26 December 2009 |accessdate=26 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref>

In Ireland, since 1902, most shops remain closed on St. Stephen's Day, as with Christmas Day. In 2009, some stores decided to open on this day, breaking a 107-year-old tradition. Some shops have also started their [[January sales]] on this day.

===Cyber Boxing Day===
In 2009, many retailers with both online and ''[[High Street]]'' stores launched their online sales on [[Christmas Eve]] and their High Street sales on Boxing Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imrg.org/8025741F0065E9B8/%28httpPressReleases%29/2947A86A04A12E2180257694003BB487?OpenDocument |title = Many retailers' sales to start on Christmas Eve |date = 22 December 2009 |author = IMRG |accessdate =22 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/6858609/Boxing-Day-sales-start-on-Christmas-Eve.html |title = Boxing Day sales start on Christmas Eve |date = 22 December 2009 |author = Telegraph |accessdate =22 December 2009 | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

In [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] it is traditional for the [[Premier League]], [[Scottish Premier League]] and [[Irish Premier League]] respectively, as well as the lower divisions and [[Rugby football|rugby]] leagues, to hold a full programme of [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby League]] matches on Boxing Day. Traditionally, matches on Boxing Day are played against [[local derby|local rivals]]. This was originally to avoid teams and their fans having to travel a long distance to an away game on the day after Christmas Day. It also makes the day an important one in the sporting calendar. In Australia and South Africa, much anticipated Test matches are played on Boxing Day.

In horse racing, there is the [[King George VI Chase]] at [[Kempton Park Racecourse]] in [[Surrey]]. It is the second most prestigious [[National Hunt racing|chase]] in England, after the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]].

Boxing Day is one of the main days in the hunting calendar for [[list of foxhound packs of the United Kingdom|hunts]] in the UK and US, with most hunts (both mounted foxhound or harrier packs and foot packs of beagles or bassets) holding meets, often in town or village centres.

Australia holds the first day of the [[Boxing Day Test]] in [[Melbourne]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and the start to the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]].

Several [[ice hockey]] contests are associated with the day. The [[IIHF World U20 Championship]]  typically begins on 26 December, while the [[Spengler Cup]] also begins on 26 December in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]]; the Spengler Cup competition includes [[HC Davos]], [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]], and other top European Hockey teams. The [[National Hockey League]] tends to have close to a full slate of games (11 were played in 2010), following the league-wide days off given for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

Although Boxing Day is not celebrated in the U.S., some American colleges usually play their last non-conference [[college basketball]] games, particularly [[crosstown rivalry|crosstown or cross-regional rivalries]] on the 26th, while others participate in regular season tournaments on this day.

In some African [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, particularly [[Ghana]], [[Uganda]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]], prize fighting contests are held on Boxing Day. This practice has also been followed for decades in [[Guyana]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126179017496705483.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_RIGHTTopCarousel | title = Season's Beatings: 'Boxing Day' Takes a Pugilistic Turn | accessdate =14 November 2011 | last = Millman | first = Joel | date = 28 December 2009 | work = The Wall Street Journal (Asia Edition)}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
There is a tradition in the [[British Army]] that on Boxing Day, the officers and enlisted personnel change places for one day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The tradition is examined in an episode of [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]] titled "'Twas the Day After Christmas", which originally aired on 28 December 1981. [[Colonel Sherman T. Potter]] ([[Harry Morgan]]) decides to try the same thing in his own unit with mixed results.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
