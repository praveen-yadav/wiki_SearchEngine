'''Charlemagne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑɹ|l|ɨ|m|eɪ|n}};  2 April 742/747/748<ref name="birthdate" />{{spaced ndash}}28 January 814), also known as '''Charles the Great''' ({{lang-de|Karl der Große}};<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne Charlemagne], Encyclopedia Brittanica</ref> {{lang-la|Carolus'' or ''Karolus Magnus}}) or '''Charles I''', was the [[Francia|King of the Franks]] from 768, the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|King of Italy]] from 774, and from 800 the first emperor in western Europe since the [[collapse of the Western Roman Empire]] three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state he founded is called the [[Carolingian Empire]].

The oldest son of [[Pepin the Short]] and [[Bertrada of Laon]], Charlemagne became king in 768 following the death of his father. He was initially co-ruler with his brother [[Carloman I of the Franks|Carloman I]]. Carloman's sudden death in 771 under unexplained circumstances left Charlemagne as the undisputed ruler of the Frankish Kingdom.  Charlemagne continued his father's policy towards the [[papacy]] and became its protector, removing the [[Lombards]] from power in northern Italy, and leading an incursion into [[Muslim Spain]]. He also campaigned against the [[Saxons|peoples]] to his east, [[Christianization|Christianizing]] them [[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae|upon penalty of death]], at times leading to events such as the [[Massacre of Verden]]. Charlemagne reached the height of his power in 800 when he was [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] as "[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]]" by [[Pope Leo III]] on Christmas Day at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]].

Called the "Father of Europe" (''pater Europae''),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.karlspreis.de/preistraeger/seine_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii/ansprache_von_seiner_heiligkeit_papst_johannes_paul_ii.html | title=Ansprache von seiner Heiligkeit Papst Johannes Paul II | year=2004 | author=Papst Johannes Paul II | publisher=Internationaler Karlspreis zu Aachen | language=German}}</ref> Charlemagne's empire united most of Western Europe for the first time since the [[Roman Empire]]. His rule spurred the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], a period of cultural and intellectual activity within the Catholic Church. Both the [[List of French monarchs|French]] and [[List of German monarchs|German]] monarchies considered their kingdoms to be descendants of Charlemagne's empire.

Charlemagne died in 814 after having ruled as Emperor for just over thirteen years. He was laid to rest in his imperial capital of [[Aachen]] in today's [[Germany]]. His son [[Louis the Pious]] succeeded him as Emperor.

==Political background==
By the 6th century, the western [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Franks]] had been [[Germanic Christianity|Christianised]], and [[Francia]], ruled by the [[Merovingians]], was the most powerful of the kingdoms that succeeded the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Following the [[Battle of Tertry]], however, the Merovingians declined into a state of powerlessness, for which they have been dubbed the ''[[rois fainéants]]'' ("''do-nothing kings''"). Almost all government powers of any consequence were exercised by their chief officer, the [[mayor of the palace]].<ref name=France/Neustria>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40279/The-hegemony-of-Neustria France], Encyclopedia Brittanica</ref>

In 687, [[Pippin of Herstal]], mayor of the palace of [[Austrasia]], ended the strife between various kings and their mayors with his victory at Tertry and became the sole governor of the entire Frankish kingdom.<ref name=France/Neustria /> Pippin himself was the grandson of two of the most important figures of the Austrasian Kingdom, Saint [[Arnulf of Metz]] and [[Pippin of Landen]]. Pippin of Herstal was eventually succeeded by his illegitimate son Charles, later known as [[Charles Martel]].

After 737, Charles governed the Franks without a king on the throne but declined to call himself ''king''. Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel|Carloman]] and [[Pepin the Short]], the father of Charlemagne. To curb separatism in the periphery of the realm, in 743 the brothers placed on the throne [[Childeric III]], who was to be the last Merovingian king. After Carloman resigned office in 746 to enter the church by preference as a monk, Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749. He decreed that it was better for Pepin, who had the powers of high office as Mayor, to be called king, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He therefore ordered him to become ''true king.''<ref name=France/Pippin>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III France], Encyclopedia Brittanica</ref>

In 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. Branding Childeric III as "the false king," the Pope ordered him into a monastery. Thus was the Merovingian dynasty replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Pepin's father, Charles Martel. In 753 [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia appealing for assistance for the rights of St. Peter to Pepin. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother. In return the pope could only provide legitimacy, which he did by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus and Carloman to the royal patrimony, now heirs to the great realm that already covered most of western and central Europe. In 754 Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=France/Pippin /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Years 745–755}}</ref>

Under the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the division of the kingdom formed the bases for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]].<ref>{{harvnb|Oman|1914|pp=409–410}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]], 843, between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne, as the foundation event of an independent France under its first king, [[Charles the Bald]], an independent Germany, under its first king, [[Louis the German]], and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[low countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had broken up by 890. The disposition of its territory remained a major source of divisiveness between France, Germany, and Italy down to the 20th century. The ultimate solution was the creation of smaller nations in the buffer zones, mainly [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]] but also some very small states. The concept and memory of a united Europe remains to the current time.</ref> The [[Religion|religious]], political, and artistic evolutions originating from a centrally positioned Francia made a defining imprint on the whole of Europe.

==Rise to power==

===Early life===

====Date of birth====
The most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources. The date of 742—calculated from [[Einhard]]'s date of death of January 814 at age 72—suffers from the defect of being two years before the marriage of his parents in 744. The year given in the ''[[Annales Petaviani]]'', 747, would be more likely, except that it contradicts Einhard and a few other sources in making Charlemagne less than a septuagenarian at his death. The month and day of April 2 is established by a calendar from [[Lorsch Abbey]].<ref name="Baldwin">{{cite web | first=Stewart | last=Baldwin | title=Charlemagne | date=2007-2009 | publisher=The Henry Project | url=http://sbaldw.home.mindspring.com/hproject/prov/charl000.htm}}</ref>

In 747, that day fell on [[Easter]], a coincidence that would have been remembered but was not. If Easter was being used as the beginning of the calendar year, then 2 April 747 could have been, by modern reckoning, 2 April  748 (not on Easter). The date favored by the preponderance of evidence is 2 April  742, based on the septuagenarian age at death.<ref name="Baldwin"/> This date would appear to support an initial [[Illegitimacy|illegitimacy of birth]], which is not, however, mentioned by Einhard.

====Place of birth====
[[File:Spoorlijn37.png|thumb|255px|Region of Aachen-Liège (with contemporary borders, trade- and travel routes).]]
Charlemagne’s exact birthplace is unknown, although historians have suggested [[Aachen]] in modern-day Germany, and [[Liège]] ([[Herstal]]) in present-day Belgium as possible locations.<ref>http://www.history.com/topics/charlemagne</ref> Aachen and Liège are close to the region from where both the Merovingian and Carolingian families originated. Other cities have been suggested, including [[Düren]], [[Gauting]], [[Mürlenbach]],<ref>[http://www.route-gottfried-von-bouillon.de/index.php?rid=1307&cid=5&area=content Route Gottfried von Bouillon e.V. - deutsche Sektion]. Route-gottfried-von-bouillon.de. Retrieved on 2013-09-07.</ref> and  [[Prüm]]. No definitive evidence as to which is the right candidate exists.
Charlemagne was the eldest child of [[Pepin the Short]] (714&nbsp;–&nbsp;24&nbsp;September&nbsp;768, reigned from 751) and his wife [[Bertrada of Laon]] (720&nbsp;–&nbsp;12&nbsp;July&nbsp;783), daughter of [[Caribert of Laon]] and [[Bertrada of Cologne]]. Records name only [[Carloman I, King of the Franks|Carloman]], [[Gisela (daughter of Pepin the Short)|Gisela]], and three short-lived children named Pepin, Chrothais and Adelais as his younger siblings.

{{Quote|It would be folly, I think, to write a word concerning Charles' birth and infancy, or even his boyhood, for nothing has ever been written on the subject, and there is no one alive now who can give information on it. Accordingly, I determined to pass that by as unknown, and to proceed at once to treat of his character, his deed, and such other facts of his life as are worth telling and setting forth, and shall first give an account of his deed at home and abroad, then of his character and pursuits, and lastly of his administration and death, omitting nothing worth knowing or necessary to know.|[[Einhard]]<ref>{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=4. Plan of This Work}}</ref>}}

===The ambiguous high office===
{{further2|[[Mayor of the Palace]]}}

The most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (Maior Domus) and one or more kings (rex, reges), were appointed by election of the people; that is, no regular elections were held, but they were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', "to whom the highest matters of state pertained." Evidently interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people, which met once a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}</ref>

Before he was elected king in 750, [[Pepin the Short]] was initially a Mayor, a high office he held "as though hereditary" (velut hereditario fungebatur). Einhard explains that "the honor" was usually "given by the people" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the wise received it as though hereditary, as did their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],<ref>{{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Years 745, 746}}</ref> the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the Mayorship into a Kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who now had the full right to pass it on by inheritance.<ref name=Einhard3>{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}}</ref>

This decision was not accepted by all members of the family. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his own son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favor of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. By 753 all was over. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1998|pp=32–33}}.</ref>

On the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, "with divine assent" (divino nutu).<ref name=Einhard3/> According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks "in general assembly" (generali conventu) gave them both the rank of king (reges) but "partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally" (totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur). The ''annals''<ref>{{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741–829|loc=Year 768}}</ref> tell a slightly different version. The king died at [[Saint-Denis|St. Denis]], which is, however, still in Paris. The two "lords" (domni) were "elevated to kingship" (elevati sunt in regnum), Carolus on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Carolus was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill and genius. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.

The language in either case suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled by the Frankish people. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.

===Aquitanian rebellion===
An inheritance in the countries formerly under Roman law ([[ius]] or iustitia) represented not only a transmission of the properties and privileges but also the encumbrances and obligations attached to the inheritance. Pepin at his death had been in process of building an empire, a difficult task:<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1930|page=87}}.</ref><blockquote>"In those times, to build a kingdom from an aggregation of small states was itself no great difficulty&nbsp;... But to keep the state intact after it had been formed was a colossal task&nbsp;... Each of the minor states&nbsp;... had its little sovereign&nbsp;... who&nbsp;... gave himself chiefly to&nbsp;... plotting, pillaging and fighting."</blockquote>

====Formation of a new Aquitania====
{{main|Aquitaine}}
Aquitania under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanized and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated entirely by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitania and Hispania were the Euskaldunak, Latinized to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1987|p=32}}.</ref> living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1987|p=105}}.</ref> The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from Vasconia. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitania was [[Toulouse]].

At about 660 the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitania]] to form a single kingdom under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a 28-year-old Basque king, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Douglas|Bilbao|2005|pp=36–37}}. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, "wolf."</ref> The kingdom was sovereign and independent. On the one hand Vasconia gave up predation to become a player on the field of European politics. On the other, whatever arrangements Felix had made with the weak Merovingians were null and void. At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance, but practiced [[primogeniture]], Lupus in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque kings of an expanded Aquitania.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1987|p=100}}.</ref>

====Acquisition of Aquitania by the Carolingians====
{{further2|[[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]]}}

The Latin chronicles on the end of Visigothic [[Hispania]] leave much to be desired, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps, and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130–131}}, "The sequence of events&nbsp;... has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information&nbsp;... from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account&nbsp;... As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity."</ref> The [[Saracen]] (Muslim) sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' ("History of the Conquest of al-Andalus") by [[Ibn al-Qūṭiyya]] (a name meaning "the son of the Gothic woman," referring to the granddaughter of the last king of all Visigothic Spain, who married a Saracen). Ibn al-Qūṭiyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.

According to Ibn al-Qūṭiyya,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2009|p=49}}.</ref> the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast, reached majority. Their mother was regent at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]]. Of all the possible outcomes, he chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=131–132}}.</ref> Wittiza is succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by a certain Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the Saracens, then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably Portugal.

The Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitania, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitania]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.<ref>{{harvnb|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}}.</ref> Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing toward [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] settled the question of the Saracen advance into Europe. The Moors were defeated so conclusively that they retreated across the mountains, never to return, leaving Septimania to become part of Francia.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107383/Charles-Martel Charles Martel], Encyclopedia Brittanica</ref> Odo also had to pay the price of incorporation into Charles's kingdom, a decision that was repugnant to him and also to his heirs.

====Loss and recovery of Aquitania====
After the death of his son, [[Hunald of Aquitaine|Hunald]] allied himself with free [[Lombardy]]. However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance according to Carolingian sources.<ref>The story, originally told in the [[Annales Mettenses priores]], is retold in {{cite book | title=Western Europe in the eighth century & onward | first=Edward Augustus | last=Freeman | first2=T Scott | last2=Holmes | location=London, New York | publisher=Macmillan and Co. | year=1904 | page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitania, and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honor it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since Aquitania was now Pepin's inheritance,{{Clarify|date=January 2013}} according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1930|p=88}}.</ref>

Among the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo&nbsp;III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian royal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the royal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign Tassilo with all his Bavarians left the field. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.<ref>{{harvnb|McKitterick|2008|pp=118–125}}.</ref>  Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and within a few weeks after the execution of Waifer died himself.

The first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascon]]s, in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year before, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, one Hunald (seemingly other than [[Hunald of Aquitaine|Hunald]] the duke) led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoulême]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lop II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and he was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.

===Union perforce===
The brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he would soon have little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.

Less than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and quickly married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, seemingly of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court in Lombardy with her sons for protection.

===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===
[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

At his succession in 772, [[Pope Adrian I]] demanded the return of certain cities in the former [[exarchate of Ravenna]] in accordance with a promise at the succession of Desiderius. Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent embassies to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own embassies denying the pope's charges. The embassies both met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne promptly demanded what the pope had demanded, and Desiderius promptly swore never to comply.

Lombard War}}</ref>

The siege lasted until the spring of 774, when Charlemagne visited the pope in Rome. There he confirmed his father's grants of land,<ref name=Campaigns>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256620/Military-campaigns Charlemagne], Encyclopedia Brittanica</ref> with some later chronicles claiming—falsely—that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice, and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in Constantinople a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy do homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.

There was still instability, however, in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the duke of Friuli in battle; the duke was slain.<ref name=Einhard/Lombard /> The duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city. Northern Italy was now faithfully his.

===Southern Italy===
In 787 Charlemagne directed his attention toward the [[Duchy of Benevento]], where Arechis was reigning independently. Charlemagne besieged [[Salerno]], and Arechis submitted to [[vassalage]]. However, with his death in 792, Benevento again proclaimed independence under his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]]. Grimoald was attacked by armies of Charles or his sons many times, but Charlemagne himself never returned to the [[Mezzogiorno]], and Grimoald never was forced to surrender to Frankish [[suzerainty]].

==Charles and his children==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
[[File:Karl der Grosse - Pippin der Bucklige.jpg|thumb|200px|Charlemagne (left) and [[Pippin the Hunchback]]. Tenth-century copy of a lost original from about 830]]
During the first peace of any substantial length (780–782), Charles began to appoint his sons to positions of authority within the realm, in the tradition of the kings and mayors of the past. In 781, he made his two younger sons kings, having them crowned by the Pope. The elder of these two, [[Pippin of Italy|Carloman]], was made [[king of Italy]], taking the Iron Crown which his father had first worn in 774, and in the same ceremony was renamed "Pippin."<ref name=Einhard/Lombard /><ref name=Campaigns />  The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[king of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pippin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but real power was always in his hands, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms some day. Nor did he tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished his eldest, though possibly illegitimate, son, [[Pippin the Hunchback]], to the monastery of Prüm, because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.

Charles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as he himself was not. His children were taught all the arts, and his daughters were learned in the way of being a woman. His sons took archery, horsemanship, and other outdoor activities.

[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|left|thumb|Charlemagne instructing [[Louis the Pious]]]]

The sons fought many wars on behalf of their father when they came of age. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down, but he was also sent against the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the Böhmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing a tribute on them. Pippin had to hold the [[Eurasian Avars|Avar]] and Beneventan borders but also fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when finally that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and also went to southern Italy to fight the duke of Benevento on at least one occasion. He took Barcelona in a great siege in 797 (see below).

Charlemagne's attitude toward his daughters has been the subject of much discussion. He kept them at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] – possibly to prevent the creation of [[cadet branch]]es of the family to challenge the main line, as had been the case with [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo of Bavaria]] – yet he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands, and treasured the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behavior. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.<ref>Matthias Becher, [http://books.google.com/books?id=KbbMcYpuQswC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q&f=false Charlemagne] (2003), pp.122-26.</ref><ref>Rosamund McKitterick, [http://books.google.com/books?id=kxb8kR4hvbQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q&f=false Charlemagne] (2008), pp.91-94.</ref>

==Carolingian expansion to the south==
{{See also|Abbasid-Carolingian alliance}}

===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===
The destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the Loire was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waifer of Aquitaine]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, maybe son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, handed him over to the new King of the Franks besides pledging loyalty to him, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the Garonne.

However, wary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to diminish duke Lupus's power by appointing a certain [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768–877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of Fézensac]]), a decision that seriously undermined the authority of the duke of Gascony (Vasconia). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] duke in turn seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as "Basque treachery"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed him in his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (son [[Louis the Pious]] proclaimed first king) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as ally. A Christianization program was put on place across the high Pyrenees (778).

The new political arrangement for Vasconia didn´t go down well with other local lords either. As of 788 we hear of [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone|William of Orange]]. William in turn fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).

From 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagorça]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne managed to assert Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by bringing to heel the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]]. As of 794, we hear for the first time of a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') in the lands of [[Álava]], but Pamplona remained in Cordovan and local hands up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hispánica provided the necessary springboard to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801), in a way that Charlemagne had succeeded in expanding the Carolingian rule all around the Pyrenees by 812, although events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Galíndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral on his death.

===Roncesvalles campaign===
According to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the Diet of Paderborn had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], Barcelona, and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] peninsula by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of Córdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These "Saracen" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the great king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.

In 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne was facing the toughest battle of his career where the Muslims had the upper hand and forced him to retreat. He decided to go home, since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his long reign occurred. The Basques fell on his rearguard and baggage train, utterly destroying it. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], less a battle than a mere skirmish, left many famous dead: among which were the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').

===Wars with the Moors===
[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius Köckert]]]]
The conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Pippin, his son, was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) kept them at bay with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref>Gene W. Heck ''When worlds collide: exploring the ideological and political foundations of the clash of civilizations'' Rowman & Littlefield, 2007 ISBN 0-7425-5856-8, p. 172 [http://books.google.com/books?id=dtAyMXqaozwC&pg=PA172 Google Books Search]</ref>

In [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. His son Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (and much longer, it remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly revolting against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]], and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].

In 797 [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognize their conquests in 812.

==Eastern campaigns==

===Saxon Wars===
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|300px|Map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]
Charlemagne was engaged in almost constant battle throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, "The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63–5</ref>  often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons, with his legendary sword [[Joyeuse]] in hand. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert the conquered to Christianity.

The [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to Austrasia was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. In between these two kingdoms was that of [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].

In his first campaign, Charlemagne forced the Engrians in 773 to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon [[Fort of Hohensyburg|fort of Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. All of Saxony but Nordalbingia was under his control, but Saxon resistance had not ended.

Following his campaign in Italy to subjugate the dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned very rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again brought to heel, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], managed to escape to Denmark, home of his wife. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.

In the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria, and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, there was no immediate Saxon revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.

[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne reçoit la soumission de Widukind à Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|Charlemagne (742–814) receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, by [[Ary Scheffer]] (1795–1858). [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]]]

He returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This revived a renewal of the old conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] ("Verdener Blutgericht"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare (783–785). During this war the [[Frisians]] were also finally subdued and a large part of their fleet was burned. The war ended with [[Widukind]] accepting baptism.

Thereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 the Westphalians again rose against their conquerors. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection did not catch on and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection of the independent-minded people occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them. This time, the most restive of them, the Nordalbingians, found themselves effectively disempowered from rebellion for the time being. According to Einhard:
<blockquote>
The war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.
</blockquote>

===Submission of Bavaria===
By 774 AD Charlemagne invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its
crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name="autogenerated30">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was also acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued
of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs,
and Czechs. The remaining power confronting the Franks in the east were the [[Avar people (Caucasus)|Avars]], however Charlemagne went on acquiring other Slav areas, including [[Bohemia]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Moravia]], [[Austria]] and [[Croatia]].<ref name="autogenerated30"/> 
In 789, Charlemagne turned his attention to [[Bavaria]]. He claimed Tassilo was an unfit ruler, due to his oath-breaking. The charges were exaggerated, but Tassilo was deposed anyway and put in the monastery of [[Jumièges]]. In 794, he was made to renounce any claim to Bavaria for himself and his family (the [[Agilolfings]]) at the [[synod]] of [[Frankfurt]]. Bavaria was subdivided into Frankish counties, as had been done with Saxony.

===Avar campaigns===
In 788, the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], a pagan Asian horde that had settled down in what is today [[Hungary]] (Einhard called them [[Huns]]), invaded Friuli and Bavaria. Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790, when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Győr]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns would have continued if the Saxons had not revolted again in 792, breaking seven years of peace.

For the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to all his followers and even to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had thrown in the towel and traveled to Aachen to subject themselves to Charlemagne as vassals and Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] also attacked the remains of Avar state.

In 803 Charlemagne sent a huge Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name="Rogers">Clifford J. Rogers, Bernard S. Bachrach, Kelly DeVries, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0E-LTZ2n_2EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn+9780851159096&source=bl&ots=NU8eVzLw_0&sig=S7WA50VM5bsPQ9MFr1kpuaJO9EQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eguHUJC_Aoiw0AXen4HIBw&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=isbn%209780851159096&f=false The Journal of Medieval Military History], Boydell Press, 2003, pp&nbsp;58–59 ISBN 978-0-85115-909-6</ref> In November of the same year, Charlemagne went to Regensburg where the Avar leaders acknowledged him as their own ruler.<ref name="Rogers"/> In 805 the Avar khagan, who had already been baptised, went to Aachen to ask permission to settle with his people south-eastward from [[Vienna]].<ref name="Rogers"/>  The [[Transdanubia]]n territories became integral parts of the Frankish realm, which was abolished by the [[Magyars]] in 899-900.

===Northeast Slav expeditions===
In 789, in recognition of his new pagan neighbours, the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], Charlemagne marched an Austrasian-Saxon army across the [[Elbe]] into [[Obotrite]] territory. The Slavs immediately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Wiltzes]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. Charlemagne also demanded the permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Wiltzes rose in arms with their new master against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who greatly honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.

===Southeast Slav expeditions===
[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|275px|Europe around 800]]

When Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name="Bruce Ross">{{cite book | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212–235 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | publisher=Medieval Academy of America | year=Apr., 1945 | isbn=}}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbors were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Charlemagne also directed his attention to the [[South Slavs|Slavs]] to the west of the Avar khaganate: the [[Carantania]]ns and [[Carniola]]ns. These people were subdued by the Lombards and Bavarii, were made tributaries, but were never fully incorporated into the Frankish state.

==Imperium==

===Coronation===
[[File:Aachen-cathedral-inside.jpg|thumb|[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's chapel]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]

In 799, [[Pope Leo III]] had been mistreated by the Romans, who tried to put out his eyes and tear out his tongue. Leo escaped and fled to Charlemagne at [[Paderborn]], asking him to intervene in Rome and restore him. Charlemagne, advised by scholar [[Alcuin of York]], agreed to travel to Rome, doing so in November 800 and holding a council on 1&nbsp;December. On 23&nbsp;December Leo swore an oath of innocence. At [[Mass]], on Christmas Day (25&nbsp;December), when Charlemagne knelt at the altar to pray, the Pope [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] him ''Imperator Romanorum'' ("Emperor of the Romans") in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]]. In so doing, the Pope was effectively nullifying the legitimacy of [[Empress Irene]] of [[Constantinople]]:
:"When [[Odoacer]] compelled the abdication of [[Romulus Augustulus]], he did not abolish the Western Empire as a separate power, but cause it to be reunited with or sink into the Eastern, so that from that time there was a single undivided Roman Empire&nbsp;... [Pope Leo III and Charlemagne], like their predecessors, held the Roman Empire to be one and indivisible, and proposed by the coronation of [Charlemagne] not to proclaim a severance of the East and West&nbsp;... they were not revolting against a reigning sovereign, but legitimately filling up the place of the deposed [[Constantine VI]]&nbsp;... [Charlemagne] was held to be the legitimate successor, not of Romulus Augustulus, but of Constantine VI&nbsp;..."<ref>[[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]], ''The Holy Roman Empire'', 1864, pg 62–64</ref>

Charlemagne's coronation as Emperor, though intended to represent the continuation of the unbroken line of Emperors from [[Augustus]] to Constantine VI, had the effect of setting up two separate (and often opposing) Empires and two separate claims to imperial authority. For centuries to come, the Emperors of both West and East would make competing claims of sovereignty over the whole.

Einhard says that Charlemagne was ignorant of the Pope's intent and did not want any such coronation:
<blockquote>[H]e at first had such an aversion that he declared that he would not have set foot in the Church the day that they [the imperial titles] were conferred, although it was a great feast-day, if he could have foreseen the design of the Pope.</blockquote> A number of modern scholars, however,<ref>Tierney, Brian. ''The Crisis of the Church and State 1050–1300''. University of Toronto Press, 1964. p. 17.</ref> suggest that Charlemagne was indeed aware of the coronation; certainly he cannot have missed the bejeweled crown waiting on the altar when he came to pray.

In any event, Charlemagne used these circumstances to claim that he was the renewer of the Roman Empire, which had apparently fallen into degradation under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. In his official charters, Charles preferred the style ''Karolus serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus magnus pacificus imperator Romanum gubernans imperium''<ref>Cf. ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', Diplomata Karolinorum I, 77ff.; title used from 801 onward.</ref> ("Charles, most serene Augustus crowned by God, the great, peaceful emperor ruling the Roman empire") to the more direct ''Imperator Romanorum'' ("Emperor of the Romans").

===Imperial Diplomacy===
The [[iconoclasm (Byzantine)|iconoclasm]] of the Byzantine [[Leo III the Isaurian|Isaurian Dynasty]] was endorsed by the Franks.<ref name=Becher2011>{{cite journal|title=Die Außenpolitik Karls des Großen. Zwischen Krieg und Diplomatie |language=German |first=Matthias |last=Becher |journal=[[Damals]] |volume=2011 Special Volume |year=2011 |pages=33–46}}</ref> The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] reintroduced the veneration of icons under Empress [[Byzantine Empress Irene|Irene]]. The council was not recognized by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the old Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nicephorus&nbsp;I]] — neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.

The Byzantines, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Brindisi]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810, when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rhangabes]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf. ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'', a. 812.</ref> although not necessarily as "Emperor of the Romans".<ref>E. Eichmann, ''Die Kaiserkrönung im Abendland'' I (Würzburg: 1942), 33.</ref>

===Danish attacks===
After the conquest of Nordalbingia, the Frankish frontier was brought into contact with Scandinavia. The [[Norse paganism|pagan]] Danes, "a&nbsp;race almost unknown to his ancestors, but destined to be only too well known to his sons" as [[Charles Oman]] described them, inhabiting the [[Jutland]] peninsula, had heard many stories from [[Widukind]] and his allies who had taken refuge with them about the dangers of the Franks and the fury which their Christian king could direct against pagan neighbours.

In 808, the king of the Danes, [[Gudfred|Godfred]], built the vast [[Danevirke]] across the isthmus of [[Schleswig]]. This defence, last employed in the Danish-Prussian War of 1864, was at its beginning a {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} long earthenwork rampart. The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Wiltzes and fought the Abotrites.

[[File:Shroud of Charlemagne manufactured in Constantinople 814.jpg|thumb|Portion of the 814 death [[shroud]] of Charlemagne. It represents a [[quadriga]] and was manufactured in [[Constantinople]].]]

Godfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men. Godfred was succeeded by his nephew [[King Hemming|Hemming]], who concluded the [[Treaty of Heiligen]] with Charlemagne in late 811.

===Death===
In 813, Charlemagne called [[Louis the Pious]], king of [[Aquitaine]], his only surviving legitimate son, to his court. There Charlemagne crowned his son with his own hands as co-emperor and sent him back to Aquitaine. He then spent the autumn hunting before returning to Aachen on 1&nbsp;November. In January, he fell ill with [[pleurisy]].<ref>Einhard, ''Life'', p. 59</ref> In deep depression (mostly because many of his plans were not yet realized), he took to his bed on 21&nbsp;January and as [[Einhard]] tells it:
<blockquote>He died January twenty-eighth, the seventh day from the time that he took to his bed, at nine o'clock in the morning, after partaking of the [[Holy Communion]], in the seventy-second year of his age and the forty-seventh of his reign.</blockquote>

[[File:AachenerDomSarg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persephone sarcophagus]] of Charlemagne]]

He was buried the same day as his death, in [[Aachen Cathedral]], although the cold weather and the nature of his illness made such a hurried burial unnecessary. The earliest surviving ''[[planctus]]'', the ''[[Planctus de obitu Karoli]]'', was composed by a monk of [[Bobbio Abbey|Bobbio]], which he had patronised.<ref>Peter Godman (1985), ''Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 206–211.</ref> A later story, told by Otho of Lomello, Count of the Palace at Aachen in the time of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;III]], would claim that he and Emperor Otto had discovered Charlemagne's tomb: the emperor, they claimed, was seated upon a throne, wearing a crown and holding a sceptre, his flesh almost entirely incorrupt. In 1165, [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick&nbsp;I]] re-opened the tomb again and placed the emperor in a sarcophagus beneath the floor of the cathedral.<ref>Chamberlin, Russell, ''The Emperor Charlemagne'', pp. 222–224</ref> In 1215 [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] re-interred him in a casket made of gold and silver.

Charlemagne's death greatly affected many of his subjects, particularly those of the literary clique who had surrounded him at [[Aachen]]. An anonymous monk of Bobbio lamented:<ref>Dutton, PE, ''Carolingian Civilization: A Reader''</ref>

[[File:Sarg Karl.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II's]] gold and silver casket for Charlemagne, the [[Karlsschrein]]]]

<blockquote>From the lands where the sun rises to western shores, people are crying and wailing&nbsp;... the Franks, the Romans, all Christians, are stung with mourning and great worry&nbsp;... the young and old, glorious nobles, all lament the loss of their Caesar&nbsp;... the world laments the death of Charles&nbsp;... O Christ, you who govern the heavenly host, grant a peaceful place to Charles in your kingdom. Alas for miserable me.</blockquote>

He was succeeded by his surviving son, Louis, who had been crowned the previous year. His empire lasted only another generation in its entirety; its division, according to custom, between Louis's own sons after their father's death laid the foundation for the modern state of Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3840415,00.html |title=Die Geburt zweier Staaten – Die Straßburger Eide vom 14.

==Administration==
As an administrator, Charlemagne stands out for his many reforms: [[monetary]], governmental, military, cultural, and [[ecclesiastic]]al. He is the main protagonist of the "Carolingian Renaissance."

===Military===
It has long been held that the dominance of Charlemagne's military was based on a "[[heavy cavalry|cavalry]] revolution" led by [[Charles Martel]] in 730s. However, the [[stirrup]], which made the "shock cavalry" [[lance]] charge possible, was not introduced to the Frankish kingdom until the late eighth century.<ref name="books.google.com">Hooper, Nicholas / Bennett, Matthew. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Sf8UIynR0koC&pg=PA12&dq=cavalry+made+the+carolingian+expansion+possible&lr=#v=onepage&q=cavalry%20made%20the%20carolingian%20expansion%20possible&f=false ''The Cambridge illustrated atlas of warfare: the Middle Ages''] Cambridge University Press, 1996, Pg. 12–13 ISBN 0-521-44049-1, ISBN 978-0-521-44049-3</ref> Instead, Charlemagne's success rested primarily on novel [[siege]] technologies and excellent logistics.<ref>Bowlus, Charles R.

However, large numbers of horses were used by the Frankish military during the age of Charlemagne. This was because horses provided a quick, long-distance method of [[mounted infantry|transporting troops]], which was critical to building and maintaining such a large empire.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

=== Economic and monetary reforms ===
[[File:Karldergrossesignatur.svg|thumb|400px|[[Monogram]] of Charlemagne, from the subscription of a royal diploma: ''{{lang|la|Signum ''(monogr.: KAROLVS)'' Karoli gloriosissimi regis}}'']]

Charlemagne had an important role in determining the immediate economic future of Europe. Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|''[[solidus (coin)|sou]]''}}, and he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up the system set in place by Pippin. There were strong pragmatic reasons for this abandonment of a [[gold standard]], notably a shortage of gold itself.

The gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonized and unified the complex array of currencies which had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.

Charlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|''[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]''}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]''}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver—a unit of both money and weight—which was worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]''}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|''[[denier (coin)|deniers]]''}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|''[[denarius]]''}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|''livre''}} and the {{lang|fr|''sou''}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|''denier''}} was a coin of the realm.

[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|200px|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793–812]]

Charlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis vel curtis imperii|Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.

Early in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed the Jews to monopolize money lending. Then lending money for interest was proscribed in 814, being against Church law at the time, Charlemagne introduced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions of the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board. A reversal of his earlier recorded general policy.<ref>http://www.worldology.com/Europe/early_dark_ages_3.htm "Charlemagne created a peaceful environment for Jews in his kingdom. Charlemagne fostered a system where the Christian majority could procure credit through Jewish constituents. Christians were forbidden to loan money at an interest rate, a restriction not shared by the Jews."</ref> In addition to this macro-oriented reform of the economy, Charlemagne also performed a significant number of microeconomic reforms, such as direct control of prices and levies on certain goods and commodities.

His [[Capitulary for the Jews]], however was not representative of his overall economic relationship or attitude, toward the Frankish Jews and certainly not his earlier relationship with them, which had evolved over his lifespan. His paid personal physician for example was Jewish,<ref>http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4250-charlemagne</ref> he employed at least one Jew for his diplomatic missions,<ref>http://www.geni.com/people/Isaac-the-Jew-Charlemagne-s-Diplomat/6000000014633081117</ref> Isaac was his personal representative to the Muslim caliphate of Baghdad. Letters have been credited to him as well inviting Jews to settle in his kingdom, for economic purposes,  generally welcoming them through his overall, progressive policies.<ref>Author: Raymond P. ScheindlinTitle: A Short History of the Jewish PeoplePublisher: Oxford University PressDate: Copyright 1998 by Raymond P. Scheindlin

Charlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.

===Education reforms===
A part of Charlemagne's success as warrior and administrator can be traced to his admiration for learning. His reign and the era it ushered in are often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art, and architecture which characterize it. Charlemagne, brought into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Visigothic Spain, Anglo-Saxon England, and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests, greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.

Most of the presently surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars. Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.

The pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]], [[Italians]]; and [[Angilbert]], [[Angilram]], [[Einhard]], and [[Waldo of Reichenau]], Franks.

Charlemagne took a serious interest in scholarship, promoting the [[liberal arts]] at the court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who assisted him in his studies of arithmetic.<ref name="ReferenceA">Dutton, Paul Edward, ''Charlemagne's Mustache''</ref>

His great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he began attempts to learn—practicing the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow—"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success", and his ability to read – which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports—has also been called into question.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it. He certainly had not been personally in Jerusalem.<ref>Karl der Grosse und das Erbe der Kulturen, Band 1999, Franz-Reiner Erkens, Akademie Verlag, 2001.</ref><ref>Saint-Denis zwischen Adel und König, Rolf Große, Thorbecke, Stuttgart 2002.</ref>

===Church reforms===
Unlike his father,Pippin, and Uncle, Carloman, Charlemagne expanded the reform program of the church. The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on the strengthening of the church's power structure, improving the skill and moral quality of the clergy, standardizing liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and moral, and the rooting out of paganism. His authority was now extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had grown a well developed support from the clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his Christian subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url="Charlemagne."

===Writing reforms===
[[File:Codexaureus 04.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from the [[Lorsch Gospels]] of Charlemagne's reign]]

During Charles' reign, the [[uncial|Roman half uncial]] script and its cursive version, which had given rise to various continental [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]] scripts, were combined with features from the [[insular script]]s that were being used in Irish and English monasteries. [[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]] of York, who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence in this.

The revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming the crabbed Merovingian and Germanic hands had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.

===Political reforms===
Charlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance, but he continued also in many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====Organization====
{{Main|Government of the Carolingian Empire}}
The Carolingian king exercised the ''[[bannum]]'', the right to rule and command. He had supreme jurisdiction in judicial matters, made legislation, led the army, and protected both the Church and the poor. His administration was an attempt to organize the kingdom, church, and nobility around him. However, the effort was heavily dependent upon the efficiency, loyalty, and support of his subjects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

====Imperial coronation====
[[File:Friedrich Kaulbach - Krönung Karls des Großen.jpg|thumb|275px|Imperial Coronation of Charlemagne, by [[Friedrich Kaulbach]], 1861]]

Historians have debated for centuries whether Charlemagne was aware of the Pope's intent to crown him Emperor prior to the coronation (Charlemagne declared that he would not have entered Saint Peter's had he known), but that debate has often obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne chose to accept it once he did.<ref>"he said that he would have refused to enter the church that day, although it was a major festival, had he been aware of the pope's plans". Einhard, The life of Charlemagne,&nbsp;28</ref>

[[Roger Collins]] points out "[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely."<ref>Collins, ''Charlemagne'', p. 147</ref> For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having "fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans" and "from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals", as Pippin&nbsp;III described it in a law of 763 or 764.<ref name="Collins151">Collins 151</ref>

Furthermore, the new title—carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would "make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government" or "concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally"—risked alienating the Frankish leadership.<ref>Collins, ''Charlemagne'', p. 149</ref>

For both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time, and continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not very far south of the city of Rome itself—this is the empire historiography has labelled the Byzantine Empire, for its capital was Constantinople (ancient Byzantium) and its people and rulers were [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]]; it was a thoroughly Hellenic state. Indeed, Charlemagne was usurping the prerogatives of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople simply by sitting in judgement over the Pope in the first place:

{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by Irene. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]|Byzantium: The Early Centuries, pg. 378}}

For the Pope, then, there was "no living Emperor at the that time"<ref>Norwich 379,</ref> though [[Henri Pirenne]]<ref>''Mohammed and Charlemagne'', pg. 234n</ref> disputes this saying that the coronation "was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople." Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of iconoclasm, the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.

[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]

By bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself "the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created." And "because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view—political, military and doctrinal—he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries."

With Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, "the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor", though there can have been "little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople."<ref>Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Apogee'', pg. 3</ref>

How realistic either Charlemagne or the Pope felt it to be that the people of Constantinople would ever accept the King of the Franks as their Emperor, we cannot know; Alcuin speaks hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' ("Christian Empire"), wherein, "just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith,<ref name="Collins151"/> certainly this is the view of Pirenne when he says "Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church".<ref>Pirenne 233</ref> The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across the Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name="Butler1995">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.si/books?id=XIEAD2MC1YkC&pg=PA74 |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726–804) |pages=74–75 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>

What is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],<ref>Collins 153</ref> is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps toward securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favorably to them.

[[File:AachenerDomKarlsthron 1661a.jpg|thumb|right|Throne of Charlemagne and the subsequent German Kings in Aachen Cathedral]]

It is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which have been the source of considerable controversy among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a "commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction"; and the emperor "was entitled to the obedience of Christendom." According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his policy was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by far-flung theories.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire "Holy Roman Empire" at Britannica]</ref>

According to Werner Ohnsorge, for a long time it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual "sons" of the Byzantines. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century, to the pride of the Franks in the eighth century was provoking and insulting. Charles came to the realization that the great Roman emperor, who claimed to be the head of the world hierarchy of states, in reality was no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself "Basileus" (translated literally as "king"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: "Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be king of the Franks and wished only for the greatness of his Frankish people. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his youngest, only surviving son, Louis, as emperor without recourse to Rome and only with the acclamation of his Franks, also the form in which this acclamation was offered was no longer Roman, but Frankish-Christian; thus demonstrating both independence from Rome, and a Frankish understanding of empire different from Rome's.<ref>[http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im früheren Mittelalter. Die Bedeutung des byzantinischen Reiches für die Entwicklung der Staatsidee in Europa'', (Hildesheim, August Lax Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1947), pp.&nbsp;15–31. Translated by Richard E. Sullivan in ''The Coronation of Charlemagne'' D. C. Heath and Company, Boston, 1959, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 59-14499]</ref>

The title of emperor remained in his family for years to come, however, as brothers fought over who had the supremacy in the Frankish state. The papacy itself never forgot the title nor abandoned the right to bestow it. When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

This devolution led, as could have been expected, to the dormancy of the title for almost forty years (924–962). Finally, in 962, in a radically different Europe from Charlemagne's, a new Roman Emperor was crowned in Rome by a grateful pope. This emperor, [[Otto the Great]], brought the title into the hands of the kings of Germany for almost a millennium, for it was to become the Holy Roman Empire, a true imperial successor to that of Charles, if not [[Augustus]].

====Divisio regnorum====
[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], circa 1516–1517]]
In 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy, and [[Thuringia]]. To Pippin he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]. Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March, and [[Provence]]. There was no mention of the imperial title however, which has led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement which held no hereditary significance.

This division might have worked, but it was never to be tested. Pippin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire which Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].

==Personality==

===Language===
{{main|Theodiscus}}
By Charlemagne's time the French vernacular had already diverged significantly from Latin. This is evidenced by one of the regulations of the [[Council of Tours]] (813), which required that the parish priests preach either in the "rusticam Romanam linguam" (Romance) or "Theotiscam" (the Germanic vernacular) rather than in Latin. The goal of this rule was to make the sermons comprehensible to the common people, who must therefore have been either Romance speakers or Germanic speakers.<ref>{{harvnb|Barbero|2004|p=106}}.</ref> Charlemagne himself probably spoke a [[Rhenish Franconian]] dialect of [[Old High German]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=R.E. | last=Keller | title=The Language of the Franks | journal=Bulletin of the John Rylands Library of Manchester | volume=47 |number=1 | year=1964 | pages=101–122, esp. 122}} {{cite book | first=W.W. | last=Chambers | first2=J.R. | last2=Wilkie | title=A short history of the German language | year=1970 | location=London | publisher=Methuen | page=33}} {{harvnb|McKitterick|2008|p=318}}.</ref>

Apart from his native language he also spoke [[Latin]] "as well as his native tongue" and understood a bit of Greek, according to his biographer [[Einhard]] (''Grecam vero melius intellegere quam pronuntiare poterat'', "he could understand Greek better than he could speak it").<ref>{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=25. Studies}}.</ref>

The largely fictional account of Charlemagne's Iberian campaigns by [[Pseudo-Turpin]], written some three centuries after his death, gave rise to the legend that the king also spoke [[Arabic]].<ref>{{cite book | first=J. v. | last=Herwaarden | title=Between Saint James and Erasmus | series=Studies in late-medieval religious life: devotion and pilgrimage in the Netherlands | year=2003 | location=Leiden | publisher=Brill | page=475}}</ref>

===Appearance===
[[File:Vitrail Cathédrale de Moulins 160609 34.jpg|thumb|In the Cathedral of Moulins, France, end of the 15th century]]
Charlemagne's personal appearance is known from a good description by a personal associate, [[Einhard]], author after his death of the biography ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]''. Einhard tells in his twenty-second chapter:<ref>{{harvnb|Barbero|2004|p=116}}.</ref>

<blockquote>"He was heavily built, sturdy, and of considerable stature, although not exceptionally so, since his height was seven times the length of his own foot. He had a round head, large and lively eyes, a slightly larger nose than usual, white but still attractive hair, a bright and cheerful expression, a short and fat neck, and he enjoyed good health, except for the fevers that affected him in the last few years of his life. Toward the end, he dragged one leg. Even then, he stubbornly did what he wanted and refused to listen to doctors, indeed he detested them, because they wanted to persuade him to stop eating roast meat, as was his wont, and to be content with boiled meat."</blockquote>

The physical portrait provided by Einhard is confirmed by contemporary depictions of the emperor, such as coins and his {{convert|8|in|cm|adj=on}} bronze statue kept in the [[Louvre]]. In 1861, Charlemagne's tomb was opened by scientists who reconstructed his skeleton and estimated it to be measured {{convert|1.90|m|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Barbero|2004|p=118}}.</ref> An estimate of his height from a [[Radiology|X-ray]] and [[CT Scan]] of his [[tibia]] performed in 2010 is {{convert|1.84|m|in|abbr=on}}. This puts him in the 99th [[percentile]] of tall people of his period, given that average male height of his time was {{convert|1.69|m|in|abbr=on}}. The width of the bone suggested he was [[Gracility|gracile]] but not [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] in body build.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Ruhli | first=F.J. | last2=Blumich | first2=B. | last3=Henneberg | first3=M. | year=2010 | title=Charlemagne was very tall, but not robust | journal=Economics and Human Biology | volume=8 | pages=289–290}}</ref>

===Dress===
[[File:Charles Ier le Grand ou Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|In the Bibliothèque Nationale de France]]
Charlemagne wore the traditional [[Early medieval European dress|costume of the Frankish people]], described by Einhard thus:<ref name=VKM>{{harvnb|Einhard|1999|loc=23. Dress}}.</ref>

<blockquote>"He used to wear the national, that is to say, the Frank, dress-next his skin a linen shirt and linen breeches, and above these a tunic fringed with silk; while hose fastened by bands covered his lower limbs, and shoes his feet, and he protected his shoulders and chest in winter by a close-fitting coat of otter or marten skins."</blockquote>

He wore a blue cloak and always carried a sword with him. The typical sword was of a golden or silver hilt. He wore fancy jewelled swords to banquets or ambassadorial receptions. Nevertheless:<ref name=VKM />
<blockquote>"He despised foreign costumes, however handsome, and never allowed himself to be robed in them, except twice in Rome, when he donned the Roman tunic, chlamys, and shoes; the first time at the request of Pope Hadrian, the second to gratify Leo, Hadrian's successor."</blockquote>

He could rise to the occasion when necessary. On great feast days, he wore embroidery and jewels on his clothing and shoes. He had a golden buckle for his cloak on such occasions and would appear with his great [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], but he despised such apparel, according to Einhard, and usually dressed like the common people.<ref name=VKM />

==Family==

===Marriages and heirs===
Charlemagne had eighteen children over the course of his life with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will. [http://www.chronique.com/Library/MedHistory/charlemagne.htm "King Charlemagne."] History of Civilization, Vol III, ''The Age of Faith''. Online version in the Knighthood, Tournaments & Chivalry Resource Library, Ed. Brian R. Price.</ref> Nonetheless, he only had four legitimate grandsons, the four sons of his fourth son, Louis. In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pippin of Italy]]), who was born illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. So, despite eighteen children, the claimants to his inheritance were few.

| ca.768
| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubine|concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a "concubine" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth "before legal marriage", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Riché]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter Hägemann (''Karl der Große. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was "something more than concubinage, less than marriage" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognized by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.) The union with Himiltrude produced two children:

==Name==
He was named Karl (Carolus) after his grandfather, [[Charles Martel]]. Later Old French historians dubbed him ''Charles le Magne'' (Charles the Great),<ref>Church historians of the period wrote universally in Latin, regardless of native language. Charles le Magne only translates Carolus Magnus given in the Latin manuscripts into French, which was subsequent to whatever language Charles spoke.</ref> becoming Charlemagne in English after the [[Norman conquest of England]]. The epithet Carolus Magnus was widely used, leading to numerous translations into many languages of Europe. He was known in German as Karl der Grosse; Dutch, Karel de Grote; Danish, Karl den Store; Italian, Carlo Magno; Croatian, Karlo Veliki; Spanish, Carlomagno; and various others.

Charles' achievements gave a new meaning to [[Charles|his name]]. In many European languages, the very word for "king" derives from his name; e.g., {{lang-pl|król}}, {{lang-ua|король (korol')}}, {{lang-cs|král}}, {{lang-sk|kráľ}}, {{lang-hu|király}}, {{lang-lt|karalius}}, {{lang-lv|karalis}}, {{lang-ru|король}}, {{lang-mk|крал}}, {{lang-bg|крал}}, {{lang-bs|kralj}}, {{lang-sr|краљ/kralj}}, {{lang-hr|kralj}}, {{lang-tr|kral}}. This development parallels that of the name of the Caesars in the original Roman Empire, which became Kaiser and Czar, among others.<ref>{{cite book | title=Passages from antiquity to feudalism | first=Perry | last=Anderson | location=London; New York | year=1996 | series=Verso classics, 2 | page=231}}</ref>

Charlemagne had an immediate afterlife. The author of the ''[[Visio Karoli Magni]]'' written around 865 uses facts gathered apparently from Einhard and his own observations on the decline of Charlemagne's family after the dissensions war (840–43) as the basis for a visionary tale of Charles' meeting with a prophetic spectre in a dream.

[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Charlemagne by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican, Italy]]
Charlemagne, being a model [[knight]] as one of the [[Nine Worthies]], enjoyed an important afterlife in European culture. One of the great medieval [[literary cycle]]s, the Charlemagne cycle or the ''[[Matter of France]]'', centres on the deeds of Charlemagne—the Emperor with the Flowing Beard of ''[[Song of Roland|Roland]]'' fame—and his historical commander of the border with [[Brittany]], [[Roland]], and the [[paladin]]s who are analogous to the knights of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] or [[King Arthur]]'s court. Their tales constitute the first ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''.

Charlemagne himself was accorded sainthood inside the Holy Roman Empire after the twelfth century. His [[canonisation]] by [[Antipope Paschal&nbsp;III]], to gain the favour of [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1165, was never recognised by the [[Holy See]], which annulled all of Paschal's ordinances at the [[Third Lateran Council]] in 1179.<ref name=Shahan>{{cite journal|last=Shahan|first=Thomas|coauthors=Ewan Macpherson|title=Charlemagne|journal=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03610c.htm|accessdate=1 January 2013|quote=In some parts of the empire popular affection placed him among the saints.

In 809–810, Charlemagne called together a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son). For this Charlemagne sought the approval of [[Pope Leo III]]. The Pope, while affirming the doctrine and approving its use in teaching, opposed its inclusion in the text of the Creed as adopted in the 381 [[First Council of Constantinople]]. This spoke of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father, without adding phrases such as "and the Son", "through the Son", or "alone". Stressing his opposition, the Pope had the original text inscribed in Greek and Latin on two heavy shields, which were displayed in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].<ref>[http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/dialogue-with-others/ecumenical/orthodox/filioque-church-dividing-issue-english.cfm The Filioque: A Church-Dividing Issue?: An Agreed Statement of the North American Orthodox-Catholic Consultation]</ref><ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma5.ii.ii.i.vi.iv.html Adolf Harnack, ''History of Dogma'', The Controversy regarding the Filioque and Pictures]</ref><ref>[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/TynBul/Library/TynBull_1983_34_04_Bray_FilioqueInHistory.pdf Gerald Bray, ''The ''Filioque'' Clause in History and Theology'' The Tyndale Historical Lecture 1982], p.&nbsp;121</ref>

The city of Aachen has, since 1949, awarded an international prize (called the ''[[Karlspreis]] der Stadt Aachen'') in honour of Charlemagne. It is awarded annually to "personages of merit who have promoted the idea of western unity by their political, economic and literary endeavours."<ref>Chamberlin, Russell, ''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. ???</ref> Winners of the prize include [[Richard Nikolaus Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi|Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi]], the founder of the pan-European movement, [[Alcide De Gasperi]], and [[Winston Churchill]].

In its national anthem, [[El Gran Carlemany]], the nation of [[Andorra]] credits Charlemagne with its independence.

Charlemagne is quoted by Dr Henry Jones Sr. (played by [[Sean Connery]]) in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. After using his umbrella to induce a flock of seagulls to smash through the glass cockpit of a pursuing German fighter plane, Henry Jones remarks, "I suddenly remembered my Charlemagne: 'Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky'." Despite the quote's popularity since the movie, there is no evidence that Charlemagne actually said this.<ref>[http://www.quidplura.com/?p=29 Quid plura? | "Flying birds, excellent birds&nbsp;..."<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'', the weekly news and international affairs newspaper, features a one-page article every week entitled "Charlemagne", focusing generally on European affairs and, more usually and specifically, on the [[European Union]] and its politics.

==Books and Libraries==
Charlemagne was a lover of books.  He had clerics translate Christian creeds and prayers into their respective vernaculars.  Book production was completed slowly by hand, and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.  Books were so in  demand during Charlemagne’s time that monastic libraries lent out some books, but only if that borrower put up valuable collateral.  At Charlemagne’s court, a court library was founded.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=SkyHorse|location=Chicago|isbn=9780838909911}}</ref>

Charlemagne was a bibliophile and founded a court library during the ninth-century. Some claims that add to Charlemagne’s credit as a lover of books include during meals having books read out loud to him, and loving the books by St. Augustine.  He also had Alcuin at his court, although originally he was from North Umbria in modern England, Alcuin was a proponent of education and wrote thoughtfully on Christian religion.  In the court library created by Charlemagne a number of copies of books were produced but those copies were made to be distributed by Charlemagne, like expensive jewelry.  Pope Paul I sent a selection of books, mostly written in Greek, to Charlemagne’s father Pippin in 758, and it is not clear whether any of those titles were added later to Charlemagne’s court library.  The first codex, codices are modern  books, acquired by Charlemagne for his court library was in 774 and was a papal gift; it was a canon law collection by Dionysius Exiguus from the sixth-century. A  number of foreigners came to the Frankish court, and those people most likely did not arrive without books but there was never any record made.  Some of the most popular books from the ninth-century that might have been included in Charlemagne’s court library are “Against Images” by Theodulf and a letter on adoptionism addressed to the Spanish bishops by Alcuin. The work “Against Images” was probably researched using a fourth-century summary of Aristotle.  Alcuin was the first medieval author to have read Faustus of Riez’s De Spiritu Sancto  and used in his  future writings (Charlemagne’s court library visited, 2003).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339–363|accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref><ref>
