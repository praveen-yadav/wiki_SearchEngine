The metal is extremely reactive and [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], reacting with [[water]] even at −116&nbsp;°C (−177&nbsp;°F). It is the least [[electronegativity|electronegative]] element with a stable [[isotope]], caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from [[pollucite]], while the [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]], especially [[caesium-137]], a [[fission product]], are extracted from waste produced by [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]].

Two German chemists, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of [[Atomic emission spectroscopy#Flame emission spectroscopy|flame spectroscopy]]. The first small-scale applications for caesium were as a "[[getter]]" in [[vacuum tube]]s and in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]]. In 1967, a specific frequency from the [[emission spectrum]] of caesium-133 was chosen to be used in the definition of the [[second]] by the [[International System of Units]]. Since then, caesium has been widely used in [[atomic clock]]s.

Since the 1990s, the largest [[#Applications|application of the element]] has been as [[caesium formate]] for [[drilling fluid]]s. It has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a [[half-life]] of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Although the element is only mildly [[Toxicity|toxic]], it is a hazardous material as a metal and its radioisotopes present a high health risk if released into the environment.

===Chemical properties===
[[File:Cesium water.theora.ogv|left|thumb|Addition of a small amount of caesium to cold water is explosive.|alt=A person adds a small amount of metal to a petri dish with cold water which produces a small explosion.]]
Caesium metal is highly reactive and very [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]]. In addition to igniting spontaneously in air, it reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures, more so than other members of the [[Alkali metal|first group]] of the [[periodic table]].<ref name="USGS" /> The reaction with solid water occurs at temperatures as low as {{convert|−116|°C}}.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Because of its high reactivity, the metal is classified as a [[hazardous material]]. It is stored and shipped in dry saturated hydrocarbons, such as [[mineral oil]]. Similarly, it must be handled under [[inert gas]], such as [[argon]]. However, a caesium-water explosion is often less powerful than a sodium-water explosion with a similar amount of sodium. This is because caesium explodes instantly upon contact with water, leaving little time for hydrogen to accumulate.<ref>Gray, Theodore (2012) ''The Elements'', Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, p. 131, ISBN 1579128955.</ref> Caesium can be stored in vacuum-sealed [[borosilicate glass]] [[ampoule]]s. In quantities of more than about 100&nbsp;grams (3.5&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]), caesium is shipped in hermetically sealed, stainless steel containers.<ref name="USGS" />

The chemistry of caesium is similar to that of other alkali metals, but is more closely similar to that of [[rubidium]], the element above caesium in the periodic table.<ref name="greenwood" /> As expected for an alkali metal, its only common oxidation state is +1.{{#tag:ref|It differs from this value in caesides, which contain the Cs<sup>−</sup> anion and thus have caesium in the −1 oxidation state.<ref name=caeside/> Additionally, 2013 calculations by Mao-sheng Miao indicate that under conditions of extreme pressure (greater than 30&nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]]), the inner 5p electrons could form chemical bonds, where caesium would behave as the seventh 5p element.

The vast majority of caesium compounds contain the element as the [[cation]] {{chem|Cs||+}}, which [[ionic bond|binds ionically]] to a wide variety of [[anion]]s. One noteworthy exception is provided by the [[alkalide|caeside]] anion ({{chem|Cs||−}}).<ref name=caeside>{{cite journal|journal = [[Angewandte Chemie|Angewandte Chemie International Edition]]|year = 1979|first = J.

Returning to more normal compounds, salts of Cs<sup>+</sup> are almost invariably colorless unless the anion itself is colored. Many of the simple salts are [[hygroscopic]], but less so than the corresponding salts of the lighter alkali metals. The [[phosphate]],<ref>Hogan, C. M. (2011).

National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC</ref> [[acetate]], [[carbonate]], [[halide]]s, [[oxide]], [[nitrate]], and [[sulfate]] salts are water-soluble.

The double salt with antimony (such as {{chem|CsSbCl|4}}), [[bismuth]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], and [[lead]] are also poorly [[Dissolution (chemistry)|soluble]].<ref name="USGS" />

A stoichiometric mixture of caesium and [[gold]] will react to form yellow [[caesium auride]] (Cs<sup>+</sup>Au<sup>−</sup>) upon heating. The auride anion here behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]]. The compound reacts violently with water, yielding [[caesium hydroxide]], metallic gold, and hydrogen gas; in liquid ammonia it can be reacted with a caesium-specific ion exchange resin to produce tetramethylammonium auride. The analogous [[platinum]] compound, the red caesium platinide (Cs<sub>2</sub>Pt), contains the platinide ion that behaves as a pseudo[[chalcogen]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Effects of relativistic motion of electrons on the chemistry of gold and platinum|journal=Solid State Sciences|date=2005-11-30|volume=7|issue=12|pages=1464–1474|doi=10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2005.06.015|last=Jansen|first=Martin}}</ref>

====Complexes====
Like all metal cations, Cs<sup>+</sup> forms complexes with [[Lewis base]]s in solution. Because of its large size, Cs<sup>+</sup> usually adopts [[coordination number]]s greater than six-coordination, which is typical for the lighter alkali metal cations. This trend is already apparent by the 8-coordination in CsCl, vs the halite motif adopted by the other alkali metal chlorides. Its high coordination number and [[HSAB|softness]] (tendency to form covalent bonds) are the basis of the separation of Cs<sup>+</sup> from other cations, as is practiced in the remediation of nuclear wastes, where <sup>137</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup> is separated from large amounts of nonradioactive K<sup>+</sup>.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moyer |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Birdwell |first2=Joseph F. |last3=Bonnesen |first3=Peter V. |last4=Delmau |first4=Laetitia H. |title=Macrocyclic Chemistry |pages=383–405 |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/1-4020-3687-6_24 |chapter=Use of Macrocycles in Nuclear-Waste Cleanup: A Realworld Application of a Calixcrown in Cesium Separation Technology |isbn=1-4020-3364-8}}.</ref>

[[Caesium chloride]] (CsCl) crystallizes in the simple [[cubic crystal system]]. Also called the "caesium chloride structure",<ref name="HollemanAF" /> this structural motif is composed of a [[primitive cell|primitive]] cubic lattice with a two-atom basis, each with an eightfold [[coordination number|coordination]]; the chloride atoms lie upon the lattice points at the edges of the cube, while the caesium atoms lie in the holes in the center of the cubes. This structure is shared with [[caesium bromide|CsBr]] and [[caesium iodide|CsI]], and many other compounds that do not contain Cs. In contrast, most other alkaline halides adopt the [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) structure.<ref name="HollemanAF" /> The CsCl structure is preferred because Cs<sup>+</sup> has an [[ionic radius]] of 174&nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] and {{chem|Cl||−}} 181&nbsp;pm.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wells|first = A.F.| year=1984| title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry| edition=5|publisher=Oxford Science Publications|isbn=0-19-855370-6}}</ref>

Due to its large [[ionic radius]], caesium is one of the "[[incompatible element]]s".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.org/adb/02/13/02/cesium-occurrence-uses.html|title=Cesium as a Raw Material: Occurrence and Uses|first=Simon|last=Rowland|publisher=Artemis Society International|date=1998-07-04|accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref> During [[Fractional crystallization (geology)|magma crystallization]], caesium is concentrated in the liquid phase and crystallizes last. Therefore, the largest deposits of caesium are zone [[pegmatite]] ore bodies formed by this enrichment process. Because caesium does not substitute for [[potassium]] as readily as does rubidium, the alkali evaporite minerals [[sylvite]] (KCl) and [[carnallite]] ({{chem|KMgCl|3|·6H|2|O}}) may contain only 0.002% caesium. Consequently, Cs is found in few minerals. Percentage amounts of caesium may be found in [[beryl]] ({{chem|Be|3|Al|2|(SiO|3|)|6}}) and [[avogadrite]] ({{chem|(K,Cs)BF|4}}), up to 15&nbsp;wt% Cs<sub>2</sub>O in the closely related mineral [[pezzottaite]] (Cs(Be<sub>2</sub>Li)Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>), up to 8.4&nbsp;wt% Cs<sub>2</sub>O in the rare mineral [[londonite]] ({{chem|(Cs,K)Al|4|Be|4|(B,Be)|12|O|28}}), and less in the more widespread [[rhodizite]].<ref name="USGS" /> The only economically important source mineral for caesium is [[pollucite]] {{chem|Cs(AlSi|2|O|6|)}}, which is found in a few places around the world in zoned pegmatites, and is associated with the more commercially important [[lithium]] minerals [[lepidolite]] and [[petalite]]. Within the pegmatites, the large grain size and the strong separation of the minerals create high-grade ore for mining.<ref name="Cerny">{{cite journal|title=The Tanco Pegmatite at Bernic Lake, Manitoba: X.

==Production==
The mining of pollucite ore is a selective process and is conducted on a small scale in comparison with most metal mining operations. The ore is crushed, hand-sorted, but not usually concentrated, and then ground. Caesium is then extracted from pollucite mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.<ref name="USGS" /><ref name=Burt>{{cite book|last = Burt|first = R. O.|year = 1993|chapter = Caesium and cesium compounds|title = Kirk-Othmer encyclopedia of chemical technology|edition = 4th|place = New York|publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|volume = 5|pages = 749–764|isbn = 978-0-471-48494-3}}</ref>

In the acid digestion, the [[silicate]] pollucite rock is dissolved with strong acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] (HCl), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}), [[hydrobromic acid|hydrobromic]] (HBr), or [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] (HF) acids. With hydrochloric acid, a mixture of soluble chlorides is produced, and the insoluble chloride double salts of caesium are precipitated as caesium antimony chloride ({{chem|Cs|4|SbCl|7}}), caesium iodine chloride ({{chem|Cs|2|ICl}}), or caesium hexachlorocerate ({{chem|Cs|2|(CeCl|6|)}}). After separation, the pure precipitated double salt is decomposed, and pure CsCl is obtained after evaporating the water. The method using sulfuric acid yields the insoluble double salt directly as caesium [[alum]] ({{chem|CsAl(SO|4|)|2|·12H|2|O}}). The [[aluminium sulfate]] in it is converted to the insoluble [[aluminium oxide]] by roasting the alum with [[carbon]], and the resulting product is [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] with water to yield a {{chem|Cs|2|SO|4}} solution.<ref name="USGS" />

The roasting of pollucite with [[calcium carbonate]] and [[calcium chloride]] yields insoluble calcium silicates and soluble caesium chloride. Leaching with water or dilute [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|4|OH}}) yields then a dilute chloride (CsCl) solution. This solution can be evaporated to produce caesium chloride or transformed into caesium alum or caesium carbonate. Albeit not commercially feasible, direct reduction of the ore with potassium, sodium or calcium in vacuum can produce caesium metal directly.<ref name="USGS" />

Most of the mined caesium (as salts) is directly converted into [[formate|caesium formate]] (HCOO<sup>−</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup>) for applications such as [[oil drilling]]. To supply the developing market, [[Cabot Corporation]] built a production plant in 1997 at the Tanco mine near Bernic Lake in Manitoba, with a capacity of {{convert|12000|oilbbl|m3}} per year of caesium formate solution.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Benton|first1 = William|last2 = Turner| first2 = Jim|year = 2000|title = Cesium formate fluid succeeds in North Sea HPHT field trials|journal = Drilling Contractor|issue = May/June|pages = 38–41|url = http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc-mayjun00/m-cabot.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref> The primary smaller-scale commercial compounds of caesium are [[caesium chloride]] and its [[Caesium nitrate|nitrate]].<ref name="CEC" />

[[File:Kirchhoff Bunsen Roscoe.jpg|thumb|[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] (left) and [[Robert Bunsen]] (center) discovered caesium spectroscopically.| alt= Three middle-aged men, with the one in the middle sitting down. All wear long jackets, and the shorter man on the left has a beard.]]
In 1860, [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] discovered caesium in the [[mineral water]] from [[Bad Dürkheim|Dürkheim]], Germany. Due to the bright blue lines in its [[emission spectrum]], they chose a name derived from the Latin word ''caesius'', meaning sky-blue.<ref group=note>Bunsen quotes [[Aulus Gellius]] [[Aulus Gellius|Noctes Atticae]] II, 26 by [[Nigidius Figulus]]: ''Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.''</ref><ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd Edition</ref><ref name="BuKi1861" /><ref name="Weeks">{{cite journal |title = The discovery of the elements.

To obtain a pure sample of caesium, {{convert|44,000|liters}} of mineral water had to be evaporated to yield {{convert|240|kg}} of concentrated salt solution. The [[alkaline earth metal]]s were precipitated either as sulfates or [[oxalate]]s, leaving the alkali metal in the solution. After conversion to the [[nitrate]]s and extraction with [[ethanol]], a sodium-free mixture was obtained. From this mixture, the lithium was precipitated by [[ammonium carbonate]]. Potassium, rubidium and caesium form insoluble salts with [[chloroplatinic acid]], but these salts show a slight difference in solubility in hot water. Therefore, the less-soluble caesium and rubidium hexachloroplatinate ((Cs,Rb)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>) could be obtained by [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]]. After reduction of the hexachloroplatinate with [[hydrogen]], caesium and rubidium could be separated by the difference in solubility of their carbonates in alcohol. The process yielded {{convert|9.2|g}} of [[rubidium chloride]] and {{convert|7.3|g}} of caesium chloride from the initial 44,000&nbsp;liters of mineral water.<ref name="BuKi1861">{{cite journal |title = Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen |pages = 337–381 |first1 = G.|last1 = Kirchhoff |first2 = R.|last2 = Bunsen|authorlink1 = Gustav Kirchhoff|authorlink2 = Robert Bunsen|doi = 10.1002/andp.18611890702 |journal = [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]] |volume = 189 |issue = 7|year = 1861|bibcode = 1861AnP...189..337K}}</ref>

Historically, the most important use for caesium has been in research and development, primarily in chemical and electrical fields. Very few applications existed for caesium until the 1920s, when it came to be used in radio [[vacuum tube]]s. It had two functions; as a [[getter]], it removed excess oxygen after manufacture, and as a coating on the heated [[cathode]], it increased its [[electrical conductivity]]. Caesium did not become recognized as a high-performance industrial metal until the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Strod|first = A.J.|year = 1957|title = Cesium—A new industrial metal|journal = American Ceramic Bulletin|volume = 36|issue = 6| pages = 212–213}}</ref> Applications of nonradioactive caesium included [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], [[photomultiplier]] tubes, optical components of [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrophotometers]], catalysts for several organic reactions, crystals for [[scintillation counter]]s, and in [[MHD generator|magnetohydrodynamic power generators]].<ref name="USGS" />

Since 1967, the [[International System of Units|International System of Measurements]] has based its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium. The International System of Units (SI) defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the [[Radioactive decay|radiation]], which corresponds to the transition between two [[hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] [[energy level]]s of the [[ground state]] of the caesium-133 [[atom]].<ref name=USNO>{{cite web|title = Cesium Atoms at Work|publisher=Time Service Department—U.S. Naval Observatory—Department of the Navy|url = http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html|accessdate = 2009-12-20}}</ref> The 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures of 1967 defined a second as: "the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of microwave light absorbed or emitted by the hyperfine transition of caesium-133 atoms in their ground state undisturbed by external fields".

==Applications==
===Petroleum exploration===<!-- linked from "Formate" article -->
The largest current end-use of nonradioactive caesium is in [[formate|caesium formate]]-based [[drilling fluid]]s for the [[extractive oil industry]].<ref name="USGS" /> Aqueous solutions of caesium formate (HCOO<sup>–</sup>Cs<sup>+</sup>)—made by reacting caesium hydroxide with [[formic acid]]—were developed in the mid-1990s for use as oil well drilling and [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completion fluids]]. The function of caesium formate as a drilling fluid is to lubricate drill bits, to bring rock cuttings to the surface, and to maintain pressure on the formation during drilling of the well. As completion fluid, which assists the emplacement of control hardware after drilling but prior to production, the function of caesium formate is to maintain the pressure.<ref name="USGS" />

In the two-electrode [[vacuum tube]] converter, it neutralizes the space charge that builds up near the cathode, and in doing so, it enhances the current flow.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Rasor| first1 = Ned S.| first2 = Charles|last2 =Warner| title = Correlation of Emission Processes for Adsorbed Alkali Films on Metal Surfaces| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 35| issue = 9| pages = 2589–2600| date = September 1964|doi = 10.1063/1.1713806|bibcode = 1964JAP....35.2589R}}</ref>

Caesium is also important for its [[Photoelectric effect|photoemissive]] properties by which light energy is converted to electron flow. It is used in [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]] because caesium-based cathodes, such as the intermetallic compound {{chem|K|2|CsSb}}, have low threshold voltage for emission of [[electron]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanelements.com/cs.html |title=Cesium Supplier & Technical Information |publisher=American Elements |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> The range of photoemissive devices using caesium include [[optical character recognition]] devices, [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]], and [[video camera tube]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3215593|title = K <sub>2</sub>CsSb Cathode Development| journal = American Institute of Physics Conference Proceedings |year = 2009|volume = 1149| pages = 1062–1066|first1 =John|last1 = Smedley| first2 =Triveni|last2 = Rao| first3 =Erdong|last3 = Wang}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first = P.|last = Görlich|title = Über zusammengesetzte, durchsichtige Photokathoden|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 101|pages = 335–342|year =1936|doi =10.1007/BF01342330|bibcode = 1936ZPhy..101..335G|issue = 5–6}}</ref> Nevertheless, [[germanium]], rubidium, selenium, silicon, tellurium, and several other elements can substitute caesium in photosensitive materials.<ref name="USGS" />

[[Caesium iodide]] (CsI), [[caesium bromide|bromide]] (CsBr) and caesium fluoride (CsF) crystals are employed for [[scintillator]]s in [[scintillation counter]]s widely used in mineral exploration and particle physics research, as they are well-suited for the detection of [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-ray]] radiation. Caesium, being a heavy element, provides good stopping power, contributing to better detectivity. Caesium compounds may also provide a faster response (CsF) and be less hygroscopic (CsI).

Caesium vapor is used in many common [[magnetometer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00340-005-1773-x|title = Comparison of discharge lamp and laser pumped cesium magnetometers|year = 2005|last1 = Groeger|first1 = S.|first2 = A.

===Centrifugation fluids===
Because of their high density, solutions of caesium chloride, caesium sulfate, and caesium [[trifluoroacetic acid|trifluoroacetate]] ({{chem|Cs(O|2|CCF|3|)}}) are commonly used in molecular biology for density gradient [[Differential centrifugation|ultracentrifugation]].<ref>Manfred Bick, Horst Prinz, "Cesium and Cesium Compounds" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a06 153}}.</ref> This technology is primarily applied to the isolation of [[virus|viral particles]], subcellular [[organelle]]s and fractions, and [[nucleic acid]]s from biological samples.<ref>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=1kn89nI2gUsC&pg=PA61|pages = 61–62|isbn = 978-0-89603-564-5|chapter = Gradient Materials|editor =Desai, Mohamed A.|year = 2000|publisher = Humana Press|location = Totowa, N.J.|title = Downstream processing methods}}</ref>

===Nuclear and isotope applications===
[[Caesium-137]] is a very common [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]] used as a [[gamma ray|gamma]]-emitter in industrial applications. Its advantages include a half-life of roughly 30 years, its availability from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], and having [[Isotopes of barium|<sup>137</sup>Ba]] as stable end product. The high water solubility is a disadvantage which makes it incompatible with large pool irradiators for food and medical supplies.<ref name="Takeshi">{{cite web|url =http://earth1.epa.gov/radiation/docs/source-management/csfinallongtakeshi.pdf|title = The material flow of radioactive cesium-137 in the U.S. 2000|first = Takeshi|last = Okumura|date=2003-10-21|format=PDF| accessdate = 2009-12-20|publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency}}</ref> It has been used in agriculture, cancer treatment, and the [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of food, sewage sludge, and surgical equipment.<ref name="USGS" /><ref>{{cite book|last = Jensen|first = N.

Isotope 137 has also been used in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] studies analogous to those using [[tritium]]. It is a daughter product of nuclear fission reactions. With the commencement of nuclear testing around 1945, and continuing through the mid-1980s, caesium-137 was released into the atmosphere, where it is absorbed readily into solution. Known year-to-year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers. Caesium-134, and to a lesser extent caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology as a measure of caesium output by the nuclear power industry. While they are less prevalent than either caesium-133 or caesium-137, these isotopes have the advantage of being produced solely from anthropogenic sources.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Carol|last=Kendall |url=http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/cs_iig.html |title=Isotope Tracers Project – Resources on Isotopes – Cesium|publisher=National Research Program – U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref><!--http://books.google.com/books?id=pWDQnxd-r1UC&pg=PT360 &pg=PT12 -->

Caesium and mercury were used as a propellant in early [[ion thruster|ion engines]] designed for [[spacecraft propulsion]] on very long interplanetary or extraplanetary missions. The ionization method was to strip the outer electron from the propellant upon contact with a [[tungsten]] electrode that had [[voltage]] applied. Concerns about the corrosive action of caesium on spacecraft components have pushed development in the direction of the use of inert gas propellants, such as [[xenon]]; this is easier to handle in ground-based tests and has less potential to interfere with the spacecraft.<ref name="USGS" /> Eventually, xenon was used in the experimental spacecraft [[Deep Space 1]] launched in 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|doi =10.1063/1.1150468|title =NSTAR Xenon Ion Thruster on Deep Space 1: Ground and flight tests (invited)|year =2000|last1 =Marcucci|first1 =M.

Caesium metal is one of the most reactive elements and is highly [[explosive material|explosive]] when it comes in contact with water. The hydrogen gas produced by the reaction is heated by the thermal energy released at the same time, causing ignition and a violent explosion. This can occur with other alkali metals, but caesium is so potent that this explosive reaction can even be triggered by cold water.<ref name="USGS" /> The [[autoignition temperature]] of caesium is also −116 °C, so it is highly [[pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]], and ignites explosively in air to form [[caesium hydroxide]] and various oxides. Caesium hydroxide is a very strong [[base (chemistry)|base]], and will rapidly corrode glass.<ref name=RSC>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/55/caesium|accessdate=2010-09-27|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|title=Chemical Data – Caesium – Cs}}</ref>

The [[isotope]]s [[Caesium-134|134]] and 137 are present in the [[biosphere]] in small amounts from human activities and represent a radioactivity burden which varies depending on location. Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products (such as radioiodine and radiostrontium). About 10% of absorbed radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine.
