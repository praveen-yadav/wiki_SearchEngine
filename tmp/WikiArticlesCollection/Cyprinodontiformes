The '''Cyprinodontiformes''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|aɪ|p|r|ɨ|n|ɵ|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|t|ɨ|ˈ|f|ɔr|m|iː|z}} is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], comprising mostly small, fresh-water fish.  Many popular aquarium fish, such as [[killifish]] and [[Poeciliidae|live-bearers]], are included.  They are closely related to the [[Atheriniformes]] and are occasionally included with them.  A colloquial term for the order as a whole is '''toothcarps''', though they are not actually close relatives of the true [[carp]]s &ndash; the latter belong to the [[superorder]] [[Ostariophysi]], while the toothcarps are [[Acanthopterygii]].

The families of Cyprinodontiformes can be divided into three groups: [[Vivipary|viviparous]] and [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] (all species give [[Live birth (human)|live birth]]), and [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (all species egg-laying). The live-bearing groups differ in whether the young are carried to term within (ovoviviparous) or without (viviparous) an enclosing eggshell. [[Phylogenetical]]ly however, one of the two [[suborders]] &ndash; the [[Aplocheiloidei]] &ndash; contains oviparous species exclusively, as do two of the four [[superfamilies]] of the other suborder (the [[Cyprinodontoidea]] and [[Valencioidea]] of the [[Cyprinodontoidei]]). Vivipary and ovovivipary have [[evolved]] independently from oviparous ancestors, the latter possibly twice.

Members of this order are notable for inhabiting harsh environments, such as [[saline water|saline]] or very warm waters, water of poor quality, or isolated situations where no other types of fish occur. They are typically [[omnivore]]s, and often live near the surface, where the oxygen-rich water compensates for environmental disadvantages.

They are small to medium fish, with small mouths, large eyes, a single [[dorsal fin]], and a rounded [[caudal fin]]. The largest species is the cuatro ojos (''[[Anableps dowi]]''), which measures {{convert|34|cm|in}}<ref>http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Anableps+dowi&flags=col3:&res=320</ref> in length, while the smallest, the least killifish (''[[Heterandria formosa]]''), is just {{convert|8|mm|in}} long as an adult.<ref name=EoF>{{cite book |editor=Paxton, J.R. & Eschmeyer, W.N.|author= Parenti, Lynne R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 148–151|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}</ref>
