'''Claude Monet''' ({{IPA-fr|klod mɔnɛ|lang}} or {{IPA-fr|mɔne|}}; 14 November 1840{{spaced ndash}}5 December 1926) was a founder of French [[impressionism|impressionist]] painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to [[plein-air]] [[landscape painting]].<ref>House, John, et al.: ''Monet in the 20th century'', page 2, Yale University Press, 1998.</ref><ref Name=giverny>{{cite web|url=http://giverny.org/monet/biograph/ |title=Claude MONET biography |publisher=Giverny.org |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' (''Impression, soleil levant'').

==Early life==
Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the 5th floor of 45 [[rue Laffitte]], in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref name="Tucker5">P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p. 5</ref> He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians. On 20 May 1841, he was baptized in the local parish church, [[Notre-Dame de Lorette (church in Paris)|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]], as Oscar-Claude, but his parents called him simply Oscar.<ref name="Tucker5" /><ref>S. Patin, ''Monet "un œil&nbsp;... mais bon Dieu, quel œil !", Collection Découverte Gallimard. p. 14.</ref> (He signed his juvenilia "O.&nbsp;Monet".) Despite being baptized Catholic, Monet later on became an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Monet, Narcissus, and Self-Reflection: The Modernist Myth of the Self|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226475431|page=66|author=Steven Z.

It's not clear, and probably not consciously intended by the atheist Claude Monet, but somehow the suggestion of a Cross lies there on her body.}}</ref>

In 1845, his family moved to [[Le Havre]] in Normandy. His father wanted him to go into the family grocery business, but Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a singer.

On 1 April 1851, Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts. Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty [[franc]]s. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from [[Jacques-François Ochard]], a former student of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. On the beaches of Normandy in about 1856/1857, he met fellow artist [[Eugène Boudin]], who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet "[[en plein air]]" (outdoor) techniques for painting.<ref Name=guggenheim>[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html Biography for Claude Monet] Guggenheim Collection. Retrieved 6 January 2007.</ref> Both received the influence of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]].

On 28 January 1857, his mother died. At the age of sixteen, he left school and went to live with his widowed childless aunt, Marie-Jeanne Lecadre.

When Monet traveled to Paris to visit the [[Louvre]], he witnessed painters copying from the old masters. Having brought his paints and other tools with him, he would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Monet was in Paris for several years and met other young painters who would become friends and fellow impressionists; among them was [[Édouard Manet]].

In June 1861, Monet joined the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry in [[Algeria]] for a seven-year commitment, but, two years later, after he had contracted typhoid fever, his aunt intervened to get him out of the army if he agreed to complete an art course at an art school. It is possible that the Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], whom Monet knew, may have prompted his aunt on this matter. Disillusioned with the traditional art taught at art schools, in 1862 Monet became a student of [[Charles Gleyre]] in Paris, where he met [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]] and [[Alfred Sisley]]. Together they shared new approaches to art, painting the effects of light ''[[en plein air]]'' with broken color and rapid brushstrokes, in what later came to be known as [[Impressionism]].

Monet's ''Camille'' or ''The Woman in the Green Dress'' (''La femme à la robe verte''), painted in 1866, brought him recognition and was one of many works featuring his future wife, [[Camille Doncieux]]; she was the model for the figures in ''[[Women in the Garden]]'' of the following year, as well as for ''On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt'', 1868, pictured here. Camille became pregnant and gave birth to their first child, Jean in 1867.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110003101 |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref>

==Franco-Prussian War, Impressionism, and Argenteuil==
After the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (19 July 1870), Monet took refuge in England in September 1870,<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/ Monet, Claude] Nicolas Pioch, www.ibiblio.org, 19 September 2002. Retrieved 6 January 2007.</ref> where he studied the works of [[John Constable]] and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], both of whose landscapes would serve to inspire Monet's innovations in the study of color. In the spring of 1871, Monet's works were refused authorisation for inclusion in the Royal Academy exhibition.<ref name = "Stuckey">Charles Stuckey "Monet, a Retrospective", Hugh Lauter Levin Associates, 195</ref>

In May 1871, he left London to live in [[Zaandam]], in the [[Netherlands]],<ref name = "Stuckey"/> where he made twenty-five paintings (and the police suspected him of revolutionary activities).<ref>The texts of seven police reports, written on 2 June – 9 October 1871 are included in ''Monet in Holland'', the catalog of an exhibition in the Amsterdam [[Van Gogh Museum]] (1986).</ref> He also paid a first visit to nearby [[Amsterdam]]. In October or November 1871, he returned to France. Monet lived from December 1871 to 1878 at [[Argenteuil]], a village on the right bank of the [[Seine]] river near Paris, and a popular Sunday-outing destination for Parisians, where he painted some of his best known works. In 1874, he briefly returned to Holland.<ref>His paintings are shown and discussed here [http://www.livius.org/a/netherlands/amsterdam-monet/amsterdam-monet.html].</ref>

In 1872, he painted ''[[Impression, Sunrise]] (Impression, soleil levant)'' depicting a [[Le Havre]] port landscape. It hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and is now displayed in the [[Musée Marmottan Monet]] in Paris. From the painting's title, art critic [[Louis Leroy]] coined the term "[[Impressionism]]", which he intended as disparagement but which the Impressionists appropriated for themselves.<ref>[http://www.artinthepicture.com/styles/Impressionism/ Impressionism – Overview] ARTinthePICTURE.com. Retrieved 6 January 2007.</ref> Also in this exhibition was a painting titled ''Boulevard des Capucines'', a painting of [[Boulevard des Capucines|the boulevard]] done from the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar's]] apartment at no. 35. There were, however, two paintings by Monet of the boulevard: one is now in the [[Pushkin Museum]] in Moscow, the other in the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. It has never become clear which painting appeared in the groundbreaking 1874 exhibition, though more recently the Moscow picture has been favoured.<ref>Kennedy, Ian. [http://apollo-magazine.co.uk/march-2007/66398/monets-boulevard-des-capucines.thtml "Kansas city or Moscow?"], ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo]]'', 1 March 2007. Retrieved on 8 June 2009.</ref>

Monet and Camille Doncieux had married just before the war (28 June 1870)<ref name = "Stuckey"/> and, after their excursion to London and Zaandam, they had moved to Argenteuil, in December 1871. It was during this time that Monet painted various works of modern life. Camille became ill in 1876. They had a second son, Michel, on 17 March 1878, (Jean was born in 1867). This second child weakened her already fading health. In that same year, Monet moved to the village of [[Vétheuil]]. On 5 September 1879, Camille Monet died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of thirty-two; Monet painted her on her death bed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artelino.com/articles/la_japonaise.asp |title=La Japonaise |publisher=artelino |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>http://members.aol.com/wwjohnston/camille.htm</ref>

Monet believed that his art was forward-looking and based on a scientific study of nature. Or at least this is what he began by believing and never renounced. The degree of sublimation involved in such a belief is poignantly demonstrated by the story of the painting he made of Camille on her death bed. She died in 1879, aged thirty-two. Many years later, Monet confessed to his friend Clementceau that his need to analyse colours was both the joy and torment of his life. He explained, ''I one day found myself looking at my beloved wife's dead face and just systematically noting the colours according to an automatic reflex!'' Without doubt the confession was sincere, yet the evidence of the painting is quite otherwise: A blizzard of white, grey, purplish paint blows across the pillows of the bed, a terrible blizzard of loss which will forever efface her features. In fact there can be very few death-bed paintings which have been so intensely felt or subjectively expressive.  And yet to this—the consequence of his own painting—Monet was apparently blind.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berger|first=John|title=The Eyes of Claude Monet from Sense of Sight|year=1985|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-73722-7|pages=194–195}}</ref>

==Later life==
[[File:Clémentel monet in seinen gaerten 20008 1.jpg|thumb|''Claude Monet, in his garden'', by Étienne Clémentel, c. 1917]]
[[File:Monet in Garden, New York Times, 1922.JPG|thumb|Monet, right, in his garden at [[Giverny]], 1922]]
After several difficult months following the death of Camille in September 1879, a grief-stricken Monet (resolving never to be mired in poverty again) began in earnest to create some of his best paintings of the 19th century. During the early 1880s, Monet painted several groups of landscapes and seascapes in what he considered to be campaigns to document the French countryside. His extensive campaigns evolved into his series' paintings.

[[Camille Doncieux|Camille Monet]] had become ill with tuberculosis in 1876. Pregnant with her second child, she gave birth to Michel Monet in March 1878. In 1878 the Monets temporarily moved into the home of [[Ernest Hoschedé]], (1837–1891), a wealthy department store owner and patron of the arts. Both families then shared a house in [[Vétheuil]] during the summer. After her husband ([[Ernest Hoschedé]]) became bankrupt, and left in 1878 for Belgium, and after the death of Camille Monet in September 1879, and while Monet continued to live in the house in Vétheuil; [[Alice Hoschedé]] (1844–1911), helped Monet to raise his two sons, Jean and Michel, by taking them to Paris to live alongside her own six children.<ref name="monetalia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.monetalia.com/biography.aspx |title=Biography of Oscar-Claude Monet, The Life and Work of Claude Monet |publisher=Monetalia.com |date= |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> They were [[Blanche Hoschedé Monet]], (she eventually married Jean Monet), Germaine, [[Suzanne Hoschedé]], Marthe, Jean-Pierre, and Jacques. In the spring of 1880, Alice Hoschedé and all the children left Paris and rejoined Monet still living in the house in Vétheuil.<ref>Charles Merrill Mount, ''Monet a biography,'' [[Simon and Schuster]] publisher, copyright 1966, pp.309–322.</ref> In 1881, all of them moved to [[Poissy]], which Monet hated. In April 1883, looking out the window of the little train between Vernon and Gasny, he discovered Giverny.<ref name="monetalia1"/><ref name="giverny1">{{cite web|url=http://giverny.org/giverny/ |title=Monet's Village |publisher=Giverny |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>Charles Merrill Mount, ''Monet a biography,'' [[Simon and Schuster]] publisher, copyright 1966, p326.</ref> They then moved to [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]], then to a house in [[Giverny]] in Normandy, where he planted a large garden and where he painted for much of the rest of his life. Following the death of her estranged husband, Alice Hoschedé married Claude Monet in 1892.<ref name="guggenheim"/>

==Giverny==
[[File:'Port-Goulphar, Belle-Île', oil on canvas painting by Claude Monet, 1887, Art Gallery of New South Wales.jpg|thumb|''Port-Goulphar, [[Belle Île]]'', 1887, [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]]]
At the beginning of May 1883, Monet and his large family rented a house and {{convert|2|acre|m2}} from a local landowner. The house was situated near the main road between the towns of [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]] and Gasny at [[Giverny]]. There was a barn that doubled as a painting studio, orchards and a small garden. The house was close enough to the local schools for the children to attend and the surrounding landscape offered many suitable motifs for Monet's work. The family worked and built up the gardens and Monet's fortunes began to change for the better as his dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] had increasing success in selling his paintings. By November 1890, Monet was prosperous enough to buy the house, the surrounding buildings and the land for his gardens. During the 1890s, Monet built a greenhouse and a second studio, a spacious building well lit with skylights. Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s through the end of his life in 1926, Monet worked on "series" paintings, in which a subject was depicted in varying light and weather conditions. His first series exhibited as such was of [[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]], painted from different points of view and at different times of the day. Fifteen of the paintings were exhibited at the [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Galerie Durand-Ruel]] in 1891. He later produced several series of paintings including: ''[[Rouen Cathedral (Monet)|Rouen Cathedral]],'' ''[[Poplar Series (Monet)|Poplars]],'' the ''[[London Parliament (Monet)|Parliament]],'' ''Mornings on the Seine,'' and the ''[[Water Lilies]]''  that were painted on his property at Giverny.

Monet was fond of painting controlled nature: his own gardens in Giverny, with its [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]], pond, and bridge. He also painted up and down the banks of the Seine, producing paintings such as ''Break-up of the ice on the Seine''. He wrote daily instructions to his gardener, precise designs and layouts for plantings, and invoices for his floral purchases and his collection of botany books. As Monet's wealth grew, his garden evolved. He remained its architect, even after he hired seven gardeners.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/getaways/europe/articles/2007/05/20/monets_gardens_a_draw_to_giverny_and_to_his_art/|title=Monet's gardens a draw to Giverny and to his art|publisher=Globe Correspondents|date=20 May 2007|accessdate=13 October 2008 | first=Robert | last=Garrett}}</ref>

Between 1883 and 1908, Monet traveled to the [[Mediterranean]], where he painted landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes, such as ''Bordighera''. He painted an important series of paintings in [[Venice, Italy]], and in London he painted two important series—views of [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] and views of Charing Cross Bridge. His second wife, Alice, died in 1911 and his oldest son Jean, who had married Alice's daughter Blanche, Monet's particular favourite, died in 1914.<ref name="guggenheim"/> After Alice died, Blanche looked after and cared for Monet. It was during this time that Monet began to develop the first signs of [[cataract]]s.<ref>Forge, Andrew, and Gordon, Robert, ''Monet'', page 224. Harry N. Abrams, 1989.</ref>

During [[World War I]], in which his younger son Michel served and his friend and admirer [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] led the French nation, Monet painted a series of [[Salix babylonica|weeping willow]] trees as homage to the French fallen soldiers. In 1923, he underwent two operations to remove his cataracts: the paintings done while the cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone, which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. It may also be that after surgery he was able to see certain [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by the lens of the eye; this may have had an effect on the colors he perceived. After his operations he even repainted some of these paintings, with bluer water lilies than before.<ref>[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/medicalscience/story/0,9837,724257,00.html Let the light shine in] Guardian News, 30 May 2002.

==Death==
[[File:Claude Monet 038.jpg|thumb|''[[Water Lilies]]'', 1920–1926, [[Musée de l'Orangerie]]]]
Monet died of lung cancer on 5 December 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the [[Giverny]] church cemetery.<ref name="giverny1"/> Monet had insisted that the occasion be simple; thus only about fifty people attended the ceremony.<ref>P. Tucker ''Claude Monet: Life and Art'', p.224</ref>

His home, garden and waterlily pond were bequeathed by his son Michel, his only heir, to the French Academy of Fine Arts (part of the [[Institut de France]]) in 1966. Through the ''Fondation Claude Monet'', the house and gardens were opened for visits in 1980, following restoration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-monet.fr/uk/?q=content/historical-record |title=Historical record |publisher=Fondation-monet.fr |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> In addition to souvenirs of Monet and other objects of his life, the house contains his collection of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese woodcut prints]]. The house is one of the two main attractions of [[Giverny]], which hosts tourists from all over the world.

In October 2013, Monet's paintings, ''L' Eglise de Vetheuil'' and ''Le Bassin aux Nymphease'', are subjects of a legal case in New York against NY-based Vilma Bautista, one-time aide to [[Imelda Marcos]],<ref>[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/88049/ex-imelda-marcos-aide-on-trial-in-nyc-for-selling-monet-work Ex-Imelda Marcos aide on trial in NYC for selling Monet work] inquirer.net, 17 October 2013.

==Monet forgery discovered==
On 14 February 2008, the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] in [[Cologne]], Germany announced that ''On the Banks of the Seine by Port-Villez'', attributed to Claude Monet, was a [[Art forgery|forgery]]. The discovery was made when the painting was examined by restorers prior to an upcoming Impressionism exhibition. [[X-ray]] and [[infrared]] testing revealed that a "colorless substance" had been applied to the canvas to make it appear older. The picture was acquired by the museum in 1954. The museum, which will keep the forgery, still has five authentic Monet paintings in its collection.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jVxW8AFhmjVkdIHZYB64fOsqnkrQ German museum discovers prized Monet is a fake]</ref>
