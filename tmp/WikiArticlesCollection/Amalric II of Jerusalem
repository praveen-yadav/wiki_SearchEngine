'''Aimery of Jerusalem''' or '''Aimery of Cyprus''', born '''Aimery of Lusignan''' (1145 –  1 April 1205), [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] 1197–1205, was an older brother of [[Guy of Lusignan]].<ref name="crusades-en">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Gerish | first = Deborah | title = Aimery of Lusignan | editor = Alan V.

Note: Older scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers: Amalric I, r. 1163-1174 and Amalric II, r. 1197-1205. Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king: Amalric, r. 1163-1174 and Aimery, r. 1197-1205.

The [[Lusignan family]] was noted for its many Crusaders. Aimery and Guy were sons of [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]], who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the 1160s. After being expelled from [[Poitou]] by their overlord, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]], for the murder of [[Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], Aimery arrived in Palestine c. 1174, Guy possibly later. Aimery married [[Eschive d'Ibelin (1160–1196)|Eschiva]], daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]]. He then took service with [[Agnes of Courtenay]], wife of [[Reginald of Sidon]] and mother of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]]. The pro-Ibelin ''Chronicle of [[Ernoul]]'' later claimed that he was her lover, but it is likely that she and Baldwin IV were attempting to separate him from the political influence of his wife's family. He was appointed [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|Constable of Jerusalem]] soon after 22 April 1179. Guy married the king's widowed older sister, [[Sibylla of Jerusalem]] in 1180, and so gained a claim to the kingdom of Jerusalem.

Aimery was among those captured with his brother after the disastrous [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187. In 1194, on the death of Guy, he became [[Kingdom of Cyprus|King of Cyprus]]. By his first wife, Eschiva of Ibelin, he was the father of [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] and was crowned in [[Nicosia]] on 22 September 1197. After Eschiva's death in October 1197 he married [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], the daughter of [[Amalric of Jerusalem]] by his second marriage, and became [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] in right of his wife and was crowned at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in January 1198. This was only possible, because the candidacy for the crown of Aimery, who was a  [[vassal]] of Roman-German Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI.]], was supported by the German crusaders.

In 1198, at the end of the [[Crusade of 1197]], he was able to procure a five years' truce with the [[Muslim]]s, owing to the struggle between [[Saladin]]'s brothers and his sons for the inheritance of his territories. The truce was disturbed by raids on both sides, but in 1204 it was renewed for six years.

Many members of the royal family died in rapid succession in early 1205, including Aimery himself.  Aimery's two older sons, Guy and John, boys of about eight years of age, died early in 1205.  Aimery died of dysentery (allegedly brought on by "a surfeit of white mullet") or even poisoned at [[Saint Jean d'Acre]] on 1 April 1205, just after his son Aimery and four days before his wife, and was buried at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Saint Sophia]], Nicosia.  The kingdom of Cyprus passed to [[Hugh I of Cyprus|Hugh]], his only surviving son, while the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] passed to [[Maria of Montferrat|Maria]], the daughter of Isabella by her previous marriage with [[Conrad of Montferrat]].
