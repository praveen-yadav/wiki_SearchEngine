'''Craven Cottage''' is the name of a football [[stadium]] located in [[Fulham]], [[London]]. It has been the home ground of the [[Premier League]] club [[Fulham F.C.]] since 1896.<ref name="officialwebsite" />

==History==

===Pre-Fulham===
[[File:Craven Cottage LH4736.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Craven Cottage on the banks of the [[River Thames]] as it looks today]]
The original 'Cottage' was built in 1780, by [[William Craven, 6th Baron Craven|William Craven]], the sixth [[Baron Craven]]<ref name="placeinhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/may/20/a-place-in-history |title=A Place In History |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=20 May 2011|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> and was located on the centre circle of the pitch. At the time, the surrounding areas were woods which made up part of [[Anne Boleyn]]'s hunting grounds.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> Several other sports may have taken place here, such as [[lawn bowls]], [[croquet]] and possibly a version of the [[Aztec]] game called '[[tlachtli]]' (scoring a ball through a hoop using your hips). This game is thought to be a distant cousin of association football and is arguably one of the earliest codes of organised football.

The Cottage was lived in by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]<ref name="placeinhistory" /> (who wrote ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Pompeii-Dodo-Press/dp/1406521647 |title=The Last Days of Pompeii | first=Edward | last=Bulwer-Lytton |publisher=''Dodo Press'' |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>) and other somewhat notable (and moneyed) persons<ref name="placeinhistory" /> until it was destroyed by fire in May 1888.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> Many rumours persist among Fulham fans of past tenants of Craven Cottage. [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]],   [[Jeremy Bentham]],  [[Florence Nightingale]] and even [[Queen Victoria]] are reputed to have stayed there, although there is no real evidence for this. Following the fire, the site was abandoned.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> Fulham had had 8 previous grounds<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/july/01/moments-that-made-ffc |title=50 Moments That Made Fulham: 10. The Formation of the Club - 1879 |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=1 July 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> before settling in at Craven Cottage for good. Therefore, The Cottagers have had 12 grounds overall (including a temporary stay at [[Loftus Road]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/september/11/top-10-loftus-road-matches |title=Top 10: Loftus Road Matches |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=11 September 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>), meaning that only their former 'landlords' and rivals [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] have had more home grounds (14) in British football. Of particular note, was [[Ranelagh House]], Fulham's palatial home from 1886–1888.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.derelictlondon.com/londons-long-lost-sports-grounds.html |title=London's Long Lost Sports Grounds |publisher=Derelict London |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>

===Under construction: 1894–1905===
[[File:Rabbit Hutch at the Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The 'Rabbit Hutch' stand along Stevenage Road before [[Archibald Leitch]]'s redesign in 1904-5]]
When representatives of Fulham first came across the land, in 1894, it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> A deal was struck for the owners of the ground to carry out the work, in return for which they would receive a proportion of the gate receipts.<ref name="placeinhistory" />

The first football match at which there were any gate receipts was when Fulham played against Minerva in the [[Middlesex Senior Cup]], on 10 October 1896.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> The ground's first stand was built shortly after.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> Described as looking like an "orange box", it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats, and later was affectionately nicknamed the "rabbit hutch".<ref name="placeinhistory" />

In 1904 [[London County Council]] became concerned with the level of safety at the ground, and tried to get it closed.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> A court case followed in January 1905, as a result of which [[Archibald Leitch]], a Scottish [[architect]] who had risen to prominence after his building of the [[Ibrox Stadium]], a few years earlier,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=93&Itemid=128 |title=Archibald Leitch - 'Engineering Archie': The Designer of Ibrox |publisher=The Rangers Archive |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> was hired to work on the stadium.<ref name="placeinhistory" /> In a scheme costing £15,000<ref name="placeinhistory" /> (a record for the time<ref name="Terrace">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19009781 |title=Fulham's plans to increase Craven Cottage capacity approved |publisher=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>), he built a pavilion (the present-day 'Cottage' itself<ref name="placeinhistory" />) and the Stevenage Road Stand,<ref name="placeinhistory" /> in his characteristic [[red brick]] style.<ref name="placeinhistory" />

The stand on Stevenage Road celebrated its centenary in the 2005–2006 season<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2005/august/15/stevenage-road-centenary |title=Stevenage Road Centenary |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=15 August 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> and, following the death of Fulham FC's favourite son, former England captain [[Johnny Haynes]], in a car accident in October 2005<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353732.stm |title=Legendary Haynes dies after crash |publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 October 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> the Stevenage Road Stand was renamed the Johnny Haynes Stand after the club sought the opinions of Fulham supporters.<ref name="Haynes">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4480816.stm |title=Fulham re-name stand after Haynes |publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 November 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Fulham Football Club - geograph.org.uk - 577777.jpg|thumb|right|The facade of the Johnny Haynes stand]]
Both the Johnny Haynes Stand and Cottage remain among the finest examples of [[Archibald Leitch]] football architecture to remain in existence and both have been designated as Grade II listed buildings.<ref name="officialwebsite" />

===Establishing itself as a stadium===
An [[England national football team|England]] v [[Wales national football team|Wales]] match was played at the ground in 1907,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=90 |title=England 1 - 1 Wales |publisher=England Stats |date=18 March 1907|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/englandmatchreports/090-wales-1907 |title=England 1 - 1 Wales |publisher=England Match Reports |date=18 March 1907|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> followed by a [[rugby league]] international between [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in 1911.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1911/game-7/england-vs-australia.html |title=England 6 lost to Australia 11 |publisher=The Rugby League Project |date=18 October 2011|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>

One of the club's directors [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]], and his friend William Hall, took over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the early 1910s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/laying-the-foundations/club-moves-from-woolwich-to-highbury |title=Club moves from Woolwich to Highbury |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=16 December 2008|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> the plan being to merge Fulham with Arsenal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/arsenal-stadium-highbury/arsenal-stadium-a-history |title=Highbury - A history |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=14 July 2008|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> to form a "London superclub" at Craven Cottage.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IcsXyTmY7MoC&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=ARSENAL+FULHAM+%E2%80%9CLONDON+SUPERCLUB%E2%80%9D&source=bl&ots=DM3r1GUKu3&sig=BbYTd_0Gmk1w80UEAqnyAdGwAgg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qVOLUsnLAtPN7AadyYHADw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=ARSENAL%20FULHAM%20%E2%80%9CLONDON%20SUPERCLUB%E2%80%9D&f=false |title=Rebels for the Cause: The Alternative History of Arsenal Football Club | first=Jon | last=Spurling |publisher=Random House |date=2 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> This move was largely motivated by Fulham's failure thus far to gain promotion to the top division of English football. There were also plans for Henry Norris to build a larger stadium on the other side of Stevenage Road but there was little need after the merger idea failed. During this era, the Cottage was used for choir singing and marching bands along with other performances, and Mass.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs0LBqzEDIM&feature=relmfu</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKDAASBY8yE&feature=relmfu</ref>

In 1933 there were plans to demolish the ground and start again from scratch with a new 80,000 capacity stadium. These plans never materialised mainly due to the [[Great Depression]].

On 8 October 1938, 49,335 spectators watched Fulham play [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref name="ESPN" /> During the 1930-60's era, Fulham often averaged over 25,000. However, the official attendances can be considered somewhat dubious in this era as many fans would get in by climbing over the fence from Bishops Park into the Putney End. As at many other grounds, fans would sometimes pay at the turnstiles but not be counted.  This [[Boot money scandal|boot money]] would be given to the players (stuffed in their boots) and would not be counted in the gate money. The ground hosted several football games for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] pp. 45–6.</ref>

===Post-War===

It wasn't until after Fulham first reached the top division, in 1949, that further improvements were made to the stadium. In 1962 Fulham became the final side in the first division to erect floodlights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/august/22/throwback-thursday |title=1962: Cook Lights Up The Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=22 August 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> The floodlights were said to be the most expensive in Europe at the time as they were so modern. The lights were like large pylons towering 50 metres over the ground and were similar in appearance to those at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]]. An electronic scoreboard was installed on the Riverside Terrace at the same time as the floodlights were installed and flagpoles flying the flags of all of the other first division teams were flown from them.<ref name="pies">{{cite web |url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/fulham/171403/the-black-and-white-years-scorching-vintage-photos-of-fulhams-craven-cottage-between-1923-1978.html |title=The Black-And-White Years: Scorching Vintage Photos Of Fulham’s Craven Cottage, Between 1923-1978 | first=Chris | last=Wright |publisher=Who Ate All The Pies? |date=30 July 2013|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> Following the sale of Alan Mullery to Tottenham Hotspur in 1964 (for £72,500) the Hammersmith End had a roof put over it<ref name="roof">{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fulham-go-from-laughing-stock-to-serious-players-1947790.html |title=Fulham go from laughing stock to serious players | first=Steve | last=Tongue |publisher=''Independent'' |date=18 April 2010|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> at a cost of approximately £42,500.

This helped his Fulham team to beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] 10–1 (a club record).<ref>Three minutes is the time quoted by [http://web.archive.org/web/20090325201135/http://www.grahamleggatsoccer.com/memories.htm his official website].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article6235.ece/BINARY/Fulham+10-1+Ipswich |title=Ten for The 'Turkeys' | first=Bill | last=Holden |publisher=''Daily Mirror'' |date=27 December 1963|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> The international record is held by [[Jimmy O'Connor]], an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] player who notched up his hat trick in 2 minutes 14 seconds in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/3485294.stm |title=Hayter keeps feet on ground | first=Mark | last=Mitchener |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2004|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref>

On 27 July 2012, Fulham FC were granted permission to redevelop the Riverside Stand, increasing the capacity of Craven Cottage to 30,000 seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11681/7939236/Cottage-expansion-granted |title=Cottage expansion granted |publisher=''Sky Sports'' |date=27 July 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/october/08/fulham-forever</ref> Beforehand various rumours arose including plans to return to ground-sharing with QPR in a new 40,000 seater White City stadium,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2370480/Fayed-scheme-for-Fulham-switch-to-new-White-City-stadium.html |title=Fayed scheme for Fulham switch to new White City stadium | first=Mihir | last=Bose |publisher=''Daily Telegraph'' |date=1 January 2004|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3774/the-sweeper/2012/01/28/2869994/the-sweeper-fulham-approached-by-qpr-about-interest-in-sharing-a- |title=The Sweeper: Fulham approached by QPR about interest in sharing a new stadium | first=Wayne | last=Versey |publisher=goal.com |date=28 January 2012|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> although these now appear firmly on hold with the construction of the [[Westfield London|Westfield]] shopping centre on the proposed site. The board seem to have moved away from their grandiose ideas of making Fulham the "Manchester United of the south" as Al-Fayed has come to realise how expensive it is to subsidise a Premiership outfit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/08/premier-league-preview-fulham |title=Premier League preview No7: Fulham | first=Paul | last=Doyle |publisher=''Guardian'' |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> Yet Fulham's comfortable Premier League table positions in the previous years and the fact that, for the previous three seasons the ground has been filled to capacity, means stadium expansion is a viable option. With large spaces of land at a premium in south-west London, Fulham appear to be committed to a gradual increase of the ground's capacity often during the summer between seasons. The capacity of Craven Cottage has been increased during summers for instance in 2008 with a small increase in the capacity of the Hammersmith End. Fulham previously announced in 2007 that they are planning to increase the capacity of Craven Cottage by 4000 seats,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120421203942/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx |archivedate=21 April 2012 |title=Stadium Announcement |publisher= Fulham F.C.|date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> but this is yet to be implemented.  There was also proposals for a bridge to span the Thames, for a redeveloped Riverside stand and a museum.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Model_of_proposed_bridge.jpg</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jan/17/newsstory.sport8?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Kelso | title=Development at Craven Cottage to include museum | date=17 January 2003}}</ref>

More substantial plans arose in October 2011 with the 'Fulham Forever' campaign.<ref>http://www.fulhamfc.com/stadium-development</ref> With Al-Fayed selling his [[Harrods]] department store for £1.5 billion in May 2010<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8669657.stm |title=Mohammed Al Fayed sells Harrods store to Qatar Holdings|publisher=BBC News|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> it is reasonable to presume that some of this money which has kick-started this larger scale plan into life. A detailed plan into the possibilities of expansion highlighted the Riverside Stand as the only viable area for expansion. The scheme involves the demolition of the back of the Riverside Stand with a new tier of seating added on top of the current one and a row of corporate boxes; bringing Craven Cottage up to 30,000 capacity.<ref>http://www.stadiumguide.com/fulham-and-brighton-push-for-stadium-expansion/</ref> As this would be a major project in a sensitive area the club has taken into consideration many points local residents may have problems with. The riverside walk would be re-opened, light pollution would be reduced with the removal of floodlight masts, new access points would make match-day crowds more manageable and the new stand would be respectful in design to its position on the River Thames. Although there is no time scheme for when the project will begin, the club is already far into the consultation phase and it appeared would like to begin soon during 2012-13.<ref>http://www.fulhamfc.com/stadium-development/construction-phase</ref> Buckingham Group Contracting were chosen in March 2013 as the construction company for the project.<ref>http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2013/03/12/buckingham-set-to-score-with-15m-fulham-refurb/</ref>

==The ground as it stands==

===Hammersmith End===
[[File:The Hammersmith End - Fulham FC, SW6 - geograph.org.uk - 934070.jpg|thumb|right|The Hammy End]]
The [[Hammersmith]] End (or Hammy) is the northernmost stand in the ground, the closest to Hammersmith. The roofing was financed through the sale of [[Alan Mullery]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]].<ref name="roof" /> It is traditionally the "home" end where the more vocal Fulham fans sit,<ref name="terrace">{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/help/faq/a-to-z-reference-guides |title=A to Z Reference Guides |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref><ref name="visiting">{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/help/faq/visiting-the-cottage |title=Visiting The Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> and many stand during games at the back rows of the stand. If Fulham win the toss, they usually choose to play towards the Hammersmith End in the second half. The stand had terracing until the reopening of the ground in 2004, when it was replaced with seating in order to comply with league rules following the [[Taylor Report]].<ref name="terrace" /> For several seasons, national flags of the players represented at Fulham were hung from the roof.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fulham_v_Pompey_(1).JPG#file |title=File:Fulham v Pompey (1).JPG |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> There is a large permanent banner in the river corner reading "We Are Fulham".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cravencottagenewsround.wordpress.com/2008/03/01/slouching-towards-cheltenham-fulham-0-3-manchester-utd/ |title=Slouching towards Cheltenham: Fulham 0-3 Manchester Utd |publisher=Craven Cottage Newsround |date=1 March 2008|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>

===Putney End===
The [[Putney]] End is the southernmost stand in the ground, nearest to [[Putney]] and backing onto Bishops Park.  This generally hosts visiting and 'neutral' supporters,<ref name="visiting" /> though often this is mixed with home and away fans. When the ground became redeveloped, with the standing terraces replaced in 2003-4 the club applied for a licence to have a designated neutral area, in the rows closest to the Cottage, (nicknamed 'Little Switzerland'.<ref>http://bryanprzybilla.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/a-reminder-of-the-past-craven-cottage-brings-out-the-old-time-feel/</ref>) Due to Fulham's history of having no segregation in the Putney End and no history of crowd trouble the FA gave the club special dispensation to allow for this, making Fulham is the only club currently in the UK to have such an area.<ref name="Shoot">{{cite web |url=http://www.shoot.co.uk/stadium-special-4/ |title=Stadium special| first=George | last=Preece |publisher=''Shoot'' |date=17 September 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> Flags of every nationality in the Fulham squad were hung from the roofing, although they were removed after the 2006–07 season commenced and there is now an electronic scoreboard in place. There is a plane tree in the corner by the river,<ref name="tree">{{cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/epltalk/304406352/ |title=Tree at Craven Cottage | first=The | last=Gaffer |publisher=Flickr |date=23 November 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> the only remaining tree in a senior British football ground.<ref name="Shoot" />

===Riverside Stand===
[[File:Boat Race Craven Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The current Riverside Stand beside the [[River Thames]]]]
The Riverside was originally terracing that backed onto the Thames.<ref name="pies" /> It also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans.<ref name="pies" /> By 1973, a proper seated stand had been built called the [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]] Stand (one of the directors at the time).<ref name="Miller" /> The stand was opened in a prestigious friendly against [[S.L. Benfica]], who included [[Eusebio]] in the team.<ref name="Benfica"/> The name of the stand became called simply The Riverside after the discovery of Eric Miller's suicide, who had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement.<ref name="Herald" />

The Riverside Stand backs onto the [[River Thames]]<ref name="pies" /><ref name="visiting" /> and is elevated uniquely above the pitch<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webzoom.freewebs.com/questforthe92/Fulham%20-%20Riverside%20Stand.JPG |title=Fulham - Riverside Stand.JPG | first=Richard | last=Hooper |publisher=Quest for the 92|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> unlike the other 3 stands. It contains the corporate hospitality seating<ref name="visiting" /> alongside Fulham fans.<ref name="visiting" /> [[Jimmy Hill]] once referred to the Riverside being "a bit like the London Palladium" as Blocks V & W (the middle section) are often filled with the rich and famous (including often Al-Fayed).

===Johnny Haynes Stand===

[[File:INTERIOR MONTAGE OF HAYNES STAND.jpg|thumb|right|Internal look of the stand, with a montage of [[Johnny Haynes]]]]
Originally called the Stevenage Road Stand,<ref name="Haynes" /> after the road it backs onto,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballgroundguide.com/fulham/#Craven-Cottage-Fulham-Layout |title=Football Ground Guide: Craven Cottage, Fulham FC - Ground Layout |publisher=Football Ground Guide|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> the Johnny Haynes stand is the oldest remaining football stand in the Football League,<ref name="Shoot" /> originally constructed in 1905,<ref name="terrace" /> and is a Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref name="terrace" /> Designed by [[Archibald Leitch]],<ref name="terrace" /> the stand contains the ticket office<ref name="terrace" /> and club shop<ref name="terrace" /> and features original wooden seating.<ref <ref name="terrace" /> Following his death in 2005, the stand was renamed after former player [[Johnny Haynes]].<ref name="Haynes" />

The exterior facing Stevenage Road has a brick façade<ref name="pies" /><ref name="flickr">{{cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/25645678@N06/sets/72157621791140557/detail/ |title=Craven Cottage Fulham FC Inside & Out |publisher=Flickr |date=1 August 2009|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> and features the club's old emblem in the artwork.<ref name="flickr" /> Decorative pillars show the club's foundation date as 1880 though this is thought to be incorrect. Also, a special stone to commemorate Fulham 2000 and The Cottagers' return to Craven Cottage was engraved on the façade.<ref name="flickr" /> The family enclosures are located in the two corners of the stand, one nearest to the Hammersmith End and one nearest to the Putney End.<ref name="terrace" /><ref name="visiting" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/tickets/-/media/Tickets/Season%20Tickets/2013-14/Family%20Zone%20Season%20Ticket.ashx |title=Family Zone Season Tickets |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> The front of the stand now contains plastic seating, but originally was a standing area. Children were often placed at the front of this enclosure and the area had a distinctive white picket fence to keep fans off the pitch up until the 1970s.

===The Pavilion===
[[File:Fulham Football Club, Craven Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 577769.jpg|thumb|right|The Pavilion from outside the stadium]]
The Cottage Pavilion dates back to 1905 along with the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand,<ref name="officialwebsite" /> built by renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]].<ref name="officialwebsite" /> The reason The Cottage was built was due to an oversight in the Stevenage Road Stand (as it was then), as Leitch had forgotten to accommodate changing rooms in his final plans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/article/away-day-guide-fulham-872498.aspx |title=Away Day Guide: Fulham |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=29 July 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> Besides being the changing rooms, the Cottage (also called The Clubhouse) is traditionally used by the players' families and friends who sit on the balcony to watch the game.<ref name="terrace" /> In the past, board meetings used to be held in The Cottage itself as well. There is a large tapestry draped from the Cottage which says "Still Believe". It encapsulates the now-famous moment, when fans facing defeat against [[Hamburg SV]] in the [[Europa League]] semi-final roused the players with the chant of "Stand up if you still believe".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/fulham/7653889/Fulham-v-Hamburg-Roy-Hodgson-shows-his-England-manager-credentials.html |title=Fulham v Hamburg: Roy Hodgson shows his England manager credentials | first=John | last=Ley |publisher=''Daily Telegraph'' |date=29 April 2010|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/30/fulham-hamburg-europa-league |title=Fulham's greatest game sees them back on the road to Hamburg | first=David | last=Hytner |publisher=''Guardian'' |date=30 April 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2010/04/hodgson_takes_the_acclaim.html |title=Hodgson and Fulham deserve the acclaim | first=Phil | last=McNulty |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2010|accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> In the three other corners of the ground there are what have been described as large 'filing cabinets', which are corporate boxes on three levels.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8al_iPsc0jQ</ref>
