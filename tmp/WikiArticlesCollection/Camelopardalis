'''Camelopardalis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˌ|m|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|p|ɑr|d|əl|ɨ|s}} is a large but faint [[constellation]] in the [[celestial sphere|northern sky]]. The constellation was introduced in 1612 (or 1613) by [[Petrus Plancius]]. Some older astronomy books give an alternative spelling of the name, '''Camelopardus'''.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1785, the word ''camelopardalis'' comes from [[Latin]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcamelopardalis |title = camelopardalis |last1 = Lewis |first1 = Charlton T. |last2 = Short |first2 = Charles |work = A Latin Dictionary |publisher = Perseus Digital Library|accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref> and it is the [[romanisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] "καμηλοπάρδαλις" meaning "[[giraffe]]",<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkamhlopa%2Frdalis |title = καμηλοπάρδαλις
|first1 = Henry George |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |work = A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library |accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref> from "κάμηλος" (''kamēlos''), "[[camel]]"<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dka%2Fmhlos |title = κάμηλος |first1 = Henry George |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |work = A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library |accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref> + "πάρδαλις" (''pardalis''), "[[leopard]]",<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Frdalis |title = πάρδαλις |first1 = Henry George |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |work = A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library |accessdate =8 June 2012}}</ref> due to its having a long neck like a camel and spots like a leopard.

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Camelopardalis}}

Although Camelopardalis is the 18th largest constellation, it is not a particularly bright constellation, as the brightest stars are only of fourth magnitude. In fact, it only contains four stars above magnitude 5.0.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=241}}

*'''[[Alpha Camelopardalis|α Cam]]''' is a blue-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3, 5000 light-years from Earth. Its distance is unusual for a naked-eye star.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[Beta Camelopardalis|β Cam]]''' is the brightest star in Camelopardalis with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4.03. This star is a [[double star]], with components of magnitudes 4.0{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118=119}} and 8.6. The primary is a yellow-hued supergiant 1000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[11 Camelopardalis|11 Cam]]''' is a star of magnitude 5.2, 650 light-years from Earth. It is very close to magnitude 6.1 [[12 Camelopardalis|12 Cam]], also 650 light-years from Earth, but the two stars are not a true double star because of their separation.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[Struve 1694|Σ 1694]] (Struve 1694, 32 Cam)''' is a [[binary star]] 300 light-years from Earth. Both components have a blue-white hue; the primary is of magnitude 5.4 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.9.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

*'''[[CS Camelopardalis|CS Cam]]''' is the second brightest star, though it has neither a [[Bayer designation|Bayer]] nor a [[Flamsteed designation]]. It is of magnitude 4.21 and is slightly [[variable star|variable]].{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118=119}}

Other variable stars are [[U Camelopardalis]], [[VZ Camelopardalis]], and [[Mira variable]]s [[T Camelopardalis]], [[X Camelopardalis]], and [[R Camelopardalis]].{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118=119}}

In 2011 a supernova was discovered in the constellation.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/10-year-old-canadian-girl-youngest-discover-supernova |title = 10-Year-Old Canadian Girl Is The Youngest Person Ever to Discover a Supernova |last = Boyle |first = Rebecca |accessdate =8 June 2012 |journal = Popular Science |date = 3 January 2011}}</ref>

===Deep-sky objects===
Camelopardalis is in the part of the [[celestial sphere]] facing away from the [[galactic plane]]. Accordingly, many distant galaxies are visible within its borders. [[NGC 2403]] is a galaxy in the [[M81 group]] of galaxies, located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}} with a redshift of 0.00043. It is classified as being between an [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and a [[spiral galaxy]] because it has faint arms and a large central bulge. NGC 2403 was first discovered by the 18th century astronomer [[William Herschel]], who was working in England at the time.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} It has an [[integrated magnitude]] of 8.0 and is approximately 0.25° long.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}}

[[NGC 1502]] is a magnitude 6.9 [[open cluster]] about 3,000 [[light year]]s from Earth. It has about 45 bright members, and features a double star of magnitude 7.0 at its center.<ref>Revised NGC/IC Data 2013. Dr. Wolfgang Steinicke.</ref> NGC 1502 is also associated with [[Kemble's Cascade]], a simple but beautiful asterism appearing in the sky as a chain of stars 2.5° long that is parallel to the Milky Way and is pointed towards [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}} [[NGC 1501]] is a planetary nebula located roughly 1.4° south of NGC 1502.

NGC 2655 is a small galaxy. [[IC 342]] is one of the brightest two galaxies in the [[IC 342/Maffei Group]] of galaxies. The dwarf irregular galaxy [[NGC 1569]] is a magnitude 11.9 [[starburst galaxy]], about 11 million light years away.

[[MS0735.6+7421]] is a galaxy cluster with a [[redshift]] of 0.216, located 2.6 billion light-years from Earth. It is unique for its [[intracluster medium]], which emits [[x-rays]] at a very high rate. This galaxy cluster features two cavities 600,000 light-years in diameter, caused by its central [[supermassive black hole]], which emits jets of matter. MS0735.6+7421 is one of the largest and most distant examples of this phenomenon.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}

Tombaugh 5 is a fairly dim open cluster in Camelopardalis. It has an overall magnitude of 8.4 and is located 5,800 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class c and Trumpler class III 1 r cluster, meaning that it is irregularly shaped and appears loose. Though it is detached from the star field, it is not concentrated at its center at all. It has more than 100 stars which do not vary widely in brightness,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=89}} mostly being of the 15th and 16th magnitude.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=91}}

[[NGC 2146]] is an 11th magnitude barred spiral [[starburst galaxy|starburst]] galaxy conspicuously warped by interaction with a neighbour.

[[MACS0647-JD]], one of the possible candidates for the farthest known galaxies in the universe ([[Redshift|z]]= 10.7), is also in Camelopardalis.

=== Space Exploration ===
The [[Space probe]] [[Voyager 1]] is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its power source will be long dead.

==History==
[[Image:Camelopardalisurania.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Camelopardalis as depicted in [http://www.ianridpath.com/atlases/urania.htm Urania's Mirror], a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825. Above it are shown the now-abandoned constellations of [[Tarandus (constellation)|Tarandus]] and [[Custos Messium]].]]

Camelopardalis was created by [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1613 to represent the animal [[Rebecca]] rode to marry [[Isaac]] in [[the Bible]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92-93}} One year later, [[Jakob Bartsch]] featured it in his atlas. [[Johannes Hevelius]] gave it the official name of "Camelopardus" or "Camelopardalis" because he saw the constellation's many faint stars as the spots of a giraffe.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=241}}

[[H. A. Rey]] has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars of Camelopardalis into a [[giraffe]] figure.
[[Image:Camelopardalis constellation map visualization.PNG|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of [[H. A. Rey]]'s method of connecting the stars of the constellation Camelopardalis, in order to show a giraffe.]] <br clear=left>The giraffe's body consists of the quadrangle of stars [[Alpha Camelopardalis|α Cam]], [[beta Camelopardalis|β Cam]], [[BE Camelopardalis|BE Cam]], and [[Gamma Camelopardalis|γ Cam]]: α Cam and β Cam being of the fourth magnitude. The stars [[HD 42818]] (HR 2209) and [[M Camelopardalis|M Cam]] form the [[head]] of the giraffe, and the stars M Cam and α Cam form the giraffe's long [[neck]]. Stars β Cam and [[7 Camelopardalis|7 Cam]] form the giraffe's front leg, and [[variable star]]s BE Cam and [[CS Camelopardalis|CS Cam]] form the giraffe's hind leg.

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Camelopardalis are located within a group of circumpolar stars called the [[Purple Forbidden Enclosure]] (紫微垣 ''Zǐ Wēi Yuán'').
