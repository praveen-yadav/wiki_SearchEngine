'''Corinth''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] Κόρινθος, ''Kórinthos'') ({{IPA-el|ˈkorinθos||Ell-Korinthos.ogg}}) is a city and former municipality in [[Corinthia]], [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality [[Corinth (municipality)|Corinth]], of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref> It is the capital of Corinthia. 

It was founded as '''Nea Korinthos''' or '''New Corinth''' in 1858 after an earthquake destroyed the existing settlement of Corinth, which had developed in and around the site of [[ancient Corinth]].

==Geography==
Located about {{convert|78|km|mi|0}} southwest of [[Athens]], Corinth is surrounded by the coastal townlets of (clockwise) [[Lechaio]], [[Isthmia (village)|Isthmia]], [[Kechries]], and the inland townlets of [[Examilia]] and the archaeological site and village of ancient Corinth. Geophysically the city is likewise surrounded by the narrow coastal plain of [[Vocha (plain of)|Vocha]], Corinthian Gulf, [[Corinth Canal]], the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], Saronic Gulf, [[Oneia Mountains]], and the monolithic rock of [[Acrocorinth]], where the medieval [[acropolis]] was built.

==History==
{{Main|Ancient Corinth}}
Corinth derives its name from [[Ancient Corinth]], a [[city-state]] of antiquity. In 1858, the old city of Corinth (now known as Archaia Korinthos (Αρχαία Κόρινθος), located {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} SW of the modern city), was totally destroyed by an earthquake. This led to the establishment of '''Nea''' or '''New Corinth''', on the coast of the Gulf of Corinth. New Corinth was rebuilt after a further earthquake in 1928 and again after a great fire in 1933.

==Demographics==
<!---will need some kind of consistency here between whether the article is about the city or about the metropolitan area. May require second article if there isn't one--->
Corinth is the second largest city in the [[modern regions of Greece|region]] of the Peloponnese. Between the census of 1981 and 1991, the city had one of the fastest-increasing populations in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The Municipality of Corinth, or ''Dimos Korinthion'', has a population of 58,280 (2011 census)<ref name="EL_STAT"/> and 36,991 (2001 census). It has a population density of 95.34 per km².<ref name="EL_STAT"/> The municipality includes the town of Archaia Korinthos (1,770 inhabitants), the town of Examilia (1,547 inhabitants), and the smaller settlements of [[Xylokeriza]] (777 inhabitants) and Corinthia (686 inhabitants).

==Economy==

===Industry===
Corinth is a major industrial hub at a national level. Copper cables, petroleum products, leather, medical equipment, marble, gypsum, ceramic tiles, salt, mineral water and beverages, meat products, and gums are produced nearby. As of 2005, a period of [[deindustrialization]] has commenced as a large pipework complex, a textile factory and a meat packing facility disrupted their operations.

==Transport==

=== Roads ===

Corinth is a major road hub. The [[Moreas Motorway|A7]] [[toll road|toll]] motorway for Tripoli and Kalamata, (and Sparta via [[Moreas Motorway|A71]] [[toll road|toll]]), branches off the [[Motorway 8 (Greece)|A8]]/[[European route E94]] [[toll road|toll]] motorway from Athens at Corinth.  Corinth is the main entry point to the Peloponnesian peninsula, the southernmost area of continental Greece.

=== Railways ===

The city has been connected to the [[Proastiakos]], the Athens suburban rail network, since 2005, when the new [[Corinth railway station]] was completed.

===Port===
The port of Corinth, located north of the city centre and close to the northwest entrance of the [[Corinth Canal]], at 37 56.0’ N / 22 56.0’ E, serves the local needs of industry and agriculture. It is mainly a cargo exporting facility. 

It is an artificial harbour (depth approximately {{convert|9|m|ft}}, protected by a concrete [[mole (architecture)|mole]] (length approximately 930 metres, width 100 metres, mole surface 93,000 m2). A new pier finished in the late 1980s doubled the capacity of the port. The reinforced mole protects anchored vessels from strong northern winds. 

Within the port operates a [[customs]] office facility and a [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] post. Sea traffic is limited to trade in the export of local produce, mainly citrus fruits, grapes, marble, aggregates and some domestic imports. The port operates as a contingency facility for general cargo ships, [[bulk carrier]]s and [[RORO]]s, in case of [[strike action|strike]]s at [[Piraeus]] port. There is a [[ferry]] line (RORO) connecting Corinth to [[Italy]].

==== Ferries ====
There was a [[ferry]] link to [[Catania]], [[Sicily]] and [[Genoa]]  in [[Italy]].

===Canal===
{{Main|Corinth Canal}}
[[File:Canal of korinth greece.jpg|thumb|The canal cuts through the [[Isthmus of Corinth|Isthmus]].]]
The [[Corinth Canal]], carrying ship traffic between the western [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]], is about {{convert|4|km}} east of the city, cutting through the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] that connects the Peloponnesian peninsula to the Greek mainland, thus effectively making the former an island. The builders dug the canal through the Isthmus at sea level; no locks are employed. It is {{convert|6.4|km}} in length and only {{convert|21.3|m}} wide at its base, making it impassable for most modern ships. It now has little economic importance.

The canal was mooted in classical times and an abortive effort was made to build it in the 1st century AD. Construction finally got underway in 1881 but was hampered by geological and financial problems that bankrupted the original builders. It was completed in 1893, but due to the canal's narrowness, navigational problems and periodic closures to repair landslips from its steep walls, it failed to attract the level of traffic anticipated by its operators. It is now used mainly for tourist traffic.

==Sport==
The city's [[association football]] team is [[Korinthos F.C.]] (''Π.Α.E. Κόρινθος''), established in 1999 after the merger of Pankorinthian Football Club (''Παγκορινθιακός'') and Corinth Football Club (''Κόρινθος''). During the 2006-2007 season, the team played in the Greek Fourth Division's Regional Group 7. The team went undefeated that season and it earned the top spot.<ref>[http://www.paskorinthos.gr/2006-2007.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>{{dead link|date=February 2013}} This granted the team a promotion to the [[Gamma Ethniki|Gamma Ethnikí (Third Division)]] for the 2007-2008 season. For the 2008-2009 season, Korinthos F.C. competed in the Gamma Ethniki (Third Division) southern grouping.
