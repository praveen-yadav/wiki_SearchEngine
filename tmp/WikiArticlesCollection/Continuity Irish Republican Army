The '''Continuity Irish Republican Army''' or '''Continuity IRA''' ('''CIRA''') is an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] paramilitary group that aims to bring about a [[united Ireland]]. It emerged from a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] in 1986 but did not become active until the Provisional IRA [[ceasefire]] of 1994. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and is designated a [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organisation]] in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has links with the political party [[Republican Sinn Féin]] (RSF).

Like the Provisional IRA before it, the CIRA sees itself as the direct continuation of the original [[Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply "the Irish Republican Army" in English or ''[[Óglaigh na hÉireann]]'' (Volunteers of Ireland) in Irish. It sees itself as the national army of an [[Irish Republic]] covering the whole of Ireland. The security forces initially referred to it as the "Irish National Republican Army" (INRA).

Since its formation, the CIRA has [[Timeline of Continuity Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in Northern Ireland against the [[British Army]] and the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI), formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC). This is part of a [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|wider campaign]] against the British security forces by "[[dissident republican]]" paramilitaries. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, as well as with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The CIRA has also carried out bombings with the goal of causing economic harm and/or disruption, as well as many "punishment" attacks on alleged criminals. 

To date, it has been responsible for the death of one PSNI officer.<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/index.html Sutton Index of Deaths]. ''CAIN''.</ref> However, the CIRA is not as big and has not been as active as the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]] and there have been a number of splits within the organisation since the mid-2000s.

==Origins==

===1986 IRA General Army Convention===
The Continuity IRA has its origins in a split in the [[Provisional IRA]]. In September 1986, the Provisional IRA held a meeting of its General Army Convention (GAC), the organisation's supreme decision-making body. It was the first GAC in 16 years. The meeting, which like all such meetings was secret, was convened to discuss among other resolutions, the articles of the Provisional IRA constitution which dealt with [[abstentionism]], its opposition to the taking of seats in [[Dáil Éireann]].<ref>J Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army: The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, ISBN 1-85371-813-0</ref> The GAC passed motions (by the necessary two-thirds majority) allowing members of the Provisional IRA to discuss and debate the taking of parliamentary seats, and the removal of the ban on members of the organisation from supporting any successful republican candidate who took their seat in Dáil Éireann.<ref>{{Cite web| title = A Chronology of the Conflict – 1986 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch86.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]] | date = | accessdate = 17 May 2007}}</ref><ref>"Essentially since the spring of 1972, the crucial player in the armed struggle has been the Provisional IRA—now ''the IRA''. (Authors Italics) J. Bowyer Bell, IRA: Tactics & Targets, Poolbeg, First Published 1990, Reprinted 1993, This Edition 1998, Dublin, ISBN 1-85371-603-0.</ref>

The Provisional IRA convention delegates opposed to the change in the constitution claimed that the convention was [[gerrymander]]ed "by the creation of new IRA organisational structures for the convention, including the combinations of Sligo-Roscommon-Longford and Wicklow-Wexford-Waterford."<ref>Robert White, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary, 2006, p. 309.</ref> The only IRA body that supported this viewpoint was the outgoing IRA Executive. Those members of the outgoing Executive who opposed the change comprised a quorum. They met, dismissed those in favour of the change, and set up a new Executive. They contacted [[Tom Maguire]], who had legitimated the Provisionals in 1969, and asked him for support. Maguire had also been contacted by supporters of [[Gerry Adams]], then and now President of [[Sinn Féin]], and a supporter of the change in the Provisional IRA constitution. 

Maguire rejected Adams' supporters, supported the IRA Executive members opposed to the change, and named the new organisers the Continuity Army Council.<ref>Robert White, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006. Indiana University Press. p310</ref> In a 1986 statement, he rejected "the legitimacy of an Army Council styling itself the Council of the Irish Republican Army which lends support to any person or organisation styling itself as Sinn Féin and prepared to enter the partition parliament of Leinster House." In 1987, Maguire described the "Continuity Executive" as the "lawful Executive of the Irish Republican Army."<ref>Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, Dilseacht, The Story of Comdt. General Tom Maguire and the Second (all-Ireland) Dáil, 1997, pp. 65–66.</ref>

===Claim to legitimacy===
{{Main|Irish republican legitimatism}}

Thus, similar to the claim put forward by the Provisional IRA after its split from the [[Official IRA]] in 1969, the Continuity IRA claims to be the legitimate continuation of the '[[Irish Republican Army]]' or ''Óglaigh na hÉireann''.<ref>{{cite book | last = van Engeland | first = Anisseh | authorlink = | title = From Terrorism to Politics (Ethics and Global Politics) | publisher = [[Ashgate Publishing]] | year = 2008 | page = 55 | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-7546-4990-8}}</ref> This argument is based on the view that the surviving anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] members of the [[Second Dáil]] delegated their "authority" to the [[IRA Army Council]] in 1938. As further justification for this claim, [[Tom Maguire]], one of those anti-Treaty members of the Second Dáil, issued a statement in favour of the Continuity IRA, just as he had done in 1969 in favour of the Provisionals. [[J. Bowyer Bell]], in his ''The Irish Troubles'', describes Maguire's opinion in 1986, "abstentionism was a basic tenet of republicanism, a moral issue of principle. Abstentionism gave the movement legitimacy, the right to wage war, to speak for a Republic all but established in the hearts of the people".<ref>J. Bowyer Bell, ''The Secret Army, The IRA'', Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, ISBN 1-85371-813-0, p. 575.</ref> Maguire's stature was such that a delegation from Gerry Adams sought his support in 1986, but was rejected.<ref>Robert W. White, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary'', 2006, p. 310.</ref>

===Relationship to other organisations===
These changes within the military wing of the [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican Movement]] were accompanied by changes in the political wing and at the 1986 [[Sinn Féin]] Ard Fheis (party conference), which followed the IRA Convention, the party's policy of [[abstentionism]], which forbade Sinn Féin elected representatives from taking seats in the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of Ireland, was dropped. On 2 November, the 628 delegates present cast their votes, the result being 429 to 161. The traditionalists, having lost at both conventions, walked out of the Mansion House, met that evening at the West County Hotel, and reformed as [[Republican Sinn Féin]] (RSF).<ref>J Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, The IRA, Poolbeg, revised third edition, Dublin, 1997, ISBN 1-85371-813-0</ref>

According to a report in the ''Cork Examiner'', the Continuity IRA's first chief of staff was [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]],<ref name = "agdooe">{{Cite web| title = CIRA bomb adds to growing crisis in the peace process | url = http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2000/02/07/current/opinionpage_9.htm | publisher = ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' | date = 2 July 2000 | accessdate = 17 May 2007}}</ref> who also served as the first chairman of RSF from 1986 to 1987.

==Structure and status==
The leadership of the Continuity IRA is believed to be based in the [[Munster]] and [[Ulster]] areas. It is alleged that its [[List of IRA Chiefs of Staff|chief of staff]] was a [[Limerick]] man and that a number of other key members were from that county. They have since being expelled. He was in this position before being expelled along with about ten others since the death of [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], the first chief of staff, in 1991.<ref name = "agdooe"/> In 2004 the United States (US) government believed the Continuity IRA consisted of fewer than fifty hardcore activists.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/cira.htm | publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]] | date = 13 July 2004 | accessdate = 18 May 2007}}</ref> In 2005, [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform]] [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]] told [[Dáil Éireann]] that the organisation had a maximum of 150 members.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Parliamentary Debates (Official Report – Unrevised) | url = http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&Node=H10-1#H10-1 | publisher = Dáil Éireann | date = 23 June 2005 | accessdate = 18 May 2007}}</ref>

The CIRA is an illegal organisation under UK (section 11(1) of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]]) and Irish law due to the use of 'IRA' in the group's name in a situation analogous to that of the [[Real Irish Republican Army]] (RIRA).<ref>{{Cite web| title = Statutory Rules and Orders, 1939, No. 162.

==External aid and arsenal==
The US government suspects the Continuity IRA of having received funds and arms from supporters in the United States. Security sources in Ireland have expressed the suspicion that, in co-operation with the RIRA, the Continuity IRA may have acquired arms and material from the [[Balkans]]. They also suspect that the Continuity IRA arsenal contains some weapons that were taken from Provisional IRA arms dumps, including a few dozen rifles, machine guns, and pistols; a small amount of the explosive [[Semtex]]; and a few dozen detonators.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Decommissioning – how big a task? | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/386434.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 5 July 1999 | accessdate = 18 May 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

==Activities==
{{Main|Chronology of Continuity Irish Republican Army actions}}

Initially, the Continuity IRA did not reveal its existence, either in the form of press statements or paramilitary activity. Although the [[Garda Síochána]] had suspicions that the organisation existed, they were unsure of its name, labelling it the "Irish National Republican Army".<ref>{{Cite web| title = The Continuity IRA | author = David Kerr | url = http://www.ulsternation.org.uk/continuity_ira.htm | publisher = ''Ulster Nation'' | year = 1997 | accessdate = 16 March 2007}}</ref> On 21 January 1994, on the 75th anniversary of the First Dáil Éireann, Continuity IRA volunteers offered a "final salute" to Tom Maguire by firing over his grave, and a public statement and a photo were published in ''[[Saoirse Irish Freedom]]''.<ref>"Final Salute to Comdt-General Tom Maguire," Saoirse, Feabhra-February 1994, p. 2; see also, Robert White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. 2006. Indiana University Press, pp. 323–24.</ref>

It was only after the Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire in 1994 that the Continuity IRA became active, announcing its intention to continue the campaign against British rule. The CIRA continues to oppose the [[Belfast Agreement]] and, unlike the Provisional IRA (and the Real IRA in 1998), the CIRA has not announced a ceasefire or agreed to participate in weapons decommissioning—nor is there any evidence that it will. In the 18th [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]'s report, the RIRA, the CIRA and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) were deemed a potential future threat. The CIRA was labelled "active, dangerous and committed and... capable of a greater level of violent and other crime". Like the RIRA and [[Real IRA/ONH|Óglaigh na hÉireann]], it too sought funds for expansion. It is also known to have worked with the INLA.<ref>[http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/18.%20Eighteenth%20Report.pdf IMC May 2008 Report]</ref>

The CIRA has been involved in a number of bombing and shooting incidents. Targets of the CIRA have included the [[British Armed Forces|British military]], the Northern Ireland police service ([[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) and [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. Since the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998 the CIRA along with other paramilitaries apposing the ceasefire, have been involved with a countless number of punishment shootings and beatings. By 2005 the CIRA was believed to be an established presence on the island of Great Britain with the capability of launching attacks.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Irish terror groups 'to hit London' | author = Martin Bright and Henry McDonald| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1441975,00.html | publisher = ''[[The Observer]]'' | date = 20 March 2005 | accessdate = 18 May 2007}}</ref> A bomb defused in Dublin in December 2005 was believed to have been the work of the CIRA.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Continuity IRA link suspected in M50 alert | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1209/m50.html | publisher = ''RTÉ'' | date = 9 December 2005 | accessdate = 16 March 2007}}</ref> In February 2006, the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) blamed the CIRA for planting four bombs in Northern Ireland during the final quarter of 2005, as well as several [[bomb threat|hoax bomb warnings]].<ref name="IMC8">{{Cite journal| last = Independent Monitoring Commission | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = 13–14 | date = 1 February 2006 | publisher = The Stationery Office | url = http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/8th%20IMC%20Report.pdf | format = PDF | id = | accessdate = 6 May 2007}}</ref> The IMC also blamed the CIRA for the killings of two former CIRA members in Belfast, who had stolen CIRA weapons and established a rival organisation.

The CIRA continued to be active in both planning and undertaking attacks on the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI). The IMC said they tried to create troubles to lure police forth, while they have also taken to [[stoning]] and using [[petrol bomb]]s. In addition, other assaults, robbery, [[tiger kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[fuel laundering]] and [[smuggling]] were undertaken by the group. The CIRA also actively took part in recruiting and training members, including disgruntled former Provisional IRA members. As a result of this continued activity the IMC said the group remained "a very serious threat".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/Twentieth%20Report.pdf |title=Twentieth Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission |publisher=[[The Stationary Office]] |format=PDF |date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2008}}</ref>

On 10 March 2009 the CIRA claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of a PSNI officer in [[Craigavon]], [[County Armagh]]—the first police fatality in Northern Ireland since 1998. The officer was fatally shot by a sniper as he and a colleague investigated "suspicious activity" at a house nearby when a window was smashed by youths causing the occupant to phone the police. The PSNI officers responded to the emergency call, giving a CIRA sniper the chance to shoot and kill officer Stephen Carroll.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Continuity IRA shot dead officer  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7934426.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 10 March 2009 | accessdate = 10 March 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title = Continuity IRA claims PSNI murder  | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0310/craigavon.html | publisher = [[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]] | date = 10 March 2009 | accessdate = 10 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Internal tension and splits==
In 2005, several members of the CIRA, who were serving prison sentences in [[Portlaoise Prison]] for paramilitary activity, left the organisation. Some transferred to the INLA landing of the prison, but the majority of those who left are now independent and on E4 landing. The remaining CIRA prisoners have moved to D Wing. Supporters of the Continuity IRA leadership claim that this resulted from an internal disagreement, which although brought to a conclusion, was followed by some people leaving the organisation anyway. Supporters of the disaffected members established the [[Concerned Group for Republican Prisoners]] in their support. Most of those who had left went back to the CIRA, or dissociated themselves from the CGRP. The group is now defunct.

In February 2006, the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]] claimed in a report on paramilitary activity that two groups, styling themselves as "Óglaigh na hÉireann" and "Saoirse na hÉireann", had been formed after a split in the Continuity IRA.<ref name=imc8>[http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/8th%20IMC%20Report.pdf  Eighth Report of the [[Independent Monitoring Commission]]], 1 February 2006</ref> The Óglaigh na hÉireann group was responsible for a number of pipe bomb attacks on the PSNI, bomb hoaxes, and robberies. The Saoirse na hÉireann group was responsible for a number of bomb hoaxes.<ref name=imc8/> The groups had apparently ceased operations by early 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/docs/frampton10icsr.pdf|title=The Return of the Militants: Violent Dissident Republicanism|last=Frampton|first=Martyn|year=2010|publisher=International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR)|pages=2–3|accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref>

In July 2010, members of a "militant Northern-based faction within the CIRA" led by a well known member from south Derry claimed to have overthrown the leadership of the organisation. They also claimed that an Army Convention representing "95 per cent of volunteers" had unanimously elected a new 12-member Army Executive, which in turn appointed a new seven-member Army Council. The moves came as a result of dissatisfication with the southern-based leadership and the apparent winding-down of military operations. A senior source from [[Republican Sinn Féin]] said: "We would see them [the purported new leadership] as just another splinter group that has broken away."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0728/1224275616749.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Militant faction claims it has taken over leadership of CIRA | date=7 July 2010}}</ref> In June 2011, Liam Kenny, a member of this Limerick based breakaway Continuity IRA faction, was allegedly murdered by drug dealers at his home in [[Clondalkin]], West Dublin.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/gardai-fear-retaliation-attack-after-dissident-murder-2800112.html | work=The Irish Independent | title=Gardai fear retaliation attack after dissident murder | date=19 June 2011}}</ref> On 28 November 2011 an innocent man was mistakenly shot dead in retaliation for the murder of Liam Kenny.

In July 2012 this faction announced it had a new leadership after expelling members who had been working against the organisation.<ref>{{cite news
