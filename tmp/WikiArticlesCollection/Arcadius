'''Arcadius''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Arcadius Augustus}}; {{lang-el|{{lang|grc|Ἀρκάδιος}}}}; 377/378 – 1 May 408) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 395 until his death in 408. He was the eldest son of [[Theodosius I]] and his first wife [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of the Western Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. A weak ruler, his reign was dominated by a series of powerful ministers and by his wife, [[Aelia Eudoxia]].{{cn|date=July 2012}}

==History==
Arcadius was born in [[Hispania]], the elder son of [[Theodosius I]] and [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], who would become a [[Western Roman Emperor]]. His father declared him an [[Augustus]] and co-ruler for the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern half of the Empire]] in January, 383. His younger brother was also declared Augustus in 393, for the Western half.

As emperors, Honorius was under the control of the Romanized Vandal ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Stilicho|Flavius Stilicho]] while Arcadius was dominated by one of his ministers, [[Rufinus (consul)|Rufinus]]. Stilicho is alleged by some to have wanted control of both Emperors, and is supposed to have had Rufinus assassinated by Gothic mercenaries in 395; though definite proof of Stilicho's involvement in the assassination is lacking, the intense competition and political jealousies engendered by the two figures compose the main thread of the first part of Arcadius' reign. Arcadius' new advisor, the eunuch [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius]], simply took Rufinus' place as the power behind the Eastern imperial throne.

Arcadius was also dominated by his wife [[Aelia Eudoxia]], who convinced her husband to dismiss Eutropius, who was holding the consulate, at the height of his power, in 399. That same year, on the 13th July, Arcadius issued an edict ordering that [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|all remaining non-Christian temples should be immediately demolished]].

Eudoxia's influence was strongly opposed by [[John Chrysostom]], the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], who felt that she had used her family's wealth to gain control over the Emperor. Eudoxia used her influence to have Chrysostom deposed in 404, but she died later that year. Eudoxia gave to Arcadius four children: three daughters, [[Pulcheria]], [[Arcadia (daughter of Arcadius)|Arcadia]] and Marina, and one son, Theodosius, the future Emperor [[Theodosius II]].

Arcadius was dominated for the rest of his rule by [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]], the [[Praetorian prefect|Praetorian Prefect]], who made peace with Stilicho in the West.  Arcadius himself was more concerned with appearing to be a pious [[Christianity|Christian]] than he was with political or military matters, and he died, only nominally in control of his Empire, in 408.

==Character and works==
In this reign of a weak Emperor dominated by court politics, a major theme was the ambivalence felt by prominent individuals and the court parties that formed and regrouped round them towards [[barbarian]]s, which in Constantinople at this period meant [[Goths]]. In the well-documented episode that revolved around [[Gainas]], a number of Gothic ''foederati'' stationed in the capital were massacred, the survivors fleeing under the command of Gainas to [[Thrace]], where they were tracked down by imperial troops and slaughtered and Gainas dispatched.  The episode has been traditionally interpreted as a paroxysm of anti-barbarian reaction that served to stabilize the East. The main source for the affair is a mythology ''à clef'' by [[Synesius]] of Cyrene, ''Aegyptus sive de providentia'', (400)<ref>The date 400 is argued for by Cameron and Long 1993.</ref> an Egyptianising allegory that embodies a covert account of the events, the exact interpretation of which continues to baffle scholars. Synesius' ''De regno'', which claims to be addressed to Arcadius himself, contains a tirade against Goths.

A new [[forum of Arcadius|forum]] was built in the name of Arcadius, on the seventh hill of Constantinople, the ''Xērolophos'', in which a [[column of Arcadius|column]] was begun to commemorate his 'victory' over Gainas (although the column was only completed after Arcadius' death by [[Theodosius II]]).

The [[Pentelic marble]] portrait head of Arcadius (''illustration'') was discovered in Istanbul close to the Forum Tauri, in June 1949, in excavating foundations for new buildings of the University at [[Beyazıt Square|Beyazit]].<ref>Nezih Firatli, "A Late Antique Imperial Portrait Recently Discovered at Istanbul" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''55'''.1 (January 1951), pp. 67–71.</ref> The neck was designed to be inserted in a torso, but no statue, base or inscription was found. The [[diadem]] is a fillet with rows of pearls along its edges and a rectangular stone set about with pearls over the young Emperor's forehead.
