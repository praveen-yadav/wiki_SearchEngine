The '''[[Cook Islands]]''' are named after [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], who visited the islands in 1773 and 1777.<ref>''Cook : the Extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', 2003, by Nicholas Thomas, pages 310-311.</ref> The [[Cook Islands]] became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888.

By 1900, administrative control was transferred to [[New Zealand]]; in 1965 residents chose self-government in free association with New Zealand.

The Cook Islands contain 15 islands in the group spread over a vast area in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. The majority of islands are low coral atolls in the Northern Group, with [[Rarotonga]], a volcanic island in the Southern Group, as the main administration and government centre. The main Cook Islands language is [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan Māori]]. There are some variations in dialect in the 'outer' islands.

==History==
The Cook Islands were first settled around 600 [[Anno Domini|AD]] by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from nearby [[Tahiti]] to the southeast. Overpopulation on many of the tiny islands of Polynesia led to these oceanic migrations. Tradition has it that this was the reason for the expedition of Ru, from Tupua'i in French Polynesia, who landed on [[Aitutaki]], and Tangiia, also from French Polynesia, both of whom are believed to have arrived on [[Rarotonga]] around 800 AD. These arrivals are evidenced by an older road in Toi, the ''Ara Metua'', which runs around most of Rarotonga, and is believed to be at least 1200 years old. This 29&nbsp;km long, paved road is a considerable achievement of ancient engineering, possibly unsurpassed elsewhere in Polynesia.<ref name=wondermondo>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/NZ/Cook/AraMetua.htm|title=Ara Metua - ancient Polynesian road|publisher=Wondermondo}}</ref> The islands of Manihiki and Rakahanga trace their origins to the arrival of Toa (an outcast from Rarotonga) and Tupaeru (a woman of high-ranking in the Puaikura tribe of Rarotonga)The remainder of the northern islands were probably settled by expeditions from [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].<ref>[http://www.ck/history.htm History of the Cook Islands www.ck]</ref>

[[Spain|Spanish]] ships visited the islands in the 16th century; the first written record of contact from Europeans with the native inhabitants of the Cook Islands came with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña]] in 1595 who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). Portuguese-Spaniard [[Pedro Fernández de Quirós]] made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).<ref name="findingnz.co.nz">[http://findingnz.co.nz/av/gav22.htm European discovery of the Cook Islands by Brian Hooker]</ref>

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777; Cook named the islands the 'Hervey Islands' to honour a British Lord of the Admiralty; Half a century later the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern]] published the ''Atlas de l'Ocean Pacifique'', in which he renamed the islands the Cook Islands to honour Cook. [[Captain Cook]] navigated and mapped much of the group. Surprisingly, Cook never sighted the largest island, [[Rarotonga]], and the only island that he personally set foot on was tiny, uninhabited [[Palmerston Island|Palmerston Atoll]].<ref>Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga & the Cook Islands, by Errol Hunt & Nancy J. Keller p10-11 ISBN 1-74059-083-X</ref>

[http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc] The first recorded landing by Europeans was in 1814 by the Cumberland; trouble broke out between the sailors and the Islanders and many were killed on both sides.

The islands saw no more Europeans until missionaries arrived from England in 1821. Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and retains that grip today.

In 1823, [[Captain John Dibbs]] of the colonial barque Endeavour made the first official sighting of the island [[Rarotonga]]. The Endeavour was transporting Rev. [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] on a missionary voyage to the islands.

Brutal [[Peruvian]] [[slave traders]], known as [[blackbirding|blackbirders]], took a terrible toll on the islands of the Northern Group in 1862 and 1863. At first the traders may have genuinely operated as labour recruiters, but they quickly turned to subterfuge and outright kidnapping to round up their human cargo. The [[Cook Islands]] was not the only island group visited by the traders, but [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn Atoll]] was their first port of call and it has been estimated that three-quarters of the population was taken to [[Callao]], [[Peru]].<ref>Discoverers Of The Cook Islands And The Names They Gave, by Alphons M.J. Kloosterman Chap 10. Penrhyn</ref> [[Rakahanga]] and [[Pukapuka]] also suffered tremendous losses.<ref>Lonely Planet Guidebook : Rarotonga & the Cook Islands, by Errol Hunt & Nancy J. Keller p11-12 ISBN 1-74059-083-X</ref>

The [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858 and in 1888 it became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[protectorate]] by the request of [[Queen Makea Takau]], mainly to thwart French expansionism. Then later were transferred to [[New Zealand]] in 1901. They remained a New Zealand protectorate until 1965, at which point they became a [[self-government|self-governing]] territory in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand. The first Prime Minister Sir [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] led the county until 1978 when he was accused of [[vote-rigging]].

Today, the Cook Islands are essentially independent (self-governing in free association with New Zealand), but are still officially placed under New Zealand [[sovereignty]]. New Zealand is tasked with overseeing the country's foreign relations and defence. The Cook Islands are one of four New Zealand [[Dependent territory|dependencies]], along with [[Tokelau]], [[Niue]] and the [[Ross Dependency]].

After achieving autonomy in 1965, the Cook Islands elected [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] as their first [[Prime Minister]]. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

On 11 June 1980, the [[United States]] signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the maritime [[border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing its claim to the islands of [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> In 1990 the Cook Islands signed [[Cook Islands – France Maritime Delimitation Agreement|a treaty]] with [[France]] which [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]]. 

On June 13, 2008, a small majority of members of the [[House of Ariki]] attempted a coup, claiming to dissolve the elected government and to take control of the country's leadership. "Basically we are dissolving the leadership, the prime minister and the deputy prime minister and the ministers," chief Makea Vakatini Joseph Ariki explained. The ''Cook Islands Herald'' suggested that the ''[[ariki]]'' were attempting thereby to regain some of their traditional prestige or ''[[mana]]''.<ref name="TVNZ_1845025">{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/536641/1845025 |title=Cooks heading for internal strife |date=June 13, 2008 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4583560a12.html |title=NZ Maori stirs Cooks sovereignty stoush |date=June 13, 2008 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Jim Marurai]] described the take-over move as "ill-founded and nonsensical".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4587067a12.html |title=NZ Maori behind strange Cook's 'coup' |date=June 17, 2008 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> By June 23, the situation appeared to have normalised, with members of the House of Ariki accepting to return to their regular duties.<ref name="RNZI_40504">{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=40504 |title=Cook Islands chiefs drop take over claim, return to normal duties |date=June 23, 2008 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref>

The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are continuing problems.
