The '''Chlorophyceae''' are one of the classes of [[green alga]]e, distinguished mainly on the basis of ultrastructural morphology.  For example the chlorophycean CW [[clade]], and chlorophycean DO clade, are defined by the arrangement of their [[flagella]]. Members of the CW clade have flagella that are displaced in a "clockwise" (CW, 1–7 o'clock) direction e.g. [[Chlamydomonadales]].  Members of the DO clade have flagella that are "directly opposed" (DO, 12–6 o'clock) e.g. [[Sphaeropleales]]. They are usually green due to the dominance of pigments [[chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b]]. The [[chloroplast]] may be [[discoid]], plate-like, [[reticulate]], cup-shaped, [[spiral]] or [[ribbon shaped]] in different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies called [[Pyrenoid]]s located in the chloroplast. Pyrenoids contain protein besides [[starch]]. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets. Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made up of an inner layer of [[cellulose]] and outer layer of [[pectose]].

==General Characteristics==
<!-- this section needs to be rewritten and cleaned up -->
* Plant Body May Be Unicellular,Colloidal or Filamentous
* They Are Usually Green Due To The Dominance Of Pigments Like Chlorophyll A Or B.
* The Chlorosplast May Be Discoid,Cup-Shaped,Spiral or Ribbon shapedin different species.
* Most of the m embers have one or more storage bodies called pyrenoids tht are localised around the chloroplast.
* Cell Wall In a layer is made of cellulose and outer layer is called Pectin
* [[Asexual reproduction|A.R]] is by zoospores. They are flagellates produced from the parent cells by Mitosis.
* [[Sexual reproduction of plants|S.R]] is by Isogamus,Anisogamus or Oogamus
* Starch Is Deposited On Small Bodies Called Pyrenoids
<big>'''Reproduction'''</big>

Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by formation of spores. Asexual reproduction is by flagelated [[zoosporangia]].
The sexual reproduction shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it may be [[isogamous]], [[anisogamous]] or [[oogamous]].
 
They share many similarities with the higher plants, including the presence of asymmetrical flagellated cells, the breakdown of the nuclear envelope at mitosis, and the presence of phytochromes, flavonoids, and the chemical precursors to the cuticle.<ref>Raven, Evert and Eichhorn.

==Classification==

The following orders are typically recognised:

* [[Dunaliellales]] (e.g. ''[[Dunaliella]]'')
* [[Volvocales]] (e.g. ''[[Volvox]]'', ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'')
* [[Chlorococcales]] (e.g. ''[[Nannochloris]]'')
* [[Oedogoniales]] (e.g. ''[[Oedogonium]]'')
* [[Sphaeropleales]]
* [[Chaetophorales]]
* [[Microsporales]]
* [[Tetrasporales]] (e.g. ''[[Tetraspora]]'')

In older classifications, the term Chlorophyceae is sometimes used to apply to all the green algae except the [[Charales]], and the internal division is considerably different.<!-- reference needed -->
