The [[Trans–West African Coastal Highway]] provides a paved link to [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]] and [[Nigeria]], with paved highways to landlocked [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] feeding into the coastal highway. When construction of roads and bridges in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] is complete, the highway will link to another seven [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) nations to the west and north-west.

== Waterways ==
980&nbsp;km navigable rivers, canals, and numerous coastal lagoons

== Ports and harbors ==
Harbor activity is concentrated at [[Abidjan]] (West Africa’s largest container port), which has facilities that include a fishing port and equipment for handling containers, and [[San Pédro, Côte d'Ivoire|San Pedro]], a deepwater port that began operations in 1971. There are also small ports at [[Sassandra]], [[Aboisso]], and [[Dabou]]. Two nationalized shipping lines serve West Africa and [[Europe]].

== Airports ==

[[Nouvelle Air Ivoire]] is the national carrier of Ivory Coast. Recently formed from the failed [[Air Ivoire]], the airline operates an aging fleet of Western-built aircraft. It is owned by Air France and the U.S. Finance company AIG. Air Ivoire was forced to cease operations a number of times due to technical and financial difficulties.

===Security and safety concerns===
There is rampant corruption among airport officials in Ivory Coast.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Immigration officials have been known to ask for bribes to 'expedite' processing the forms, or to offer to fill out the customs forms prior to demanding a 'fee' for doing so. The anti-French sentiment, peaking in early 2003, spilled over onto airports when 1,500 French nationals were trapped in Abidjan's airport by an anti-French mob.
