The '''AIM-54 Phoenix''' is a radar-guided, long-range [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), carried in clusters of up to six missiles on [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcats]], its only launch platform. The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile. The weapons system based on Phoenix was the world's first to allow simultaneous guidance of missiles against multiple targets. Both the missile and the aircraft were used by the [[United States Navy]] and are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]s, employed on the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Following the retirement of the F-14 by the U.S. Navy, the weapon's only current operator is [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]]. [[Multiservice tactical brevity code#F|Brevity code]] "Fox Three" was used when firing the AIM-54.

==Background==
Since 1951, the Navy faced the initial threat from the [[Tupolev Tu-4|Tupolev Tu-4K 'Bull']] carrying<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=kGyc0NZEe_QC&lpg=PT41&dq=%22Tu-4K%22&pg=PT41#v=onepage&q=%22Tu-4K%22&f=false</ref> [[anti-ship missile]]s. Eventually, during the height of the Cold War, the threat would have actually expanded into regimental-size raids of [[Tu-16 Badger]] and [[Tu-22M Backfire]] bombers equipped with low-flying, long-range, high-speed, nuclear-armed cruise missiles and considerable [[Electronic Counter Measures]] (ECM) of various types.

The Navy would require a long-range, long-endurance [[interceptor aircraft]] to defend [[carrier battle group]]s against this threat.  The projected [[F6D Missileer]] was intended to fulfill this mission and oppose the attack far from the fleet it was defending. The weapon needed for interceptor aircraft, the Bendix [[AAM-N-10 Eagle]], would be an air-to-air missile of unprecedented range when compared to contemporary [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] missiles. It would work together with [[Westinghouse AN/APQ-81]] radar.

==Development==
[[File:AIM-54A first test A-3A NAN11-66.jpg|thumb|left|An AIM-54A launched from the [[A-3 Skywarrior|NA-3A]]-testbed in 1966]]
The Missileer project was cancelled in December 1960, but in the early 1960s Navy made the next interceptor attempt with the [[General Dynamics/Grumman F-111B|F-111B]], and they needed a new missile design.

At the same time, the [[USAF]] canceled the projects for their land-based high-speed interceptor aircraft, the [[North American XF-108 Rapier]] and the [[Lockheed YF-12]], and left the capable [[AIM-47 Falcon]] missile at a quite advanced stage of development, but with no effective launch platform.

The AIM-54 Phoenix, developed for the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with 4 cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the AIM-47.
One characteristic of the Missileer ancestry was that the radar sent it mid-course corrections, which allowed the fire control system to "loft" the missile up over the target into thinner air where it had better range.

The F-111B was canceled in 1968. Its weapons system, the AIM-54 working with the [[AWG-9 radar]], migrated to the new U.S. Navy fighter project, the VFX, which would later become the [[F-14|F-14 Tomcat]].

In 1977, development of a significantly improved Phoenix version, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical anti-naval aircraft and cruise missiles, and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging ECM.<ref>http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html</ref>

In contrast to the Navy, the USAF adopted neither the AIM-47 nor the AIM-54 operationally. Its [[F-15 Eagle]] [[fighter plane]]s have no similar capability at extremely long ranges. The latest [[AIM-120 AMRAAM|AIM-120D AMRAAM]] has a significantly lower range of about {{convert|75|mi|km}}, but the AMRAAM is much smaller, lighter, and more flexible in its use. The AMRAAM is also usable by a wide variety of fighter planes, including the F-4, F-15, F-16, F-18, F-22, [[Panavia Tornado]], [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[F-35 Lightning II]], Swedish-made fighters, and ground-based launchers of the Norwegian and [[U.S. Army]].

==Usage in comparison to other weapon systems==
The AIM-54/AWG-9 combination was the first to have multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to 6 Phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} missile is equipped with a conventional warhead. The AWG-9 radar system carried by the F-111B and F-14 Tomcat was one of largest and most powerful ever fitted to a fighter.

On the F-14, the 4 missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, plus 2 under glove stations. A full load of 6 Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weigh in at over {{convert|8000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, about twice the weight of Sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of 4 Phoenix, 2 Sparrow and 2 Sidewinder missiles.

Before the introduction of the Phoenix missile, most other US aircraft relied on the smaller, less-expensive [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]; classified as a Medium Range Missile (MRM). Guidance for the Sparrow required that the launching aircraft use its radar to continuously illuminate a single target for the missile's "passive" seeker to track, or guidance would be lost. This method meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow, effectively reducing situational awareness.

The Tomcat's [[AN/AWG-9|AWG-9]] radar was capable of tracking up to 24 targets in [[Track-While-Scan]] mode, with the AWG-9 selecting up to six priority targets for potential launch by the AIM-54. The pilot or [[Radar Intercept Officer]] (RIO) could then launch the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles when launch parameters were met. The large Tactical Information Display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave an unprecedented amount of information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and, importantly, the AWG-9 could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining [[situational awareness]] of the battlespace.

Link-4 datalink capability allowed US Navy Tomcats to share information with the [[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] [[airborne early warning|AEW]] aircraft, and during [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] in 1990, the Link-4A was introduced and allowed the Tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better Link-16 datalink "picture" to the cockpit.

===Active guidance===
[[File:F-14A VF-1 launching AIM-54 Phoenix.JPEG|thumb|AIM-54 Phoenix seconds after launch (1991)]]
The Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between {{convert|80000|ft|m|-3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100000|ft|m|-4|abbr=on}} at close to Mach 5. Phoenix uses its high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance.<ref name="Directory">[http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-54.html "AIM-54"]. (2004) Directory of US Military Rockets and Missiles. Retrieved 28 November 2010.</ref> Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around {{convert|2|nmi|km|abbr=on}}; active homing would initiate upon launch at this distance.<ref name="Directory"/>

==Legacy==
[[File:AIM-54 Phoenix cropped.jpg|thumb|left|An AIM-54 Phoenix being attached to an F-14 wing pylon. Note the forward fins have not been installed yet (2003)]]
The AIM-54 Phoenix was retired from USN service on September 30, 2004. F-14 Tomcats were retired on September 22, 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]s, employed on the [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]. Both the F-14 Tomcat and AIM-54 Phoenix missile continue in the service of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], although the operational abilities of these aircraft and the missiles are questionable, since the US refused to supply spare parts and maintenance after the 1979 revolution; except for a brief period during the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].

Despite the much-vaunted capabilities, the Phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in US Navy service, though a large number of [[Iranian aerial victories during the Iran-Iraq war|kills]] were claimed by Iranian F-14s during the [[Iranâ€“Iraq War]]. The USAF [[F-15 Eagle]] had responsibility for overland [[Combat Air Patrol]] (CAP) duties in [[Desert Storm]] in 1991, primarily because of the onboard F-15 [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] capabilities. The Tomcat did not have the requisite IFF capability mandated by the [[JFACC]] to satisfy the Rules of Engagement (ROE) to utilize the Phoenix capability at [[Beyond Visual Range]] (BVR). From an engineering and service standpoint, the Phoenix could be said to be a notable success. As the only surviving member of the Falcon missile family, it was not adopted by any other nation (besides [[Iran]]), any other US armed service, or used on any other aircraft. It was heavy, large, expensive and not practical in close combat compared to the Sparrow or AMRAAM. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Variants==
[[File:Phoenix missile at Grumman Memorial Park.jpg|thumb|An AIM-54A "Phoenix" missile on display at [[Grumman Memorial Park]] in New York State.]]

;AIM-54A: The original model that became operational with the [[U.S. Navy]] in about 1974, and it was also exported to [[Iran]] in modest numbers before the [[Iran hostage crisis]] beginning in 1979.

;AIM-54B: Also known as the 'Dry' missile. A version with simplified construction and no coolant conditioning. Did not enter series production. Developmental work started in January of 1972. 7 X-AIM-54B missiles were created for testing, 6 of them by modifying pilot production IVE/PIP rounds. After two successful test firings, the 'Dry' missile effort was cancelled for being "not cost effective".<ref name=DeptNav_FY83>DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY  SUPPORTING DATA FOR FISCAL YEAR 1983  BUDGET ESTIMATES DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARIES</ref>

;AIM-54C: The lone improved model that was ever produced. It used [[digital electronics]] in the place of the analog electronics of the AIM-54A. This model had better abilities to shoot down low and high-altitude [[antiship missile]]s. This model took over from the AIM-54A beginning in 1986.

;AIM-54 ECCM/[[Sealed round]]: Had more capabilities in [[electronic counter-countermeasures]]. It did not require coolant conditioning during flights on board F-14s and not fired (the usual situation). Deployed beginning in 1988.

:Because the AIM-54 ECCM/Sealed received no coolant, [[F-14 Tomcat]]s carrying this version of the missile could not exceed a specified airspeed.

There were also test, evaluation, ground training, and captive air training versions of the missile; designated ATM-54, AEM-54, DATM-54A, and CATM-54. The flight versions had A and C versions. The DATM-54 was not made in a C version as there was no change in the ground handling characteristics.


;'''Sea Phoenix''': This was a 1970s proposal for a ship launched version of the Phoenix as an alternative/replacement for the [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] point defense system. It would also have provided a medium range SAM capability for smaller and/or non-Aegis equipped vessels (such as the [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV]]). The Sea Phoenix system would have included a modified shipborne version of the [[AN/AWG-9]] radar. Hughes Aircraft touted the fact that 27 out of 29 major elements of the standard (airborne) AN/AWG-9 could be used in the shipborne version with little modification. Each system would have consisted of one AWG-9 radar, with associated controls and displays, and a fixed 12-cell launcher for the Phoenix missiles. In the case of an aircraft carrier, for example, at least three systems would have been fitted in order to give overlapping coverage throughout the full 360Â°.<ref name=JanesWS76>Jane's Weapon Systems 1977</ref> Both land and ship based tests of modified Phoenix (''AIM-54A'') missiles and a containerised AWG-9 (originally the 14th example off the AN/AWG-9 production line) were successfully carried out from 1974 onwards.<ref name=Tarpgaard>P. T. Tarpgaard, "The Sea Phoenix-A Warship Design Study", ASNE Journal, Vol. 88, No. 2, pp. 31-44, 1976.</ref> Incidently a land based version for the [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] was also proposed. It has been suggested that the ''AIM-54B'' would have been used in operational Sea Phoenix systems, although that version had been cancelled by the second half of the 1970s. Ultimately, a mix of budgetary and political issues meant that, despite being technically and operationally attractive, further development of the Sea Phoenix was not proceeded with.

==Iranian combat experiences with the AIM-54 Phoenix==
[[File:Irani F-14 Tomcats carrying AIM-54 Phoenixs.jpg|thumb|300px|Two F-14 Tomcats of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force|IRIAF]], armed with different types of air-to-air missiles, including AIM-54 Phoenixes.]]
There is very little information available regarding Iran's use of its 79 F-14A Tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most [[Western world|western]] outlets; the exception being a book released by [[Osprey Publishing]] titled ''"Iranian F-14 Tomcats in Combat"'' by Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml | title =Book: Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat| publisher = Acig |accessdate= 3 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100130102218/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_452.shtml| archivedate= 30 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Most of the research contained in the book was based on pilot interviews.

Reports vary on the use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0077.shtml |title=Iranian Air Force F-14 | publisher=Aerospace Web|accessdate= 3 February 2010}}</ref> during the [[Iranâ€“Iraq War]], 1980â€“88.  Unverified rumors that US technical personnel sabotaged the aircraft and weapons before they left the country following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] imply that the Iranians might have found it impossible to fire the missiles.  However, the IRIAF was able to repair the sabotage and the damage only affected a limited number of planes, not the entire fleet.

Some claim that it is unlikely that the Phoenix was used operationally. First, as difficult as the missile and fire control systems were to operate, Iran had hired many American technicians.  Upon leaving, they took most of the knowledge about how to operate and maintain these complex weapon systems with them. Also, without a steady supply of engineering support from Hughes Aircraft Missile Systems Group and corresponding spares and upgrades, even a technically competent operator would have extreme difficulty fielding operational weapons.

Others claim that the primary use of the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] was as an [[airborne early warning]] aircraft, guarded by other fighters.  However, Cooper claims that the IRIAF used the F-14 actively as a fighter-interceptor, and at times as an escort fighter with the AIM-54 scoring 60â€“70 kills. F-14s were often used to protect IRIAF tankers supporting strike packages into Iraq, and scanned over the border with their radars, often engaging detected Iraqi flights. Also, some F-14s were modified into specialized airborne early warning aircraft.

Supporters of these claims point to the fact that, in the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]], Iraqi fighter pilots consistently turned and fled as soon as American F-14 pilots turned on their fighters' very distinctive [[AN/AWG-9]] radars, which suggests that Iraqi pilots had learned to avoid the F-14. 

According to Cooper, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force was able to keep its F-14 fighters and AIM-54 missiles in regular use during the entire Iranâ€“Iraq War, though periodic lack of spares grounded at times large parts of the fleet.  At worst, during late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with less than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh [[thermal batteries]] that could only be purchased from the US. Iran managed finally, to find a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteries â€” though those did cost up to $10,000 USD each. Iran did receive spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the Iranâ€“Iraq War, and has received more spares after the conflict. Iran started a heavy industrial program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.<ref>{{cite web | last = Theimer| first = Sharon | title = Iran Gets Army Gear in Pentagon Sale | url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | publisher = Forbes | accessdate = 2007-01-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070119084031/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/01/16/ap3334088.html | archivedate = 2007-01-19}}</ref>
