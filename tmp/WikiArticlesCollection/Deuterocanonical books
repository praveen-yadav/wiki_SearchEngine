'''Deuterocanonical books''' is a term used since the 16th century in the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Christianity]] to describe certain books and passages of the Christian [[Old Testament]] that are not part of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The term is used in contrast to the [[protocanonical books]], which are contained in the Hebrew Bible. This distinction had previously contributed to debate in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]] about whether they should be classified as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] texts. The term is used as a matter of convenience by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] and other Churches to refer to books of their Old Testament which are not part of the [[Masoretic Text]].

The Deuterocanonical books are considered [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by [[Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]], but are considered non-canonical by most [[Protestantism|Protestants]]. The word ''deuterocanonical'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning 'belonging to the second canon'.

The original usage of the term distinguished these scriptures both from those considered ''[[Biblical apocrypha|non-canonical]]'' and from those considered ''[[protocanonical books|protocanonical]]''. However, some editions of the [[Bible]] include text from both deuterocanonical and non-canonical scriptures in a single section designated "[[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]". This arrangement can lead to conflation between the otherwise distinct terms "deuterocanonical" and "apocryphal".

==History==
Deuterocanonical is a term coined in 1566 by the theologian [[Sixtus of Siena]], who had converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] from Judaism, to describe scriptural texts of the [[Old Testament]] considered [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by the Catholic Church, but which are not present in the Hebrew Bible, and which had been omitted by some early canon lists, especially in the [[Eastern Christianity|East]].<ref name="isbe">[http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/C/CANON+OF+THE+OLD+TESTAMENT%2C+II/ Canon of the Old Testament, II, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1915]</ref><ref name="cathenOT">{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Canon of the Old Testament}}</ref><ref>Commonly cited include (1) [[Melito of Sardis]], who went ''east'', to Palestine, and recorded the canon he found being used in the synagogues, as recorded in Eusebius' ''Church History'' 4.26.13–14, (2) [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], (3) [[Council of Laodicea]], (4) [[Jerome]] residing in [[Bethlehem]]</ref>

Their acceptance among [[early Christians]] was widespread, though not universal, and the Bible of the early Church always included, with varying degrees of recognition, books now called ''deuterocanonical''.<ref>J.N.D. Kelly, "Early Christian Doctrines", p.53</ref> Some say that their canonicity seems not to have been doubted in the Church until it was challenged by Jews after AD 100,<ref>Stuart G. Hall, "Doctrine and Practice in the Early Church", p.28</ref> sometimes postulating a hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]]. Regional councils in the [[Western Christianity|West]] published official canons that included these books as early as the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th]] and 5th centuries.<ref name="cathenOT"/><ref>e.g. the [[Council of Carthage]], the [[Council of Rome]], the [[Gelasian decree]]</ref>

===Dead Sea scrolls===
Fragments of three deuterocanonical books have been found among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] found at [[Qumran]], in addition to several partial copies of ''[[I Enoch]]'' and ''[[Jubilees]]'' from the Ethiopic deuterocanon. ''[[Sirach]]'', whose [[Hebrew]] text was already known from the [[Cairo Geniza]], has been found in two scrolls (2QSir or 2Q18, 11QPs_a or 11Q5) in Hebrew. Another Hebrew scroll of ''Sirach'' has been found in [[Masada]] (MasSir).<ref name="Abegg">{{cite book| last1 = Abegg| first1 = Martin| last2 = Flint| first2 = Peter| last3 = Ulrich| first3 = Eugene| title = The Dead Sea Scroll Bible| year = 1999| publisher = HarperOne| isbn = 978-0-06-060064-8 }}</ref>{{rp|597}} The ''[[Book of Tobit]]'' has been found in Qumran in four scrolls written in [[Aramaic]] and in one written in Hebrew.<ref name="Abegg"/>{{rp|636}} The ''[[Letter of Jeremiah]]'' (or ''[[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]'' chapter 6) has been found in cave 7 (7Q5) in [[Koine Greek|Greek]].<ref name="Abegg"/>{{rp|628}} It has been theorized by recent scholars<ref>Lena Cansdale 1997, ''Qumran and the Essenes'' p. 14 ff. cites Rengstorf 1963, Golb 1980, and several others, as well as detractors of this theory.</ref> that the Qumran library was not entirely produced at Qumran, but may have included part of the library of the Jerusalem Temple, that may have been hidden in the caves for safekeeping at the time the Temple was destroyed by Romans in 70&nbsp;AD.

===Influence of the Septuagint===
The large majority of Old Testament references in the [[New Testament]] are taken from the Greek [[Septuagint]] (LXX)—which includes the deuterocanonical books, as well as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] —both of which are called collectively αναγιγνοσκόμενα ''anagignoskomena'' (things that are read or "profitable reading").<ref>[http://users.auth.gr/~pv/inspiration.htm Prof. Petros Vassiliadis defines the work thusly]</ref> Several appear to have been written originally in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but the original text has long been lost. Archaeological finds, however, discovered some original texts among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]]. The Septuagint was widely accepted and used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] in the 1st century, even in the region of [[Iudaea Province|Roman Judea]], and therefore naturally became the text most widely used by early Christians, who were predominantly Greek speaking.

In the New Testament, Hebrews 11:35 refers to an event that was
recorded in one of the deuterocanonical books [[2 Maccabees]].<ref>[[Jimmy Akin|James Akin]], [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/DEUTEROS.htm Defending the Deuterocanonicals]</ref>
Other New Testament authors also quote period literature which was familiar to the audience but that was not included in the Old Testament or the deuterocanonical books. For instance, Paul cites Greek writers and philosophers, and the author of Hebrews references oral tradition which spoke of an Old Testament prophet who was sawn in half in Hebrews 11:37, two verses after the 2nd Maccabees reference.

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] speaks of there being 22 books in the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]],<ref>[[Josephus]] writes in ''[[Against Apion]]'', I, 8: "We have not 10,000 books among us, disagreeing with and contradicting one another, but only twenty-two books which contain the records of all time, and are justly believed to be divine." These 22 books make up the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]].</ref> a Jewish tradition reported also by the Christian bishop [[Athanasius]]. However, included in Athanasius's list of 22 [[Old Testament]] books are [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]]. At the same time, he mentioned that certain other books, including five deuterocanonical books but also the [[Didache]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]], while not being part of the canon, "were appointed by the Fathers to be read". He excluded what he called "apocryphal writings" entirely.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxv.iii.iii.xxv.html Athanasius of Alexandria, Excerpt from Letter 39]</ref>

==In the Catholic Church==
In the [[Catholic Church]], "the first infallible and effectually promulgated pronouncement on the [[Canon of the Bible|Canon]]"<ref name="canonOT">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03267a.htm Canon of the Old Testament], ''Catholic Encyclopedia''</ref> was that defined by the [[Council of Trent]].<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct04.html Council of Trent, Session 4, 8 April 1546].</ref> Among the minority, in Trent, that showed opposition to these books' inclusion were Cardinals [[Seripando]] and [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]], the latter an opponent of Luther at Augsburg.<ref>Hubert Jedin, ''Papal Legate At The Council Of Trent'' (St Louis: B. Herder Book Co., 1947), pp. 270-71,78.</ref><ref>Commentary on all the Authentic Historical Books of the Old Testament,'' In ult. Cap., Esther.</ref><ref>[http://aomin.org/aoblog/index.php?itemid=1877 Bill Webster Responds to Gary Michuta, Part III]</ref> However, Trent confirmed the statements of earlier and less authoritative regional councils which also included the deuterocanonical books, such as the [[Synod of Hippo]] (393), and the [[Councils of Carthage]] of 397. Much later (15th century), the [[Council of Florence]] taught the divine inspiration of these books, but "did not formally pass on their canonicity.
"<ref name="canonOT"/><ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum17.htm Council of Florence, Session 11, 4 February 1442]</ref>

In the canonical debate between Catholics and Protestants controversy remains as to the significance of Trent's omission of the Septuagint version of [[1 Esdras]] which Carthage may have ratified.<ref>[http://aomin.org/aoblog/index.php?itemid=1876&catid=7 Alpha & Omega Ministries Apologetics Blog, ''Bill Webster Responds to Gary Michuta, Part II'']</ref> However, there is ambiguity over the [[Esdras#Differences in names|naming of the books of Esdras]]. The ''Canon of Carthage''<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.xxv.html Schaff's ''Seven Ecumenical Councils'': The Canons of the CCXVII Blessed Fathers who assembled at Carthage: Canon XXIV]</ref> lists two books of Esdras. This could mean 1 Esdras and [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] as in the Septuagint or [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] as in the Vulgate.

The Catholic deuterocanonical scriptural texts are:
* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]
* [[Book of Judith|Judith]]
* [[Additions to Esther]] ([[Vulgate]] [[Esther]] 10:4-16:24)<ref>See also [http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/index.htm#esther Esther] in the [[New American Bible|NAB]].</ref>
* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]] (or [[Wisdom of Solomon]])
* [[Wisdom of Jesus ben Sira]] (or [[Sirach]] or [[Ecclesiasticus]])
* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]], including the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] ([[Book of Jeremiah#Septuagint version|Additions to Jeremiah in the Septuagint]])<ref>''An Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek'', [[Henry Barclay Swete]], Cambridge University Press, 1914, Part II, Chapter III, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/swete/greekot.iv.iii.html Section 6], "Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah were regarded by the Church as adjuncts of Jeremiah, much in the same way as Susanna and Bel were attached to Daniel. Baruch and the Epistle occur in lists which rigorously exclude the non-canonical books; they are cited as 'Jeremiah' (Iren. v. 35. I, Tert. scorp. 8, [[Clement of Alexandria]] ''[[Paedagogus]]'' i. 10, [[Cyprian]], ''Testimonia'' ii. 6); with Lamentations they form a kind of trilogy supplementary to the prophecy."; The [http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canon of Trent] specifies "Ieremias cum Baruch" (Jeremiah with Baruch).</ref>

** [[Bel and the Dragon]] (Vulgate Daniel 14, Septuagint epilogue)
* [[1 Maccabees]]
* [[2 Maccabees]]

===Influence of the Vulgate===
[[Jerome]] in the [[Vulgate#Prologues|Vulgate's prologues]]<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/prologi.shtml ''Prologues of St. Jerome'', Latin text]</ref> describes a canon which excludes the deuterocanonical books, possibly excepting [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]. In his ''Prologues'', Jerome mentions all of the deuterocanonical and apocryphal works by name as being apocryphal or "not in the canon" except for ''Prayer of Manasses'' and ''Baruch''. He mentions ''Baruch'' by name in his [http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=233 ''Prologue to Jeremiah''] and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or "not in the canon".<ref>Since some ancients counted Baruch as part of Jeremiah, it is conceivable though unlikely that Jerome counted Baruch under the name of Jeremiah when he enumerated the canon in his ''Prologus Galeatus''.</ref> The inferior status to which the deuteros were relegated by authorities like Jerome is seen by some as being due to a rigid conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, to be entitled to this supreme dignity, must be received by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the "confirmation of the doctrine of the Church".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03267a.htm New Advent, "Canon of the Old Testament"]</ref> Eventually however, Jerome's [[Vulgate]] did include the deuterocanonical books as well as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]]. Jerome referenced and quoted from some as scripture despite describing them as "not in the canon". In his prologue to [[Judith]], without using the word canon, he mentioned that Judith was held to be scriptural by the [[First Council of Nicaea]].<ref>[http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=224 Jerome’s Prologue to Judith]</ref> In his reply to Rufinus, he affirmed that he was consistent with the choice of the church regarding which version of the deuterocanonical portions of Daniel to use, which the Jews of his day did not include:

:What sin have I committed if I followed the judgment of the churches? But he who brings charges against me for relating the objections that the Hebrews are wont to raise against the [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Story of Susanna]], the [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Song of the Three Children]], and the story of [[Bel and the Dragon]], which are not found in the Hebrew volume, proves that he is just a foolish sycophant. For I was not relating my own personal views, but rather the remarks that they [the Jews] are wont to make against us. (''Against Rufinus'', 11:33 [AD 402]).

Thus Jerome acknowledged the principle by which the canon would be settled —the judgment of the Church, rather than his own judgment or the judgment of Jews, though he wondered why one would sanction the version of a [[heresy|heretic]] and [[judaizer]].<ref>[http://beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2006/06/guest-blogdid-jerome-change-his-mind.html Ray Aviles, "Did Jerome change his mind on the apocrypha"]</ref>

The Vulgate is also important as the touchstone of the canon concerning which parts of books are canonical. When the [[Council of Trent]] listed the books included in the canon, it qualified the books as being "entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition".<ref>[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session], 1546.</ref> This decree was clarified somewhat by [[Pope Pius XI]] on June 2, 1927, who allowed that the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute, and it was further explicated by [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[Divino Afflante Spiritu]].

==Reception in Orthodox Christianity and other churches==
{{Bible related}}
Outside of the Roman Catholic Church, the term deuterocanonical is sometimes used, by way of analogy, to describe books that [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] included in the [[Old Testament]] that are not part of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Tanakh]], nor the [[Protestant]] [[Old Testament]]. Among Orthodox, the term is understood to mean that they were compiled separately from the primary canon, as explained in 2 Esdras, where Esdras is instructed to keep certain books separate and hidden.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Eastern Orthodox Churches have traditionally included all the books of the Septuagint in their Old Testaments. The Greeks use the word ''Anagignoskomena'' (Ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα "readable, worthy to be read") to describe the books of the Greek [[Septuagint]] that are not present in the Hebrew [[Tanakh]]. When Orthodox theologians use the term "deuterocanonical," it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.<ref>[http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ Orthodox Answer To a Question About Apocrypha, Canon, Deuterocanonical - Answer #39]</ref>

The Eastern Orthodox books included in the Old Testament are the seven deuterocanonical books listed above, plus [[3 Maccabees]] and [[1 Esdras]] (also included in the [[Clementine Vulgate]]), while Baruch is divided from the Epistle of Jeremiah, making a total of 49 Old Testament books in contrast with the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] 39-book canon.<ref name = "Kimbrough">{{cite book| author = S. T. Kimbrough| title = Orthodox And Wesleyan Scriptual Understanding And Practice| url = http://books.google.com/?id=q-vhwjamOioC&pg=PA23| year = 2005| publisher = St Vladimir's Seminary Press| isbn = 978-0-88141-301-4| page = 23 }}</ref>

Like the Roman Catholic deuterocanonical books, these texts are integrated with the rest of the Old Testament, not printed in a separate section.

Other texts printed in Orthodox Bibles are considered of some value (like the additional [[Psalm 151]], and the [[Prayer of Manasses]]) or are included as an appendix (like the Greek [[4 Maccabees]], and the Slavonic [[2 Esdras]]).<ref name=Kimbrough/>

===Ethiopian Orthodoxy===
In the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] Bible used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Church (an Oriental Orthodox Church), those books of the Old Testament that are still counted as canonical, but not by all other Churches, are often set in a separate section titled ''"Deeyutrokanoneekal"'' (ዲዩትሮካኖኒካል), which is the same word. The Ethiopian Orthodox Deuterocanon, in addition to the standard set listed above, along with the books of Esdras and ''Prayer of Minasse'', also includes some books that are still held canonical by only the Ethiopian Church, including Enoch or ''Henok'' ([[I Enoch]]), ''Kufale'' ([[Jubilees]]) and 1, 2 and 3 [[Meqabyan]] (which are sometimes wrongly confused with the "Books of Maccabees").

==Jewish position==
{{main|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
Judaism and most Protestant versions of the Bible exclude these books. It is commonly said that [[Judaism]] officially excluded the deuterocanonicals and the additional Greek texts listed here from their Scripture in the [[Council of Jamnia]] (c.70-90&nbsp;AD), but this claim is also disputed.<ref>Albert C. Sundberg, Jr., [http://department.monm.edu/classics/Speel_Festschrift/sundbergJr.htm "The Old Testament of the Early Church" Revisited 1997]</ref>

==Reception in Christian churches having their origins in the Reformation==
===Anglicanism===
There is a great deal of overlap between the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of the original 1611 [[King James Bible]] and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct. The Apocrypha section of the original 1611 [[King James Bible]] includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which were not included in the list of the canonical books by the [[Council of Trent]]:
* [[1 Esdras]] ([[Vulgate]] 3 Esdras)
* [[2 Esdras]] (Vulgate 4 Esdras)
* [[Prayer of Manasses]]

These books make up the [[Biblical apocrypha#Clementine Vulgate|Apocrypha]] section of the [[Vulgate#Clementine Vulgate|Clementine Vulgate]]: [[3 Esdras]] ([[1 Esdras]]); [[4 Esdras]] ([[2 Esdras]]); and [[The Prayer of Manasseh]], where they are specifically described as "outside of the series of the canon". The 1609 [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douai Bible]] includes them in an appendix, but they have been dropped from recent Catholic translations into English. They are found, along with the deuterocanonical books, in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of Protestant bibles.

Using the word apocrypha (Greek: hidden away) to describe texts, although not necessarily pejorative, implies to some people that the writings in question should not be included in the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of the [[Books of the Bible|Bible]]. This classification commingles them with certain non-canonical [[gospel]]s and [[New Testament Apocrypha]]. The ''Style Manual for the Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical literature'' instead of ''Apocrypha'' in academic writing.

The [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of Religion of the [[Church of England]] lists the deuterocanonical books as suitable to be read for "example of life and instruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to establish any doctrine." The early lectionaries of the Anglican Church (as included in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1662) included the deuterocanonical books amongst the cycle of readings, and passages from them were used in the services (such as the [[Benedicite]])

Readings from the deuterocanonical books are now included in most, if not all, of the modern lectionaries in the Anglican Communion, based on the Revised Common Lectionary (in turn based on the post-conciliar Roman Catholic lectionary).

===Presbyterianism===
The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a [[Calvinist]] document that serves as a systematic summary of doctrine for the [[Church of Scotland]] and [[Presbyterian]] churches worldwide, recognizes only the sixty-six books of the [[Biblical canon#Canons of various Christian traditions|Protestant canon]] as authentic Scripture. Chapter 1, Article 3 of the Confession reads: "The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings."

===Reformed churches===
The [[Belgic Confession]], used in [[Reformed churches]], devotes a section (Article 6) to "The difference between the canonical and apocryphal books" and asserts that "All which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power and efficacy as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of faith or of the Christian religion; much less to detract from the authority of the other sacred books."

==New Testament apocrypha and deuterocanonicals==
{{Main|Antilegomena}}
{{See also|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The term ''deuterocanonical'' is sometimes used to describe the canonical [[antilegomena]], those books of the [[New Testament]] which, like the deuterocanonicals of the Old Testament, were not universally accepted by the early Church, but which are now included in the 27 books of the [[New Testament]] recognized by almost all [[Christianity|Christians]]. The deuterocanonicals of the New Testament are as follows:
* The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]
* The [[Epistle of James]]
* The [[Second Epistle of Peter]]
* The [[Second Epistle of John]]
* The [[Third Epistle of John]]
* The [[Epistle of Jude]]
* The [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]] (also known as the [[Book of Revelation]])
