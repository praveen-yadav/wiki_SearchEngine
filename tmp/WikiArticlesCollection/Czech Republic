The '''Czech Republic''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Czech Republic.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|k}} {{respell|CHEK|'}};<ref>[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary], second edition, Oxford University Press, 1989.</ref> {{lang-cs|Česká republika}}, {{IPA-cs|ˈt͡ʃɛskaː ˈrɛpuˌblɪka|pron|Ceska Republika.ogg}}, short form ''Česko'' {{IPA-cs|ˈt͡ʃɛsko}}) is a [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Europe]]. The country is bordered by [[Germany]] to the west, [[Austria]] to the south, [[Slovakia]] to the east and [[Poland]] to the north. Its capital and largest city, with 1.3 million inhabitants, is [[Prague]]. The Czech Republic includes the historical territories of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] and a small part of [[Silesia]].

The Czech state, formerly known as '''Bohemia''' (''Čechy''), was formed in the late 9th century as a small [[duchy]] around Prague, at that time under the dominance of the powerful [[Great Moravia]]n Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power was transferred from Moravia to Bohemia, under the [[House of Přemysl|Přemyslids]]. Since 1002 it was formally recognized as part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name="The Path">{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.cz/assets/udalosti/vystavy/Cesty-ceske-ustavnosti.pdf|title=The Path of Czech Constitutionality|last=Mlsna|first=Petr|coauthors=Šlehofer F. and Urban D.|year=2010|work=1st edition|publisher=Úřad Vlády České Republiky (The Office of the Government of the Czech Republic)|pages=10–11|language=: (Bilingual) – Czech, English|accessdate=31 October 2012|location=Praha}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacr.cz/zpravy/zlatabula800.aspx|title=800 let Zlaté buly sicilské|last=Čumlivski|first=Denko|year=2012|publisher=National Archives of the Czech Republic (Národní Archiv České Republiky)|language=czech|accessdate=31 October 2012|archiveurl=http://www.nacr.cz/zpravy/zlatabula800.aspx|archivedate=1 October 2012}}</ref> In 1212 the duchy was raised to a kingdom and during the rule of Přemyslid dukes/kings and their successors, the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourgs]], the country reached its greatest territorial extent (13th–14th century). During the [[Hussite wars]] the kingdom faced economic embargoes and crusades from all over Europe. Following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was gradually integrated into the [[Habsburg monarchy]] as one of its three principal parts, alongside the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The [[Bohemian Revolt]] (1618–20) lost in the [[Battle of White Mountain]], led to [[Thirty Years War]] and further centralization of the monarchy including forced recatholization and [[Germanization]]. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian kingdom became part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. In the 19th century the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and the core of the Republic of [[Czechoslovakia]] which was formed in 1918, following the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] after [[World War I]]. After 1933, Czechoslovakia remained the only democracy in [[Central Europe|central]] and eastern Europe.

After the [[Munich Agreement]], [[Zaolzie#Part of Poland (1938–1939)|Polish annexation of Zaolzie]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] and the consequent disillusion with the Western response and gratitude for the liberation of the major portion of Czechoslovakia by the [[Soviet Union|Red Army]], the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] won the majority in the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]]. In the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|1948 coup d'état]], Czechoslovakia became a communist-ruled state. In 1968, the increasing dissatisfaction culminated in attempts to reform the [[communist regime]]. The events, known as the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968, ended with an [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion by the armies]] of the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (with the exception of [[Romania]]); the troops remained in the country until the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], when the communist regime collapsed. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]] into its constituent states, the Czech Republic and the [[Slovak Republic]].

In 2006, the Czech Republic became first former member of the [[Comecon]] to achieve the status of a [[developed country]] according to the [[World Bank]].<ref name="worldbank06">{{Cite web| last = Velinger| first = Jan | title = World Bank Marks Czech Republic's Graduation to 'Developed' Status | publisher=Radio Prague| url = http://www.radio.cz/en/article/76314| date = 28 February 2006| accessdate =22 January 2007 }}</ref> In addition, the country has the highest [[human development index|human development]] in [[Central and Eastern Europe]],<ref name="hdi09">{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2009|work=UNDP.org |format=PDF |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> ranking as a "Very High Human Development" nation.

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{Main|Name of the Czech Republic}}
The traditional English name "Bohemia" derives from Latin "Boiohaemum", which means "home of the [[Boii]]". The current name comes from the endonym ''Čech'', borrowed through Polish and spelt accordingly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0201690#m_en_gb0201690 |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Askoxford.com |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/czech Czech]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 19 November 2012.
</ref>
The name comes from the Slavic tribe (Czechs, {{lang-cs|Čechové}}) and, according to legend, their leader [[Lech, Čech, and Rus|Čech]], who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on [[Říp Mountain]]. The etymology of the word ''Čech'' can be traced back to the [[Proto-Slavic]] root ''*čel-'', meaning "member of the people; kinsman", thus making it [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] to the Czech word ''[[:wiktionary:člověk|člověk]]'' (a person).<ref>{{cite web|last=Spal|first=Jaromír|title=Původ jména Čech|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=4320|publisher=Naše řeč|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

The country has been traditionally divided into lands, namely [[Bohemia proper]] (''Čechy'') in the west, [[Moravia]] (Morava) in the southeast, and [[Czech Silesia]] (''Slezsko''; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast. Known officially as the "Lands of the Bohemian Crown" since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, and the Lands of the Crown of [[Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]]. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]] in 1918, the new name of ''Czechoslovakia'' was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within the one country.

Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single-word name in English. In 1993, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested the name '''Czechia''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|k|i|ə}} (''Česko'' {{IPA-cs|ˈtʃɛsko}} in Czech) as an official alternative in all situations other than formal official documents and the full names of government institutions; however, this has not become widespread in English.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Czech lands}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:Great Moravia Svatopluk.jpg|thumb|upright|Great Moravia during the reign of [[Svatopluk I]]]]
Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the [[Paleolithic]] era. In the [[classical era]], from the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, the [[Boii]] and later in the 1st century, Germanic tribes of [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe.
[[File:Small coat of arms of the Czech Republic.svg|thumb|upright|left|Czech lion with a double tail from the [[Coat of arms of the Czech Republic|Small coat of arms]] first time appeared in the 13th century]]
[[Slavic people]] from the [[Black Sea]]-[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century they moved southwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present day Austria. During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting their Avar rulers, became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe. The [[Great Moravia|Moravian principality]] arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th, when it held off the influence of the Franks and won the protection of the Pope.

===Bohemia===

[[File:Premysl2Gelnhausen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar II]], (c. 1233–1278), King of Bohemia and ruler of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]]]]

The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered Moravia, Silesia and expanded farther to the east. The [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was, as the only kingdom in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was part of the Empire from 1002 till 1806, with the exception of the years 1440–1526. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title "king" since 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the Czech king would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. After the [[Battle of Legnica]], the Mongols carried their raids into [[Moravia]], but were beaten by the Czech royal army in the battle of [[Olomouc]], where [[Genghis Khan]]'s grandson [[Baidar]] was killed. The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.<ref>Jan Dugosz, Maurice Michael (1997) ''The Annals of Jan Dlugosz'', IM Publications, ISBN 1-901019-00-4</ref>

King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar II]] earned the nickname "Iron and Golden King" because of his military power and wealth. He acquired Austria, [[Styria]], Carinthia and [[Carniola]], thus spreading the Bohemian territory to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. He met his death at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] in 1278 in a war with his rival, King [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history03.html |title=The rise and fall of the Przemyslid Dynasty |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] acquired the Polish crown in 1300 for himself and the Hungarian crown for his son. He built a great empire stretching from the [[Danube river]] to the [[Baltic Sea]]. In 1306, the last king of Přemyslid line was murdered in mysterious circumstances in Olomouc while he was resting. After a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of Luxembourg]] gained the Bohemian throne.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panovnici.cz/vaclav-II-kral|title=Václav II. český král|work=panovnici.cz}}</ref>

The 14th century, in particular, the reign of the [[List of rulers of Bohemia|Czech king]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1316–1378), who also became the [[King of Italy]], [[King of the Romans]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]], is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348, [[Charles Bridge]], [[Charles Square]]. Much of [[Prague Castle]] and the [[cathedral of Saint Vitus]] in [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]  were completed during his reign. He unified [[Brandenburg]] (until 1415), [[Lusatia]] (until 1635), and [[Silesia]] (until 1742) under the Czech crown. The [[Black Death]], which had raged in Europe from 1347 to 1352, decimated the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1380,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Czech_Hist4.html |title=The flowering and the decline of the Czech medieval state |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> killing about 10% of the population.<ref>''"[http://books.google.com/books?id=3u3rNCWtv0MC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Plague epidemics in Czech countries]"''. E. Strouhal. p.49.</ref>

[[File:Karel-IV..jpg|thumb|Czech lands during the reign of Charles IV.]]
In the 15th century, the religious and social reformer [[Jan Hus]] formed a movement later named after him. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in [[Konstanz|Constance]] in 1415, his followers seceded from the Catholic Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. [[Petr Chelčický]] continued with the Czech Hussite Reformation movement. During the next two centuries, 90% of the inhabitants became adherents of the Hussite [[Christian movement]].

After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then the hereditary{{When|date=January 2012}} rulers of Bohemia. The [[Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which quickly spread throughout Central Europe. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]], and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The war had a devastating effect on the local population; the people were given the choice either to convert to Catholicism or leave the country.

The following period, from 1620 to the late 18th century, had colloquially often been called the "Dark Age". The population of the [[Czech lands]] declined by a third through war, disease, famine and the expulsion of Protestant Czechs.<ref>Oskar Krejčí, Martin C. Styan, Ústav politických vied SAV. (2005).

The reigns of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and co-regent from 1765, were characterized by [[enlightened absolutism]]. In 1742, most of Silesia (except the southernmost area), at that time the possession of the Bohemian crown, was seized by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[Silesian Wars]]. In 1757 Prusians invaded the Bohemia and after the [[Battle of Prague (1757)]] occupied the city. Destroyed were more than one quarter of Prague and heavy damage suffered also the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]]. However, soon in the [[Battle of Kolín]] Frederick lost and had to vacate the Prague and retreat from Bohemia. The [[Famines in Czech lands|Great Famine]], which lasted from 1770 until 1771, killed about one tenth of the Czech population, or 250,000 inhabitants, and radicalized countrysides leading to peasant uprisings.<ref>"''The Cambridge economic history of Europe: The economic organization of early modern Europe''". E. E. Rich, C. H. Wilson, M. M. Postan (1977). p.614. ISBN 0-521-08710-4</ref>

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Bohemia became part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later of [[Austria–Hungary]]. [[Serfdom]] was not completely abolished until 1848. After the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]] instituted an [[absolute monarchy]] in an effort to balance competing ethnic interests in the empire.

===Czechoslovakia===
{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia}}
An estimated 1.4 million Czech soldiers fought in World War I, of whom some 150,000 died. More than 90,000 Czech volunteers formed the [[Czechoslovak Legions]] in France, Italy and Russia, where they fought against the [[Central Powers]] and later against [[Bolshevik]] troops.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/105664 Radio Praha – zprávy] (30 June 2008) {{cs icon}}</ref> Following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I, the independent republic of [[Czechoslovakia]] was created in 1918. This new country incorporated the [[Bohemian Crown]] (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) and parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (Slovakia and the [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) with significant [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|German]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian]], [[Polish minority in the Czech Republic|Polish]] and [[Ruthenia]]n speaking minorities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tab. 3 Národnost československých státních příslušníků podle žup a zemí k 15.2.1921|url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb.nsf/i/8BE4678613181F2AC1256E66004C77DD/$File/tab3_21.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Czech Statistical Office]]|language=Czech|accessdate=2 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070605105429/http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb.nsf/i/8BE4678613181F2AC1256E66004C77DD/$File/tab3_21.pdf |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}</ref>

In 1929 compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938 Czechoslovakia held a 10th place in the world industrial production.<ref>[http://www.blisty.cz/art/59458.html Ekonomika ČSSR v letech padesátých a šedesátých]</ref>

[[File:Tomáš G Masaryk1918.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], first president of [[Czechoslovakia]].]]
Although Czechoslovakia was a [[unitary state]], it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period. The effects of the [[Great Depression]] including high unemployment and massive propaganda from Nazi Germany, however, resulted in discontent and strong support among ethnic Germans for a break from Czechoslovakia.

[[Adolf Hitler]] took advantage of this opportunity and, using [[Konrad Henlein]]'s separatist [[Sudeten German Party]], gained the largely German speaking [[Sudetenland]] (and its substantial [[Maginot Line]]-like [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|border fortifications]]) through the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]] (signed by [[Nazi Germany]], France, Britain and Italy). Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference and felt betrayed by the United Kingdom and France, so Czechs and Slovaks call the Munich Agreement the [[Western betrayal|Munich Betrayal]] because the military alliance Czechoslovakia had with France and Britain proved useless.

Despite the mobilization of 1.2 million-strong Czechoslovak army and the Franco-Czech military alliance. Poland annexed the [[Zaolzie]] area around [[Český Těšín]]. Hungary gained parts of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus as a result of the [[First Vienna Award]] in November 1938. The remainders of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus gained greater autonomy, with the state renamed to "Czecho-Slovakia". After Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia, allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary and Poland, Slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity, seceding from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939, and allying itself, as demanded by Germany, with Hitler's coalition.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481.</ref>

The remaining Czech territory was occupied by Germany, which transformed it into the so-called [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinate to the Nazi Germany's ''[[Protector (title)|Reichsprotektor]]'' ("imperial protector"). Subcarpathian Rus declared independence as the Republic of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939 but was invaded by Hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day. Approximately 345,000 Czechoslovak citizens, including 277,000 Jews, were killed or executed while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and [[concentration camps]] or used as forced labour. Perhaps two–thirds of the Czech nation was destined either for extermination or removal.<ref>Stephen A. Garrett (1996).

ISBN 0-312-15908-0</ref> A [[Nazism|Nazi German]] concentration camp existed at [[Terezín]], north of Prague.
[[File:Memorial lidice children (2007)-commons.JPG|thumb|A memorial to 82 [[Lidice]] children murdered by the Nazi Germans in Chelmno.]]
There was a strong [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation]], both at home and abroad, most notably with the [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Nazi German leader]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] by Czechoslovakian soldiers [[Jozef Gabčík]] and [[Jan Kubiš]] in a Prague suburb on 27 May 1942. The [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia#Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] and its army fighting against the Germans were acknowledged by the Allies; Czech/Czechoslovak troops fought from the very beginning of the war in Poland, France, the UK, North Africa, the Middle East and the [[Soviet Union]]. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the [[Prague uprising]]. An estimated 140,000 Soviet soldiers died in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&pg=PA409&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A Companion to Russian History]''". Abbott Gleason (2009). Wiley-Blackwell. p.409. ISBN 1-4051-3560-3</ref>

In 1945–1946, almost the entire German minority in Czechoslovakia, about 3 million people, [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II#Czechoslovakia|were expelled]] to Germany and Austria. During this time, thousands of Germans were held in prisons and detention camps or used as forced labour. In the summer of 1945, there were several massacres. The only Germans not expelled were some 250,000 who had been active in the resistance against the Nazi Germans or were considered economically important, though many of these emigrated later. Following a Soviet-organised referendum, the Subcarpathian Rus never returned under Czechoslovak rule but became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] in 1946.

Czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a "bridge" between the West and East. However, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] rapidly increased in popularity, with a general disillusionment with the West, because of the pre-war [[Munich Agreement]], and a favourable popular attitude towards the Soviet Union, because of the Soviets' role in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule. In the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]], the Communists gained 38%<ref>F. Čapka: [http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t98.html Dějiny zemí Koruny české v datech]. XII. Od lidově demokratického po socialistické Československo – pokračování. Libri.cz {{cs icon}}</ref> of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament. They formed a coalition government with other parties of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] and moved quickly to consolidate power. The decisive step took place in February 1948, during [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|a series of events]] characterized by Communists as a "revolution" and by anti-Communists as a "takeover", the Communist [[People's Militias (Czechoslovakia)|People's Militias]] secured control of key locations in Prague, and a new all-Communist government was formed.

For the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|next 41 years]], Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the [[Eastern Bloc]]. This period is characterized by lagging behind the West in almost every aspect of social and economic development. The country's GDP per capita fell from the level of neighboring Austria below that of Greece or Portugal in the 1980s. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s. The political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dubček]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create "socialism with a human face" and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] of all [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries with the exception of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on 21 August 1968.

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|The Czech Republic became a member of the European Union in 2004, signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007 and [[Signing of the Treaty of Lisbon|ratified]] it in 2009 as the last EU member.]]
The invasion was followed by a harsh program of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]" in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977, and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988. Between 1948 and 1989 more than 250,000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison for "anti-state activities" and over 400,000 emigrated.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4388764.stm Czech schools revisit communism]. ''BBC News.'' 1 November 2005.</ref>

===Velvet revolution and independence===
In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful "[[Velvet Revolution]]". However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened and on 1 January 1993, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[capitalism|capitalist economy]]. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognised by the World Bank as a "developed country",<ref name="worldbank06"/> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".<ref name="hdi09"/>

From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. It held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency of the European Union]] for the first half of 2009.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the Czech Republic}}

[[File:Václav Havel cut out.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Václav Havel]], the first President of the Czech Republic]]

The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], with the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') is bicameral, with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] ({{lang-cs|Poslanecká sněmovna}}) (200 members) and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] ({{lang-cs|Senát}}) (81 members).

The [[President of the Czech Republic]] was being selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms. This system was practised between years 1993–2012. Since 2013 the presidential election is direct.
The president is a formal [[head of state]] with limited specific powers, most importantly to return bills to the parliament, nominate [[constitutional court]] judges for the Senate's approval and dissolve the parliament under certain special and unusual circumstances. He also appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 2013 on, the president is elected by the public, not the parliament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Klaus signs Czech direct presidential election implementing law|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/tema/zpravy/klaus-signs-czech-direct-presidential-election-implementing-law/823441|publisher=Czech Press Agency|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> [[Miloš Zeman]] was the first [[Two-round system|directly elected]] Czech President.

The Prime Minister is the head of government and wields considerable powers, including the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy, mobilize the parliamentary majority and choose government ministers.

The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]], with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia.

The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. The first election was in 1996, for differing terms. This arrangement is modeled on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout, overall roughly 30% in the first round and 20% in the second.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of the Czech Republic}}
Membership in the European Union is central in Czech Republic's foreign policy. The Czech Republic held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] for the first half of 2009.

Czech officials have supported dissenters in [[Burma]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]] and [[Cuba]].<ref name="democrats">{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9725352 |title=Czechs with few mates |work=The Economist |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Czech ISAF (6).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Czech soldier in [[Afghanistan]]]]

===Military===
{{Main|Military of the Czech Republic}}
The Czech armed forces consist of the [[Military of the Czech Republic|Army]], [[Czech Air Force|Air Force]] and of specialized support units. The president of the Czech Republic is [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the armed forces. In 2004 the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The country has been a member of [[NATO]] since 12 March 1999. Defense spending is around 1.8% of the GDP (2006). Currently, as a member of NATO, the Czech military are participating in [[ISAF]] and [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] operations and have soldiers in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kosovo]]. Main equipment includes: multi-role fighters [[JAS-39 Gripen]], combat aircraft [[Aero L-159 Alca]], attack helicopters [[Mi-24]], armored vehicles [[Pandur II]], [[OT-64 SKOT|OT-64]], [[OT-90]], [[BMP-2|BVP-2]] and Czech modernized tanks [[T-72]] (T-72M4CZ).

===Administrative divisions===
{{See also|Regions of the Czech Republic|Districts of the Czech Republic}}
Since 2000, the Czech Republic is divided into [[List of regions of the Czech Republic|thirteen regions]] ([[Czech language|Czech]]: [[wikt:en:kraj#Czech|''kraje'', singular ''kraj'']]) and the capital city of [[Prague]]. Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (''krajské zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (usually translated as [[hetman]] or "president"). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The older seventy-six [[districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three "statutory cities" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046 The death of the districts], [[Radio Prague]] 3 January 2003.</ref>

==Geography==
{{See also|Geography of the Czech Republic|Protected Areas of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Satellite image of Czech Republic in September 2003.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Czech Republic]]
[[File:Pravcicka brana 001.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Switzerland]] is one of four Czech [[national park]]s]]
The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] (a small area lies north of 51°), and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

The Czech landscape is exceedingly varied. [[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] (or Moldau) rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkonoše]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sněžka]] at {{convert|1602|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. [[Moravia]], the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder River]] ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).

Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sing=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, [[Western European broadleaf forests]] and Carpathian montane conifer forests.

There are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is
[[Krkonoše National Park]] ([[Biosphere Reserve]]), [[Šumava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyjí National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].

===Climate===
[[File:Smrk a rameno Šance 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Šance Dam]], part of the [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]]]]

The Czech Republic has a temperate [[continental climate]], with relatively hot summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is relatively high, due to the landlocked geographical position.<ref>R. Tolasz, ''Climate Atlas of the Czech Republic'', Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Prague, 2007. ISBN 80-244-1626-3, graphs 1.5 and 1.6</ref>

Within the Czech Republic, temperatures vary greatly, depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[Bílý Potok (Liberec District)|Bílý Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.
[[File:Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg|thumb|Rolling hills of [[Králický Sněžník]]]]
At the highest peak of [[Sněžka]] ({{convert|1602|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.

The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.

The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about {{convert|20|°C|0}} – {{convert|30|C|F}} higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.

Autumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous|deciduous trees]] begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.

The coldest temperature ever measured was in Litvínovice near [[České Budějovice]] in 1929, at {{convert|-42.2|C|F}} and the hottest measured, was at {{convert|40.4|C|F}} in [[Dobřichovice]] in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Czech absolute record temperature registered near Prague|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-absolute-record-temperature-registered-near-prague/830626|work=České noviny|publisher=ČTK|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>

Most rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is relatively constant throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1&nbsp;mm of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated heavy rainfall (days with more than 10&nbsp;mm per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).<ref>R.

Growth has been led by exports to the European Union, especially Germany, and foreign investment, while domestic demand is reviving.

Most of the economy has been privatised, including the banks and telecommunications. A 2009 survey in cooperation with the Czech Economic Association found that the majority of Czech economists favor continued liberalization in most sectors of the economy.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Stastny, Daniel|title=Czech Economists on Economic Policy: A Survey|journal=Econ Journal Watch|volume=7|issue=3|pages= 275–287|year= 2010|url=http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-7-issue-3-september-2010}}</ref>

===Energy===
[[File:Nuclear.power.plant.Dukovany.jpg|thumb|[[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station]]]]
Production of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 TWh per year, which are exported. [[Nuclear power]] presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is [[Temelín Nuclear Power Station]], other [[nuclear power plant]] is in [[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station|Dukovany]].

The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from [[Norway|Norwegian]] companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption. South Moravia has small [[Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic|oil and gas deposits]].

The Czech Republic has one of the least religious populations in the world. Historically, the Czech people have been characterised as "tolerant and even indifferent towards religion".<ref>Richard Felix Staar, ''Communist regimes in Eastern Europe'', Issue 269, p. 90</ref> According to the 2011 census, 34.2% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Roman Catholic, 0.8% was [[Protestant]] (0.5% [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren|Czech Brethren]] and 0.4% [[Hussite Church|Hussite]]), and 9.4% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are [[Neopaganism|Pagan]]) 45.2% of the population did not answer the question about religion.<ref name="Czech Statistical Office"/> From 1991 to 2001 and further to 2011 the adherence to Roman Catholicism decreased from 39.0 to 26.8 and then to 10.3; Protestantism similarly declined from 3.7% to 2.1% and then to 0.8%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.czso.cz/csu/2008edicniplan.nsf/engt/24003E05ED/$File/4032080119.pdf|title= Population by denomination and sex: as measured by 1921, 1930, 1950, 1991 and 2001 censuses

===Music===
{{Main|Music of the Czech Republic}}
Music in the Czech lands has its roots in more than 1,000-year old [[sacred music]]. The first surviving references [[Lord, Have Mercy on Us]] come from the end of the 10th century and in the [[traditional music|traditional]] folk music of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Silesia]] and in the long-term high-culture classical music tradition. Since the early eras of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have often been influenced by genuine folk music. Notable Czech composers include [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Bedřich Smetana]], [[Gustav Mahler]] (he was born and grew up in the Czech lands), [[Adam Michna]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Josef Mysliveček]], [[Leoš Janáček]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], [[Erwin Schulhoff]] and [[Petr Eben]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Czech literature}}

[[Czech literature]] is the literature written by [[Czechs]], mostly in the [[Czech language]], although other languages like [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Latin]] or German have been also used, especially in the past. Non-Czech inhabitants of the [[Czech lands]] who had written in German and other languages, such as [[Franz Kafka]], are usually excluded from the corpus of Czech literature, regardless of their own national self-identification.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Czech literature is divided into several main time periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the years of re-Catholicization and the baroque; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the 19th century; the avantgarde of the interwar period; the years under Communism and the Prague Spring; and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic. Czech literature and culture played a major role on at least two occasions, when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

A famous antiwar comedy novel ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Hašek]] is the most translated Czech book in history. It was depicted by [[Karel Steklý]] in two color films ''[[The Good Soldier Schweik (1956 film)|The Good Soldier Schweik]]'' in 1956 and 1957.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre of the Czech Republic}}

[[Theatre of the Czech Republic]] has rich tradition with roots in the Middle Ages. In the 19th century, the theatre played an important role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century it became a part of the modern European theatre art.

{{Main|Czech cuisine}}

Czech cuisine is marked by a strong emphasis on meat dishes. Pork is quite common; beef and chicken are also popular. Goose, duck, rabbit and wild game are served. Fish is rare, with the occasional exception of fresh [[trout]] and [[carp]], which is served at Christmas.

[[Czech beer]] has a long and important history. The first brewery is known to have existed in 1118 and the Czech Republic has the highest [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita|beer consumption per capita]] in the world. The famous [[Pilsener]] style [[Beer in Czech Republic|beer]] originated in the western Bohemian city of [[Plzeň]], and further south the town of [[České Budějovice]], known as Budweis in German, lent its name to its beer, eventually known as [[Budweiser Budvar]]. Apart from these and other major brands, the Czech Republic also boasts a growing number of top quality small breweries and mini-breweries seeking to continue the age-old tradition of quality and taste, whose output matches the best in the world: Štiřín, Chýně, Oslavany, Kácov. Tourism is slowly growing around the Southern Moravian region too, which has been producing [[Czech wine|wine]] since the Middle Ages; about 94% of [[vineyard]]s in the Czech Republic are Moravian. Aside from [[Slivovitz]], Czech beer and wine, the Czechs also produce two unique liquors, [[Fernet Stock]] and [[Becherovka]]. [[Kofola]] is a non-alcoholic domestic [[cola]] [[soft drink]] which competes with [[Coca Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] in popularity.

Unique Czech dishes include roast pork with bread dumplings and stewed cabbage ''Vepřo-knedlo-zelo'', roast sirloin beef with steamed dumplings and cream-of-vegetable sauce ''[[Svíčková na smetaně]]'', tomato sauce ''Rajská'' or dill sauce ''Koprovka'', roast duck with bread or potato dumplings and braised red cabbage, a variety of beef and pork goulash stews ''[[Guláš]]'', fried cheese ''[[Smažený sýr|Smažák]]'' or the famous potato pancakes ''[[Bramboráky]]'', besides a large variety of delicate local sausages, wurst, pâtés and smoked meats and other traditional local foods. Czech desserts include a wide variety of whipped cream, chocolate and fruit pastries and tarts, crepes, creme desserts and cheese, poppy seed filled and other types of traditional cakes ''[[Buchteln|buchty]]'' and ''[[koláč]]e''.

Sports play a part in the life of many Czechs, who are generally loyal supporters of their favorite teams or individuals. The three leading sports in the Czech Republic are [[ice hockey]], [[association football|football]] and [[sport shooting]],<ref name="ihned 2010">{{cs icon}} {{cite news|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-49617340-pocet-legalne-drzenych-zbrani-v-cesku-stoupa-uz-jich-je-pres-700-tisic|title=Počet legálně držených zbraní v Česku stoupá. Už jich je přes 700 tisíc|date=28 January 2011|first=Leoš|last=Kyša|publisher=ihned.cz|accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref> with the first two drawing the largest attention of both the media and supporters. Tennis is also a very popular sport in the Czech Republic. The many other sports with professional leagues and structures include basketball, volleyball, [[team handball]], [[track and field athletics]] and [[floorball]]. [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|The Czech ice hockey team]] won the gold medal at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] and has won six gold medals at the [[IHWC|World Championships]] including three straight from [[1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1999]] to [[2001 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2001]]. In total the country has won 14 gold medals in [[Summer Olympic Games|summer]] (plus 49 as Czechoslovakia) and five gold medals (plus two as Czechoslovakia) in [[Winter Olympic Games|winter]] [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|Olympic history]].

Sport is a source of strong waves of patriotism, usually rising several days or weeks before an event. The events considered the most important by Czech fans are: the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic Ice hockey tournament]], [[UEFA European Football Championship]], [[UEFA Champions League]] and qualification matches for such events.<ref>[http://www.prague.fm/11845/pragues-most-popular-sports/ Prague's Most Popular Sports]</ref> In general, any international match of the Czech ice hockey or football national team draws attention, especially when played against a traditional rival.

The Czech Republic also has great influence on tennis with such players as, [[Ivan Lendl]], 8 times Grand Slam singles champion, [[2010 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles]] finalist [[Tomáš Berdych]], [[2011 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles]] champion, [[Petra Kvitová]], [[1998 Wimbledon]] Women's Singles title [[Jana Novotná]], [[2011 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles]] champion [[Květa Peschke]] and 18 time Grand Slam Champion [[Martina Navratilova]].

The favourite Czech individual or group sport is [[hiking]] mainly in Czech mountains. Even one meaning of the word "tourist" in the Czech language is a trekker or a hiker. It is  ideal sport also for beginners, because thanks to the more than 100 years long tradition, there is a unique system of the trekkings markers, one of the best in Europe. It contains the net around 40 000&nbsp;km perfectly marked short or long distanced trails crossing the whole country and all Czech mountains - not only in [[Bohemian Forest|Šumava]] Mountains, but also in [[Bohemian-Moravian Highlands|Vysočina]], [[Ore Mountains|Krušné hory]], [[Jizera Mountains|Jizerské hory]], [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids|Beskydy]],  [[Jeseníky]], [[Orlické hory]] and [[Krkonoše|Giant Mountains - Krkonoše]].
