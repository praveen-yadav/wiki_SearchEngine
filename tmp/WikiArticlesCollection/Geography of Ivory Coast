'''[[Ivory Coast]]''' (Côte d'Ivoire) is a [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] nation in southern [[West Africa]] located at 8 00°N, 5 00°W. The country is shaped like a [[Square (geometry)|square]]. Its southern border is a {{convert|115|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} coastline on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] on the north [[Atlantic Ocean]].   On the other three sides it borders five other [[Africa]]n nations for a total of {{convert|3110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}: [[Liberia]] to the southwest for {{convert|716|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Guinea]] to the northwest for {{convert|610|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mali]] to the north-northwest for {{convert|532|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Burkina Faso]] to the north-northeast, and [[Ghana]] to the east for {{convert|668|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. 

Ivory Coast comprises {{convert|322460|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|318000|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|4460|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}} is water, which makes the country slightly larger than the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Mexico]], or about the size of [[Germany]].

== Maritime claims ==
Ivory Coast makes maritime claims of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=on}} as an [[exclusive economic zone]], {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}} of territorial sea, and a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1}} [[continental shelf]].

==Terrain and topography==
Ivory Coast's [[terrain]] can generally be described as a large [[plateau]] rising gradually from [[sea level]] in the south to almost 500 m [[elevation]] in the north. The nation's natural resources have made it into a comparatively prosperous nation in the [[Economy of Africa|African economy]]. 
The southeastern region of Ivory Coast is marked by coastal inland lagoons that starts at the Ghanaian border and stretch {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the eastern half of the coast. The southern region, especially the southwest, is covered with dense tropical moist forest. The [[Eastern Guinean forests]] extend from the Sassandra River across the south-central and southeast portion of Ivory Coast and east into [[Ghana]], while the [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] extend west from the [[Sassandra River]] into [[Liberia]] and southeastern [[Guinea]]. The mountains of [[Dix-Huit Montagnes]] region, in the west of the country near the border with Guinea and Liberia, are home to the [[Guinean montane forests]]. 

The [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west, and is the transition zone between the coastal forests and the interior [[savanna]]s. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Ivory Coast is part of the [[West Sudanian Savanna]] ecoregion of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]]. It is a zone of lateritic or sandy [[soil]]s, with [[vegetation]] decreasing from south to north. 

The terrain is mostly flat to undulating [[plain]]s, with [[mountain]]s in the northwest. The lowest elevation in Ivory Coast is at sea level on the coasts. The highest elevation is [[Mount Nimba]], at {{convert|1752|m}} in the far west of the country along the border with Guinea and Liberia.

==Rivers==
{{See also|List of rivers of Ivory Coast}}
The [[Cavalla River]] drains the western border area of the Ivory Coast and eastern Liberia. It forms the southern two-thirds of the international boundary between Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire. 

The [[Sassandra River]] forms in the Guinea highlands and drains much of the western part of the Ivory Coast east of the Cavalla River. 

The [[Bandama River]] is the longest river in the Ivory Coast with a length of some {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} draining the east central part of the country.  In 1973 the [[Kossou Dam]] was constructed at [[Kossou]] on the Bandama creating [[Lake Kossou]].  The capital, [[Yamoussoukro]], is located near the river south of the lake.

The [[Komoé River]] originates on the [[Sikasso]] Plateau of [[Burkina Faso]],<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Rupley, Lawrence A.; Bangali, Lamissa and Diamitani, Boureima|title=Sikasso Plateau|year=2013|encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=HnRbA-pYcegC&pg=PA197 197]|isbn=978-0-8108-6770-3}}</ref> and briefly follows the border between Burkina Faso and [[Ivory Coast]] before entering Ivory Coast. It drains the northeastern and eastern-most portions of the country before emptying into the eastern end of the [[Ébrié Lagoon]] and ultimately the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the Atlantic Ocean.  Its waters contribute to the [[Comoé National Park]].<ref name="Mepham1991">{{cite book|last=Mepham|first=Robert|title=IUCN Directory of African Wetlands|publisher=Pinter Pub. Ltd.|year=1991|isbn=2-88032-949-3}}</ref>

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Ivory Coast is generally warm and humid, ranging from [[equator]]ial in the southern coasts to [[Tropics|tropical]] in the middle and semiarid in the far north. There are three seasons: warm and dry (November to March), hot and dry (March to May), and hot and wet (June to October). Temperatures average between {{convert|25|and|32|°C|°F|1}} and range from {{convert|10|to|40|°C|°F}}.

==Crops and natural resources==
Ivory Coast has a large [[timber]] industry due to its large [[forest]] coverage. The nation's [[hardwood]] exports match that of [[Brazil]]. In recent years there has been much concern about the rapid rate of [[deforestation]]. [[Rainforest]]s are being destroyed at a rate sometimes cited as the highest in the world. The only forest left completely untouched in Ivory Coast is [[Taï National Park]] (''Parc National de Taï''), a {{convert|3600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} area in the country's far southwest that is home to over 150 [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species and many other [[endangered species]] such as the [[Pygmy Hippopotamus]] and 11 species of [[monkey]]s.

Eight percent of the country is [[arable land]]. Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, a major national [[cash crop]]. Other chief crops include [[coffee]], [[banana]]s, and [[Elaeis guineensis|oil palms]], which produce [[palm oil]] and kernels. [[Natural resource]]s include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[diamond]]s, [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]], and [[hydropower]].
There are more foreigners than Ivorians. Foreigners currently make up 67% of the country's population.

==Natural hazards==
[[Natural hazard]]s include the heavy surf and the lack of [[natural harbor]]s on the coast; during the rainy season torrential [[flood]]ing is a danger.

== Extreme points ==

Extreme points are the geographic points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in the country.

* Northernmost point – the point at which the border with [[Mali]] enters the [[Bagoé river]], [[Savanes Region, Ivory Coast|Savanes Region]], the [[Sahel]].
* Easternmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ghana]] south-west of the town of [[Tanbi]], [[Zanzan]]
* Southernmost point – [[Boubré]], [[Bas-Sassandra]] region
* Westernmost point -  unnamed location on the border with [[Liberia]] in the [[Nuon river]] west of [[Klobli]], [[Moyen-Cavally]] region
