The '''anthophytes''' were thought to be a [[clade]] comprising plants bearing flower-like structures.  The group contained the [[angiosperms]] - the extant flowering plants - as well as the [[Gnetales]] and the extinct [[Bennettitales]]. It also includes such plants as roses, tulips, and common plants found to have '''flower''' structures.

Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel.<ref name=Crepet2000/>  This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around {{Ma|300}}.<ref name=Nam2003>{{cite journal | author=Nam J. et al.  | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/20/9/1435 |title=Antiquity and Evolution of the MADS-Box Gene Family Controlling Flower Development in Plants | journal=Mol.

Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils ([[Glossopteris|glossopterids]], ''[[Pentoxylon]]'', [[Bennettitales]], and ''[[Caytonia]]''), but not the Gnetales.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/1133/1/3 | title = The Year in Evolutionary Biology 2008 | date = published June 2008 | journal = Ann.
