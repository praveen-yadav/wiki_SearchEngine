The '''geography of Antarctica''' is dominated by its [[polar region|south polar location]] and, thus, by [[ice]].  The [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]], located in the [[Earth]]'s [[southern hemisphere]], is centered asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].  It is surrounded by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]] – alternatively (depending on source), it is washed by the [[Southern Ocean|Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean]] or the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s. It has an area of more than 14 million&nbsp;km².

Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], the world's largest [[ice sheet]] and also its largest reservoir of [[fresh water]].  Averaging at least 1.6&nbsp;km thick, the ice is so massive that it has [[post-glacial rebound|depressed the continental bedrock]] in some areas more than 2.5&nbsp;km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid [[water]] also occur (e.g., [[Lake Vostok]]).  [[Ice shelf|Ice shelves]] and [[ice rise|rises]] populate the ice sheet on the periphery.  Only about 2% of the continent is not  covered by ice.

Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Western Antarctica]] and [[Eastern Antarctica]] correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the [[Prime Meridian|Greenwich meridian]]. This usage has been regarded as [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.

Western Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this [[ice sheet]], because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.

==Volcanoes==
There are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are
considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or 
"recent" tephra deposits: 
[[Mount Melbourne]] (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano; 
[[Mount Berlin]] (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano; 
Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and 
[[Mount Hampton]] (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.
 
Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.
[[Mount Erebus]] (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on
[[Ross Island]] with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.
On the opposite side of the continent, 
[[Deception Island]]
(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known
and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.
[[Buckle Island]] in the [[Balleny Islands]] (66°50'S., 163°12'E.), 
[[Penguin Island (South Shetland Islands)|Penguin Island]] (62°06'S., 57°54'W.), 
[[Paulet Island]] (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and 
[[Lindenberg Island]] (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also 
considered to be active.
