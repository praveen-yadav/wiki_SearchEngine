The '''geography of Cyprus''' comprises both [[physical geography|physical]] and [[human geography]]. [[Cyprus]] is an [[island country]] situated in the Eastern Basin of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  Cyprus is the third largest [[island]] in the Mediterranean (after the [[Italy|Italian]] islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]) and the [[List of islands by area|world's 81st largest]] island by area. It is located south of Asia Minor, the [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]]  of the [[Asia]]n (or [[Eurasia]]n) mainland (now part of modern-day [[Turkey]]), so it may be included in [[Southwest Asia|Western Asia]]<ref>http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#asia UN</ref> or the [[Middle East]]:<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cy.html CIA World Factbook</ref>  At a confluence of Western Asia, [[Southern Europe]], and [[Northern Africa]], Cyprus has had lengthy periods of mainly [[Greece|Greek]] and intermittent Anatolian, [[Levant]]ine, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Western Europe]]an influences.  It is sometimes included in [[Europe]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Britannica]</ref> and has been a [[member state of the European Union]] since 1 May 2004.

Cyprus measures 240 kilometres latitudinally and {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} longitudinally, with Turkey {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north.  Other neighbouring territories include [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] to the east (105&nbsp;km and {{convert|108|km|0|abbr=on}}, respectively), [[Israel]] {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} to the southeast, [[Egypt]] {{convert|380|km|0|abbr=on}} to the south, and [[Greece]] to the west-northwest: {{convert|280|km|0|abbr=on}} to the small [[Dodecanese|Dodecanesian]] island of [[Kastellórizo|Kastellórizo (Meyísti)]], {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} to [[Rhodes]], and {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} to the Greek mainland.

The island is dominated by two mountain ranges, the Troodos Mountains and the Kyrenia Mountains,  and the central plain, the [[Mesaoria]], which is between them. The [[Troodos Mountains]] cover most of the southern and western portions of the island and account for roughly half its area. The narrow [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]], extends along the northern coastline. It is not as high as the Troodos Mountains, and it occupies substantially less area. The two mountain ranges run generally parallel to the [[Taurus Mountains]] on the Turkish mainland, the outlines of which are visible from northern Cyprus. Coastal lowlands, varying in width, surround the island.

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], the island is divided into four main segments.  The Republic of Cyprus, the internationally recognized government, occupies the southern two-thirds of the island. The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], recognized only by Turkey, occupies the northern one-third of the island. The [[United Nations]]-controlled [[Green Line (Cyprus)|Green Line]] is a buffer zone that separates the two. Lastly, [[Sovereign Base Areas|two bases under British sovereignty]], [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]], are located on the island.

==Terrain==
[[File:Geology of Cyprus-SkiriotissaMine.jpg|thumb|left|Skiriotissa mine]]
[[File:CyprusFromTheISS(cropped).jpg|thumb|This image, photographed from the [[International Space Station]] in 2013, shows the three distinct geologic regions of the island. In the central and western part of the island is the Troodos Massif, a mountain range whose surface layer is mostly basaltic lava rock, and whose maximum elevation is {{convert|1952|m|ft|0|abbr-on}}. Running in a thin arc along the northeast margin of the island is Cyprus's second mountain range, a limestone formation called the Kyrenia Range. The space between these ranges is home to the capital [[Nicosia]], visible as a grayish-brown patch near the image's center.]]
[[Image:Cyprus topo.png|thumb|Topography]]
The rugged [[Troodos Mountains]], whose principal range stretches from Pomos Point in the northwest almost to Larnaca Bay on the east, are the single most conspicuous feature of the landscape. Intensive uplifting and folding in the formative period left the area highly fragmented, so that subordinate ranges and spurs veer off at many angles, their slopes incised by steep-sided valleys. In the southwest, the mountains descend in a series of stepped foothills to the coastal plain.

While the Troodos Mountains are a massif formed of molten igneous rock, the Kyrenia Range is a narrow limestone ridge that rises suddenly from the plains. Its easternmost extension becomes a series of foothills on the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. That peninsula points toward Asia Minor, to which Cyprus belongs geologically.

Even the highest peaks of the [[Kyrenia Range]] are hardly more than half the height of the great dome of the Troodos massif, [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] ({{convert|1952|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}),<ref name="Embassy climate">{{cite web|title = Country Profile: Climate|publisher = Official Website of the Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus in Washington D.C.|url = http://www.cyprusembassy.net/home/index.php?module=page&pid=11|accessdate = 2006-10-11}}</ref> but their seemingly inaccessible, jagged slopes make them considerably more spectacular. [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Lawrence Durrell]], in Bitter Lemons, wrote of the Troodos as "an unlovely jumble of crags and heavyweight rocks" and of the Kyrenia Range as belonging to "the world of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Europe]], its lofty crags studded with crusader castles."

Rich copper deposits were discovered in antiquity on the slopes of the Troodos. The massive sulfide deposits formed as a part of an [[ophiolite]] complex at a [[Mid-ocean ridge|spreading center]] under the Mediterranean Sea which was [[Tectonics|tectonically]] uplifted during the [[Pleistocene]] and emplaced in its current location.<ref>http://www.moa.gov.cy/moa/gsd/gsd.nsf/dmlTroodos_en/dmlTroodos_en?OpenDocument Cyprus Geologic Survey</ref>

==Drainage==
In much of the island, access to a year-round supply of water is difficult. This is traditionally attributed to deforestation which damaged the island's drainage system through erosion, but Grove and Rackham question this view.<ref>A.T. Grove, Oliver Rackham, ''The Nature of Mediterranean Europe: An Ecological History'', Yale, 2001.  ISBN 0-300-08443-9.</ref> A network of winter rivers rises in the Troodos Mountains and flows out from them in all directions. The Yialias River and the [[Pedieos|Pedhieos River]] flow eastward across the Mesaoria into Famagusta Bay; the Serraghis River flows northwest through the [[Morphou]] plain. All of the island's rivers, however, are dry in the summer. An extensive system of dams and waterways has been constructed to bring water to farming areas.

The Mesaoria is the agricultural heartland of the island, but its productiveness for wheat and barley depends very much on winter rainfall; other crops are grown under irrigation. Little evidence remains that this broad, central plain, open to the sea at either end, was once covered with rich forests whose timber was coveted by ancient conquerors for their sailing vessels. The now-divided capital of the island, Nicosia, lies in the middle of this central plain.

== Natural vegetation ==
[[File:Cyprus countryside on the way to Troodos Mountains in the late summer Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|left|Cyprus countryside on the way to Troodos Mountains during the summer]]
Despite its small size, Cyprus has a variety of natural vegetation. This includes forests of conifers and broadleaved trees such as ''[[Pinus brutia]]'', [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[cypress]]es and [[oak]]s. Ancient authors write that most of Cyprus, even Messaoria, was heavily forested, and there are still considerable forests on the Troodos and Kyrenia ranges, and locally at lower altitudes. About 17% of the whole island is classified as woodland. Where there is no forest, tall shrub communities of [[golden oak]] (''Quercus alnifolia''), strawberry tree (''[[Arbutus andrachne]]''), terebinth (''[[Pistacia terebinthus]]''), olive (''[[Olea europaea]]''), kermes oak (''[[Quercus coccifera]]'') and styrax (''[[Styrax officinalis]]'') are found, but such [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] is uncommon. Over most of the island untilled ground bears a grazed covering of [[garrigue]], largely composed of low bushes of [[Cistus]], ''[[Genista sphacelata]]'', ''[[Calycotoime villosa]]'', ''[[Lithospermum hispidulum]]'', ''[[Phaganalon rupestre]]'' and, locally, ''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''. Where grazing is excessive this covering is soon reduced, and an impoverished [[Garrigue|batha]] remains, consisting principally of ''[[Thymus capitatus]]'', ''[[Sarcopoterium spinosum]]'', and a few stunted herbs.

==Climate==

[[Image:Cyprus.A2002292.1045.500m.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dust storm|Sandstorm]] in the [[Levant]], October 19, 2002]]
The [[Mediterranean climate]], warm and rather dry, with rainfall mainly between November and March, favors agriculture. In general, the island experiences mild wet winters and dry hot summers. Variations in temperature and rainfall are governed by altitude and, to a lesser extent, distance from the coast. Hot, dry summers from mid-May to mid-September and rainy, rather changeable winters from November to mid-March are separated by short autumn and spring seasons.
