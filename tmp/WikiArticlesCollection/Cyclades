The '''Cyclades''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|k|l|ə|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-el|Κυκλάδες}}, {{IPA-el|cikˈlaðes|}}) is a [[Greek island]] group in the [[Aegean Sea]], southeast of mainland Greece and a former administrative [[prefectures of Greece|prefecture]] of Greece. They are one of the [[List of islands of Greece|island groups]] which constitute the Aegean [[archipelago]]. The name refers to the islands ''around'' (κυκλάς), the sacred island of [[Delos]]. The Cyclades is where the native Greek breed of cat (the [[Aegean cat]]) originated.

==History==
{{main|History of the Cyclades}}
[[File:Harp player, Cycladic civilization - Greece.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Harp player, example of Cycladic art, National Archeological Museum, Athens.]]

The significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age '''[[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic culture]]''' is best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands' pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age ("[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]") culture arose in Crete, to the south: these figures have been looted from burials to satisfy a thriving Cycladic antiquities market since the early 20th century.

A distinctive Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on [[emmer wheat]] and wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites include Saliagos and Kephala (on [[Keos]]) with signs of copper-working, Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter), and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos, which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.

===Archaeology===
The first archaeological excavations of the 1880s were followed by systematic work by the British School at Athens and by Christos Tsountas, who investigated burial sites on several islands in 1898–1899 and coined the term "[[Cycladic civilization]]". Interest lagged, then picked up in the mid-20th century, as collectors competed for the modern-looking figures that seemed so similar to sculpture by [[Jean Arp]] or [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. Sites were looted and a brisk trade in forgeries arose. The context for many of these [[Cycladic art|Cycladic figurines]] have been mostly destroyed and their meaning may never be completely understood. Another intriguing and mysterious object is that of the Cycladic [[frying pans]]. More accurate archaeology has revealed the broad outlines of a farming and seafaring culture that had immigrated from [[Asia Minor]] c. [[5th millennium BCE|5000 BCE]]. Early Cycladic culture evolved in three phases, between c.&nbsp;[[33rd century BCE|3300]]–[[20th century BCE|2000 BCE]], when it was increasingly swamped in the rising influence of Minoan Crete. The culture of mainland Greece contemporary with Cycladic culture is called [[Helladic culuture]].

In recent decades the Cyclades islands have become popular with [[Europe]]an and other [[tourist]]s, and as a result there have been problems with [[erosion]], [[pollution]], and water shortages.

The Cyclades comprise about 220 islands, the major ones being [[Amorgos|Amorgós]], [[Anafi|Anáfē]], [[Andros|Ándros]], [[Antiparos|Antíparos]], [[Delos|Dēlos]], [[Eschati|Eschátē]], [[Ios (island)|Íos]], [[Kea (island)|Kéa]], [[Kimolos|Kímōlos]], [[Kythnos|Kýthnos]], [[Milos|Mēlos]], [[Mykonos|Mýkonos]], [[Naxos (island)|Náxos]], [[Paros|Páros]], [[Folegandros|Folégandros]], [[Serifos|Sérifos]], [[Sifnos|Sífnos]], [[Sikinos|Síkinos]], [[Syros|Sýros]], [[Tinos|Tēnos]], and [[Santorini|Thēra or Santoríni]]. Most of the smaller islands are uninhabited.

[[Ermoupolis]], on Syros, is the chief town and administrative center of the former prefecture.

The islands are peaks of a submerged mountainous terrain, with the exception of two [[volcano|volcanic]] islands, [[Milos]] and [[Santorini]] (Thera). The climate is generally dry and mild, but with the exception of Naxos the soil is not very fertile; agricultural produce includes [[wine]], [[fruit]], [[wheat]], [[olive oil]], and [[tobacco]].  Cooler temperatures are in higher elevations and mainly do not receive wintry weather.

The Cyclades are bounded to the south by the Sea of Crete.<ref>Saundry, Hogan & Baum. 2011</ref>

==Administration==

The '''Cyclades Prefecture''' was one of the [[prefectures of Greece]]. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was abolished, and its territory was divided into nine [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] of the [[South Aegean]] region:
* [[Andros]]
* [[Kea-Kythnos]]
* [[Milos (regional unit)|Milos]]
* [[Mykonos]]
* [[Naxos (regional unit)|Naxos]]
* [[Paros (regional unit)|Paros]]
* [[Santorini (regional unit)|Santorini]]
* [[Syros]]
* [[Tinos]]

===Municipalities and communities===

The prefecture was subdivided into the following municipalities and communities. These have been reorganised at the 2011 Kallikratis reform as well.
