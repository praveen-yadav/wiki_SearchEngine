A '''battleship''' is a large [[armour|armored]] [[warship]] with a main [[artillery battery|battery]] consisting of heavy [[caliber]] [[gun]]s. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of battleships was vital for any [[nation]] which desired to maintain [[command of the sea]]. During [[World War II]], [[aircraft carrier]]s overtook battleships in power. Some battleships remained in service during the [[Cold War]] and the last were [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in the 1990s.

The word ''battleship'' was coined around 1794 and is a contraction of the phrase ''[[ship of the line|line-of-battle ship]],'' the dominant wooden warship during the [[Age of Sail]].<ref name="OED">"battleship" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989.

In 1906, the commissioning of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} heralded a revolution in battleship design. Following battleship designs, influenced by HMS ''Dreadnought'', were referred to as "[[dreadnought]]s".

Battleships were a symbol of [[navy|naval]] dominance and national might, and for decades the battleship was a major factor in both [[diplomacy]] and [[military strategy]].<ref name="Sondhaus">Sondhaus, L.

The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during the period of their prominence.<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Connell, Robert J. |title= Sacred vessels: the cult of the battleship and the rise of the U.S. Navy |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year= 1993 |pages= |isbn= 0-19-508006-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }} {{Page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> In spite of the immense resources spent on battleships, there were few pitched battleship clashes.

==Ships of the line==
{{Main|Ship of the line}}
[[File:TheNapoleonAtToulonIn1852ByLauvergne.jpg|thumb|{{ship|French ship|Napoléon|1850|2}} (1850), the first steam battleship]]

A ship of the line was a large, unarmored [[wood]]en sailing ship on which was mounted a [[artillery battery|battery]] of up to 120 [[smoothbore]] [[gun]]s and [[carronade]]s. The ship of the line was a gradual evolution of a basic design that dates back to the 15th century, and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of [[line of battle]] tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.<ref name="OED" />

The sheer number of guns fired [[broadside]] meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], knocking down [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s, wrecking her [[rigging]], and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.

The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of [[steam power]] as an auxiliary [[marine propulsion|propulsion system]]. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for [[frigate]]s. The [[French Navy]] introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun {{ship|French ship|Napoléon|1850|2}} in 1850<ref>"Napoleon (90 guns), the first purpose-designed screw line of battleships", ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', ''Conway's History of the Ship'', p. 39.</ref>—the first true steam battleship.<ref>''"Hastened to completion Le Napoleon was launched on 16 May 1850, to become the world's first true steam battleship"'', ''Steam, Steel and Shellfire'', Conway's History of the Ship, p. 39.</ref> ''Napoléon'' was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of {{convert|12|kn|km/h|0}}, regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] were the only countries to develop [[List of steam powered ships of the line|fleets of wooden steam screw battleships]], although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (9), [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] (3), [[Sweden]] (2), [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] (1), [[Denmark]] (1) and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] (1).<ref name="LambertBIT">Lambert, Andrew, ''Battleships in Transition'', pub Conway1984, ISBN 0-85177-315-X pages 144–147.<br /> In addition, the Navy of the North Germany Confederacy (which included Prussia) bought {{HMS|Renown|1857|6}} from Britain in 1870 for use as a gunnery training ship.</ref><ref name="Sondhaus" />

==Ironclads==
{{Main|Ironclad warship}}
[[File:LaGloirePhotograph.jpg|thumb|The French {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} (1859), the first ocean–going [[ironclad warship]]]]

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the [[ironclad warship|ironclad]]: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing [[high-explosive]] [[shell (projectile)|shells]].

===Explosive shells===
Guns which fired explosive or [[incendiary ammunition|incendiary shells]] were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8&nbsp;inch shell guns as part of the standard armament of French and American line-of-battle ships in 1841.<ref>"The canon-obusier [shell gun] originally constructed by [[Henri-Joseph Paixhans|Colonel Paixhans]] for the French Naval Service... was subsequently designated the canon-obusier of 80, No 1 of 1841... the diameter of the bore is 22 centimetres (8.65 inches)." See: [[Howard Douglas|Douglas, Sir Howard]], ''A Treatise on Naval Gunnery 1855'', 4th Edition 1855, republished Conway Maritime Press, 1982, ISBN 0-85177-275-7, p. 201. <br />The British undertook trials with shell guns trials at {{HMS|Excellent|1787|6}}' starting in 1832.

ISBN 0-87021-007-6, p. 149.</ref> In the [[Crimean War]], six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] destroyed seven Turkish frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the [[Battle of Sinop]] in 1853.<ref>Lambert, Andrew D, ''The Crimean War, British Grand Strategy Against Russia, 1853–56'', Manchester University Press, 1990, ISBN 0-7190-3564-3, pp. 60–61.</ref> Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Battle of Kinburn]].<ref name="Lambert">Lambert, Andrew: ''Battleships in Transition'', pp. 92–96.</ref>

Nevertheless wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to shells, as shown in the 1866 [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]], where the modern Austrian steam two-decker {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|6}} ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] ironclad and took 80 hits from Italian ironclads,<ref>Clowes, William Laird, ''Four Modern Naval Campaigns'', Unit Library, 1902, republished Cornmarket Press, 1970, ISBN 0-7191-2020-9, p. 68.</ref> many of which were shells,<ref>Clowes, William Laird. ''Four Modern Naval Campaigns'', pp. 54–55, 63.</ref> but including at least one 300&nbsp;pound shot at point blank range.

''Ironclads in Action&nbsp;– Vol 1'', London, 1898, p. 240.</ref>

===Iron armor and construction===
[[File:Hms warrior.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Warrior|1860}}, the Royal Navy's first ocean–going iron hulled warship.]]

The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron [[armour|armor]] plate on warships necessary. In 1859 [[France]] launched {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}}, the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, ''Gloire'' was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor.<ref>Gibbons, Tony. ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', pp. 28–29.</ref> ''Gloire'' prompted further innovation from the [[Royal Navy]], anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.

The superior armored frigate {{HMS|Warrior|1860|2}} followed ''Gloire'' by only 14 months, and both nations embarked on a program of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigates.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 30–31.</ref> Within two years, Italy, Austria, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the {{USS|Monitor}} and the {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} at the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.<ref name="Sondhaus" />

[[File:LeRedoutablePhoto.jpg|thumb|The French {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable|1876|2}}, the first battleship to use steel as the main building material<ref>Gibbons, p. 93.</ref>]]

Navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in [[Gun turret|turrets]] (like the USS ''Monitor''), [[central battery ship|central-batteries]] or [[barbette]]s, or with the [[naval ram|ram]] as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s [[steel]] was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}}, laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central [[artillery battery|battery]] and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.<ref>Conway Marine, "Steam, Steel and Shellfire", p. 96.</ref>

===Pre-dreadnought battleship===
{{Main|Pre-dreadnought battleship}}
[[File:USS Texas2.jpg|thumb|Pre-''Dreadnought'' battleship {{USS|Texas|1892|6}}, built in 1892, was the first battleship of the U.S. Navy. [[Photochrom]] print c. 1898.]]

The term "battleship" was officially adopted by the Royal Navy in the re-classification of 1892. By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type that later became known as the 'pre-dreadnought battleship' emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s, had a speed of {{convert|16|kn|km/h|0}}, and an armament of four {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure.<ref name="Stoll" /> An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British {{sclass-|Devastation|ironclad|4}} of 1871.<ref>Gibbons, Tony: ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Battleships'', p. 101.</ref>

The slow-firing {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as [[cruiser]]s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref>Hill, Richard. ''War at Sea in the Ironclad Age'', ISBN 0-304-35273-X. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.<ref name="Sondhaus" />

[[File:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Diagram of {{HMS|Agamemnon|1906|6}} (1908), a typical late pre-dreadnought battleship]]

In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became an [[arms race]] between Britain and [[German Empire|Germany]]. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the [[United States]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref name="k209">Kennedy, p. 209.</ref> Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]] all had second-rate fleets led by [[armored cruiser]]s, [[coastal defence ship]]s or [[monitor (warship)|monitors]].<ref>Preston, Anthony. ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II'' {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and [[steam engine]]s were all improved over the years, and [[torpedo]] tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American {{sclass-|Kearsarge|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|battleship|4}}es, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.<ref>Preston, Anthony. ''Battleships of World War I'', New York City: Galahad Books, 1972. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

==Dreadnought era==
{{See also|Dreadnought}}
In 1906, the British [[Royal Navy]] launched the revolutionary {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}. Created as a result of pressure from Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Sir John ("Jackie") Fisher]], HMS ''Dreadnought'' made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an "all-big-gun" armament of ten 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns with unprecedented speed (from steam turbine engines) and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programmes. While the Japanese had laid down an all-big-gun battleship, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}} in 1904,<ref>Gibbons, p. 168.</ref> and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. ''Dreadnought'' sparked a new [[arms race]], principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.

Technical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with step changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.

===Origin===
[[File:Vittoriocuniberti001.jpg|thumb|upright|Vittorio Cuniberti]]
In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.

Admiral [[Vittorio Cuniberti]], the Italian Navy's chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in [[Jane's Fighting Ships|''Jane{{'}}s'']] proposing an "ideal" future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000&nbsp;tons, armed solely with a single calibre main battery (twelve 12-inch {305&nbsp;mm} guns), carrying {{convert|300|mm|in|0|sing=on}} [[belt armor]], and capable of 24 [[knot (unit)|knots]] (44&nbsp;km/h).<ref>Cuniberti, Vittorio, "An Ideal Battleship for the British Fleet", ''All The World's Fighting Ships'', 1903, pp. 407–409.</ref>

The [[Russo-Japanese War]] provided operational experience to validate the 'all-big-gun' concept. At the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], pre-dreadnoughts exchanged volleys at ranges of 7,600–12,000 yd (7 to 11&nbsp;km), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries were just as important as the larger weapons.<ref name="Sondhaus" />

In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme were the first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign.<ref>Breyer, ''Battleships and Battlecruisers of the World'', p. 331.</ref> The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional [[Compound engine|triple-expansion steam engine]]s.<ref>Evans and Peattie, ''Kaigun'', p. 159.</ref>

[[File:Japanese battleship Satsuma.jpg|thumb|left|A preliminary design for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}} was an "all-big-gun" design.]]
As early as 1904, Jackie Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on {{convert|12|in|mm|0|sing=on}} guns.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> Fisher's concerns were [[submarine]]s and [[destroyer]]s equipped with torpedoes, then threatening to outrange battleship guns, making speed imperative for [[capital ship]]s.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> Fisher's preferred option was his brainchild, the [[battlecruiser]]: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to {{convert|25|kn|km/h|0}} by [[steam turbine]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title= British Battlecruisers 1914–18 |last= Burr |first= Lawrence |year= 2006 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-84603-008-0 |pages= 4–7}}</ref>

It was to prove this revolutionary technology that ''Dreadnought'' was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the [[Gun turret|wings]], giving her at her launch twice the [[broadside]] of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76&nbsp;mm) [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing]] guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 170–171.</ref>

[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|right|{{HMS|Dreadnought|1906}}]]

''Dreadnought'' was to have been followed by three {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser|2}}s, their construction delayed to allow lessons from ''Dreadnought'' to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended ''Dreadnought'' to be the last Royal Navy battleship,<ref name="Sondhaus" /> the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets had limited arcs of fire and strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the {{sclass-|Bellerophon|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|St. Vincent|battleship|4}}es.

An American design, {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|2}}, authorized in 1905 and laid down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|2}}, were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.

===Arms race===
{{see also|World War I naval arms race (disambiguation){{!}}World War I naval arms race}}
In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by HMS ''Dreadnought'', the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany.<ref name="k209"/> In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with ''Dreadnought''. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons today, represented a nation's standing in the world.<ref name="Sondhaus"/> Germany, France, Japan,<ref name=Ireland_p66/> Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; and second-rank powers including Turkey, [[Argentina]], [[Russia]],<ref name=Ireland_p66>Ireland, Bernard Janes War at Sea, p. 66.</ref> Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.

==World War I==
{{See also|Naval warfare of World War I}}
Contrary to common belief, battleships were the dominant naval weapon of the World War I era. There were few serious challenges at that time. The most significant naval battles of World War I, such as Jutland (31 May 1916-1 June 1916), were fought by battleships and their battlecruiser cousins.

[[File:Hochseeflotte 1.jpg|thumb|left|German [[High Seas Fleet]] during [[World War I]]]]

By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy was able to use her imposing battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept [[High Seas Fleet|Germany's smaller battleship fleet]] bottled up in the [[North Sea]]: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= Adrian |title= The encyclopedia of warfare: from earliest time to the present day, Part 25 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |year= 2000 |page= 224 |isbn= 978-1-57958-216-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MZoO7SIwMVIC&pg=PA224&dq=%22world+war+i%22+%22high+seas+fleet%22+%22royal+navy%22+%22north+sea%22&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=%22world%20war%20i%22%20%22high%20seas%20fleet%22%20%22royal%20navy%22%20%22north%20sea%22&f=false|accessdate=2012-04-17}}</ref> Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully blockade Great Britain unlike Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. Royal Navy however, were able to adopt convoy tactics to combat the submarine blockade and eventually defeated it.<ref>Keegan, p. 289.</ref>

The first two years of war saw the Royal Navy's battleships and battlecruisers regularly "sweep" the North Sea making sure that no German ships could get in or out. Only a few German surface ships that were already at sea, such as the famous light cruiser Emden, were able to raid commerce. Even some of those that did manage to get out were hunted down by battlecruisers, as in the Battle of the Falklands, 7 December 1914. The results of sweeping actions in the North Sea were battles such as the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]] and German raids on the English coast. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the [[Battle of Jutland]].<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 88–95.</ref> The German fleet withdrew to port after two short encounters with the British fleet. Less than two months later, the Germans once again attempted to draw portions of the Grand Fleet into Battle. The resulting [[Action of 19 August 1916]] proved inconclusive. This reinforced German determination not to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.<ref>Padfield 1972, p. 240.</ref>

In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the [[Black Sea]], engagement between [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]].<ref>[[Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain]] Episode 3.</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C2280, Szent István, Sinkendes Linienschiff.jpg|thumb|right|The sinking of {{SMS|Szent István}}, after being torpedoed by [[Regia Marina|Italian]] [[motor torpedo boats|motor boats]]]]

Torpedo boats did have some successes against battleships in World War I, sinking the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought Szent Istvan and the British pre-dreadnought Goliath. In large fleet actions, however, destroyers and torpedo boats were usually unable to get close enough to the battleships to damage them. The only battleship sunk in a fleet action by either torpedo boats or destroyers was the obsolescent German pre-dreadnought Pommern. She was sunk by destroyers during the night phase of the Battle of Jutland.

Submarines did prove to be an incredibly dangerous threat to older predreadnought battleships, but not a single dreadnought battleship was sunk by submarine torpedoes in World War I. In September 1914, the threat posed surface ships by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British [[armored cruiser]]s by the German submarine {{SMU|U-9}} in less than an hour. Sea mines proved a threat the next month, when the recently commissioned British super-dreadnought {{HMS|Audacious|1912|2}} struck a mine and sank: the only casualty of a dreadnought battleship to mine strike in WWI. But threats to battleship was enough to cause the British Navy to change their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.<ref>Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp. 127–145.</ref> Whilst the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers successfully turning away the British battleship, the German attempt to rely on U-boat attacks on the British fleet failed.<ref>Massie, Robert. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. pp. 675.</ref> Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.

The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for the remainder of the war.<ref>Kennedy, pp. 247–249.</ref> Other theatres equally showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts: {{SMS|Szent István}} of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] was sunk by [[Regia Marina|Italian]] [[motor torpedo boats]] in June 1918, while her sister ship, {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}}, was sunk by [[frogman|frogmen]].

==Inter-war period==
For many years, [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] simply had no battleships. The [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice with Germany]] required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in [[Scapa Flow]], [[Scotland]]. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were [[scuttling|scuttled]] by their German crews on 21 June 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any [[capital ship]]s.<ref>Ireland, Bernard: ''Jane's War At Sea'', p. 118.</ref>

[[File:HMS Nelson (1931) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|Profile drawing of {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} commissioned 1927]]
The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''U.S. Battleships'', pp. 181–2.</ref>

While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan.<ref>Kennedy, p. 277.</ref> The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the [[Geneva Naval Conference|First Geneva Naval Conference]] (1927), the [[London Naval Treaty|First London Naval Treaty]] (1930), the [[Second Geneva Naval Conference]] (1932), and finally the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on 1 September 1939 at the beginning of [[World War II]], but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply.<ref>Ireland, Bernard. ''Jane's War At Sea'', pp. 124–126, 139–142.</ref> The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched from 1919–1939 than from 1905–1914. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British {{sclass2-|N3|battleship|2}}, the first American {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|4}}, and the Japanese {{sclass-|Kii|battleship|4}}—all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as [[treaty battleship]]s.<ref>Sumrall, Robert.

===Rise of air power===
[[File:Ostfriesland bombed by Mitchells team p19.jpg|thumb|Bombing tests which sank {{SMS|Ostfriesland}} (1909), September 1921]]

As early as 1914, the British Admiral [[Percy Scott]] predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by [[military aviation|aircraft]].<ref>Kennedy, p. 199.</ref> By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the torpedo as a weapon.<ref>From the ''Guinness Book of Air Facts and Feats ''(3rd edition, 1977): "The first air attack using a torpedo dropped by an aeroplane was carried out by Flight Commander [[Charles H. K. Edmonds]], flying a [[Short Type 184|Short 184]] seaplane from {{HMS|Ben-my-Chree}} on 12 August 1915, against a 5,000 ton (5,080 tonne) Turkish supply ship in the [[Sea of Marmara]]. Although the enemy ship was hit and sunk, the captain of a British submarine claimed to have fired a torpedo simultaneously and sunk the ship. It was further stated that the British submarine E14 had attacked and immobilised the ship four days earlier. However, on 17 August 1915, another Turkish ship was sunk by a torpedo of whose origin there can be no doubt. On this occasion Flight Commander C. H. Edmonds, flying a Short 184, torpedoed a Turkish steamer a few miles north of the Dardanelles. His formation colleague, Flight Lieutenant G. B. Dacre, was forced to land on the water owing to engine trouble but, seeing an enemy tug close by, taxied up to it and released his torpedo. The tug blew up and sank. Thereafter, Dacre was able to take off and return to the ''Ben-my-Chree''.</ref> In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist [[Giulio Douhet]] completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled ''The Command of the Air'', which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.

In the 1920s, General [[Billy Mitchell]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps]], believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that "1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship" and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds.<ref>[[Walter J. Boyne|Boyne, Walter J.]] [http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1996/June%201996/0696billy.aspx "The Spirit of Billy Mitchell"]. Air Force Magazine, June 1996.</ref> This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the "unsinkable" German World War I battleship {{SMS|Ostfriesland}} and the American pre-dreadnought {{USS|Alabama|BB-8|2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/navybomb2.htm |title= Vice Admiral Alfred Wilkinson Johnson, USN Ret.

Although Mitchell had required "war-time conditions", the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of ''Ostfriesland'' was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, "No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them." While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> Rear Admiral [[William A. Moffett]] used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.<ref>Jeffers, H. Paul (2006).

===Rearmament===
The [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]], and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] extensively upgraded and modernized their World War I–era battleships during the 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the "Queen Anne's castle", such as in the {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|2}} and {{HMS|Warspite|03|2}}, which would be used in the new conning towers of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|0}} [[fast battleship]]s. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive "[[pagoda]]" structures, though the {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}} received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|2}}s. Bulges were fitted, including steel tube array to improve both underwater and vertical protection along waterline. The U.S. experimented with [[Lattice mast|cage masts]] and later tripod masts, though after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] some of the most severely damaged ships such as {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}} and {{USS|California|BB-44|2}} were rebuilt to a similar appearance to their {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|0}} contemporaries (called tower masts). Radar, which was effective beyond visual contact and was effective in complete darkness or adverse weather conditions, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm |title= CombinedFleet.com |publisher= Combinedfleet.com |date= |accessdate= 2009-01-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090203152004/http://www.combinedfleet.com/b_fire.htm| archivedate= 3 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance which it had held in the years before World War I. The "building holiday" imposed by the naval treaties meant that the building capacity of dockyards worldwide was relatively reduced, and the strategic position had changed.

In [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], the ambitious [[Plan Z]] for naval rearmament was abandoned in favour of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|2}}s as commerce raiders. In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}}. It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}es, and the Italians two {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship|0}} ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1939)|4}}. Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|0}} ships (although the third, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Shinano||2}}, was later completed as a carrier) and a planned fourth was cancelled.<ref name="Lenton" />

At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish]] navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, {{ship|Spanish battleship|España|1913|2}} and {{ship|Spanish battleship|Jaime I||2}}. ''España'' (originally named ''Alfonso XIII''), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], fell into [[Spain under Franco|Nationalist]] hands in July 1936. The crew aboard ''Jaime I'' murdered their officers, mutinied, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units.<ref>Gibbons, p. 195.</ref> In April 1937, ''España'' ran into a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, ''Jaime I'' was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On 29 May 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} outside [[Ibiza]], causing severe damage and loss of life. {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} retaliated two days later by bombarding [[Almería]], causing much destruction, and the resulting [[Deutschland incident (1937)|''Deutschland'' incident]] meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.<ref>Greger, René. ''Schlachtschiffe der Welt'', p. 251.</ref>

==World War II==
{{Main|Battleships in World War II}}
[[File:Yamato during Trial Service.jpg|thumb|right|''Yamato'' during sea trials, October 1941.]]
[[File:US warships entering Lingayen Gulf 1945.jpg|thumb|{{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38|2}} leading battleship {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|2}} and cruisers {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}}, {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}, and {{USS|Columbia|CL-56|2}} into [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Philippines]], January 1945]]

The {{ship|German battleship|Schleswig-Holstein||2|up=y}}—an obsolete [[pre-dreadnought]]—fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at [[Westerplatte]];<ref>Gibbons, p. 163.</ref> and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}. Between those two events, it had become clear that aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet and that battleships now performed a secondary role.

Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as independent commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by [[aircraft carrier]]s.

In the first year of the war, armored warships defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} surprised and sank the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious||2}} off western [[Norway]] in June 1940.<ref>Gibbons, pp. 246–247.</ref> This engagement marked the last time a fleet carrier was sunk by surface gunnery. In the [[attack on Mers-el-Kébir]], British battleships opened fire on the French battleships in the harbour near Oran in Algeria with their heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.

The subsequent years of the war saw many demonstrations of the maturity of the aircraft carrier as a strategic naval weapon and its potential against battleships. The British air attack on the Italian naval base at [[Battle of Taranto|Taranto]] sank one Italian battleship and damaged two more. The same [[Fairey Swordfish|Swordfish]] torpedo bombers played a crucial role in sinking the German commerce-raider {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}.

[[File:Yamato under air attack.jpg|thumb|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''Yamato'' (1940), seen here under air attack in 1945, and her sister ship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} (1940) were the heaviest battleships in history.]]

On 7 December 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Within a short time five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The American aircraft carriers were out to sea, however, and evaded detection. They in turn would take up the fight, eventually turning the tide of the war in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinking of the British battleship ''Prince of Wales'']] and her escort, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse||2}}, demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, finally settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and en route to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]] when they were caught by Japanese land-based [[bomber]]s and [[torpedo bomber]]s on 10 December 1941.<ref>Axell, Albert: ''Kamikaze'', p. 14.</ref>

At many of the early crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}}, which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46&nbsp;cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in [[Kantai Kessen|Japanese pre-war planning]].<ref>Gibbons, pp. 262–263.</ref>

The last battleship confrontation in history was the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]], on October 25, 1944, in which a numerically and technically superior American battleship group destroyed a lesser Japanese battleship group by gunfire after it had already been devastated by destroyer torpedo attacks. All but one of the American battleships in this confrontation had previously been sunk by the Attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and subsequently raised and repaired. When {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}} fired the last salvo of this battle, the last salvo fired by a battleship against another heavy ship, she was "firing a funeral salute to a finished era of naval warfare."<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of US Naval Operations in World War II'' Vol. 12, ''Leyte'', p. 141.</ref> In April 1945, during the battle for [[Okinawa]], the world's most powerful battleship,<ref>Jentschura, Dieter, Mickel p. 39.</ref> the ''Yamato'', was sent out against a massive U.S. force on [[Operation Ten-Go|a suicide mission]] and sunk by overwhelming carrier aircraft with nearly all hands.

==Cold War==
[[File:Operation Crossroads Baker Edit.jpg|thumb|[[Operation Crossroads]]]]

After World War II, several navies retained their existing battleships, but they were no longer strategically dominant military assets. Indeed, it soon became apparent that they were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance and only one new battleship was commissioned after the war, {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}. During the war it had been demonstrated that battleship-on-battleship engagements like [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]] or the sinking of {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} were the exception and not the rule, and with the growing role of aircraft engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] as tactical missiles with a range of {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} or more could be mounted on the Soviet {{sclass-|Kildin|destroyer|2}} and {{sclass2-|Whiskey|submarine|2}}s. By the end of the 1950s, minor vessel classes which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition now were capable of eliminating battleships at will.

The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|6}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions.<ref>''Operation 'Crossroads'&nbsp;— the Bikini A-bomb tests'', in {{cite book |last= Ireland |first= Bernard |title= Jane's Battleships of the 20th Century |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 1996 |location= New York |pages= 186–87 |isbn= 0-00-470997-7}}</ref> The {{ship|Italian battleship|Giulio Cesare||2|up=y}} was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed ''Novorossiysk''; she was sunk by a leftover German mine in the [[Black Sea]] on 29 October 1955.

[[File:Missouri missile BGM-109 Tomahawk.JPG|thumb|{{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} launches a [[Tomahawk missile]] during ''Operation Desert Storm''.]]

The {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship|2}}s gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. [[Radar]] and computer-controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The U.S. recommissioned all four ''Iowa''-class battleships for the [[Korean War]] and the {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}} for the [[Vietnam War]]. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, ''New Jersey'' firing nearly 6,000 rounds of 16&nbsp;inch shells and over 14,000 rounds of 5&nbsp;inch projectiles during her tour on the gunline,<ref>Polmar, p. 129.</ref> seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had fired in the Second World War.<ref>History of World Seapower, Bernard Brett, ISBN 0-603-03723-2, p. 236.</ref>

As part of [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[John F. Lehman]]'s effort to build a [[600-ship Navy]] in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of ''[[Soviet battlecruiser Kirov|Kirov]]'' by the Soviet Union, the United States recommissioned all four ''Iowa''-class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in [[carrier battle group]]s, or led their own [[battleship battle group]]. These were modernized to carry [[Tomahawk missile]]s, with ''New Jersey'' seeing action bombarding [[Lebanon]] in 1983 and 1984, while {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} and {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}} fired their 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991. ''Wisconsin'' served as the [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|TLAM]] strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of ''Desert Storm'', firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; ''Missouri'' was targeted by two [[Iraq]]i [[Silkworm missile]]s, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer {{HMS|Gloucester|D96|6}}.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20090426090614/http://www.global-defence.com/1997/DefencePower.html Defence power: developments of the decade]</ref>

==Modern times==
[[File:USS Texas BB-35.jpg|thumb|left|The American {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}} (1912) is the only preserved example of a Dreadnought-type battleship that dates to the time of the original HMS ''Dreadnought''.]]

All four ''Iowa'' ships were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. USS ''Iowa'' and USS ''Wisconsin'' were maintained to a standard where they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel.  These last two battleships were finally stricken from the U.S. [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 2006.<ref name="BB61">[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB61.htm Naval Vessel Register for BB61].

With the decommissioning of the last ''Iowa''-class ships, no battleships remain in service or in reserve with any navy worldwide. A number are preserved as [[museum ship]]s, either afloat or in drydock. The U.S. has eight battleships on display: {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}}, {{USS|North Carolina|BB-55|2}}, {{USS|Alabama|BB-60|2}}, {{USS|Iowa|BB-61|2}}, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|2}}, {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|2}} and {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}}. ''Missouri'' and ''New Jersey'' are now museums at [[Pearl Harbor]] and [[Camden, New Jersey]], respectively. ''Iowa'' is now on display as an educational attraction at the Los Angeles Waterfront in [[San Pedro, California]]. ''Wisconsin'' was removed from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 2006 and now serves as a museum ship in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref>[http://www.wavy.com/dpp/military/City-to-take-ownership-of-USS-Wisconsin-Friday "WCBC files lawsuit"]. Associated Press. 14 April 2010. Retrieved: 15 April 2010.</ref> ''Massachusetts'', which owns the distinction of never having lost a man while in active service, was acquired by the [[Battleship Cove]] naval museum in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleshipcove.org/exhibits.asp|title=Battleship Cove: Exhibits|author=U.S.S. ''Massachusetts'' Memorial Committee|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> ''Texas'', the first battleship turned into a museum, is on display at the [[San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site]], near [[Houston]]. ''North Carolina'' is on display in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. ''Alabama'' is on display in [[Mobile, Alabama]].  The only other 20th-century battleship on display is the Japanese pre-dreadnought {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}.

Owing to geography, ''Iowa'', ''Missouri'' and ''Wisconsin'' are the only museum battleships not enshrined in their namesake states.

==Strategy and doctrine==

===Doctrine===
Battleships were the embodiment of [[sea power]]. For [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan's theory, proposed in ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History|The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783]]'' of 1890, dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas.<ref>Massie, Robert K. ''Castles of Steel'', London, 2005. ISBN 1-84413-411-3. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> While the work of escorting, [[blockade|blockading]], and raiding might be done by [[cruiser]]s or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. (This concept came to be known as a "[[fleet in being]]".) Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships, which came to be known as the "decisive battle" doctrine in [[Imperial Japanese Navy|some navies]], while targeting merchant ships ([[commerce raiding]] or ''guerre de course'', as posited  by the ''[[Jeune École]]'') could never succeed.<ref>Mahan, A.T., Captain. ''Influence of Sea Power on History, 1660–1783.'' (Boston: Little Brown), ''passim.'' {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship,<ref name="Sondhaus" /><ref>Kennedy, pp. 2, 200, 206.</ref> calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international impact,<ref name="Sondhaus" /> in the end adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.

The "fleet in being" suggested battleships could simply by their existence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic impact.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm |title= "Fleet In Being", Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved 18 March 2007 |publisher= Globalsecurity.org |date= 2007-05-03 |accessdate= 2009-01-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090213032122/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/fleet-in-being.htm| archivedate= 13 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Tactics===
While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike the [[ship of the line]], the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines, weapons which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The ''Jeune École'' school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing [[torpedo boat]]s alongside battleships; these would hide behind the battleships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> While this tactic was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s the Royal Navy had developed the first [[destroyer]]s, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.

Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages [[battlecruisers]], [[cruisers]], destroyers, [[airship]]s, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, [[direction finding]] and [[traffic analysis]] would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.<ref>It could presage an enemy sortie, or locate an enemy over the horizon. Beesly, Patrick. ''Room 40'' (London : Hamish Hamilton)</ref>) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques,<ref>Beesly. {{page needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.

===Strategic and diplomatic impact===
The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing [[nuclear weapon]]s today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation's force projection.<ref name="Sondhaus" />

Even during the [[Cold War]], the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS ''Missouri'' was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and [[Greece|Greek]] waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the [[Balkans|Balkan]] region.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm |title= USS Missouri |accessdate= 2007-03-18 |publisher= Naval Historical Center|work= Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070315201127/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm| archivedate= 15 March 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In September 1983, when [[Druze]] militia in [[Lebanon]]'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS ''New Jersey'' stopped the firing. Gunfire from ''New Jersey'' later killed militia leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/newjersey/bb62-nj.html |title= USS New Jersey |accessdate= 2007-03-18 |work= Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070203052502/http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/ships/battleships/newjersey/bb62-nj.html| archivedate= February 3, 2007}}</ref>

===Value for money===
Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, "The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people".<ref name=Dahl>Dahl, Erik J. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JIW/is_4_58/ai_n15927771/pg_5 "Net-Centric before its time: The Jeune École and Its Lessons for Today"] U.S. Naval War College Review, Autumn 2005, Vol. 58, No. 4</ref> The ''[[Jeune École]]'' school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a [[sea denial]] strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the ''Jeune Ecole'' were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented.<ref name=Dahl/>

The determination of powers such as the [[German Empire]] to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet which has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.<ref name="Sondhaus" /> According to this view, attempts by a weaker navy to compete head-to-head with a stronger one in battleship construction simply wasted resources which could have been better invested in attacking the enemy's points of weakness. In Germany's case, the British dependence on massive imports of food and raw materials proved to be a near-fatal weakness, once Germany had accepted the political risk of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against commercial shipping. Although the U-boat offensive in 1917–18 was ultimately defeated, it was successful in causing huge material loss and forcing the Allies to divert vast resources into [[anti-submarine warfare]]. This success, though not ultimately decisive, was nevertheless in sharp contrast to the inability of the German battlefleet to challenge the supremacy of Britain's far stronger fleet.{{citation needed|reason=Much of this paragraph is uncited.|date=May 2012}}
