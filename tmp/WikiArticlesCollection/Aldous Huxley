'''Aldous Leonard Huxley''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ʌ|k|s|l|i}} (26 July 1894 – 22 November 1963) was an English writer and a prominent member of the famous [[Huxley family]]. Best known for his novels including ''[[Brave New World]]'' and a wide-ranging output of essays, Huxley also edited the magazine ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'', and published short stories, poetry, travel writing, film stories and scripts. He spent the later part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death.

Huxley was a [[Humanism|humanist]], [[pacifist]], and [[Satire|satirist]]. He later became interested in spiritual subjects such as [[parapsychology]] and philosophical [[mysticism]],<ref>{{cite book| last = Thody| first = Philipe| title = Huxley: A Biographical Introduction| year = 1973| publisher = Scribner| isbn = 978-0-289-70188-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = David K.

By the end of his life Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the pre-eminent intellectuals of his time.<ref>Thody, Philipe (1973)</ref>

== Early life ==
{{See also|Huxley family}}

Aldous Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]] and his first wife, [[Julia Arnold]], who founded [[Prior's Field School]]. Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[zoologist]], [[agnostic]] and controversialist ("Darwin's Bulldog"). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].<ref>Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p.&nbsp;5</ref>

Huxley began his learning in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, then continued in a school named [[Hillside]]. His teacher was his mother, who supervised him for several years until she became terminally ill. After Hillside, he was educated at [[Eton College]]. Huxley's mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911, he suffered an illness ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which "left [him] practically blind for two to three years".<ref>{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|year=1939|chapter=biography and bibliography (appendix)|title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan (1st Perennial Classic Ed.)|page=243|publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers}}</ref> Aldous volunteered to join the army at the outbreak of the [[First World War]], but was rejected on health grounds: he was half-blind in one eye. Once his eyesight recovered sufficiently, he was able to study English literature at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], Oxford. In 1916 he edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and later graduated (B.A.) with first class honours. His brother Julian wrote,

<blockquote>I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career&nbsp;... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.<ref>Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto & Windus, London. p.&nbsp;22</ref></blockquote>

Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. He taught French for a year at [[Eton College|Eton]], where [[Eric Blair]] (later to become [[George Orwell]]) and [[Stephen Runciman]] were among his pupils, but was remembered as an incompetent and hopeless teacher who couldn’t keep discipline. Nevertheless, Blair and others were impressed by his use of words.<ref name="Crick">

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time in the 1920s at the technologically advanced [[Brunner Mond|Brunner and Mond]] chemical plant in [[Billingham]], Teesside, and the most recent introduction to his famous science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) states that this experience of "an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence" was one source for the novel.<ref>{{cite book| last = Baggini| first = Julian| title = Atheism| url = http://books.google.com/?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&pg=PA86| year = 2009| publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.| isbn = 978-1-4027-6882-8| page = 86 }}</ref>

==Career==
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s. His first published novels were social satires, beginning with ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921).

=== Bloomsbury set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members – [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]].]]
During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]], home of Lady [[Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. Here he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Clive Bell]]. Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 Middleton Murray was reorganizing the [[Athenaeum (magazine)|Athenaeum]] and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.<ref>''The Huxleys'', Ronald W. Clark, William Heinemann Ltd, London, 1968.</ref>  They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time in the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1933).

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'' Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley|accessdate=2011-05-15| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html| archivedate= 2011-06-06 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== United States ===
In 1937, Huxley moved to [[Hollywood]], with his wife Maria, son Matthew, and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the U.S., mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). In this work he examines the fact that although most people in modern civilisation agree that they want a world of "liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love", they have not been able to agree on how to achieve it.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and vegetarianism through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938 Huxley befriended [[J. Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami]] [[Swami Prabhavananda|Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted "five senses" and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as "Tarzana College" in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley that year's [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.<ref>Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p.103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009</ref> Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period Huxley earned some Hollywood income as a writer. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (1943 film)|Madame Curie]]'' which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (The film was eventually completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1944 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944).

However, his success in Hollywood was minimal. When he wrote a synopsis of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Walt Disney]] rejected it on the grounds that "he could only understand every third word".<ref name="The Huxleys p. 295">{{cite book |last = Clark |first = Ronald William |title=The Huxleys |year=1968 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location = New York |page=295 |isbn = 978-0-434-13580-6}}</ref> Huxley's leisurely development of ideas, it seemed, was not suitable for the movie moguls, who demanded fast, dynamic dialogue above all else. For Dick Huemer, during the 1940s, Huxley went to the first of a five meetings' session to elaborate the script of ''Alice in Wonderland'' but never came again.<ref name="Mouse Under Glass p82">David Koenig, ''Mouse Under Glass'', p.82</ref> For author John Grant, although the movie's character the Caterpillar displays some characteristics familiar from Huxley's discussion of his experiments with [[hallucinogens]], Huxley's contribution to the movie is nonexistent.<ref name="Animated Characters 233">John Grant, ''The Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters'', p.233.</ref>

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of J.D. Unwin's 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and economic Foundations of a New Society''.<ref>J.D. Unwin, ''Hopousia OR The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society'' (1940), Oscar Piest, NY</ref>

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on "how fine and how profoundly important the book is". In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:

<blockquote>Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.<ref name="Smith">{{cite book |last = Huxley |first = Aldous |editor = Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location = London |isbn= 978-0-7011-1312-4}}</ref></blockquote>

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these he put forward some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organization; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians, to a naive public, as well-marketed commodities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (1958-05-18) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref>

=== Post World War II ===
After the Second World War, Huxley applied for United States citizenship. His application was continuously deferred on the grounds that he would not say he would take up arms to defend the U.S. He claimed a philosophical, rather than a religious objection, and therefore was not exempt under the [[McCarran Act]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.charlestonvt.com/Holly/BCL/MCV%20Aldous%20Huxley/Originals/Derbyshire_WhatHappened.ORG.pdf|title=What Happened to Aldous Huxley?|author=J Derbyshire|publisher=The New Criterion|year=2003|postscript=}}</ref> He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the country; and in 1959 he turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]]. During the 1950s, Huxley's interest in the field of [[psychical research]] grew keener, and his later works are strongly influenced by both [[mysticism]] and his experiences with [[psychedelic drug]]s.

In October 1930, the English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] dined with Huxley in [[Berlin]], and to this day rumours persist that Crowley introduced Huxley to [[peyote]] on that occasion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} He was introduced to [[mescaline]] (the key active ingredient of peyote) by the psychiatrist [[Humphry Osmond]] in 1953, taking for his first time during the evening of May 5.<ref>Martin, Douglas. Friday, 22 August 2008 "Humphry Osmond, 86, Who Sought Medicinal Value in Psychedelic Drugs, Dies". New York: ''New York Times''</ref> Through Dr. Osmond, Huxley met millionaire [[Alfred Matthew Hubbard]] who would deal with [[LSD]] on a wholesale basis.<ref>{{cite book| last = Stevens| first = Jay| title = Storming heaven: LSD and the American dream| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WWmAE3kiNzsC&pg=PA47| year = 1987| publisher = Grove Press| isbn = 978-0-8021-3587-2| id = ISBN 0802135872 {{Please check ISBN| pages = 47–64| reason = Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure. }} |year=1998 |publisher=Grove Press |quote=All sorts of crazy things started happening... }}</ref> On 24 December 1955, Huxley took his first dose of LSD. Indeed, Huxley was a pioneer of self-directed psychedelic drug use "in a search for enlightenment". According to a letter written by his wife Laura, Huxley requested and received two intramuscular injections of 100 micrograms of LSD as he lay dying.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html|title=Letters of Note: The most beautiful death |date=2010-03-25}}</ref> His psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (the title deriving from some lines in the book ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[William Blake]]), and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]''.

According to Sam Weller's biography of Bradbury, the latter was dissatisfied with Huxley, especially after Huxley encouraged Bradbury to take psychedelic drugs.

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944 Huxley wrote the introduction to the "Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God",<ref name="IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987">{{cite book| last1 = Isherwood| first1 = Christopher| last2 = Swami Prabhavananda| last3 = Aldous| first3 = Huxley| title = Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God| year = 1987| publisher = Vedanta Press| location = Hollywood, Calif| isbn = 978-0-87481-043-1 }}</ref> translated by Swami Prabhavanada and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 through 1960 Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the Society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''Knowledge and Understanding'' and ''Who Are We'' from 1955.

After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Huxley and the Swami disagreed about the meaning and importance of the LSD drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the Society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

== Eyesight ==
With respect to details about the true quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life, there are differing accounts. Around 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates Method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Corbett]], who was able to teach him in the method. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). It was from this period, with the publication of the generally disputed theories contained in the latter book, that a growing degree of popular controversy arose over the subject of Huxley’s eyesight.

It was, and to a noticeable extent still is, widely held that, for most of his life, since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, that his eyesight was exceedingly poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). For instance, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: "Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment."<ref name="Gardner">From Bennet Cerf’s column in ''The Saturday Review'', 12 April 1952, quoted in

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera Huxley]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': "One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight." After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a "poor fellow who can hardly see" by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempers this: "Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens."<ref name="Huxley">{{cite book| last = Huxley| first = Laura| title = This Timeless Moment| year = 1968| publisher = Farrar, Straus & Giroux| location = New York| isbn = 978-0-89087-968-9 }}</ref> Laura Huxley proceeds to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing''. "The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable." Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley’s eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.<ref>Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary L.A.'' p.50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California</ref>

==Personal life==
He married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at Garsington, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html "Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84".] 17 February 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref> In 1955, Maria died of breast cancer.

In 1956 he married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911–2007), also an author. She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. Laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their provocative marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, "Huxley on Huxley".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/ |title= Huxley on Huxley. |others= Dir. Mary Ann Braubach. Cinedigm, 2010. DVD.}}</ref>

In 1960 Aldous Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]], and in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',<ref>Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969</ref> and gave lectures on "Human Potentialities" at the [[Esalen Institute]], which were fundamental to the forming of the [[Human Potential Movement]].

Despite his interest in spirituality and mysticism, Huxley called himself an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book| title = Aldous Huxley| year = 2003| publisher = Infobase Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7910-7040-6| page = 27| quote = As late as 1962 he wrote to Reid Gardner, “I remain an agnostic who aspires to be a gnostic” (Letters 935).| editor = Harold Bloom }}</ref>

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak, Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for "LSD, 100 µg, intramuscular". According to her account of his death<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html |title=Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note |publisher=Lettersofnote.com |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}</ref> in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:45&nbsp;am and a second one a few hours later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20&nbsp;pm on 22 November 1963.
Media coverage of Huxley's passing was overshadowed by the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], on the same day, as was the death of the British author [[C. S. Lewis]], who also died on 22 November. This coincidence was the inspiration for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, & Aldous Huxley]]''.

Huxley's ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in Compton, a village near [[Guildford]], Surrey, England.<ref>{{Find a Grave|8707127}}</ref> On 26 July 2013 a commemorative bench was unveiled there, donated by the Aldous and Laura Huxley Literary Trust and the International Aldous Huxley Society.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of famous Russian composer Igor Stravinsky who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began 'Variations' in Santa Fé, New Mexico in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood, California on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft (Spies 1965, 62; White 1979, 534). The score is dedicated to the memory of Stravinsky's close friend Aldous Huxley, who died on 22 November 1963, when composition of the Variations was in progress (White 1979, 536–37).

Although not composed for the purpose, Stravinsky's music was twice choreographed for the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, a first version in 1966, and a second version in 1982, both times under the title "Variations" (Barnes 1966; Anderson 1982).

Huxley's literary legacy continues to be represented by the literary agency headed by [[Georges Borchardt]].
