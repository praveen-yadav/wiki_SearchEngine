'''Agni''' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is a [[Rigvedic deities|Hindu deity]], one of the most important of the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] gods. He is the god of fire<ref>[[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Cavendish, Richard]] (1998). ''Mythology, An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Principal Myths and Religions of the World''. ISBN 1-84056-070-3</ref> and the acceptor of sacrifices. The sacrifices made to Agni go to the [[deity|deities]] because Agni is a messenger<ref>{{cite web|author=January 19, 2013 |url=http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/agni-the-messenger-god/ |title=Agni - The Messenger God |publisher=Rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref> from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day, and also immortal. 

Agni, the Vedic god of fire, has two heads, one marks immortality and the other marks an unknown symbol of life. Agni has made the transition into the Hindu pantheon of gods, without losing his importance. With [[Varuna]] and [[Indra]] he is one of the supreme gods in the [[Rigveda]]. The link between heaven and earth, the deities and the humans, he is associated with Vedic sacrifice, taking offerings to the other world in his fire. In [[Hinduism]], his vehicle is the ram.<ref>[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]] (1997). ''World Religions''. New York: DK Publishing, Inc.</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''agni'' is [[Sanskrit]] for "fire" (noun), cognate with [[Latin]] ''ignis'' (the root of English ''ignite''), Russian огонь (''ogon''), Polish "ogień", Serbo-Croatian ''oganj'', and Lithuanian ''ugnis''—all with the meaning "fire", with the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root being ''h₁égni-''. Agni has three forms: fire, lightning and the Sun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/agni.asp |title=Agni, the Vedic God of Fire |publisher=Hinduwebsite.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>

In Hindu scriptures, Agni is the God of Fire, and is present in many phases of life such as honouring of a birth (diva lamp), birthdays (birthday candles on a cake), prayers (diva lamp), weddings (Yagna where the bride and groom circle 7 times) and death (cremation).

==Vedas==
{{Classic element}}
Agni is the first word of the first hymn of the [[Rigveda]]:
<blockquote>{{lang|sa|अग्नि॒म् ई॑ळे पुरो॒हि॑तं यज्ञ॒स्य॑ देव॒म् ऋत्वि॒ज॑म् । होता॑रं रत्नधा॒त॑मम् ॥}}

{{IAST|agním īḷe puróhitaṃ / yajñásya devám ṛtvíjam / hótāraṃ ratnadhâtamam}} <br />

Agni I laud, the [[purohita|high priest]], [[deva (Hinduism)|god]], [[ṛtvíj|minister of sacrifice]], The [[hotar|invoker]], lavishest of wealth.</blockquote>

He is the supreme director of religious ceremonies and duties, and figures as messenger between mortals and gods. Vedic rituals all involve Agni, for example the elaborate [[Agnicayana]], that is, the piling of the fire altar, the [[Agnihotra]], viz., offering to Agni.

The Rigveda often says that Agni arises from water or dwells in the waters. He may have originally been the same as [[Apam Napat]], who is also sometimes described as fire arising from water, which in a natural explanation may have referred to flames from natural gas or oil seepages surfacing through water, or as the seven rays or bands of light of a rainbow. Other Rigvedic names, epithets or aspects of Agni include [[Matarishvan]], [[Jataveda]]s, or Bharata.

Agni is a [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]], second only to [[Indra]] in the power and importance attributed to him in [[Vedic mythology]], with 218 out of 1,028 hymns of the [[Rigveda]] dedicated to him. He is [[Indra]]'s twin, and therefore a son of [[Dyaus Pita]] and [[Prthivi]]. However, he is also said to have two mothers<ref>{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|page=197|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ|quote=Rig Veda I.31.2}}</ref>  (the two parts of the [[Making fire|firedrill]] used to start the fire), and ten servant maids (the fingers of the man who is lighting the fire) or as the twice-born.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|page=43|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ|quote=Rig Veda 1.149.4}}</ref> He is one of the [[Guardians of the directions]], representing the southeast.

==Nature and Significance of Agni==
Agni has two forms: Jaataveda and Kravyada. 
Jaataveda is invoked to burn and carry the offerings (except flesh) to the respective Gods. 
Kravyada is invoked to burn the flesh (corpses and animal parts).

In the Jaataveda form Agni, god of fire  acts as the divine model for the sacrificial priest. He is the messenger who carries the oblation from humans to the gods, bringing the Gods to sacrifice, and interceding between gods and humans (RgV.1.26.3). When Agni is pleased, the gods are generous. Agni represents the cultivated, cooked and cultured aspects of Vedic ritual. Together with Soma, Agni is invoked in the Rig Veda more than any other gods.<ref>Doniger, Wendy (2010). ''The Hindus: An Alternative History''. Oxford University Press.

[[File:Agni and consort.jpg|thumb|Agni with his consort [[Svaha]].]]

In Hindu scriptures, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads and three legs. He has seven fiery tongues with which he licks sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or in a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. Agni is represented as red and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and beneficent qualities, and with black eyes and hair, three legs and seven arms. He rides a ram, or a chariot pulled by goats or, more rarely, parrots. [[Seven rays]] of light emanate from his body. One of his names is ''Saptajihva'', "having seven tongues".<ref name=Jansen>Jansen, Eva Rudy (1993). ''The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning''. p. 64</ref> Another one of his epithets is Abhimani (from Sanskrit: abhi towards + the verbal root man to think, reflect upon) meaning dignified, proud; longing for, thinking.

==Legends==
Agni is the eldest son of [[Brahma]]. In [[Visnu Purana]], Agni (Abhimani) the fire god is said to have sprung from the mouth of the [[Purusha|Virat purusha]], the Cosmic Man. His wife is [[Svaha]]. Abhimani had three sons of surpassing brilliancy: Pavaka, Pavamana, and Suchi, the personifications of the three fires that produced our earth and humanity (VP 1:10).<ref>Dowson, John (1961). ''[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6JB-KOXy5k8C&pg=PA7&dq=abhimani&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=acLESqPjGKKIkATXlNXJAw&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=abhimani&f=false A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion: Geography, History, and Literature]''. Kessinger Publishing. ISBN 0-7661-7589-8</ref> All these three names indicate purity. Abhimanin, his three sons, and their 45 sons constitute the 49 mystic fires of the [[Puranas]] and theosophy. (cf [[Agni Purana]].) [[Agneya]] or Aagneya is the Hindu Goddess of Fire and the daughter of Agni.

His three sons, according to the [[Vayu Purana]], stand for three different aspects of Agni (fire): Pavaka is the electric fire, Pavamana the fire produced by friction, and Suchi the solar fire. Interpreted on the cosmic and human planes, these three fires are "Spirit, Soul, and Body, the three great Root groups, with their four additional divisions" (SD 2:247). They are said to have been cursed by the sage Vasishtha to be born again and again (cf BP 4:24,4; SD 2:247–8). "Every fire has a distinct function and meaning in the worlds of the physical and the spiritual. It has, moreover, in its essential nature a corresponding relation to one of the human psychic faculties, besides its well determined chemical and physical potencies when coming in contact with the terrestrially differentiated matter" (SD 1:521).

[[Agni (Ayurveda)|Agni]] is also an important entity in [[Ayurveda]]. It is considered to be the one which is responsible for the sustenance of life. Agni helps in the various physiological functions of the body.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In some Hindu symbolism, Agni's parents are said to be the two components of the [[Making fire#Hand drill|firedrill]] used to start the fire, and when young he was said to be cared for by ten servants, which represent the fingers of the man who is starting the fire.

==Cultural influence==
[[Agni (missile)|Agni]] is the name of India's first [[ICBM|long-range strategic missile]] capable of [[nuclear weapons]] delivery, becoming only the fourth country to have this combined technology (after the Soviet Union/Russia, the United States and China). The [[Agni-V]] was successfully test launched on April 19, 2012.

==Other religions==

In Newar, Tibetan and Japanese [[Buddhism]], he is a [[Guardians of the directions#Lokapālas|lokapāla]] guarding the Southeast. In the Tibetan text ''Jigten lugs kyi bstan bcos'' it says "Make your hearth in the southeast corner of the house, which is the quarter of Agni". He also plays a central role in most Buddhist ''homa'' fire-[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rites. A typical praise to Agni starts  "Son of Brahma, Lord of the World, King of fire gods empowered by Takki, Whose supreme wisdom burns all delusion [...]"<ref>Perrott, Michael; Tuluku, Sharpa (1987). ''A Manual of Ritual Fire Offerings''. Library of Tibetan Works and Archives. ISBN 81-85102-66-X p. 20.</ref> In [[Mikkyō]] tradition Agni is known as ''Katen'' (火天).
