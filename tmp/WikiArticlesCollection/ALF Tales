'''''ALF Tales''''' is an animated [[United States|American]] series that ran on the [[NBC]] television network on Saturdays from August 1988 to December 1989. The show was a spinoff from the series ''[[ALF: The Animated Series]]''. The show had characters from that series play various characters from [[fairy tale]]s. The fairy tale was usually altered for comedic effect in a manner relational to [[Fractured Fairy Tales]].

Each story typically spoofs a film genre, such as the "Cinderella" episode done as an Elvis movie. Some episodes featured a "[[fourth wall]]" effect where ALF is backstage preparing for the episode, and Rob Cowan would appear drawn as a TV executive (who introduced himself as "Roger Cowan, network executive") to try to brief ALF on how to improve this episode. For instance Cowan once told ALF who was readying for a [[medieval]] themed episode that "less than 2% of our audience lives in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]".
