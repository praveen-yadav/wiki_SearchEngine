{{Politics of the Czech Republic}}
'''Politically''', the '''Czech Republic''' is a multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. According to the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]], the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] is the [[head of state]] while the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]], exercising supreme [[executive power]]. The Legislature is [[bicameral]], with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Poslanecká sněmovna'') and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Senát'').

==Political developments==
The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] political scene supports a broad spectrum of [[political party|parties]] ranging from [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communist Party]] on the far left to various [[nationalistic]] parties on the far right. Generally, the (liberal) right beyond the specific case of huge and conservative [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] is splintered and has failed in several attempts to unite.

Czech voters returned a split verdict in the June 2002 parliamentary elections, giving [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (ČSSD) and Communists majority, without any possibility to form a functioning government together due to [[Vladimír Špidla]]'s strong anticommunism. The results produced a ČSSD coalition government with [[Christian Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party|Christian Democrats]] (KDU-ČSL) and [[Freedom Union-Democratic Union|Liberals]] (US-DEU), while [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democrats]] (ODS) and Communists (KSČM) took place in opposition. The MP ratio was the tiniest 101:99. After many buffetings and, finally, after the catastrophic results of the June [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Czech Republic)|European Parliament election, 2004]] Špidla resigned after a revolt in his own party and the government was reshuffled on the same basis.

As the system in Czech repeatedly produces very weak governments (a specific problem is that about 15% of the electorate support the Communists, who are shunned by all the other parties) there is constant talk about changing it but without much chance of really pushing the reform through. An attempt to increase majority elements by tweaking the system parameters (more smaller districts, [[d'Hondt method]] used) by ČSSD and ODS during their "opposition agreement" 1998–2002 was vehemently opposed by smaller parties and blocked by the Constitutional Court as going too much against the constitution-stated proportional principle; only a moderated form was adopted. This, however led to a stalemate in 2006 elections where both the left and the right each gained exactly 100 seats; as many commenters point out, the earlier system would have given the right 3–4 seats majority.

In March 2006, the parliament overturned a veto by President Václav Klaus, and the Czech Republic became the first former communist country in Europe to grant legal recognition to same-sex partnerships.

A government formed of a coalition of the ODS, KDU-ČSL, and the [[Green Party (Czech Republic)|Green Party]] (SZ), and led by the leader of the ODS [[Mirek Topolánek]] finally succeeded in winning a [[vote of confidence]] on 19 January 2007. This was thanks to two members of the ČSSD, [[Miloš Melčák]] and [[Michal Pohanka]], who abstained.

On 23 March 2009, the government of Mirek Topolánek lost a [[vote of no-confidence]].

The [[President of the Czech Republic]] is elected by direct suffrage (no more than two consecutive). The president is a formal [[head of state]] with limited specific powers, most importantly to return laws to the parliament, nominate [[Constitutional Court]] judges for Senate's approval, and dissolve the parliament under certain special and rare conditions. He also appoints the [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|prime minister]] as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. [[Václav Klaus]], former President of the Czech Republic, former Prime Minister and chairman of Civic Democrats (ODS) remains one of the country's most popular politicians.

The Prime Minister is the head of government and wields considerable powers, including the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy, mobilize the parliamentary majority, and choose governmental ministers.

The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') has [[bicameralism|two chambers]]. The [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Poslanecká sněmovna'') has 200 members, elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]] with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, at first the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former [[Czechoslovakia]].

The [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] (''Senát'') has 81 members, in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] elected by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one third renewed every even year in the autumn. The first election was 1996 (for differing terms). This is patterned after the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] but each constituency is of (roughly) same size and the system used is two-round runoff voting. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout (overall roughly 30% in the first round, 20% in the second).
