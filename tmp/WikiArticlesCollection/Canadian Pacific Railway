The '''Canadian Pacific Railway''' ('''CPR'''), formerly also known as '''CP Rail''' {{reporting mark|CP}} between 1968 and 1996, is a historic Canadian [[Class I railroad|Class I rail carrier]] founded in 1881 and now operated by '''Canadian Pacific Railway Limited''' ({{TSX|CP}}, {{NYSE|CP}}), which began operations as legal owner in a corporate restructuring in 2001.  Headquartered in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], it owns approximately {{convert|14000|mi|-2}} route miles of track all across Canada and into the United States,<ref>{{cite web|author=Canadian Pacific Railway |url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/Media/News/General/2009/Day+of+Mourning.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090430150148/http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/Media/News/General/2009/Day+of+Mourning.htm |archivedate=2009-04-30 |title=Canadian Pacific trains across North America pause for day of mourning |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> stretching from [[Montreal]] to [[Vancouver]], and as far north as [[Edmonton]]. Its rail network also serves major cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City]].

The railway was originally built between eastern Canada and [[British Columbia]] between 1881 and 1885 (connecting with [[Ottawa Valley]] and [[Georgian Bay]] area lines built earlier), fulfilling a promise extended to British Columbia when it entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1871. It was Canada's first [[transcontinental railroad|transcontinental railway]], but currently does not reach the Atlantic coast. Primarily a [[freight]] railway, the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance [[passenger train|passenger]] transport in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the [[colonization|settlement]] and [[economic development|development]] of Western Canada. The CP became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada, a position it held as late as  1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwo.ca/business/200TopCompanies.html|title=The Top 200: Canada's Largest Companies (c1973-74)|publisher=Western Libraries at The University of Western Ontario|year=2008|accessdate=8 April 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080223151834/http://www.lib.uwo.ca/business/200TopCompanies.html|archivedate=23 February 2008}}</ref> Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986, after being assumed by [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]] in 1978. A [[beaver]] was chosen as the railway's logo because it is one of the national symbols of Canada and represents the hardworking character of the company.

The company acquired two American lines in 2009: the [[Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad]] and the [[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad]]. The trackage of the [[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad|ICE]] was at one time part of CP subsidiary [[Soo Line Railroad|Soo Line]] and predecessor line [[The Milwaukee Road]]. The combined [[Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad|DME]]/[[Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad|ICE]] system spanned [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Iowa]], as well as two short stretches into two other states, which included a line to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and a line to Chicago, Illinois, and regulatory approval to build a line into the [[Powder River Basin]] of [[Wyoming]]. The Canadian Pacific Railway is a public company with over 15,000 employees and market capitalization of US $7 billion in 2008.<ref name=zenobank>{{cite web|url=http://zenobank.com/index.php?symbol=CA;CP&page=quotesearch|title=Company Profile for Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CA;CP)|accessdate=7 October 2008}}</ref> It is publicly traded on both the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CP.

==History==
The creation of the Canadian Pacific Railway was a task originally undertaken for a combination of reasons by the [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] government of Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald|Sir John A. Macdonald]]. [[British Columbia]] had insisted upon a transport link to the east as a condition for joining the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] of Canada (initially requesting a wagon road).<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> The government however, proposed to build a railway linking the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[Canadian province|province]] to the eastern provinces within 10 years of 20 July 1871. Macdonald also saw it as essential to the creation of a unified Canadian nation that would stretch across the continent. Moreover, [[manufacturing]] interests in [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] desired access to sources of [[raw material]]s and markets in [[Western Canada|Canada's west]].

[[Image:JaMAC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir John A. Macdonald]].]]
The first obstacle to its construction was political. The logical route went through the American [[Midwest]] and the city of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. In addition to this was the difficulty of building a railroad through the [[Canadian Rockies]], an entirely Canadian route would require crossing {{convert|1600|km|mi|abbr=on}} of rugged terrain of the barren [[Canadian Shield]] and [[muskeg]] of [[Northern Ontario]]. To ensure this routing, the government offered huge incentives including vast grants of land in Western Canada.

In 1873, [[Sir John A. Macdonald]] and other high-ranking politicians, bribed in the [[Pacific Scandal]], granted federal contracts to [[Hugh Allan]]'s "Canada Pacific Railway Company" (which was unrelated to the current company) rather than to [[David Lewis Macpherson]]'s Inter-Ocean Railway Company which was thought to have connections to the American [[Northern Pacific Railway Company]]. Because of this scandal, the Conservative party was removed from office in 1873. The new [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] prime minister, [[Alexander Mackenzie]], ordered construction of segments of the railway as a public enterprise under the supervision of the Department of Public Works led by [[Sandford Fleming]]. Surveying was carried out during the first years of a number of alternative routes in this virgin territory followed by construction of a telegraph along the lines that had been agreed.<ref>

With Macdonald's return to power on 16 October 1878, a more aggressive construction policy was adopted. Macdonald confirmed that [[Port Moody, British Columbia|Port Moody]] would be the terminus of the transcontinental railway, and announced that the railway would follow the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] and [[Thompson River|Thompson]] rivers between Port Moody and [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]]. In 1879, the federal government floated bonds in London and called for tenders to construct the {{convert|206|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the railway from [[Yale, British Columbia]], to [[Savona's Ferry, British Columbia|Savona's Ferry]], on [[Kamloops Lake]]. The contract was awarded to [[Andrew Onderdonk]], whose men started work on 15 May 1880. After the completion of that section, Onderdonk received contracts to build between Yale and Port Moody, and between Savona's Ferry and [[Eagle Pass, British Columbia|Eagle Pass]].

On 21 October 1880, a new syndicate, unrelated to Hugh Allan's, signed a contract with the Macdonald government and Fleming was dismissed. They agreed to build the railway in exchange for [[Canadian dollar|$]]25 million (approximately $625 million in modern Canadian dollars) in credit from the Canadian government and a grant of 25 million acres (100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land. The government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed under government ownership, on which it had already spent at least $25m. But its estimates of the cost of the Rocky Mountain section alone was over $60m.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|1880}}</ref> The government also defrayed surveying costs and exempted the railway from property taxes for 20 years. The Montreal-based syndicate officially comprised five men: [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], [[James J. Hill]], [[Duncan McIntyre (businessman)|Duncan McIntyre]], [[Richard B. Angus]] and [[John Stewart Kennedy]]. [[Donald Alexander Smith|Donald A. Smith]] and [[Norman Kittson]] were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest. On 15 February 1881, legislation confirming the contract received [[royal assent]], and the [[Canadian Pacific Limited|Canadian Pacific Railway Company]] was formally [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the next day.<ref>[http://members.kos.net/sdgagnon/cpa.html "An Act Respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway" 44th Victoria, C.1]</ref>

===Building the railway, 1881–1885===
[[File:Canadian Pacific Railway Crew at lower Fraser Valley (1881).jpg|thumbnail|right|Canadian Pacific Railway Crew laying tracks at lower [[Fraser Valley]], 1881]]
The Canadian Pacific Railway began its westward expansion from [[Bonfield, Ontario]] (previously called Callander Station) where the first spike was driven into a sunken railway tie. Bonfield was inducted into Canadian Railway Hall of Fame in 2002 as the CPR First Spike location. That was the point where the [[Canada Central Railway]] extension ended.<ref>[http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2005_2.html Canada Central Railway]</ref> The CCR was owned by Duncan McIntyre who amalgamated it with the CPR and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed CPR. The CCR started in Brockville and extended to Pembroke. It then followed a westward route along the Ottawa River passing through places like Cobden, Deux-Rivières, and eventually to Mattawa at the confluence of the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers. It then proceeded cross-country towards its final destination Bonfield. Duncan McIntyre and his contractor James Worthington piloted the CPR expansion. Worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the CPR past Bonfield. He remained with the CPR for about a year until he left the company. McIntyre was uncle to John Ferguson who staked out future North Bay after getting assurance from his uncle and Worthington that it would be the divisional and a location of some importance. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

[[Image:Canadian Pacific Railway Survey Engineers, 1872.jpg|left|thumb|Unidentified engineers of the [[Canadian Pacific Survey|Canadian Pacific Railway Survey]], 1872.]]
It was presumed that the railway would travel through the rich "Fertile Belt" of the [[North Saskatchewan River]] valley and cross the [[Rocky Mountains]] via the [[Yellowhead Pass]], a route suggested by [[Sir Sandford Fleming]] based on a decade of work. However, the CPR quickly discarded this plan in favour of a more southerly route across the arid [[Palliser's Triangle]] in Saskatchewan and via [[Kicking Horse Pass]] and down the [[Field Hill]] to the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]]. This route was more direct and closer to the American border, making it easier for the CPR to keep American railways from encroaching on the Canadian market. However, this route also had several disadvantages.

One consequence was that the CPR would need to find a route through the [[Selkirk Mountains]] in British Columbia, as at the time it was not known whether a route even existed. The job of finding a pass was assigned to a [[surveying|surveyor]] named Major [[Albert Bowman Rogers]]. The CPR promised him a [[cheque]] for $5,000 and that the pass would be named in his honour. Rogers became obsessed with finding the pass that would immortalize his name. He discovered the pass in April 1881,<ref>Martin J, Edward. The Railway Stations of Western Canada. Canada: Studio E. 1980.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Downs|first=Art|title=Incredible Rogers Pass|publisher=Heritage|location=Surrey, BC|year=1980|edition=2|page=49|isbn=978-0-919214-08-8}}</ref> and true to its word, the CPR named the pass "[[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]]" and gave him the cheque. However, he at first refused to cash it, preferring to frame it, and saying he did not do it for the money. He later agreed to cash it with the promise of an engraved watch. Another obstacle was that the proposed route crossed land in Alberta that was controlled by the [[Blackfoot]] [[First Nation]]. This difficulty was overcome when a [[missionary]] priest, [[Albert Lacombe]], persuaded the Blackfoot chief [[Crowfoot]] that construction of the railway was inevitable. In return for his assent, Crowfoot was famously rewarded with a lifetime pass to ride the CPR. A more lasting consequence of the choice of route was that, unlike the one proposed by Fleming, the land surrounding the railway often proved too arid for successful agriculture. The CPR may have placed too much reliance on a report from [[natural history|naturalist]] [[John Macoun]], who had crossed the [[prairie]]s at a time of very high rainfall and had reported that the area was fertile. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The greatest disadvantage of the route was in [[Kicking Horse Pass]], at the Alberta/British Columbia border and Continental Divide. In the first {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the 1,625 metre (5,330&nbsp;ft) high summit, the [[Kicking Horse River]] drops 350 metres (1,150&nbsp;ft). The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} long stretch of track with a very steep 4.5 percent gradient once it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era, and even modern railways rarely exceed a 2 percent gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the [[Yellowhead Pass]] and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the CPR's [[Big Hill]]. Safety switches were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at 10&nbsp;km per hour (6&nbsp;mph), and special [[locomotive]]s were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious runaways still occurred including the first locomotive to descend the line. CPR officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the [[Big Hill#The Spiral Tunnels|Spiral Tunnels]] in the early 20th century.

[[Image:William Cornelius Van Horne.jpg|thumb|Sir [[William Cornelius Van Horne]].]]
In 1881 construction progressed at a pace too slow for the railway's officials, who in 1882 hired the renowned railway executive [[William Cornelius Van Horne]], to oversee construction with the inducement of a generous salary and the intriguing challenge of handling such a difficult railway project. Van Horne stated that he would have {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} of main line built in 1882. [[Flood]]s delayed the start of the construction season, but over {{convert|672|km|mi|abbr=on}} of main line, as well as various sidings and branch lines, were built that year. The Thunder Bay branch (west from [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]]) was completed in June 1882 by the Department of Railways and Canals and turned over to the company in May 1883, permitting all-Canadian lake and rail traffic from eastern Canada to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], for the first time in Canada's history. By the end of 1883, the railway had reached the Rocky Mountains, just eight km (5 miles) east of Kicking Horse Pass. The construction seasons of 1884 and 1885 would be spent in the mountains of British Columbia and on the north shore of [[Lake Superior]].
[[File:Canadian Pacific Railroad 3.jpg|thumb|left|C.P.R. railroad trestle bridge]]
Many thousands of [[navvy|navvies]] worked on the railway. Many were European immigrants. In British Columbia, the CPR hired workers from China, called [[coolies]]. A navvy received between  $1 and $2.50 per day, but had to pay for his own food, clothing, transportation to the job site, mail and medical care. After 2-1/2 months of back-breaking labour, they could net as little as   $16. Chinese coolies in British Columbia made only between 75 cents and $1.25 a day, paid in [[rice mat]]s, and not including expenses, leaving barely anything to send home. They did the most dangerous construction jobs, such as working with [[explosive material|explosives]] to clear tunnels through rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/settlement/kids/021013-2031.3-e.html|title=History: Building the Canadian Pacific Railway - Chinese - Explore the Communities - The Kids' Site of Canadian Settlement - Library and Archives Canada|publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> The families of the Chinese who were killed received no compensation, or even notification of loss of life. Many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in China, although Chinese labour contractors had promised that as part of their responsibilities.<ref>[''Beyond the Sterile Mountains: the Chinese in British Columbia'', Joseph Morton, 1976</ref> Many spent years in lonely, sad and often poor conditions. Yet the Chinese were hard working and played a key role in building the western stretch of the railway; even some boys as young as 12 years old served as tea-boys. In 2006 the Canadian government issued a formal apology to the Chinese population in Canada for their treatment both during and following the construction of the CPR.<ref>[http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=2&id=1220|22 June 2006, Prime Minister Harper's speech to the Canadian Parliament]</ref>

By 1883, railway construction was progressing rapidly, but the CPR was in danger of running out of funds. In response, on 31 January 1884, the government passed the Railway Relief Bill, providing a further $22.5 million in loans to the CPR. The bill received royal assent on 6 March 1884. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Completion of the transcontinental railroad was a condition of BC's entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]
In March 1885, the [[North-West Rebellion]] broke out in the [[District of Saskatchewan]]. Van Horne, in [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]] at the time, suggested to the government that the CPR could transport troops to [[Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan]] ([[District of Assiniboia|Assiniboia]]) in 10 days. Some sections of track were incomplete or had not been used before, but the trip to Winnipeg was made in nine days and the rebellion was quickly put down. Perhaps because the government was grateful for this service, they subsequently re-organized the CPR's debt and provided a further $5 million loan. This money was desperately needed by the CPR. On 7 November 1885, the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] was driven at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], making good on the original promise. Four days earlier, the last spike of the Lake Superior section was driven in just west of [[Jackfish, Ontario]]. While the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the new date of 1891 that Macdonald gave in 1881. The successful construction of such a massive project, although troubled by delays and scandal, was considered an impressive feat of engineering and political will for a country with such a small population, limited capital, and difficult terrain. It was by far the longest railway ever constructed at the time. It had taken 12,000 men, 5,000 horses and 300 dog-sled teams to build the railway. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Meanwhile, in Eastern Canada, the CPR had created a network of lines reaching from [[Quebec City]] to [[St. Thomas, Ontario]] by 1885, and had launched a fleet of Great Lakes ships to link its terminals. The CPR had effected purchases and long-term [[leasing|leases]] of several railways through an associated railway company, the [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] (O&Q). The O&Q built a line between [[Perth, Ontario]], and [[Toronto]] (completed on 5 May 1884) to connect these acquisitions. The CPR obtained a 999-year lease on the O&Q on 4 January 1884. Later, in 1895, it acquired a minority interest in the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]], giving it a link to New York and the northeast United States. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===1886–1900===

The [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] in the CPR was driven on November 7, 1885 by one of its directors, [[Donald Smith]], but
so many cost-cutting shortcuts were taken in constructing the railway that regular transcontinental service could not start for another seven months while work was done to improve the railway's condition (part of this was due to snow in the mountains and lack of snowsheds to keep the line open). However, had these shortcuts not been taken, it is conceivable that the CPR might have had to default financially, leaving the railway unfinished. The first transcontinental passenger train departed from Montreal's [[Dalhousie Station (Montreal)|Dalhousie Station]], located at Berri Street and Notre Dame Street at 8&nbsp;pm on 28 June 1886, and arrived at [[Port Moody]] at noon on 4 July 1886. This train consisted of two baggage cars, a mail car, one second-class coach, two immigrant sleepers, two first-class coaches, two sleeping cars and a diner (several dining cars were used throughout the journey, as they were removed from the train during the night, and another one was picked in the morning).

[[Image:Canadian Pacific First Train.jpg|thumb|left|First Transcontinental Train arrives in [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]] on 30 June 1886]]

By that time, however, the CPR had decided to move its western terminus from [[Port Moody]] to [[Gastown]], which was renamed "Vancouver" later that year. The first official train destined for Vancouver arrived on 23 May 1887, although the line had already been in use for three months. The CPR quickly became profitable, and all loans from the Federal government were repaid years ahead of time. In 1888, a branch line was opened between [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] where the CPR connected with the American railway system and its own [[steamship]]s. That same year, work was started on a line from [[London, Ontario]], to the American border at [[Windsor, Ontario]]. That line opened on 12 June 1890. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The CPR also leased the [[New Brunswick Railway]] in 1890 for 990 years,<ref>[http://csc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1988/1988rcs2-654/1988rcs2-654.html ''Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Paul''], [1988] 2 S.C.R. 654 (15 December 1988) . Retrieved 19 October 2009.</ref> and built the [[International Railway of Maine]], connecting Montreal with [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], in 1889. The connection with Saint John on the Atlantic coast made the CPR the first truly transcontinental railway company in Canada and permitted trans-Atlantic cargo and passenger services to continue year-round when [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] closed the port of Montreal during the winter months.

By 1896, competition with the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] for traffic in southern British Columbia forced the CPR to construct a second line across the province, south of the original line. Van Horne, now president of the CPR, asked for government aid, and the government agreed to provide around $3.6 million to construct a railway from [[Lethbridge, Alberta]], through [[Crowsnest Pass]] to the south shore of [[Kootenay Lake]], in exchange for the CPR agreeing to reduce freight rates in perpetuity for key commodities shipped in Western Canada. The controversial Crowsnest Pass Agreement effectively locked the eastbound rate on [[cereal|grain]] products and westbound rates on certain "settlers' effects" at the 1897 level. Although temporarily suspended during World War I, it was not until 1983 that the "[[Crow Rate]]" was permanently replaced by the Western Grain Transportation Act which allowed for the gradual increase of grain shipping prices. The Crowsnest Pass line opened on 18 June 1899, and followed a complicated route through the maze of valleys and passes in southern British Columbia, rejoining the original mainline at [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] after crossing the [[Cascade Mountains]] via [[Coquihalla Pass]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The Southern Mainline, generally known as the [[Kettle Valley Railway]] in British Columbia, was built in response to the booming mining and smelting economy in southern British Columbia, and the tendency of the local geography to encourage and enable easier access from neighbouring US states than from Vancouver or the rest of Canada, which was viewed to be as much of a threat to national security as it was to the province's control of its own resources. The main cross-country passenger service was re-routed to this new southerly line, which connected numerous emergent small cities across the region. Independent railways and subsidiaries that were eventually merged into the CPR in connection with this route were the [[Shuswap and Okanagan Railway]], the [[Kaslo and Slocan Railway]], the [[Columbia and Kootenay Railway]], the [[Columbia and Western Railway]] and various others. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====The CPR and the settlement of Western Canada====
[[Image:Land Ticket.jpg|thumb|One of the CPR's land offerings.]]

Practically speaking, the CPR had built a railway that operated mostly in the wilderness. The usefulness of the Prairies was questionable in the minds of many. The thinking prevailed that the Prairies had great potential. Under the initial contract with the Canadian Government to build the railway, the CPR was granted 25 million acres (100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Proving already to be a very resourceful organization, Canadian Pacific began an intense campaign to bring immigrants to Canada. Canadian Pacific agents operated in many overseas locations. Immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a CP ship, travel on a CP train, and land sold by the CP railway. Land was priced at $2.50 an acre and up but required cultivation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Canadian Pacific Railway Co|journal=The Week : a Canadian journal of politics, literature, science and arts|date=24 Jan 1884|year=1|volume=8|page=127|url=http://archive.org/stream/weekcanadianjour01toro#page/n63/mode/1up|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>  Immigrants paid very little for a seven-day journey to the West. They rode in Colonist cars that had sleeping facilities and a small kitchen at one end of the car. Children were not allowed off the train, lest they wander off and be left behind. The directors of the CPR knew that not only were they creating a nation, but also a long-term source of revenue for their company. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===1901–1928===
[[Image:Carlb-brockville-cptrain.jpg|thumb|CPR [[caboose]] on display at [[Brockville, Ontario]].]]

During the first decade of the 20th century, the CPR continued to build more lines. In 1908 the CPR opened a line connecting Toronto with [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]. Previously, westbound traffic originating in [[southern Ontario]] took a circuitous route through [[eastern Ontario]].

Several operational improvements were also made to the railway in Western Canada. In 1909 the CPR completed two significant engineering accomplishments. The most significant was the replacement of the Big Hill, which had become a major bottleneck in the CPR's main line, with the [[Big Hill|Spiral Tunnels]], reducing the grade to 2.2 percent from 4.5 percent. The Spiral Tunnels opened in August. In April 1908, the CPR started work to replace the Old Calgary-Edmonton Rail Bridge across the Red Deer River with a new standard steel bridge that was completed by March 1909.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://zoominlocal.com/red-deer-advocate/2010/03/19/?article=804405&output=html | title=Canadian Pacific Railway Bridge now 100 years old | publisher=Red Deer Advocate | date=March 19, 2010 | accessdate=December 1, 2012 | author=Dawe, Michael | page=34}}</ref> On 3 November 1909, the [[Lethbridge Viaduct]] over the [[Oldman River]] valley at [[Lethbridge]], Alberta, was opened. It is 1,624 metres (5,327&nbsp;ft) long and, at its maximum, 96 metres (314&nbsp;ft) high, making it the longest railway bridge in Canada. In 1916 the CPR replaced its line through [[Rogers Pass (British Columbia)|Rogers Pass]], which was prone to [[avalanche]]s (the [[1910 Rogers Pass avalanche|most serious of which]] killed 62 men in 1910) with the [[Connaught Tunnel]], an eight km (5 mile) long tunnel under [[Mount Macdonald]] that was, at the time of its opening, the longest railway tunnel in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

On 21 January 1910, a [[Spanish River derailment|passenger train derailed]] on the CPR line at the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] bridge at [[Nairn, Ontario]] (near [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]]), killing at least 43.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tApXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_UINAAAAIBAJ&pg=2107,421404 Soo train goes into the river], Evening Sentinel, Jan 22, 1910</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FfRhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tJIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7184,1782336 Train derailed on bridge], The Age, Jan 25, 1910</ref>

The CPR acquired several smaller railways via long-term leases in 1912. On 3 January 1912, the CPR acquired the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]], a railway that ran in western [[Nova Scotia]]. This acquisition gave the CPR a connection to [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], a significant port on the Atlantic Ocean. The Dominion Atlantic was isolated from the rest of the CPR network and used the CNR to facilitate interchange; the DAR also operated ferry services across the [[Bay of Fundy]] for passengers and cargo (but not rail cars) from the port of [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], to the CPR at [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. DAR steamships also provided connections for passengers and cargo between [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]], Boston and New York. On 1 July 1912, the CPR acquired the [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], a railway on [[Vancouver Island]] that connected to the CPR using a railcar ferry. The CPR also acquired the [[Quebec Central Railway]] on 14 December 1912. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

During the late 19th century, the railway undertook an ambitious program of hotel construction, building the [[Château Frontenac]] in [[Quebec City]], the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] in Toronto, the [[Banff Springs Hotel]], and several other major Canadian landmarks. By then, the CPR had competition from three other transcontinental lines, all of them money-losers. In 1919, these lines were consolidated, along with the track of the old [[Intercolonial Railway]] and its spurs, into the government-owned [[Canadian National Railways]]. The CPR suffered its greatest loss of life when one of its steamships, the ''[[RMS Empress of Ireland|Empress of Ireland]]'', sank after a collision with the Norwegian collier ''[[SS Storstad]].'' On 29 May 1914, the ''Empress'' (operated by the CPR's [[CP Ships|Canadian Pacific Steamship Company]]) went down in the [[St. Lawrence River]] with the loss of 1,024 lives, of which 840 were passengers. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===World War I===
During World War I CPR put the entire resources of the “world’s greatest travel system” at the disposal of the British empire, not only trains and tracks, but also its ships, shops, hotels, telegraphs, and, above all, its people. Aiding the war effort meant transporting and billeting troops; building and supplying arms and munitions; arming, lending and selling ships. Fifty-two CPR ships were pressed into service during World War I, carrying more than a million troops and passengers and four million tons of cargo. Twenty seven survived and returned to CPR. CPR also helped the war effort with money and jobs. CPR made loans and guarantees to the Allies of some $100 million. As a lasting tribute, CPR commissioned three statues and 23 memorial tablets to commemorate the efforts of those who fought and those who died in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpr.ca/en/about-cp/our-past-present-and-future/Documents/cpr-and-war.pdf |title=Canadian Pacific Railway and War |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref> After the war, the Federal government created [[Canadian National Railway]]s (CNR, later CN) out of several bankrupt railways that fell into government hands during and after the war. CNR would become the main competitor to the CPR in Canada.  The first president of the CNR, [[David Blyth Hanna]], did little to foment Alberta, but in 1923 [[Henry Worth Thornton]] replaced him, and his competition spurred [[Edward Wentworth Beatty]], the first Canadian-born president of the CPR, to action.<ref>[http://railways.library.ualberta.ca/Chapters-7-1/ "The Canadian Pacific Railway in Western Canada" (Atlas of Alberta Railways)]</ref>  Together they created part of the golden years in Alberta; it was during this time that the railway land grants were formalised.<ref>[http://railways.library.ualberta.ca/Maps-2-2-7/ "Railway Land Grants in the Prairie Provinces" (Atlas of Alberta Railways)]</ref>

===The Great Depression and World War II, 1929–1945===
[[Image:Kamloops on to Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Strikers from unemployment relief camps climbing on boxcars as part of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]], 1935.]]

The [[Great Depression]], which lasted from 1929 until 1939, hit many companies heavily. While the CPR was affected, it was not affected to the extent of its rival CNR because it, unlike the CNR, was debt-free. The CPR scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services, and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after 1932. Hard times led to the creation of new political parties such as the [[Canadian social credit movement|Social Credit movement]] and the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]], as well as popular protest in the form of the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The On-to-Ottawa Trek|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/onottawa.html |publisher=The University of Calgary (The Applied History Research Group)|year=1997|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref>

One highlight of the late 1930s, both for the railway and for Canada, was the visit of [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] during their [[1939 royal tour of Canada]], the first time that the reigning monarch had visited the country. The CPR and the CNR shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country, with the CPR undertaking the westbound journey from Quebec City to Vancouver. Later that year, World War II began. As it had done in World War I, the CPR devoted much of its resources to the war effort. It retooled its [[Angus Shops]] in Montreal to produce [[Valentine tank]]s and other armored vehicles, and transported troops and resources across the country. As well, 22 of the CPR's ships went to war, 12 of which were sunk. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===1946–1978===
[[Image:CP Multimark.svg|thumb|The Multimark logo was used from 1968 to 1987, when it fell out of favour. It was sometimes referred to as the '[[Pac-Man]]' logo, after the popular ’80s video game of the same name.]]
After World War II, the transportation industry in Canada changed. Where railways had previously provided almost universal freight and passenger services, cars, trucks, and [[fixed-wing aircraft|airplanes]] started to take traffic away from railways. This naturally helped the CPR's air and trucking operations, and the railway's freight operations continued to thrive hauling resource traffic and bulk commodities. However, passenger trains quickly became unprofitable. During the 1950s, the railway introduced new innovations in passenger service, and in 1955 introduced ''[[The Canadian]],'' a new luxury transcontinental train. However, starting in the 1960s the company started to pull out of passenger services, ending services on many of its branch lines. It also discontinued its secondary transcontinental train ''[[The Dominion (passenger train)|The Dominion]]'' in 1966, and in 1970 unsuccessfully applied to discontinue ''The Canadian.'' For the next eight years, it continued to apply to discontinue the service, and service on ''The Canadian'' declined markedly. On 29 October 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to [[Via Rail]], a new federal [[Crown corporation]] that is responsible for managing all intercity passenger service formerly handled by both CP Rail and CN. Via eventually took almost all of its passenger trains, including ''The Canadian,'' off CP's lines. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1968, as part of a corporate re-organization, each of the CPR's major operations, including its rail operations, were organized as separate subsidiaries. The name of the railway was changed to CP Rail, and the parent company changed its name to [[Canadian Pacific Limited]] in 1971. Its express, telecommunications, hotel and real estate holdings were spun off, and ownership of all of the companies transferred to Canadian Pacific Investments. The company discarded its beaver logo, adopting the new [[Multimark]] that was used—with a different colour background—for each of its operations. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===1979–2001===
On 10 November 1979 a [[1979 Mississauga train derailment|derailment of a hazardous materials train]] in [[Mississauga, Ontario]], led to the evacuation of 200,000 people; there were no fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/residents/localhistory?paf_gear_id=9700018&itemId=5500001|title=Mississauga Train Derailment (1979)|work=Local history|publisher=City of Mississauga|accessdate=2006-05-03}}</ref><ref> {{cite web|url=http://cidbimena.desastres.hn/docum/crid/Diciembre2004/pdf/eng/doc4131/doc4131.htm|title=The Mississauga Evacuation, Final Report, November 1981|publisher= Ministry of the Solicitor General of Ontario|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

In 1984 CP Rail commenced construction of the [[Mount Macdonald Tunnel]] to augment the [[Connaught Tunnel]] under the [[Selkirk Mountains]]. The first revenue train passed through the tunnel in 1988. At 14.7&nbsp;km (nine miles), it is the longest tunnel in the Americas. During the 1980s, the [[Soo Line Railroad]], in which CP Rail still owned a controlling interest, underwent several changes. It acquired the [[Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway]] in 1982. Then on 21 February 1985, the Soo Line obtained a controlling interest in the [[Milwaukee Road]], merging it into its system on 1 January 1986. Also in 1980 Canadian Pacific bought out the controlling interests of the [[Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway]] (TH&B) from [[Conrail]] and molded it into the Canadian Pacific System, dissolving the TH&B's name from the books in 1985. In 1987 most of CPR's trackage in the [[Great Lakes]] region, including much of the original Soo Line, were spun off into a new railway, the [[Wisconsin Central Ltd.|Wisconsin Central]], which was subsequently purchased by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]]. Influenced by the [[Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement]] of 1989 which liberalized trade between the two nations, the CPR's expansion continued during the early 1990s: CP Rail gained full control of the Soo Line in 1990, and bought the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] in 1991. These two acquisitions gave CP Rail routes to the major American cities of Chicago (via the Soo Line) and New York City (via the D&H). {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

During the next few years CP Rail downsized its route, and several Canadian [[branch line]]s and even some secondary mainlines were either sold to [[short line railroad|short lines]] or abandoned. This rationalization, however, came at a price, as many [[grain elevator]]s in the region known as Canada's [[Breadbasket]] shut down due to not being able to distribute their thousands of bushels of grain through a large enough region. This included all of its lines east of Montreal, with the routes operating across Maine and New Brunswick to the port of Saint John (operating as the [[Canadian Atlantic Railway]]) being sold or abandoned, severing CPR's transcontinental status (in Canada); the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in the late 1950s, coupled with subsidized icebreaking services, made Saint John surplus to CPR's requirements. During the 1990s, both CP Rail and CN attempted unsuccessfully to buy out the eastern assets of the other, so as to permit further rationalization. As well, it closed divisional and regional offices, drastically reduced white collar staff, and consolidated its Canadian traffic control system in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1996, CP Rail moved its head office to Calgary from Montreal and changed its name back to Canadian Pacific Railway. A new subsidiary company, the [[St. Lawrence and Hudson Railway]], was created to operate its money-losing lines in eastern North America, covering [[Quebec]], Southern and [[Eastern Ontario]], trackage rights to [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], as well as the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] in the [[U.S. Northeast]]. However, the new subsidiary, threatened with being sold off and free to innovate, quickly spun off losing track to short lines, instituted scheduled freight service, and produced an unexpected turn-around in profitability. After only four years, CPR revised its opinion and the StL&H formally re-amalgamated with its parent on 1 January 2001. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===2001 to present===
In 2001, the CPR's parent company, [[Canadian Pacific Limited]], spun off its five subsidiaries, including the CPR, into independent companies. Most of the company's non-railroad businesses at the time of the split were operated by a separate subsidiary called [[Canadian Pacific Limited]]. Canadian Pacific Railway formally (but, not legally) shortened its name to Canadian Pacific in early 2007, dropping the word "railway" in order to reflect more operational flexibility. Shortly after the name revision, Canadian Pacific announced that it had committed to becoming a major sponsor and logistics provider to the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Freight trains==

Over half of CP's freight traffic is in coal, grain, and [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] freight, and the vast majority of its profits are made in western Canada. A major shift in trade from the Atlantic to the Pacific has caused serious drops in CPR's wheat shipments through [[Thunder Bay]]. It also ships automotive parts and assembled automobiles, [[sulphur]], [[fertilizer]]s, other [[chemical]]s, forest products, and other types of commodities. The busiest part of its railway network is along its main line between Calgary and Vancouver. Since 1970, coal has become a major commodity hauled by CPR. Coal is shipped in [[unit train]]s from coal mines in the mountains, most notably [[Sparwood, British Columbia]] to terminals at [[Roberts Bank]] and [[North Vancouver, British Columbia|North Vancouver]], from where it is then shipped to Japan. The CPR hauls over 34 million tons of coal to the west coast each year, mainly for export to Japan. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Grain is hauled by the CPR from the prairies to ports at [[Thunder Bay]] (the former cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]), Quebec City and Vancouver, where it is then shipped overseas. The traditional winter export port was West Saint John, New Brunswick when ice closed the St. Lawrence River. Grain has always been a significant commodity hauled by the CPR; between 1905 and 1909, the CPR double-tracked its section of track between [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] (Which is today part of the city of [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Thunder Bay]]) and [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] to facilitate grain shipments. For several decades this was the only long stretch of double-track mainline outside of urban areas on the CPR. Today, though the Thunder Bay-Winnipeg section is now single tracked, the CPR still has two long distance double track lines serving rural areas, including a {{convert|75|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch between [[Kent, British Columbia]] and [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] which follows the [[Fraser River]] into the [[Coast Mountains]], as well as the Canadian Pacific Winchester Sub, a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of double track mainline which runs from [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]] through downtown [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]] which runs through many rural farming communities. There are also various long stretches of double track between [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and [[Kamloops, British Columbia|Kamloops]], British Columbia and portions of the original Winnipeg-Thunder Bay double track (such as 20 miles through [[Kenora, Ontario|Kenora]] and [[Keewatin, Ontario|Keewatin]], Ontario) are still double track. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1952, the CPR became the first North American railway to introduce [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] or "piggyback" [[freight]] service, where truck trailers are carried on [[flat car]]s. Containers later replaced most piggyback service. In 1996, the CPR introduced a scheduled reservation-only short-haul intermodal service between Montreal and West Toronto called the ''Iron Highway''; it utilized unique equipment that was later replaced (1999) by conventional piggyback flatcars and renamed ''Expressway''. This service was extended to Detroit with plans to reach Chicago however CP was unable to locate a suitable terminal. Loss of the small Detroit terminal and low US traffic along with loss of the Chrysler Windsor traffic it was later cut back to Milton, west of Toronto. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Passenger trains==
The train was the primary mode of long-distance transportation in Canada until the 1960s. Among the many types of people who rode CPR trains were new immigrants heading for the prairies, military troops (especially during the two world wars) and upper class tourists. It also custom-built many of its [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]] at its [[CPR Angus Shops]] to be able to meet the demands of the upper class.

[[Image:Angus.JPG|thumb|An Angus Shops building converted into an [[Société des alcools du Québec|SAQ]] liquor store.]]
The CPR also had a line of Great Lakes ships integrated into its transcontinental service. From 1885 until 1912, these ships linked Owen Sound on Georgian Bay to Fort William. Following a major fire in December 1911 that destroyed the grain elevator, operations were relocated to a new, larger port created by the CPR at Port McNicoll opening in May 1912. Five ships allowed daily service, and included the S.S. ''Assiniboia'', and S.S. ''Keewatin'' built in 1908 which remained in use until the end of service. Travellers went by train from Toronto to that Georgian Bay port, then travelled by ship to link with another train at the Lakehead. After World War II, the trains and ships carried automobiles as well as passengers. This service featured what was to become the last [[boat train]] in North America. The ''Steam Boat'' was a fast, direct connecting train between Toronto and Port McNicoll. The passenger service was discontinued at the end of season in 1965 with one ship, the ''Keewatin'', carrying on in freight service for two more years. It later became a marine museum in the United States. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

After World War II, passenger traffic declined as automobiles and aeroplanes became more common, but the CPR continued to innovate in an attempt to keep ridership up. Beginning 9 November 1953, the CPR introduced [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s (RDCs) on many of its lines. Officially called "Dayliners" by the CPR, they were always referred to as ''Budd Cars'' by employees. Greatly reduced travel times and reduced costs resulted, which saved service on many lines for a number of years. The CPR would go on to acquire the second largest fleet of RDCs totaling 52 cars. Only the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] had more. This CPR fleet also included the rare model RDC-4 (which consisted of a mail section at one end and a baggage section at the other end with no formal passenger section). On 24 April 1955, the CPR introduced a new luxury transcontinental passenger train, ''The Canadian''. The train provided service between Vancouver and Toronto or Montreal (east of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]; the train was in two sections). The train, which operated on an expedited schedule, was pulled by [[diesel locomotives]], and used new, streamlined, stainless steel rolling stock. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Starting in the 1960s, however, the railway started to discontinue much of its passenger service, particularly on its branch lines. For example, passenger service ended on its line through southern [[British Columbia]] and [[Crowsnest Pass]] in January 1964, and on its [[Quebec Central]] in April 1967, and the transcontinental train ''The Dominion'' was dropped in January 1966. On 29 October 1978, CP Rail transferred its passenger services to [[Via Rail]], a new federal Crown corporation that was now responsible for intercity passenger services in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presided over major cuts in Via Rail service on 15 January 1990. This ended service by "The Canadian" over CPR rails, and the train was rerouted on the former "Super Continental" route via Canadian National without a change of name. Where both trains had been daily prior to the 15 January 1990, cuts, the surviving "Canadian" was only a three-times-weekly operation. In October, 2012, the "Canadian" was reduced to twice-weekly for the six-month off-season period, and now operates three-times-weekly for only six months a year.

In addition to inter-city passenger services, the CPR also provided [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] services in Montreal. CP Rail introduced Canada's first [[Bilevel car|bi-level passenger cars]] here in 1970. On 1 October 1982, the [[Société de transport de Montréal|Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission]] (STCUM) assumed responsibility for the commuter services previously provided by CP Rail. It continues under the [[Agence métropolitaine de transport|Metropolitan Transportation Agency]] (AMT).

[[File:Westcoast.jpg|left|thumb|The West Coast Express at [[Waterfront Station, Vancouver]].]]
Canadian Pacific Railway currently operates three commuter services under contract. The [[West Coast Express]] comprises ten daily trains between downtown Vancouver and its eastern suburbs on behalf of [[TransLink (Vancouver)|TransLink]], a regional transit authority. [[GO Transit]] contracts CPR to operate six return trips between Milton and downtown Toronto in Ontario. In Montreal, 59 daily commuter trains run on CPR lines from [[Lucien-L'Allier (AMT)|Lucien-L'Allier Station]] to [[Delson-Candiac Line (AMT)|Candiac]], [[Dorion-Rigaud Line (AMT)|Rigaud]] and [[Blainville-Saint-Jerome Line (AMT)|Blainville–Saint-Jerome]] on behalf of the AMT. The [[Rocky Mountaineer]] excursion train is also crewed (Engineer and Conductor) by CP employees where it operates on their right of way. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Sleeping, Dining and Parlour Car Department===
[[Sleeping car]]s were operated by a separate department of the railway that included the dining and parlour cars and aptly named as the Sleeping, Dining and Parlour Car Department. The CPR decided from the very beginning that it would operate its own sleeping cars, unlike railways in the United States that depended upon independent companies that specialized in providing cars and porters, including building the cars themselves. Pullman was long a famous name in this regard; its [[Pullman Company#Porters|Pullman porters]] were legendary. Other early companies included the [[Wagner Palace Car Company]]. Bigger-sized berths and more comfortable surroundings were built by order of the CPR's General Manager, [[William Van Horne]], who was a large man himself. Providing and operating their own cars allowed better control of the service provided as well as keeping all of the revenue received, although profit was never a direct result of providing food to passengers. Rather, it was the realization that those who could afford to travel great distances expected such facilities and their favourable opinion would bode well to attracting others to Canada and the CPR's trains. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Express==
W. C. Van Horne decided from the very beginning that the CPR would retain as much revenue from its various operations as it could. This translated into keeping express, telegraph, sleeping car and other lines of business for themselves, creating separate departments or companies as necessary. This was necessary as the fledgling railway would need all the income it could get, and in addition, he saw some of these ancillary operations such as express and telegraph as being quite profitable. Others such as sleeping and dining cars were kept in order to provide better control over the quality of service being provided to passengers. Hotels were likewise crucial to the CPR’s growth by attracting travellers.

'''Dominion Express Company''' was formed independently in 1873 before the CPR itself, although train service did not begin until the summer of 1882 at which time it operated over some {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track from Rat Portage (Kenora) Ontario west to Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was soon absorbed into the CPR and expanded everywhere the CPR went. It was renamed '''Canadian Express Company''' on 1 September 1926, and the headquarters moved from Winnipeg, to Toronto. It was operated as a separate company with the railway charging them to haul express cars on trains. At major terminals separate buildings usually next to stations were owned by CPE. At smaller locations where volume would not warrant a separate employee the local station agent would act for the Express Company receiving a commission for all sales made on their behalf. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Express was handled in separate cars, some with employees on board, on the headend of passenger trains to provide a fast scheduled service for which higher rates could be charged than for LCL ([[Less-than-carload|Less than Carload Lot]]), small shipments of freight which were subject to delay. Aside from all sorts of small shipments for all kinds of businesses such products as cream, butter, poultry, and eggs were handled along with fresh flowers, fish and other sea foods some handled in separate refrigerated cars. Horses and livestock along with birds and small animals including prize cattle for exhibition were carried often in special horse cars that had facilities for grooms to ride with their animals. Automobiles for individuals were also handled by express in closed boxcars. Gold and silver bullion as well as cash were carried in large amounts between the mint and banks. Small business money shipments and valuables such as jewellery were routinely handled in small packets. Money orders and travellers' cheques were an important part of the express company’s business and were used worldwide in the years before credit cards. 
'''Canadian Express Cartage Department''' was formed in March 1937 to handle pickup and delivery of most express shipments including less-than-carload freight. Their trucks were painted Killarney (dark) green while regular express company vehicles were painted bright red. Express routes using highway trucks beginning in November 1945 in southern Ontario and Alberta co-ordinated rail and highway service expanded service to better serve smaller locations especially on branchlines. Trucking operations would go on to expand across Canada making it an important transportation provider for small shipments. Deregulation in the 1980s changed everything, and it was not long before all trucking services were ended even after many attempts to change with the times. CanPar was one such attempt. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Special trains==

===Silk trains===
Between the 1890s and the 1940s, the CPR transported raw silk cocoons from Vancouver, where they had been shipped from the [[Orient]], to silk mills in New York and [[New Jersey]]. A silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk, so they had their own armed guards. To avoid train robberies and so minimize insurance costs, they traveled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews, which was often done in under five minutes. The silk trains had superior rights over all other trains; even passenger trains (including the Royal Train of 1939) would be put in sidings to make the silk trains' trip faster. At the end of World War II, the invention of nylon made silk less valuable so the silk trains died out. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Funeral trains===
[[Image:Johnamacdonaldfuneraltrain.jpg|thumb|Funeral train of Prime Minister [[Sir John A. Macdonald]].]]

[[Funeral train]]s would carry the remains of important people, such as prime ministers. As the train would pass, mourners would be at certain spots to show respect. Two of the CPR's funeral trains are particularly well-known. On 10 June 1891, the funeral train of Prime Minister [[Sir John A. Macdonald]] ran from Ottawa to [[Kingston, Ontario]]. The train consisted of five heavily draped passenger cars and was pulled by [[Canadian Pacific 283|4-4-0 No. 283]]. On 14 September 1915, the funeral train of former CPR president [[Sir William Cornelius Van Horne]] ran from Montreal to [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]], Illinois, pulled by [[4-6-2]] No. 2213.

===Royal trains===
{{Further|Royal and viceroyal transport in Canada}}
The CPR ran a number of trains that transported members of the Royal family when they toured Canada. These trains transported royalty through Canada's scenery, forests, small towns and enabled people to see and greet them. Their trains were elegantly decorated; some had amenities such as a post office and barber shop. The CPR's most notable royal train was in 1939. In 1939 the CPR and the CNR had the honour of giving [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] a rail tour of Canada, from [[Quebec City]] to [[Vancouver]]. This was the first visit to Canada by a reigning Monarch. The steam locomotives used to pull the train included CPR 2850, a Hudson ([[4-6-4]]) built by [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] in 1938, CNR 6400, a U-4-a Northern ([[4-8-4]]) and CNR 6028 a U-1-b Mountain ([[4-8-2]]) type. They were specially painted royal blue with silver trim as was the entire train, the locomotives ran {{convert|5189|km|mi|abbr=on}} across Canada, through 25 changes of crew, without engine failure. The King, somewhat of a [[railbuff]], rode in the cab when possible. After the tour, King George gave the CPR permission to use the term "[[Royal Hudson]]" for the CPR locomotives and to display Royal Crowns on their running boards. This applied only to the semi-streamlined locomotives (2820–2864), not the "standard" Hudsons (2800–2819). {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Better Farming Train===
CPR provided the rollingstock for the [[Better Farming Train (Saskatchewan)|Better Farming Train]] which toured rural [[Saskatchewan]] between 1914 and 1922 to promote the latest information on agricultural research. It was staffed by the University of Saskatchewan and operating expenses were covered by the Department of Agriculture.<ref name="Review1917 p6">{{cite book|title=Dominion aid to agricultural instruction in Canada: A review of the work performed by the Provinces with the moneys granted under the Agricultural Instruction Act during the four year period, 1913-1917|page=6|publisher=Department of Agriculture|year=1917}}</ref>

===School cars===
Between 1926 and the early 1960s the CPR ran a school car to reach people who lived in Northern Ontario, far from schools. A teacher would travel in a specially designed car to remote areas and would stay to teach in one area for two to three days, then leave for another area. Each car had a blackboard and a few sets of chairs and desks. They also contained miniature libraries.

===''Silver Streak''===
Major filming for the 1976 movie ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', a fictional comedy tale of a murder-infested train trip from Los Angeles to Chicago, was done on the CPR, mainly in the [[Alberta]] area with station footage at  [[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto's Union Station]]. The train set was so lightly disguised as the fictional "AMRoad" that the locomotives and cars still carried their original names and numbers, along with the easily identifiable CP Rail red-striped paint scheme. Most of the cars are still in revenue service on Via Rail Canada; the lead locomotive is extant in Quebec, though she is unserviceable, but the second unit has been scrapped. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Holiday Train===
[[Image:Train Noel Canadien Pacifique Montreal 2009.JPG|right|thumb|Holiday Train in Montreal, November 2009]]

Starting in 1999, the CPR runs a Holiday Train along its main line during the months of November and December. The Holiday Train celebrates the holiday season and collects donations for community [[food bank]]s and hunger issues. The Holiday Train also provides publicity for Canadian Pacific and a few of its customers. Each train has a box car stage for entertainers who are travelling along with the train. Artists such as [[Johnny Reid]], [[Tracey Brown]], [[Melanie Doane]], [[The Odds]], [[Valdy]], [[The Brothers Dube]], [[Sydney Grigg]] and [[Willy Porter]] have been part of the festivity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpr.ca/en/in-your-community/holiday-train/entertainers/Pages/default.aspx |title=Canadian Pacific - Entertainers |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> The train is a freight train, but also pulls vintage passenger cars which are used as lodging/transportation for the entertainers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Holiday+Train/Bios/default.htm|title=Entertainers|publisher=.cpr.ca|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> Only entertainers and CP employees are allowed to board the train. Since its launch in 1999, the Holiday Train program as of December 2012, has raised over $7.4 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] and 3 million pounds of food for North American food banks. All donations collected in a community remain in that community for distribution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpr.ca/en/in-your-community/holiday-train/Pages/default.aspx |title=Canadian Pacific - Holiday Train |deadurl=no |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

In 2011 there were two trains, covering Canada and the United States Northeast and Midwest.<ref>{{cite press release|title=2011 CP Holiday Train: Making a difference, one stop at a time|publisher=CPR|date=November 2011|url=http://www.cpr.ca/en/in-your-community/holiday-train/Documents/2011-Media-Kit.pdf|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> Each Holiday Train is about 1,000 feet in length with brightly decorated rail cars, including a modified box car that has been turned into a traveling stage for performers. They are each decorated with hundred of thousands of LED Christmas lights.

For 2012, both the Canadian and United States versions of the Holiday Train began their tours on Wednesday, November 28, 2012. Their progress, as well as three [[EMD GP38-2]] locomotives maintained in the Delaware & Hudson paint scheme, can be monitored on the www.HeritageUnits.com tracking web site.

===Royal Canadian Pacific===
On 7 June 2000, the CPR inaugurated the [[Royal Canadian Pacific]], a luxury excursion service that operates between the months of June and September. It operates along a {{convert|1050|km|mi|abbr=on}} route from Calgary, through the [[Columbia Valley]] in British Columbia, and returning to Calgary via [[Crowsnest Pass]]. The trip takes six days and five nights. The train consists of up to eight luxury passenger cars built between 1916 and 1931 and is powered by first-generation diesel locomotives. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Steam train===
[[File:Canadian Pacific 2816.jpg|thumb|[[Canadian Pacific 2816]] ''Empress'' at [[Sturtevant, Wisconsin]], 1 September 2007]]
In 1998, the CPR repatriated one of its former passenger steam locomotives that had been on static display in the United States following its sale in January 1964, long after the close of the steam era. CPR Hudson [[Canadian Pacific 2816|2816]] was re-designated ''Empress 2816'' following a 30-month restoration that cost in excess of $1 million. It was subsequently returned to service to promote public relations. It has operated across much of the CPR system, including lines in the United States. It has been used for various charitable purposes, the most significant of which has been to raise awareness of the need to provide children with a nourishing breakfast to aid their learning in school. One hundred percent of the money raised goes to the nation-wide charity [[Breakfast for Learning]] — the CPR bears all of the expenses associated with the operation of the train. [[Canadian Pacific 2816|2816]] is the subject of ''[[Rocky Mountain Express]]'', an IMAX film released in 2011, which follows the locomotive on an eastbound journey beginning in Vancouver, and which tells the story of the building of the CPR. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Spirit Train===
In 2008, Canadian Pacific partnered with the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] to present a "Spirit Train" tour that featured Olympic-themed events at various stops. [[Colin James]] was a headline entertainer.<ref>"Canadian Pacific and Colin James bring Olympic spirit to Canadian communities" [press release], ''Canada NewsWire'', 9 May 2008</ref> Several stops were met by protesters who argued that the games were slated to take place on stolen indigenous land.<ref>Rod Mickleburgh, "Protests are fine, but can the obnoxious profanity", ''Globe and Mail'', 26 September 2003, S3; Denis St. Pierre, "Protest greets Spirit Train", ''Sudbury Star'', 13 October 2008, A9; Mark Klichling, "Protests don't derail Olympic Spirit Train", ''North Bay Nugget'', 14 October 2008, A5; Stephanie Levitz, "Winter Olympic supporters and opponents both claim success from Spirit Train", ''Canadian Press'', 19 October 2008</ref>

==Non-railway services==
Historically, Canadian Pacific operated several non-railway businesses. In 1971, these businesses were split off into the separate company [[Canadian Pacific Limited]], and in 2001, that company was further split into five companies. CP no longer provides any of these services.

===Telegraph===
The original charter of the CPR granted in 1881 provided for the right to create an [[electric telegraph]] and telephone service including charging for it. The telephone had barely been invented but telegraph was well established as a means of communicating quickly across great distances. Being allowed to sell this service meant the railway could offset the costs of constructing and maintaining a pole line along its tracks across vast distances for its own purposes which were largely for dispatching trains. It began doing so in 1882 as the separate Telegraph Department. It would go on to provide a link between the cables under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans when they were completed. Prior to the CPR line messages to the west could be sent only via the United States. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Paid for by the word, the telegram was an expensive way to send messages, but they were vital to businesses. An individual receiving a personal telegram was seen as being someone important except for those that transmitted sorrow in the form of death notices. Messengers on bicycles delivered telegrams and picked up a reply in cities. In smaller locations the local railway station agent would handle this on a commission basis. To speed things, at the local end messages would first be telephoned. In 1931 it became the Communications Department in recognition of the expanding services provided which included telephones lines, [[News agency|news wire]], [[stock ticker machine|ticker quotations]] for the [[stock market]] and eventually [[Teleprinter]]s. All were faster than mail and very important to business and the public alike for many decades before [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] and computers came along. It was the coming of these newer technologies especially cellular telephones that eventually resulted in the demise of these services even after formation in 1967 of [[CNCP Telecommunications|CN-CP Telecommunications]] in an effort to effect efficiencies through consolidation rather than competition. [[Deregulation]] in the 1980s brought about mergers and the sale of remaining services and facilities. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Radio===
On 17 January 1930, the CPR applied for licenses to operate radio stations in 11 cities from coast to coast for the purpose of organizing its own radio network in order to compete with the [[CNR Radio]] service. The CNR had built a radio network with the aim of promoting itself as well as entertaining its passengers during their travels. The onset of the Great Depression hurt the CPR's financial plan for a rival project and in April they withdrew their applications for stations in all but Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg. CPR did not end up pursuing these applications but instead operated a [[phantom station]] in Toronto known as "CPRY," with initials standing for "Canadian Pacific Royal York"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advisor.d6cn.com/Travel/ttttqc/Presenting_A_Behind_The_Scenes_Look_At_The_Historic_Royal_York_Hotel_One_Of_Toronto_s_Crown_Jewels_part_I.html|title=Presenting: A Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Historic Royal York Hotel – One of Toronto's Crown Jewels (part I) |publisher=Advisor.d6cn.com|date= 30 August 2007|first=Susanne|last=Pacher|accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref> which operated out of studios at CP's [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] and leased time on [[CFRB]] and [[CBLA|CKGW]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/networks_CNR8.html|title=The Radio Broadcast that Fulfilled the Promise|accessdate=19 June 2009}}</ref> A network of affiliates carried the CPR radio network's broadcasts in the first half of the 1930s, but the takeover of CNR's Radio service by the new [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] removed CPR's need to have a network for competitive reasons, and CPR's radio service was discontinued in 1935.

===Steamships===
{{main|Canadian Pacific Steamships}}
[[Steamboat|Steamships]] played an important part in the history of CP from the very earliest days. During construction of the line in British Columbia even before the private CPR took over from the government contractor, ships were used to bring supplies to the construction sites. Similarly, to reach the isolated area of Superior in northern Ontario ships were used to bring in supplies to the construction work. While this work was going on there was already regular passenger service to the West. Trains operated from Toronto to Owen Sound where CPR steamships connected to Fort William where trains once again operated to reach Winnipeg. Before the CPR was completed the only way to reach the West was through the United States via St. Paul and Winnipeg. This Great Lakes steam ship service continued as an alternative route for many years and was always operated by the railway. It would become the last operation in North America to feature a special connecting boat train. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1884, CPR began purchasing sailing ships as part of a railway supply service on the [[Great Lakes]]. Over time, CPR became a railroad company with widely organized water transportation auxiliaries including the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Upper Lake Service|Great Lakes service]], the trans-Pacific service, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Coast Service|Pacific coastal service]], the [[Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service|British Columbia lake and river service]], the trans-Atlantic service, and the Ferry service. In the 20th century, the company evolved into a transcontinental railroad which operated two transoceanic services which connected Canada with Europe and with Asia. The range of CPR services were aspects of an integrated plan.<ref name="smith186">Smith, Joseph Russell (1908). {{Google books|Ra4ZAAAAYAAJ|The Ocean Carrier: a History and Analysis of the Service and a Discussion of the Rates of Ocean Transportation|page=186}}</ref>

[[File:SS PrincessMary Victoria 14Feb1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|The 30th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) embarking on the SS ''Princess Mary'' at Victoria, British Columbia en route to the war in Europe—14 February 1915.]]

Once the railway was completed to British Columbia the CPR chartered and soon bought their own steamships. These sleek steamships were of the latest design and christened with the prefix Empress in a link to the Orient. Travel to and from the Orient and cargo, especially imported tea and silk were an important source of revenue aided by Royal Mail contracts. This was an important part of the All Red Route to link the British Empire. The other ocean part was the Atlantic service from England which began with acquisition of two existing lines, Beaver Line, owned by Elder Dempster and Allan Lines. These two segments became Canadian Pacific Ocean Services (later, Canadian Pacific Steamships) and operated separately from the various lake services operated in Canada. These trans-ocean routes made it possible to travel from Britain to Hong Kong using only the CPR's ships, trains and hotels. CP’s 'Empress' ships became world-famous for their luxury and speed. They had a practical role too in transporting immigrants from much of Europe to Canada especially to populate the vast prairies. They also played an important role in both world wars with many of them being lost to enemy action including the ''[[Empress of Britain]]''. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

There were also a number of [[Train ferry|rail ferries]] operated over the years as well including, between Windsor, Ontario and [[Detroit, Michigan]] from 1890 until 1915. This began with two paddle-wheelers capable of carrying 16 cars. Passenger cars were carried as well as freight. This service ended in 1915 when the CPR made an agreement with the Michigan Central to use their Detroit River tunnel opened in 1910. Pennsylvania-Ontario Transportation Company was formed jointly with the PRR in 1906 to operate a ferry across lake Erie between Ashtabula, Ohio and Port Burwell, Ontario to carry freight cars, mostly of coal, much of it to be burned in CPR steam locomotives. Only one ferry boat was ever operated, the ''Ashtabula'', a large vessel which eventually sank in a harbour collision in Ashtabula on 18 September 1958, thus ending the service. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Canadian Pacific Car and Passenger Transfer Company was formed by other interest in 1888 linking the CPR in Prescott, Ontario, and the NYC in Ogdensburg, New York. Service on this route had actually begun very early, in 1854 along with service from Brockville. A bridge built in 1958 ended passenger service however, freight continued until Ogdensburg's dock was destroyed by fire 25 September 1970, thus ending all service. CPC&PTC was never owned by the CPR. [[Bay of Fundy]] ferry service was operated for passengers and freight for many years linking [[Digby, Nova Scotia]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. Eventually, after 78 years, with the changing times the scheduled passenger services would all be ended as well as ocean cruises. Cargo would continue on both oceans with a change over to containers. CP was an intermodal pioneer especially on land with road and rail mixing to provide the best service. [[CP Ships]] was the final operation, and in the end it too left CP ownership when it was spun off in 2001. [[CP Ships]] was merged with [[Hapag-Lloyd]] in 2005. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====BC Coast Steamships====
The [[Canadian Pacific Railway Coast Service]] ([[British Columbia Coast Steamships]] or BCCS) was established when the CPR acquired in 1901 [[Canadian Pacific Navigation Company]] (no relation) and its large fleet of ships that served 72 ports along the coast of British Columbia including on Vancouver Island. Service included the Vancouver-Victoria-Seattle ''Triangle Route'', Gulf Islands, Powell River, as well as Vancouver-Alaska service. BCCS operated a fleet of 14 passenger ships made up of a number of ''Princess'' ships, pocket versions of the famous ocean going ''Empress'' ships along with a freighter, three tugs and five rail car barges. Popular with tourists, the Princess ships were famous in their own right especially the ''Princess Marguerite'' (II) which became the last coastal liner operating from 1949 until 1985. The best known of the princess ships, however, is the ''[[Princess Sophia (steamer)|Princess Sophia]]'', which sank with no survivors in October 1918 after striking the [[Vanderbilt Reef]] in Alaska's [[Lynn Canal]], constituting the largest maritime disaster in the history of the Pacific Northwest.
These services continued for many years until changing conditions in the late 1950s brought about their decline and eventual demise at the end of season in 1974. The ''Princess Marguerite'' was acquired by the province’s British Columbia Steamship (1975) Ltd. and continued to operate for a number of years. In 1977 although the BCCSS was the legal name, it was rebranded as Coastal Marine Operations (CMO). By 1998 the company was bought by the Washington Marine Group which after purchase the company was renamed Seaspan Coastal Intermodal Company. Even though passenger service ended in 1971, CP did have some ferries for freight. These ships currently are in service today. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====BC Lake and River Service====
{{Main|Canadian Pacific Railway in British Columbia}}
The [[Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service]] ([[British Columbia Lake and River Service]]) developed slowly and in spurts of growth. CP began a long history of service in the Kootenays region of southern British Columbia beginning with the purchase in 1897 of the Columbia and Kootenay Steam Navigation Company which operated a fleet of steamers and barges on the [[Arrow Lakes]] and was merged into the CPR as the [[CPR Lake and River Service]] which also served the [[Steamboats of the Arrow Lakes|Arrow Lakes and Columbia River]], [[Steamboats of Kootenay Lake and the Kootenai River|Kootenay Lake and Kootenai River]], [[Steamboats of Lake Okanagan|Lake Okanagan]] and [[Skaha Lake]], [[Slocan Lake]], [[Trout Lake (British Columbia)|Trout Lake]], and [[Shuswap Lake]] and the [[Thompson River]]/[[Kamloops Lake]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

All of these lake operations had one thing in common, the need for shallow draft therefore sternwheelers were the choice of ship. Tugs and barges handled rail equipment including one operation that saw the entire train including the locomotive and caboose go along. These services gradually declined and ended in 1975 except for a freight barge on Slocan Lake. This was the one where the entire train went along since the barge was a link to an isolated section of track. The ''Iris G'' tug boat and a barge were operated under contract to CP Rail until the last train ran late in December 1988. The sternwheel steamship ''[[Moyie (sternwheeler)|Moyie]]'' on Kootenay Lake was the last CPR passenger boat in BC lake service, having operated from 1898 until 1957. It became a beached historical exhibit, as are also the ''[[Sicamous (sternwheeler)|Sicamous]]'' and ''[[SS Naramata (steamboat)|Naramata]]'' at [[Penticton]] on [[Lake Okanagan]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Hotels===
{{Main|Canadian Pacific Hotels}}
To promote tourism and passenger ridership the Canadian Pacific established a series of first class resort hotels. These hotels became landmarks famous in their own right. They include [[The Algonquin]] in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick|St. Andrews]], [[Château Frontenac]] in [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York]] in Toronto, Minaki Lodge in Minaki Ontario, [[Hotel Vancouver]], [[The Empress (Hotel)|Empress Hotel]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and the [[Banff Springs Hotel]] and [[Chateau Lake Louise]] in the Canadian Rockies. Several signature hotels were acquired from its competitor [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] during the 1980s, including the Jasper Park Lodge. The hotels retain their Canadian Pacific heritage but are no longer operated by the railroad. In 1998 [[Canadian Pacific Hotels]] acquired [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotels]], an American company, becoming [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts]] Inc. and the combined corporation operated the historic Canadian properties as well as the Fairmont's U.S. properties until sold in 2006. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Airline===
{{Main|Canadian Pacific Air Lines}}
Canadian Pacific Airlines, also called CP Air, operated from 1942 to 1987 and was the main competitor of Canadian government-owned [[Air Canada]]. Based at [[Vancouver International Airport]], it served Canadian and international routes until it was purchased by [[Pacific Western Airlines]] which merged PWA and CP Air to create [[Canadian Airlines]].

==Locomotives==

===Steam locomotives===
[[Image:Countess-1.gif|thumb|''[[Countess of Dufferin]]'']]

In the CPR's early years, it made extensive use of ''American Standard'' [[4-4-0]] [[steam locomotive]]s and an example of this is the ''[[Countess of Dufferin]]''. Later, considerable use was also made of the [[4-6-0]] type for passenger and [[2-8-0]] type for freight. Starting in the 20th century, the CPR bought and built hundreds of ''Ten-Wheeler'' type [[4-6-0]]s for passenger and freight service and similar quantities of [[2-8-0]]s and [[2-10-2]]s for freight. 2-10-2s were also used in passenger service on mountain routes. The CPR bought hundreds of [[4-6-2]] ''Pacifics'' between 1906 and 1948 with later versions being true dual purpose passenger and fast freight locomotives. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The CPR built hundreds of its own locomotives at its shops in Montreal, first at the ''New Shops'' as the DeLorimer shops were commonly referred to and at the massive Angus Shops that replaced them in 1904. Some of the CPR's best-known locomotives were the [[4-6-4]] ''Hudsons''. First built in 1929 they began a new era of modern locomotives with capabilities that changed how transcontinental passenger trains ran, eliminating frequent changes en route. What once took 24 changes of engines in 1886, all of them 4-4-0s except for two of 2-8-0s in the mountains, for {{convert|2883|mi|km}} between Montreal and Vancouver became 8 changes. The 2800s (Twenty Eight Hundreds) as the Hudson type was known, ran from Toronto to Fort William a distance of {{convert|811|mi|km}}, while another lengthy engine district was from Winnipeg to Calgary {{convert|832|mi|km}}.
Especially notable were the semi-[[streamliner|streamlined]] H1 class ''[[Royal Hudson]]'', locomotives that were given their name because one of their class hauled the Royal Train carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on the 1939 Royal Tour across Canada without change or failure. That locomotive, No. 2850, is preserved in the Exporail exhibit hall of the [[Canadian Railway Museum]] in St. Constant (Delson) Quebec. One of the class, No. 2860, was restored by the [[British Columbia]] government and used in excursion service on the [[British Columbia Railway]] between 1974 and 1999. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1929, the CPR received its first [[2-10-4]] [[Selkirk locomotive]]s, the largest steam locomotives to run in Canada and the British Empire. Named after the Selkirk Mountains where they served, these locomotives were well suited for steep grades. They were regularly used in passenger and freight service. The CPR would own 37 of these locomotives, including number 8000, an experimental high pressure engine. The last steam locomotives that the CPR received, in 1949, were Selkirks, numbered 5930–5935. 
[[Image:Canadian Pacific - Trans Canada passenger train.jpg|thumb|CP passenger train heading east towards [[Calgary]] about 1973]]
<!-- Note: The last Selkirk built, number 5935, is preserved at the [[Canadian Railway Museum]]. (You can not climb inside but you can touch it). One other 2-10-4 Selkirk from this last order (5930–5935) has also been preserved; number 5931. It is displayed, within a chain-link fence, at the main entrance to Heritage Park in Calgary, Alberta. For most of its display life, it was intentionally painted with the incorrect number (5934) and was displayed on the west end of downtown Calgary next to the CPR mainline. It now bears its original and correct number (5931) after being repainted and renumbered for its current display location next to Heritage Park. -->

===Diesel locomotives===
In 1937, the CPR acquired its first [[diesel-electric locomotive]], a custom built one-of-a-kind switcher numbered 7000. This locomotive was not successful and was not repeated. Production model diesels were imported from [[American Locomotive Company]] (Alco) starting with five model [[ALCO S-2 and S-4|S-2]] yard switchers in 1943 and followed by further orders. In 1949, operations on lines in [[Vermont]] were dieselized with [[ALCO FA|Alco FA1]] road locomotives (8 A and 4 B units), 5 [[ALCO RS-2|Alco RS-2]] road switchers, 3 Alco S-2 switchers and 3 [[EMD E8]] passenger locomotives. In 1948 [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] began production of Alco designs. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1949, the CPR acquired 13 [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] designed locomotives from the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] for its isolated [[Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway]], and [[Vancouver Island]] was quickly dieselized. Following that successful experiment, the CPR started to dieselise its main network. Dieselization was completed 11 years later, with its last steam locomotive running on 6 November 1960. The CPR's first-generation locomotives were mostly made by [[General Motors Diesel]] and [[Montreal Locomotive Works]], ([[American Locomotive Company]] designs), with some made by the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] to [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] and [[Fairbanks Morse]] designs.
CP was the first railway in North America to pioneer [[alternating current|AC]] traction diesel-electric locomotives, in 1984. In 1995 CP turned to General Electric [[GE Transportation Systems]] for the first production AC traction locomotives in Canada, and now has the highest percentage of AC locomotives in service of all North American Class I railways. As of early 2007, 578 of the CPR's 1,669 locomotives are AC. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Major facilities==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
CP owns a large number of large yards and repair shops across their system, which are used for many operations ranging from [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminals to [[classification yard]]s. Below are some examples of these.

===Active hump yards===
[[Classification yard|Hump yards]] work by using a small hill over which cars are pushed, before being released down a slope and switched automatically into cuts of cars, ready to be made into outbound trains. Many of these yards were closed in 2012 and 2013 under Hunter Harrison's company-wide restructuring, only the St. Paul Yard hump remains open.{{cn|date=August 2013}}
