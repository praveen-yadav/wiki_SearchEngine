The '''Angolan Armed Forces''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Forças Armadas Angolanas'') are the [[military]] in [[Angola]] that succeeded [[FAPLA|Forças Armadas de Libertação de Angola]] (FAPLA) following the abortive [[Bicesse Accord]] with [[UNITA]] in 1991. As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be [[demilitarized]] and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for UNITA members in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of [[vigilantism]]. 

== Commands ==
The FAA is headed by Chief of Staff [[Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda]] since 2010, who reports to the Minister of Defense, currently [[Cândido Pereira Van-Dúnem]].

The [[defense budget]] in 2005 totaled 1.16 billion [[US Dollar]]s.

There are three components, the Army (''Forças Armadas''), Navy (''Marinha de Guerra'') and Air Force ''[[National Air Force of Angola|Força Aérea Nacional Angolana]]''. Total manpower is about 130,500. (2007). 

== Angolan Air Force ==
{{main|Angolan Air Force}}

Airforce personnel total about 8,000; its equipment includes eight [[Russia]]n-manufactured [[Sukhoi Su-27]] [[fighter aircraft]] and transport planes. In 2002 one was lost during the civil war with [[UNITA]] forces.<ref>[http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html globaldefence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] retrieved August 22, 2011 (de)</ref>

== Angolan Army ==
{{main|Angolan Army}}

The army is by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women.<ref>[http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html Global Defence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] retrieved August 21, 2011 (de)</ref>

The Angolan Army has around 29,000 "ghost workers" who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.<ref>[http://www.radioecclesia.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1686:18-anos-das-for-armadas-angolanas&catid=130:sociedade&Itemid=483, Rádio Ecclesia: 18 anos das Forças Armadas Angolanas] retrieved August 22, 2011 (pt)</ref> 

As of 2013, the Army has three military regions and 16 '[[brigade]]s', comprising [[infantry]], [[tank]]s, [[Armoured personnel carriers|APC]], [[artillery]], and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA units]] as required.<ref name="auto1" /> Major equipment included over 140 [[main battle tank]]s, 600 [[reconnaissance]] vehicles, over 320 [[armored vehicle]]s, [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s, 298 [[howitzers]] carriers. In 1991, the Air Force/Air Defense Forces had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters. 

== Angolan Navy (Marinha de Guerra) ==
{{main|Angolan Navy}}

The Navy numbers about 2,500 and operates seven small patrol craft and barges.

The Angolan Navy (MGA) has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4 200 personnel to around 1 000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola’s 1 600&nbsp;km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. The Navy is requesting procurement of a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats. 

Most of the craft detailed are from the 1980s or earlier, but the navy acquired new boats from Spain and France in the 1990s. Germany will deliver [[Fast Attack Craft]] for border protection from 2011.

== Foreign deployments ==
The FAPLA's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against UNITA in the southeast, and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared [[South African Border War]].<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]</ref> The FAPLA first performed its external assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] in 1977 to bolster the socialist regime of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. During the next several years, Angolan forces conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and exchanged technical operational visits. The Angolan expeditionary force was reduced to about 500 in early 1985.

The Angolan Armed Forces were controversially involved in training the armed forces of fellow [[Lusophone]] states [[Cape Verde]] and Guinea-Bissau. In the case of the latter, the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'état]] was cited by the coup leaders as due to Angola's involvement in trying to "reform" the military in connivance with the civilian leadership.

A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], 2010&ndash;2011, were not officially confirmed. However, the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', citing ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'', said that among President [[Gbagbo]]'s guards were 92 personnel of President Dos Santos's Presidential Guard Unit.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/elfenbeinkueste-gbagbos-letzte-trumpfkarte-als-maertyrer-sterben-1628414.html Gbagbos letzte Trumpfkarte: als Märtyrer sterben], 7 April 2011</ref> Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the [[African Union]] and has formed special units for this purpose.
