These legends seem to be a mythical account of the colonization of Aegina, which seems to have been originally inhabited by [[Pelasgians]], and afterwards received colonists from [[Phthiotis]], the seat of the Myrmidons, and from [[Phlius]] on the [[Asopus]].  Aeacus while he reigned in Aegina was renowned in all Greece for his justice and piety, and was frequently called upon to settle disputes not only among men, but even among the gods themselves.<ref>[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii. 48, &c.</ref><ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 39. § 5</ref>  He was such a favourite with the latter, that, when Greece was visited by a [[drought]] in consequence of a murder which had been committed, the oracle of Delphi declared that the calamity would not cease unless Aeacus prayed to the gods that it might.<ref name="Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6"/><ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], iv. 60, 61</ref>  Aeacus prayed, and it ceased in consequence. Aeacus himself showed his gratitude by erecting a temple to Zeus Panhellenius on mount Panhellenion,<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 30. § 4</ref> and the Aeginetans afterwards built a sanctuary in their island called Aeaceum, which was a square place enclosed by walls of white marble.  Aeacus was believed in later times to be buried under the altar in this sacred enclosure.<ref name="Pausanias, ii. 29. § 6">[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 29. § 6</ref>

A legend preserved in [[Pindar]] relates that [[Apollo]] and [[Poseidon]] took Aeacus as their assistant in building the walls of Troy.<ref>[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &c.</ref>  When the work was completed, three [[dragon]]s rushed against the wall, and while the two of them which attacked those parts of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the part built by Aeacus.  Hereupon Apollo prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall through the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]].

Aeacus was also believed by the Aeginetans to have surrounded their island with high cliffs to protect it against [[piracy|pirates]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 29. § 5</ref>  Several other incidents connected with the story of Aeacus are mentioned by [[Ovid]].<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 506, &c., ix. 435, &c</ref>  By [[Endeïs]] Aeacus had two sons, [[Telamon]] (father of [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] and [[Teucer]]) and [[Peleus]] (father of [[Achilles]]), and by [[Psamathe]] a son, [[Phocus]], whom he preferred to the two others, both of whom contrived to kill Phocus during a contest, and then fled from their native island.

After his death, Aeacus became (along with the [[Minoan Crete|Cretan]] brothers [[Rhadamanthus]] and [[Minos]]) one of the three judges in [[Hades]],<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiii. 25</ref><ref>[[Horace]], ''Carmen'' ii. 13. 22</ref> and according to [[Plato]] especially for the shades of Europeans.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' p. 523</ref><ref>[[Isocrates]], ''Evag.'' 5</ref>  In works of art he was represented bearing a sceptre and the keys of Hades.<ref name="Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6"/><ref>[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii. 47, &c.</ref>  Aeacus had sanctuaries both at [[Athens]] and in [[Aegina]],<ref name="Pausanias, ii. 29. § 6"/><ref>[[Hesychius]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=February 2012}} ''s.v.''</ref><ref>Schol. ''ad Pind. Nem.'' xiii. 155</ref> and the Aeginetans regarded him as the tutelary deity of their island.<ref>[[Pindar]], ''Nemean Odes'' viii. 22</ref>

In ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BC) by [[Aristophanes]], [[Dionysus]] descends to [[Hades]] and announces himself as [[Heracles]]. Aeacus laments [[Heracles]]'s theft of [[Cerberus]] and sentences [[Dionysus]] to [[Acheron]] and torment by hounds of [[Cocytus]], [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], the Tartesian eel, and Tithrasian Gorgons.

[[Alexander the Great]] traced his ancestry (through his mother) to Aeacus.
