In [[architecture]], a '''cupola''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|p|əl|ə}} is a small, most often [[dome]]-like, structure on top of a building.<ref name="ARCHSEE">{{Cite web |url=http://www.archiseek.com/guides/glossary/c.html |title=Glossary of Architectural Terms - C|accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Archiseek: Online Architecture Resources}}</ref> Often used to provide a lookout or to admit light and air, it usually crowns a larger [[roof]] or dome.<ref name="DICTIONARY">{{Cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cupola |title=cupola|accessdate=17 March 2010|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition |publisher=[[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]] |year=2010}}</ref><ref name="WHATCUP">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cupola.com/whatscu1.htm |title=Just what is a cupola anyway? |accessdate=3 January 2009 |publisher=Cupola Consulting}}</ref>  

The word derives, via [[Italian language|Italian]], from the lower Latin ''cupula'' (classical Latin ''cupella'' from the Greek κύπελλον ''kupellon'') "small cup" (Latin ''cupa'') indicating a vault resembling an upside down cup.<ref>In Italian ''cupola'' simply means [[dome]], and the ornamental top element is called ''lanterna''.</ref>

Cupolas often appear as small buildings in their own right. They often serve as a [[Roof lantern|lantern]], [[Bell tower|belfry]], or [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] above a main roof.  In other cases they may crown a [[tower]], [[spire]], or [[turret]].<ref name="WHATCUP"/>  The [[chhatri]], seen in [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]], fits the definition of a cupola when it is used atop a larger structure.

The cupola is a development during the Renaissance of the [[oculus]], an ancient device found in Roman architecture, but being weatherproof was superior for the wetter climates of northern Europe.

The square dome-like segment of a North American railroad train [[caboose]] is also called a cupola. The cupola is used on barns as a vent for heat and moisture.
