A '''covalent bond''' is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. The stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms when they share electrons is known as covalent bonding.<ref>{{cite book| coauthors = Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last = Campbell| first = Neil A.| title = Biology: Exploring Life| url = http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate = 2012-02-05| year = 2006| publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall| location = Boston, Massachusetts| isbn = 0-13-250882-6 }}</ref> For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. 

Covalent bonding includes many kinds of interactions, including [[sigma bond|σ-bonding]], [[pi bond|π-bonding]], <!-- do not change the following-->metal-to-metal bonding,<!-- "nonmetal/nonmetal" is already covered as sigma/pi --> [[agostic interaction]]s, and [[three-center two-electron bond]]s.<ref>{{cite book| last = March| first = Jerry| title = Advanced organic chemistry: reactions, mechanisms, and structure| year = 1992| publisher = John Wiley & Sons| isbn = 0-471-60180-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Gary L.

In the molecule {{chem|H|2}}, the hydrogen atoms share the two electrons via covalent bonding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/chemical/bond.html |title=Chemical Bonds |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}</ref> Covalency is greatest between atoms of similar [[electronegativity|electronegativities]]. Thus, covalent bonding does not necessarily require that the two atoms be of the same elements, only that they be of comparable electronegativity. Covalent bonding that entails sharing of electrons over more than two atoms is said to be [[delocalized electron|delocalized]].

==History==
[[File:covalent.svg|thumb|200px|Early concepts in covalent bonding arose from this kind of image of the molecule of [[methane]]. Covalent bonding is implied in the [[Lewis structure]] by indicating electrons shared between atoms.]]

The term "covalence" in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by [[Irving Langmuir]] in a ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' article entitled "The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules". Langmuir wrote that "we shall denote by the term '''covalence''' the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors."<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02227a002|volume=41|issue=6|pages=868–934|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1919-06-01}}</ref>

The idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|volume=38|issue=4|pages=762–785|last=Lewis|first=Gilbert N.|title=The atom and the molecule|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1916-04-01}}</ref> He introduced the ''[[Lewis Structure|Lewis notation]]'' or ''electron dot notation'' or ''Lewis dot structure'', in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as [[double bond]]s and [[triple bond]]s. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.

Lewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the methane diagram shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the [[octet rule]]), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) - its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the n=2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the n=1 shell, which can hold only two.

While the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, [[quantum mechanics]] is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond, to be specific that of [[molecular hydrogen]], in 1927.<ref>W. Heitler and F. London, Zeitschrift für Physik, vol. 44, p. 455 (1927). English translation in {{cite book| last = Hettema| first = H.| title = Quantum chemistry: classic scientific papers| url = http://books.google.com/?id=qsidHRJmUoIC| accessdate = 2012-02-05| year = 2000| publisher = World Scientific| isbn = 978-981-02-2771-5| pages = 140– }}</ref> Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the [[atomic orbitals]] of participating atoms. These atomic orbitals are known to have specific angular relationships between each other, and thus the valence bond model can successfully predict the bond angles observed in simple molecules.

==Polarity of covalent bonds==
Covalent bonds are affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H−H. An unequal relationship creates a [[polar covalent bond]] such as with H−Cl.

==Subdivision of covalent bonds==
There are three types of covalent substances: individual molecules, molecular structures, and macromolecular structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, HCl, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as [[ethanol]]), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as [[iodine]] and solid CO<sub>2</sub>). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked in chains or sheets (such as [[graphite]]), or in 3-dimensional structures (such as [[diamond]] and [[quartz]]). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical [[resistivity]]. Elements that have high [[electronegativity]], and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.<ref name="StranksEtAl1970">
