'''Colorado Springs''' is a [[Colorado municipalities#Home Rule Municipality|Home Rule Municipality]] that is the [[county seat]] and most populous city of [[El Paso County, Colorado]], United States. Colorado Springs is located in the east central portion of the state. It is situated on [[Fountain Creek]] and is located {{convert|65|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south of the [[Colorado State Capitol]] in [[Denver]]. At {{convert|6035|ft}} the city stands over one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) above sea level, though some areas of the city are significantly higher and lower. Colorado Springs is situated near the base of one of the most famous American mountains, [[Pikes Peak]], rising over 8,000 feet above the city on the eastern edge of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]].  The [[United States Air Force Academy]] is located in Colorado Springs. The city is often referred to as "The Springs."

The city had an estimated population of 431,834 in 2012.,<ref name="http://quickfacts.census.gov/">[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/08/0816000.html Colorado Springs (city), Colorado] United States Census Bureau.

==Geography==
[[Image:Colorado Springs from Pikes Peak Nov 2010.JPG|thumb|left|View of Colorado Springs from Pikes Peak.]]
[[Image:PikesPeakFromUCCS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pikes Peak]], the easternmost 14er in the United States]]
The city is made up of the mountains to the west, the [[Palmer Divide]] to the north, high plains further east, and desert land to the south when leaving [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]] and approaching [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]].<ref name=SpringsGovInfo />

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|482.1|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|481.1|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.0|km2|abbr=on|disp=flip}} (0.21%) is water.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Climate==
Colorado Springs has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''), and its location just east of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] affords it the rapid warming influence from [[chinook wind]]s during winter but also subjects it to drastic day-to-day variability in weather conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.colostate.edu/climateofcolorado.php |title=Colorado Climate Center - Climate of Colorado |publisher=Climate.colostate.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref>  The city has abundant sunshine throughout the year, averaging over 300 days of sun per year, and receives approximately {{convert|16.5|in|mm|0}} of annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Due to unusually low precipitation for several years after flooding in 1999, Colorado Springs enacted lawn water restrictions in 2002. These were lifted in 2005.<ref name=SpringsGovInfo>{{cite web| date = November 3, 2010 | url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.aspx?NavID=1188 | title=City of Colorado Springs – Drought}}</ref>

Colorado Springs is also one of the most active lightning strike areas in the United States. This natural phenomenon led [[Nikola Tesla]] to select Colorado Springs as the preferred location to build his lab and study electricity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Seasonal climate===
Winters range from mild to moderately cold, with December, the coldest month, averaging {{convert|29.8|°F|1}}; historically January has been the coldest month, but, in recent years, December has had both lower daily maxima and minima.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/colorado/colorado-springs/ |title=Colorado Springs |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Climate-zone.com |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}</ref> Typically, there are 5.2 nights with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows and 23.6 days where the high does not rise above freezing,<ref name="NOAA" /> and extended sub-zero (°F) cold is rare. Snowfall is usually moderate and remains on the ground briefly, with the city receiving {{convert|38|in|cm|0}} per season, although the mountains to the west often receive in excess of triple that amount; March is the snowiest month in the region, both by total accumulation and number of days with measurable snowfall. In addition, 8 of the top 10 heaviest 24-hour snowfalls have occurred from March to May.<ref name = NOAA/> Summers are very warm, with July, the warmest month, averaging {{convert|70.9|°F|1}}, and 18 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually. Due to the high elevation and aridity, nights are usually relatively cool and rarely does the low remain above {{convert|70|°F|0}}.<ref name = NOAA/><!--As of Summer 2012, #10 extreme high daily minimum is 69 °F--> Dry weather generally prevails, but brief afternoon thunderstorms are common, especially in July and August when the city receives the majority of its annual rainfall, due to the [[North American Monsoon]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The first freeze in the autumn and the last freeze in the spring on average occur on October 2 and May 6, respectively; the average window for measurable snowfall (≥{{convert|0.1|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is October 21 thru April 25. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|101|°F|0}} on [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|June 26, 2012]] down to {{convert|−27|°F|0}} on February 1, 1951 and December 9, 1919.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Government==
On November 2, 2010 Colorado Springs voters adopted a council-[[strong mayor]] form of government. The City of Colorado Springs transitioned to the new system of government in 2011. Under the council-strong mayor system of government, the mayor is the chief executive and the city council is the legislative branch. The mayor is a full-time elected position and not a member of the city council. The city council has nine members total, four of which represent one of four equally populated districts each. Districts 5 and 6 do not have a direct representative. The remaining five members are elected "at-large".<ref>{{cite web|title=Mayor-Council Form of Government|url=http://www.springsgov.com/Page.aspx?NavID=4353|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref>  The mayor has veto authority, with the city council having the ability to override a mayoral veto by a two-thirds majority vote (6 out of 9).

Colorado Springs City Hall was built from 1902 to 1904 on land donated by [[W. S. Stratton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM7V3Y_1904_Colorado_Springs_City_Hall_Colorado_Springs_CO |title=1904 - Colorado Springs City Hall - Colorado Springs, CO - Dated Buildings and Cornerstones on |publisher=Waymarking.com |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}</ref>{{clear left}}

The current unemployment rate, as of June 2012, in Colorado Springs is 9.8%<ref>http://www.colmigateway.com/analyzer/searchAnalyzer.asp?cat=HST_EMP_WAGE_LAB_FORCE&session=LABFORCE&subsession=99&time=&geo=&currsubsessavail=&incsource=&blnStart=True</ref> compared to 8.2% for the State<ref>{{cite web|author=www.geosolinc.com |url=http://www.colmigateway.com/default.asp |title=LMI Gateway – Home Page |publisher=Colmigateway.com |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> and the Nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ |title=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

===Defense industry===
The defense industry plays a major role in the Colorado Springs economy, with some of the city's largest employers coming from the sector.<ref>[http://www.gazette.com/display.php?id=1321945&secid=4 ''Colorado Springs Gazette''<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date = October 2009}}</ref> A large segment of this industry is dedicated to the development and operation of various projects for missile defense.

===High-tech industry===
A large percentage of Colorado Springs' economy is still based on manufacturing [[high tech]] and complex electronic equipment.

==Metropolitan area==
Colorado Springs has many features of a modern urban area, such as parks, bike trails, and urban open-area spaces. However, it is not exempt from problems that typically plague cities that experience tremendous growth, such as overcrowded roads and highways, crime, sprawl, and government budget issues. Many of the problems are indirectly or directly caused by the city's difficulty in coping with the large population growth experienced in the last twenty years, and the annexation of the [[Banning Lewis Ranch]] area to accommodate further population growth of 175,000 future residents.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Transportation==
[[Image:Colorado Springs Transportation by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A Metro bus drives past a parking garage in downtown Colorado Springs.]]
Colorado Springs is served by a bus system called Mountain Metro (short for [[Mountain Metropolitan Transit]]).  Although the transit system serves much of the city and its nearest suburbs (Manitou Springs and Security/Widefield), it lacks service to many important areas (Powers Blvd, Northgate, the Airport) and has only limited hours of operation.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Colorado Springs is served by the [[Colorado Springs Municipal Airport]]. In the state of Colorado, only [[Denver International Airport|Denver International]] has more passenger traffic. The airport has experienced a higher recovery rate in the post-9/11 era than the rest of the country<ref name = "oolfhw">{{cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/AirportPage.asp?PageID=4704 |title=Colorado Springs Airport – News Releases |publisher=Springsgov.com |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref> and is in the process of expanding its maintenance facilities, taxiways, and runways to accommodate future growth. In 2005 it served approximately two million passengers.<ref name = "oolfhw"/>

Colorado Springs is part of a consortium of cities trying to build the [[Front Range Commuter Rail]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Major highways and roads===

====Interstate highways====
Colorado Springs is primarily served by two interstate highways. [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] runs north and south through Colorado, and is in the city for nearly 18 miles, entering the city south of Circle Drive and exiting north of InterQuest Parkway. In El Paso County it is known as Ronald Reagan Highway.{{#tag:ref|In order to combat congestion the Colorado Department of Transportation widened the [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] corridor throughout the city from four lanes (two in each direction) to six lanes in a program called COSMIX. Ultimately, the plan is to make the interstate eight lanes through the city when funding becomes available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmixproject.com/ |title=Litter Removal Program |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Colorado Department of Transportation’s (CDOT) |accessdate=September 15, 2010}}</ref> This plan is similar in nature to Denver's T-Rex expansion plan.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Work has started on expanding Interstate 25 from 4 to 6 lanes between Woodmen Road (exit 149, the northern terminus for the COSMIX project) and Monument (exit 161).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/I25NorthCOSDB |title=I-25 North Design Build (Colorado Springs) — CDOT |publisher=Coloradodot.info |date= |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Zubeck |first=Pam |url=http://www.csindy.com/IndyBlog/archives/2012/12/29/i-25-widening-project-coming-soon |title=I-25 widening project coming soon &#124; IndyBlog |publisher=Csindy.com |date=December 29, 2012 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>|group="nb"}} [[U.S. Route 24 in Colorado|US 24]] runs across the central mountains, through the city, and onto the plains. From west to east in Colorado Springs, US 24 follows the western portion of Cimarron Street and the Midland Expressway, a 2-mile concurrent section with I-25/US 87 between exits 139 and 141, part of Fountain Blvd, an expressway called the Martin Luther King Bypass, part of South Powers Blvd (where it is concurrent with Colorado 21), and the easternmost portion of Platte Avenue out of the city.

====State highways====
A number of state highways serve the city.  [[Colorado State Highway 21|State Highway 21]] is a major east side semi-expressway from [[Black Forest, Colorado|Black Forest]] to [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]]. It is widely known as Powers Boulevard. [[Colorado State Highway 83|State Highway 83]] runs north-south from [[Denver]] to northern Colorado Springs. [[Colorado State Highway 94|State Highway 94]] runs east-west from western [[Cheyenne County, Colorado|Cheyenne County]] to eastern Colorado Springs. [[Colorado State Highway 115|State Highway 115]] begins in [[Cañon City, Colorado|Cañon City]] and runs up Nevada Avenue. US 85 and SH 115 are concurrent between Lake Avenue and I-25. [[U.S. Route 85 in Colorado|US 85]] enters the city at [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]] and was signed at Venetucci Blvd, Lake Avenue, and Nevada Avenue.{{#tag:ref|In addition, there were plans to develop a "Front Range Toll Road", a privately owned [[Toll road|turnpike]], which would begin south of Pueblo and end around Fort Collins. This toll road would allow rail and truck traffic to avoid the more highly traveled parts of I-25 along the Front Range. Initially, the project had support but has since been highly contested because of the need to condemn the land of many private citizens, through the use of [[eminent domain]], to make room for the corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nosuperslab.org/crap/how_to.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

====County and city roads====
In 2004, the voters of Colorado Springs and El Paso County established the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pprta.com |title=PPRTA Homepage |publisher=Pprta.com |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref> and adopted a 1% sales tax dedicated to improving the region's transportation infrastructure. Together with state funding for the Colorado Springs Metro Interstate Expansion (COSMIX) (2007 completion) and the I-25 interchange with Highway 16 (2008 completion), significant progress has been made since 2003 in addressing the transportation needs of the area. Currently the City is trying to overcome a $23.3&nbsp;million budget gap created by falling sales taxes and rising expenses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zubeck |first=Pam |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/million_39774___article.html/council_city.htmlCouncil: |title=Cut, don't raise taxes or fees August&nbsp;25, 2008 |publisher=Gazette.com |date=August 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref>

Several suggestions have been made to create a loop around the city though none have been implemented.<ref name="Powers freeway" />{{#tag:ref|The original plan to convert Powers Boulevard (now Colorado 21) into a bypass for I-25 was abandoned, although some of its interchanges are overpasses and roads further east are being looked at.<ref name="Powers freeway">{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20061224/ai_n17109195 |title=Powers freeway debate restarts &#124; Gazette, The (Colorado Springs) |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=October 5, 2009 | first=Ed | last=Sealover}}</ref> Easier access to the airport has recently been completed- in late 2011, the conversion of 2 lane Drennan Road to 4 lane expressway Milton Proby Parkway from the airport to S Academy Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springsgov.com/page.aspx?navid=415 |title=City of Colorado Springs – Proby Parkway, Phase 1 |publisher=Springsgov.com |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buildproby.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Build Proby |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> Overall the new thoroughfares would include one (or two) loop freeways, a spur into the city connecting the main freeway and the loop, east-west expressway upgrades, and easier access to the [[Colorado Springs Airport]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}|group="nb"}} To manage congestion, the city implemented two graded separated intersections at Powers and Woodmen and at Austin Bluffs and Union. A third interchange was completed in 2011 at the Woodmen Road/Academy Boulevard intersection.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Sister cities]] of Colorado Springs include:
* [[Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi|Fujiyoshida, Japan]] (1962)
* [[Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung, Taiwan]] (1983)
* [[Smolensk|Smolensk, Russia]] (1993)

Colorado Springs' sister city organization began when Colorado Springs became partners with Fujiyoshida. The ''torii'' gate erected to commemorate the relationship stands at the corner of Bijou Street and Nevada Avenue, and is one of the city's most recognizable landmarks. The [[Shinto|''torii'' gate]], crisscrossed bridge and shrine, located in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets in downtown Colorado Springs, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities. A plaque near the ''torii'' gate states that "the purpose of the sister city relationship is to promote understanding between the people of our two countries and cities". The Fujiyoshida Student exchange program has become an annual event.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

To strengthen relations between the two cities, the Colorado Springs Youth Symphony regularly invites the Taiko drummers from the city to participate in a joint concert in the Pikes Peak Center. The orchestra played in Bankstown, Australia, in 2002 and again in June 2006 as part of their tours to Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Also, in 2006 and 2010, the Bankstown TAP (Talent Advancement Program), performed with the Youth Symphony, and the Colorado Springs Children's Chorale, as a part of the annual "In Harmony" program.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

A notable similarity between Colorado Springs and its sister cities are their geographic positions:  three of the seven cities are also located near the base of a major mountain or mountain range.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.springsgov.com/Page.asp?NavID=1923 |title = City of Colorado Springs – Topic Pages |publisher = Springsgov.com |date = July 6, 2007 |accessdate = October 5, 2009}}</ref>

Colorado Springs has been the subject or setting for many books, movies and television shows, and is especially a frequent backdrop for political thrillers and military-themed stories because of its many military installations and vital importance to the United States' continental defense. Notable television series using the city as a setting include ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' and the ''[[Stargate]]'' series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', as well as the films ''[[WarGames]]'' and ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In a North Korean propaganda video released in April 2013, Colorado Springs was inexplicably singled out as one of four targets for a missile strike.  The video failed to pinpoint Colorado Springs on the map, instead showing a spot somewhere in Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/04/12/video-north-korea-threatens-to-strike-colorado-springs-but-doesnt-know-where-it-is/ |title = Video: North Korea threatens to strike Colorado Springs but doesn’t know where it is |publisher = Washingtonpost.com |date = 2013-04-12 |accessdate = 2013-05-08}}</ref>
