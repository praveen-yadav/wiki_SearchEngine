The '''Church of the Holy Sepulchre''', also called the '''[[Basilica]] of the Holy Sepulchre''', or the '''Church of the Resurrection''' by [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]]s, is a [[Church (building)|church]] within the [[Christian Quarter]] of the walled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. It is a few steps away from the [[Muristan]].

The site is venerated as [[Calvary|Golgotha]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-church-of-holy-sepulchre.htm |title=Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem |location=Jerusalem, , Israel |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (the Hill of Calvary), where [[Jesus]] was [[crucifixion|crucified]],<ref>{{CathEncy| wstitle=Holy Sepulchre| title =Holy Sepulchre| first =Arthur .L.| last = McMahon| authorlink = | accessdate =2009-02-02}}</ref> and is said also to contain the place where Jesus was buried (the [[Sepulchre]]). The church has been a paramount – and for many [[Christians]] the most important – [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] destination since at least the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], as the purported site of the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. Today it also serves as the headquarters of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], while control of the building is [[Simultaneum|shared between several Christian churches]] and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for centuries. Today, the church is home to branches of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] as well as to [[Roman Catholicism]]. [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian]]s have no permanent presence in the Church<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-191046_ITM The search for a Protestant Holy Sepulchre: the Garden Tomb in nineteenth-century Jerusalem], The Journal of Ecclesiastical History, April 01, 1995, Kochav, Sarah</ref> – and some have regarded the alternative [[Garden Tomb]], elsewhere in Jerusalem, as the true place of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection.

==History==

===Construction===
In the early 2nd century AD, the site of the present Church had been a temple of [[Aphrodite]]; several ancient writers alternatively describe it as a temple to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the [[Interpretatio graeca#Roman version|Roman equivalent]] to Aphrodite. [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] claims, in his ''Life of Constantine'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7646_3165242 |title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> that the site of the Church had originally been a Christian place of veneration, but that [[Hadrian]] had deliberately covered these Christian sites with earth, and built his own temple on top, due to his hatred for Christianity.<ref>Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'', 3:26</ref> Although Eusebius does not say as much, the temple of Aphrodite was probably built as part of [[Hadrian]]'s reconstruction of Jerusalem as [[Aelia Capitolina]] in 135 AD, following the destruction of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] of 70 AD and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–135 AD.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

[[File:Golgotha cross-section.svg|thumb|200px|right|A diagram of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre showing traditional site of [[Calvary]] and the [[Tomb of Jesus]]]]

Emperor [[Constantine I]] ordered in about 325/326 that the temple be demolished and the soil - which had provided a flat surface for the temple - be removed, instructing [[Macarius of Jerusalem]], the local Bishop, to build a church on the site. The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Pilgrim of Bordeaux]] reports in 333: "There, at present, by the command of the Emperor Constantine, has been built a basilica, that is to say, a church of wondrous beauty".<ref>''Itinerarium Burdigalense'', page 594</ref> Constantine directed his mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], to build churches upon sites which commemorated the life of Jesus Christ; she was present in 326 at the construction of the church on the site, and involved herself in the excavations and construction.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

During the excavation, Helena is alleged to have rediscovered the [[True Cross]], and a tomb, though Eusebius's account makes no mention of Helena's presence at the excavation, nor of the finding of the cross but only the tomb. According to Eusebius, the tomb exhibited "a clear and visible proof" that it was the [[tomb of Jesus]].<ref>Eusebius, ''Life of Constantine'', Chapter 28</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7655_3169703 |title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> [[Socrates Scholasticus]] (born c. 380), in his ''Ecclesiastical History,'' gives a full description of the discovery<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-02/Npnf2-02-06.htm#P394_149362 |title=NPNF2-02. Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library  |date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (that was repeated later by [[Sozomen]] and by [[Theodoret]]) which emphasizes the role played in the excavations and construction by Helena; just as the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] (also founded by Constantine and Helena) commemorated the birth of Jesus, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre would commemorate his death and resurrection.{{cn|date = October 2013}}
[[File:Altar Golgotha.jpg|thumb|150px|Golgotha altar]]
Constantine's church was built as two connected churches over the two different holy sites, including a great [[basilica]] (the ''Martyrium'' visited by [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] in the 380s), an enclosed [[colonnade]]d [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] (the ''Triportico'') with the traditional site of ''Golgotha'' in one corner, and a [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], called the ''Anastasis'' ("Resurrection"), which contained the remains of a [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut room]] that Helena and Macarius identified as the burial site of Jesus. The rockface at the west end of the building was cut away, although it is unclear how much remained in Constantine's time, as archaeological investigation has revealed that the temple of Aphrodite reached far into the current rotunda area,<ref name="Corbo">[[Virgilio Canio Corbo|Virgilio Corbo]], ''The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem'' (1981)</ref> and the temple enclosure would therefore have reached even further to the west.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

According to tradition, Constantine arranged for the rockface to be removed from around the tomb, without harming it, in order to isolate the tomb; in the centre of the rotunda is a small building called the ''Kouvouklion'' (Kουβούκλιον; Modern Greek for small compartment) or ''[[Aedicule]]''<ref>Americans spell this as ''Edicule''</ref> (from Latin: ''aediculum'', small building), which supposedly encloses this tomb, although it is not currently possible to verify the claim, as the remains are completely enveloped by a marble sheath. However, there are several thick window wells extending through the marble sheath, from the interior to the exterior that are not marble clad.  They appear to reveal an underlying limestone rock, which may be part of the original living rock of the tomb.  The discovery of the [[kokhim]] tombs just beyond the west end of the Church, and more recent archaeological investigation of the rotunda floor, suggest that a narrow [[Spur (topography)|spur]] of at least ten yards length would have had to jut out from the rock face if the contents of the Aedicule were once inside it. The [[dome]] of the rotunda was completed by the end of the 4th century.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Each year, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates the anniversary of the [[consecration]] of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) on September 13<ref>{{cite web|title=Commemoration of the Founding of the Church of the Resurrection (Holy Sepulchre) at Jerusalem|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=102593|publisher=[[Orthodox Church in America]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]], September 13 currently falls on September 26 of the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).{{cn|date = October 2013}}

===Damage and destruction===
This building was damaged by fire in 614 when the [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]], under [[Khosrau II]], invaded Jerusalem and captured the Cross. In 630, Emperor [[Heraclius]] marched triumphantly into Jerusalem and restored the [[True Cross]] to the rebuilt Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Under the [[Jerusalem in the middle ages|Muslims]] it remained a Christian church. The early Muslim rulers protected the city's Christian sites, prohibiting their destruction and their use as living quarters. In 966 the doors and roof were burnt during a riot.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

On October 18, 1009, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] ordered the complete destruction of the church. The measures against the church were part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt, which involved a great deal of damage: [[Adémar de Chabannes]] recorded that the church of St George at [[Lod|Lydda]] 'with many other churches of the saints' had been attacked, and the 'basilica of the Lord's Sepulchre destroyed down to the ground'. ...The Christian writer Yahya ibn Sa'id reported that everything was razed 'except those parts which were impossible to destroy or would have been too difficult to carry away'."<ref name="Morris 2005">{{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}</ref> The Church's foundations were hacked down to bedrock. The Edicule and the east and west walls and the roof of the cut-rock tomb it encased were destroyed or damaged (contemporary accounts vary), but the north and south walls were likely protected by rubble from further damage. The "mighty pillars resisted destruction up to the height of the gallery pavement, and are now effectively the only remnant of the fourth-century buildings."<ref name="Morris 2005"/>  Some minor repairs were done to the section believed to be the tomb of Jesus almost immediately after 1009, but a true attempt at restoration would have to wait for decades.<ref name="Morris 2005"/>

European reaction was of shock and dismay, with far-reaching and intense consequences.  For example, [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] [[monk]] [[Rodulfus Glaber]] blamed the [[Jews]], with the result that Jews were expelled from [[Limoges]] and other [[France|French]] towns. Ultimately, this destruction provided an impetus to the later [[Crusades]].<ref>
{{Harvnb|Bokenkotter |2004}}</ref>

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Holy Sepulchre IMG 0451.jpg|thumb|View of Holy Sepulchre courtyard]]
In wide ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1027-8 an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] (Al-Hakim's son) agreed to allowing the rebuilding and redecoration of the Church.<ref name="Lev 1991">{{Harvnb|Lev|1991}}</ref> The rebuilding was finally completed with the financing of the huge expense by Emperor [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] and Patriarch Nicephorus of Constantinople in 1048.<ref>{{Harvnb|Foakes-Jackson|1921}}</ref> As a concession, the mosque in [[Constantinople]] was re-opened and sermons were to be pronounced in az-Zahir's name.<ref name="Lev 1991"/> Muslim sources say a by-product of the agreement was the recanting of Islam by many Christians who had been forced to convert under Al-Hakim's persecutions.<ref name="Lev 1991"/> In addition the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by Al-Hakim and the re-establishment of a [[Patriarch]] in Jerusalem.<ref name="Lev 1991"/> Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made.<ref name="Lev 1991"/> Despite the Byzantines spending vast sums on the project, "a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins."<ref name="Morris 2005"/>  The rebuilt church site consisted of "a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it."<ref>{{Harvnb|Fergusson|1865}}</ref> The chapels were "to the east of the court of resurrection, where the wall of the great church had been. They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and of his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties for free movement among shrines in the streets of the city. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as 'a sort of [[Via Dolorosa]] in miniature'...&nbsp;since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica. Western pilgrims to Jerusalem during the eleventh century found much of the sacred site in ruins."<ref name="Morris 2005"/>  Control of Jerusalem, and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, continued to change hands several times between the Fatimids and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] (loyal to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] in [[Baghdad]]) until the arrival of the Crusaders in 1099.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gold|2007}}</ref>

===Crusader period===
[[File:GA Ordre du Saint-Sépulcre.svg|left|thumb|100px|Arms of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]]]

Many historians maintain that the main concern of [[Pope Urban II]], when calling for the [[First Crusade]], was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of Asia Minor in response to the appeal of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famoushistoricalevents.net/council-clermont/ |title=Council of Claremont |publisher=Famoushistoricalevents.net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on 15 July 1099.<ref name="Morris 2005"/>

[[File:Prise de Jérusalem par les Croisés, le 15 juillet 1099 Emil Signol, Musée du Château Versailles.JPG|thumb|right|The capture of [[Jerusalem]] by the [[Crusaders]] on 15 July 1099<br/>1. The Holy Sepulchre<br/> 2. The [[Dome of the Rock]]<br/> 3. Ramparts]]

The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed pilgrimage, and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use [[List of kings of Jerusalem|the title "king"]] during his lifetime, and declared himself ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (''Protector (or Defender) of the Holy Sepulchre''). By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been the location that Helena had found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; although the cistern later became the ''Chapel of the Invention of the Cross'', there is no evidence for the rumour prior to the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to the 11th century repairs by Monomachos.<ref name="Corbo"/>

[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|Crusader [[graffiti]] in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]

According to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the "ancient [[Georgians]]" and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.<ref>Venetian Adventurer: The Life and Times of Marco Polo, p88</ref>

The chronicler [[William of Tyre]] reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they decided to transform this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style and added a bell tower. These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchs]], and was also the site of the kingdom's [[scriptorium]]. The church was lost to [[Saladin]], along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the [[Third Crusade]] allowed for Christian pilgrims to visit the site. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century, while he himself was under a ban of excommunication, leading to the curious result of the holiest church in Christianity being laid under [[interdict]]. Both city and church were captured by the [[Khwarezm]]ians in 1244.

===Later periods===
[[File:ChurchOfTheHolySepulcher1885.png|thumb|Church of the Holy Sepulchre (1885). Other than some restoration work, its appearance has essentially not changed since 1854. The [[Immovable Ladder]], the small ladder below the top-right window, is also visible in recent photographs; this has remained in the same position since 1854 over a disagreement to move it.]]
The [[Franciscan]] friars renovated it further in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the Aedicule, extending the structure to create an ante-chamber.<ref name="Murphy56">[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], ''The Holy Land'', (2008), page 56</ref> After the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' from the ''[[Sublime Porte]]'' at a particular time, often through outright bribery, and violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was talked about it at the negotiations to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.<ref>Geschichte der europäischen Staaten, Geschichte des östreichischen Kaiserstaates, János Nepomuk Jozsef Mailáth (gróf), Band 4, Seite 262, F. Perthes, Hamburg 1848.</ref> In 1767, weary of the squabbling, the ''Porte'' issued a ''firman'' that divided the church among the claimants.

A fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808, causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Edicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Edicule's exterior were rebuilt in 1809–1810 by architect Komminos of [[Mytilene]] in the then current Ottoman [[Baroque]] style. The fire did not reach the interior of the Aedicule, and the marble decoration of the Tomb dates mainly to the 1555 restoration, although the interior of the ante-chamber, now known as the ''Chapel of the Angel'', was partly re-built to a square ground-plan, in place of the previously semi-circular western end.  Another [[firman (decree)|decree]] in 1853 from the sultan solidified the existing territorial division among the communities and set a ''[[status quo]]'' for arrangements to "remain forever", caused differences of opinion about upkeep and even minor changes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/sepulchre.shtml |title=The Church of the Holy Sepulchre:A Work in Progress |publisher=Bibleinterp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> including disagreement on the removal of the "[[Immovable Ladder]]", an exterior ladder under one of the windows; this ladder has remained in the same position since then.

[[File:Floorplan of the CotHS.JPG|thumb|right|The church after its 1808 restoration]]
The cladding of red marble applied to the Aedicule by Komminos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since 1947 it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the [[British Mandate for Palestine|British Mandate]]. No plans have been agreed upon for its renovation.

The current dome dates from 1870, although it was restored during 1994–1997, as part of extensive modern renovations to the church, which have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white ''[[meleke]]'' [[limestone]] was struck.<ref name="Hesemann170">{{Cite book|first=Michael|last=Hesemann|title=Die Jesus-Tafel|publisher=Freiburg|year=1999|page=170|isbn=3-451-27092-7|language=German}}</ref> To the east of the ''Chapel of Saint Helena'', the excavators discovered a void containing a 2nd-century drawing of a Roman ship, two low walls which supported the platform of Hadrian's 2nd-century temple, and a higher 4th-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica.<ref>[[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], ''The Holy Land'', (1998), page 59</ref><ref name="lancaster">{{cite web |last=Lancaster |first=James E. |title=Finding the Keys to the Chapel of St. Vartan |url=http://coastdaylight.com/stvartan.html|work=Jim Lancaster's Web Space|accessdate=2 March 2012|year=1998|quote=the height difference can be easily seen; the yellowish wall on the left is the 4th century wall, the pinkish wall on the right is the 2nd century wall.}}</ref> After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the [[Chapel of Saint Vartan]], and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new Chapel could be accessed (by permission) from the ''Chapel of Saint Helena''.<ref name="lancaster"/>

There was some controversy in 2010, when the Jerusalem City Council threatened to cut off water to the site, due to disputed water bills.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Arieh|title=Israel threatens to cut off water supply to Church of the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Israel-threatens-to-cut-off-water-supply-to-Church-of-the-Holy-Sepulchre-19074.html|accessdate=3 March 2012|newspaper=[[AsiaNews]]|date=30 July 2010}}</ref>

==Entrance==
The entrance to the church is through a single door in the south [[transept]]. This narrow way of access to such a large structure has proven to be hazardous at times. For example, when a fire broke out in 1840, dozens of pilgrims were trampled to death.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

==Calvary (Golgotha)==
[[File:Golgotha Stone Chapel of Adam.jpg|thumb|The Rock of Calvary as seen in the Chapel of Adam|right]]
[[File:Altar of the Crucifixion in The Church of The Holy Sepulchre.ogv|Altar of the Crucifixion|thumb]]
On the south side of the altar via the [[ambulatory]] (an aisle surrounding the end of the choir or chancel of a church) is a stairway climbing to '''Calvary (Golgotha)''', traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The main altar there belongs to the Greek Orthodox, which contains '''The Rock of Calvary''' (12th Station of the Cross). The rock can be seen under glass on both sides of the altar, and beneath the altar there is a hole said to be the place where the cross was raised. Due to the significance of this, it is the most visited site in the Holy Sepulchre. The Roman Catholics ([[Franciscan]]s) have an altar to the side, '''The Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross''' (11th Station of the Cross). On the left of the altar, towards the Eastern Orthodox chapel, there is a statue of Mary, believed to be working wonders (the 13th Station of the Cross, where Jesus' body was removed from the cross and given to his family).{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Beneath the Calvary and the two chapels there, on the main floor, there is '''The Chapel of Adam'''. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. The Rock of Calvary is seen cracked through a window on the altar wall, the crack traditionally being said to be caused by the earthquake that occurred when Jesus died on the cross, and being said by more critical scholars to be the result of quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080524035048/http://monastery.org/sephist.html] (archived from [http://www.holyplacesinisrael.com/church_holy_sepulchre.html the original]{{dead link|date=July 2012}})</ref>

==Stone of Anointing==
[[File:Holy sepulchre stone of the anoiting.jpg|thumb|The Stone of Anointing]]

Just inside the entrance is '''The Stone of Anointing''', also known as '''The Stone of Unction''', which tradition claims to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. However, this tradition is only attested since the crusader era, and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.<ref name="Murphy56"/> The wall behind the stone was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; the wall blocks the view of the rotunda, sits on top of the graves of four 12th-century kings, and is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is [[Stations of the Cross|the 13th Station of the Cross]], which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th station up on Calvary. The lamps that hang over the stone are contributed by Armenians, Copts, Greeks and Latins.

==Rotunda and Aedicule==
The [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]] is located in the centre of the Anastasis, beneath the larger of the church's two domes. In the centre of the Rotunda is the chapel called the '''Aedicule''', which contains the Holy Sepulchre itself. The Aedicule has two rooms, the first holding  the '''Angel's Stone''', which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second is the tomb itself.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Under the ''[[status quo]]'', the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the [[Holy Saturday]] ceremony of the [[Holy Fire]] led by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarch]].<ref name=holyfire>{{cite web|title=Miracle of Holy Fire which happens every year|url=http://www.holyfire.org/eng/index.htm|work=Holyfire.org|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> To its rear, within a chapel constructed of iron [[latticework]] upon a stone base semicircular in plan, lies the altar used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]].{{cn|date = October 2013}} Historically, the [[Georgians]] also retained the key to the Aedicule.<ref>Janin 1913. 35.</ref><ref>De Sandoli 1990. 47. 81.</ref><ref>A Brief Description of the Holy Sepulchre Jerusalem and Other Christian Churches in the Holy City: With Some Account of the Mediaeval Copies of the Holy Sepulchre Surviving in Europe, George Jeffery, 69</ref>

Beyond that to the rear of the Rotunda is a rough-hewn chapel containing an opening to a chamber cut from the rock, from which several ''[[kokhim|kokh]]''-tombs radiate. Although this space was discovered recently,{{when|date=July 2012}} and contains no identifying marks, many Christians believe{{vague|date=July 2012}} it to be the tomb of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], and it is where the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays. To the right of the Sepulchre on the southeastern edge of the Rotunda is the Chapel of the Apparition, which is reserved for Roman Catholic use.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

==Catholicon and Ambulatory==
[[File:5289-20080123-jerusalem-holy-sepulchre-omphalos.jpg|thumb|right|The [[omphalos]] and the north wall of the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]]]]
* '''The Catholicon''' - On the east side opposite the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today ''the Greek Orthodox [[Katholikon|catholicon]]''. The second, smaller dome sits directly over the centre of the [[crossing (architecture)|transept crossing]] of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] where the ''compas'', an '''[[omphalos]]''' once thought to be the centre of the world (associated to the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. East of this is a large [[iconostasis]] demarcating the Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the  throne of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] on the south side facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox [[Patriarch of Antioch]] on the north side.

[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-08-Prison of Christ.jpg|thumb|The "Holy Prison", or Prison of Christ]]
* Prison of Christ - In the north-east side of the complex there is ''The Prison of Christ'', alleged by the Franciscans to be where Jesus was held. The Greek Orthodox allege that the real place that Jesus was held was the similarly named ''Prison of Christ'', within their ''Monastery of the Praetorium'', located near the [[Ecce Homo (church)|Church of Ecce Homo]], at the ''first station'' on the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The Armenians regard a recess in the ''Monastery of the Flagellation'', a building near the ''second station'' on the Via Dolorosa, as the ''Prison of Christ''. A cistern among the ruins near the [[Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu]] is also alleged to have been the ''Prison of Christ''.

Further to the east in the ambulatory are three chapels (from south to north):
* Greek Chapel of St. Longinus -  The Orthodox Greek chapel is dedicated to St. Longinus, a Roman soldier who according the [[New Testament]] pierced Jesus with a spear.
* Armenian Chapel of Division of Robes -
* Greek Chapel of the Derision - the southernmost chapel in the ambulatory.

==Armenian compound==
[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre-07-St Helen Chapel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem]]]]
*  [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]- between the first two chapels are stairs descending to Chapel of Saint Helena.
* Chapel of [[Vardan Mamikonian|Saint Vartan]] - on the north side of the Chapel of Saint Helena is an ornate [[wrought iron]] door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the [[Quarry]], and which leads to the ''Chapel of [[St. Vartan|Saint Vartan]]''. The latter Chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are usually closed.
* Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross - another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of Saint Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic ''Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross'' believed to be the place where the [[True Cross]] was found.

===North of the Aedicule===
* '''The Franciscan Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene''' - The chapel indicates the place where [[Mary Magdalene]] met Jesus after his resurrection.<ref name="fran">{{cite web|title=The Franciscans at the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspfran.html|publisher=The Franciscans of the Holy Land|accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>
* '''The Franciscan Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament''' (or Chapel of the Apparition) - in memory of Jesus' meeting with his mother after the Resurrection.<ref name="fran"/>

===South of the Aedicule===
The three Greek Orthodox chapels of [[St. James the Just]], [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]], south of the rotunda and on the west side of the front courtyard originally formed the [[baptistery]] complex of the Constantinean church, the southern most chapel being the vestibule, the middle chapel being the actual [[baptistery]] and the north chapel being the chamber in which the patriarch [[chrism]]ated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex.

==Status quo==
[[File:Immovable Ladder CotHS.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Immovable Ladder]]. Detail from photograph of main entrance above the façade.]]

The primary custodians are the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Churches, with the Greek Orthodox Church having the lion's share. In the 19th century, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures within and around the building. Times and places of worship for each community are strictly regulated in common areas.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Establishment of the 1853 status quo did not halt the violence, which continues to break out every so often even in modern times. On a hot summer day in 2002, a Coptic monk moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Chris|title=Christian History Corner: Divvying up the Most Sacred Place|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/julyweb-only/7-29-52.0.html|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=[[Christianity Today]]|date=1 July 2002}}</ref>

In another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out. Some people were arrested, but no one was seriously injured.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,2763,1314466,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Punch-up at tomb of Jesus | date=September 28, 2004 | accessdate=April 18, 2010 | first=Allyn | last=Fisher-Ilan}}</ref>

[[File:Catholic monks in Jerusalem 2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Franciscan]]s during the procession on The Calvary, 2006]]
On [[Palm Sunday]], in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek [[monk]] was ejected from the building by a rival faction. Police were called to the scene but were also attacked by the enraged brawlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/976409.html |title=Armenian, Greek worshippers come to blows at Jesus' tomb - Haaretz - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz |date=2008-04-20 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> On Sunday, November 9, 2008, a clash erupted between Armenian and Greek monks during celebrations for the [[Feast of the Cross]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Times Online|date=November 10, 2008|title=Riot police called as monks clash in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5121217.ece|accessdate=2008-11-11 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1035666.html|date=10/11/2008|title=Once again, monks come to blows at Church of Holy Sepulchre|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-11-11}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref>

Under the ''status quo'', no part of what is designated as common territory may be so much as rearranged without consent from all communities. This often leads to the neglect of badly needed repairs when the communities cannot come to an agreement among themselves about the final shape of a project. Just such a disagreement has delayed the renovation of the ''[[edicule]]'', where the need is now dire, but also where any change in the structure might result in a change to the ''status quo'', disagreeable to one or more of the communities.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

A less grave sign of this state of affairs is located on a window ledge over the church's entrance. Someone placed a wooden ladder there sometime before 1852, when the ''status quo'' defined both the doors and the window ledges as common ground. This ladder, the "[[Immovable Ladder]]", remains there to this day, in almost exactly the same position it can be seen to occupy in century-old photographs and engravings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coastdaylight.com/ladder.html |title=Holy Sepulchre Ladder |publisher=Coastdaylight.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref><ref>An unusual and rare location of the ladder was documented by an Israeli tour guide in February 2009 [http://www.dannythedigger.com/newsletter/who-moved-thy-ladder]</ref> An engraving by David Roberts in 1839 also shows the same ladder in the same position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717452/ |title=Entrance to the holy sepulchre; title page, vol. 1 |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

No one controls the main entrance. In 1192, [[Saladin]] assigned responsibility for it to the Muslim [[Nusaybah clan|Nuseibeh]] family. The [[Joudeh Al-Goudia family]] were entrusted as custodian to the keys of the Holy Sepulchre by the Ottomans few hundred years later, and both families now share the responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} This arrangement has persisted into modern times.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

==Connection to Temple of Aphrodite==
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|right|Jerusalem after being rebuilt by Hadrian. Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route.]]
The site  of the Church had been a temple of Aphrodite prior to Constantine's edifice being built. Hadrian's temple had actually been located there because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (which is now the location of the (smaller) [[Muristan]]); the forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the (other) main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the ''[[Russia]]n Mission in Exile'').

From the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further.<ref name="Corbo"/> [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall, of the temple itself, would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb;<ref name="Corbo"/> if the wall had been any further west any ''tomb'' would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.

Other archaeologists have criticised Corbo's reconstructions. Dan Bahat, the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known Temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the Temple Building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now;<ref name="BahatBAR">Dan Bahat, ''Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?'', in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' May/June 1986</ref> indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda wasn't based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.<ref name="BahatBAR"/>

==Location==
The Bible describes Jesus' tomb as being outside the city wall,<ref>for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}</ref> as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean,<ref>[Toynbee, Jocelyn M. C. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rHd1MDlV-eUC&pg=PA14&dq=Funerary+art&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=mfHeS-XqKYniywT0nb3_CA&cd=21#v=onepage&q=Funerary%20art&f=false ''Death and Burial in the Roman World''], pp. 48-49, JHU Press. 1996. ISBN 0-8018-5507-1. An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials. For an extreme example, see [[Prohibition of death#In antiquity|ancient Delos]].</ref> but the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is in the heart of Hadrian's city, well within the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] walls, which were built by Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in 1538{{Clarify|this sentence is incoherent,please clarify: Hadrian's walls could not have been built by Suleiman- 1400 years later.|date=September 2012}} Some{{Who|date=May 2010}} have claimed that the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since [[Herod Agrippa]] (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.

[[File:BasicJerusalemCrossSection.svg|thumb|left|If the western city wall was originally to the east of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, then the western hill, on which it is sited, would have been advantageous to an enemy.]]
However, a wall would imply the existence of a defensive ditch outside it, so an earlier wall could not be immediately adjacent to site of the tomb, which combined with the presence of the [[Temple Mount]] would make the city inside the wall quite thin; essentially for the traditional site to have been outside the wall, the city would have had to be limited to the lower parts of the [[Tyropoeon Valley]], rather than including the defensively advantageous western hill. Since these geographic considerations imply that, not including the hill within, the walls would be willfully making the city prone to attack from it, some scholars, including the late 19th century surveyors of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], consider it unlikely that a wall would ever have been built that would cut the hill off from the city in the valley;<ref>Colonel [[Claude Reignier Conder]], ''The City of Jerusalem'' (1909), (republished 2004); for details about Conder himself, see [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener#Survey of Western Palestine]]</ref> archaeological evidence for the existence of an earlier city wall in such a location has never been found.  The area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry<ref>See Discoveries at Archaeological excavations at [[Meleke]].</ref> and outside the city during the early 1st century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated.  This obviated the need for a defensive ditch or fosse since the line of the city wall would follow the south lip of the quarry. The quarry and tombs associated with it are north, not west of the main city and west only of the merchant area in the Tyropoeon Valley, which was enclosed by the Second Wall.

Although, in 2007, Dan Bahat stated that ''Six graves from the first century were found on the area of the ''Church of the Holy Sepulchre''. That means, this place [was] outside of the city, without any doubt, ....'',<ref name="ZDF">[[Dan Bahat]] [http://www.zdf.de/ZDFde/inhalt/17/0,1872,5262833,00.html in German television ZDF, April 11, 2007]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> the dating of the tombs is based on the fact that they are in the ''[[Kokhim|kokh]]'' style, which was common in 1st century; however, the ''kokh'' style of tomb was also common in the first to 3rd centuries BC.<ref>Rachel Hachlili, (2005) ''Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period''</ref>

The likelihood of a 1st-century tomb being built to the west of the city is questionable, as according to the late 1st-century rabbinic leader, [[Akiva ben Joseph]], quoted in the [[Mishnah]], tombs should not built to the west of the city, as the wind in Jerusalem generally blows from the west, and would blow the smell of the corpses and their ''impurity'' over the city, and the Temple Mount.<ref name="Baba Batra">''[[Bava Batra|Baba Batra]]'' 25a</ref> Additionally, the Aedicule would be quite close to the city even if the west wall of the city had been to its east; yet Akiba remarks that Jewish law insists that tombs should not be built within 50 cubits of a city.<ref name="Baba Batra"/> The archaeological record indicates that the instructions reported by Akiba, for choosing a burial location, were rigidly adhered to; almost all of the tombs from classical Jerusalem are to the east of the city, on the [[Mount of Olives]], except for a few located over a kilometre to the west, and those in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.<ref>Ephraim Stern, (editor), ''New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land'', 1993</ref>

One might note, however, that what is assumed to be a niche for the Torah scroll in the building probably originally built as a Judeo-Christian synagogue between AD 70 and AD 135 on the traditional site of the [[Cenacle]] or upper room of the [[Last Supper]] and now identified as the site of the [[King David's Tomb]] is oriented not towards the [[Temple Mount]], but towards the site of the Holy Sepulchre,<ref>{{cite web|author=CenturyOne Foundation, Inc. |url=http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html |title=Church of the Apostles Found on Mt. Zion - Pixner - BAR and CenturyOne Foundation |publisher=Centuryone.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> which would seem to indicate that the Christian community that had built it had already began to transfer many of the religious traditions originally associated with the Temple to the sites they associated with Christ's death and resurrection (such as the burial place of Adam and the centre of the world).

==Challenges to authenticity==
[[File:Tomb of Christ in the Garden, 1898-1946.jpg|thumb|[[Garden Tomb]]]]
Although the identification of the Aedicule as the site of Jesus' tomb is not a tenet of faith for any major Christian denomination, many Catholic and Orthodox Christians hold fast to this traditional location. However, due to the many issues the site raises, several scholars have rejected its validity.<ref>Given that the area of Golgotha was understood by the early Jerusalem church to have been further south than the site now occupied by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, it would certainly have been miraculous if, given the history here outlined, Constanline's workmen had struck the right tomb. [...] We can deduce from the late second-century evidence of Melito of Sardis that the Jerusalem church pointed out Golgotha as lying under the colonnaded streets of the forum or the adjacent Cardo Maximus or Decumanus. This location is confirmed by the evidence of Eusebius, writing in his Onomasticon. The site of Golgotha was close to the temple of Venus, built by order of the emperor Hadrian, but further south. With Constantine came a relocation of Golgotha. The emperor made the identification of the site as actually lying under the temple of Venus. He wished to destroy this and replace it with a new Christian temple in honour of the 'saving sign', the cross, which had proved the instrument of his success. Proof of his having chosen the correct site, for those who may have been doubtful amongst the Jerusalem church, came with the finding of the wood of Christ's cross in the course of excavating the Hadrianic fill. The matter was clinched when an empty tomb was discovered and heralded as being that belonging to Christ. Further tombs which came to light were simply cut away. [...] Christians began to see the rock of the cross as being the precise place where Jesus' cross had been positioned; the decorative cross was believed to have replaced the cross of wood on which the Saviour had died. The rock of the cross, the former Venus shrine, became Golgotha itself.
It may well have been that the belief that Hadrian built a temple on Golgotha led to the idea that pagans wished to annihilate sites with Christian significance in general, so that it was precisely for this reason that  the Christians were inclined to accept that the birthplace of Christ was in the cave of Tammuz-Adonis in Bethlehem. But the evidence suggests that Hadrian did not build his temple exactly over Golgotha, and that neither the Rock of  Calvary nor the supposed Tomb of Christ was venerated by Christians before the fourth century. - Christians And The Holy Places - The Myth Of Jewish-Christian Origins, Joan E. Taylor, Clarendon Press Oxford, Oxford University Press 1993.</ref> The very fact that outside the city of Jerusalem were at the beginning of the first Christian millennium many places called in the local jargon "Golgotha" (because all of them were used as a place of execution) complicates the task of finding that one where Jesus was executed.<ref>"However, around 398 Jerome vehemently dismissed the legend as a fable (in Matt. xvii. 33). He repeated the reference to the person discoursing on Ephesians, but he went on to say that it was just "a popular interpretation", which was "pleasing to the ears" of people. '''Nevertheless, Golgotha did not gain its name because of Adam's skull, but because it was local jargon for "execution place", or "place of beheading". He explained that outside the gate of Jerusalem there were areas where criminals were executed, and these were each called "Golgotha", even in his day. Jesus was therefore killed in "the field of the condemned", as a criminal among criminals.''' Furthermore, said Jerome implicitly arguing against Origen, the Jews did not have a tradition that Adam was buried at Golgotha. Jerome knew of the tradition of Adam's burial at Hebron (cf. Lib. loc. 75.23). '''Since Jerome was familiar with Jerusalem and its surroundings, his first-hand knowledge of the language of the local population provides weighty evidence for a proper understanding of the name "Golgotha". Perhaps, if there were other "execution places" around Jerusalem, this would account for Cyril of Jerusalem's specification of the "Christian Golgotha" in his lectures as being "pre-eminent" (Cat. xiii. 39, or x. 19), a double entendre of a word which appears to refer both to the physical height of the hill (part rock, part fill) of Golgotha and to its importance.'''- "Christians And The Holy Places - The Myth Of Jewish-Christian Origins", Joan E. Taylor, Clarendon Press Oxford, Oxford University Press 1993, p.130</ref> Meanwhile, the traditional location of Golgotha is considered by some historians as unfit, due to the rocky structure the tradition put forward as the exact place of execution.<ref>"Golgotha was no longer seen as the site as a whole but as the rocky outcrop with the cross on its summit. It became one of the many sacred sites within a growing complex of shrines and buildings. The actual form of the rock was obscured and no one realized just how unlikely a place it would have been for a crucifixion; it was naturally hollow and stood 12 metres above bedrock on the east, and 5 metres above bedrock on the west. In other words, any Roman soldiers who wished to crucify three people on the top of this unstable spur would have had to overcome enormous difficulties, to say the least." - "Christians And The Holy Places - The Myth Of Jewish-Christian Origins", Joan E. Taylor, Clarendon Press Oxford, Oxford University Press 1993, p.131</ref>

After time spent in Palestine in 1882–83, General [[Charles George Gordon]] found a location outside the old city walls that he suggested to have been the real location of Golgotha. Although the Church of the Holy Sepulchre has its tomb just a few yards away from its Golgotha, there is no particular reason to regard this close juxtaposition as a necessity; however, Gordon followed this principle, concluding that his site for Golgotha must also be the approximate location for Jesus' burial, identifying a nearby tomb, now called the ''[[Garden Tomb]]'', as the location for the event. Pottery and archaeological findings in the area have subsequently been dated to the 7th century BC so, in the opinion of archaeologists the Garden Tomb site would have been abandoned by the 1st century.<ref>Gabriel Barkay, ''The Garden Tomb'', published in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' March/April 1986</ref> Biblically this does not match three of the Gospel accounts (Matthew, Luke, and John) which specifically state the tomb was new and no one had ever been laid inside. Despite the archaeological discoveries, the Garden Tomb has become a popular place of pilgrimage among Protestants. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] leaders have been more hesitant to formally commit to the identification even though many [[Mormons]] regard the Garden Tomb as the correct location of Jesus' tomb.{{cn|date = October 2013}}

Currently, no other potential site for the tomb has received much attention or academic support.{{cn|date = October 2013}}
