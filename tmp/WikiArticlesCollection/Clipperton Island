'''Clipperton Island''' ({{lang-fr|Île de Clipperton}} or ''{{lang|fr|Île de la Passion}}'') is an uninhabited {{convert|9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} coral [[atoll]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], south-west of [[Mexico]], west of [[Costa Rica]] and 2420&nbsp;km north-west of [[Galapagos Islands]], [[Ecuador]], at {{Coord|10|18|N|109|13|W|name=Clipperton Island|type:isle_region:FR-CP|display=inline}}. It is an overseas possession of [[France]] under direct authority of the [[Minister of Overseas France]].<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=2E14855B772D504D6D56073B3A3BFDAD.tpdjo13v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000879815&categorieLien=cid&dateTexte= Art. 9, Loi n° 55-1052 du 6 août 1955 modifiée portant statut des Terres australes et antarctiques françaises et de l'île de Clipperton].<br /> [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000018048991&fastPos=1&fastReqId=2007253908&categorieLien=id&oldAction=rechTexte Décret du 31 janvier 2008 relatif à l'administration de l'île de Clipperton].</ref>

It is low-lying and largely barren, save for scattered grasses and a few clumps of [[Coconut|coconut palms]]. A small volcanic outcrop rising to {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} on its south-east side is referred to as "Clipperton Rock".<ref>[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/history.html Clipperton Island History].</ref> The atoll has been occupied at various times by guano miners, would-be settlers or military personnel, mostly from Mexico, which claimed it until [[international arbitration]] awarded it to France in 1931. It has had no permanent inhabitants since 1945. It is visited on occasion by fishermen, [[French Navy]] patrols, scientific researchers, film crews, and shipwreck survivors. It has been a popular site for transmissions by [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] operators.<ref>[http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/ Clipperton Island DXpedition], includes details on several previous ham radio expeditions to Clipperton, and photos of the island.</ref>

==Environment==

===Location, lagoon and climate===
[[File:Clippertonisland.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Coconut]] palms on Clipperton; the lagoon is visible beyond the trees]]

Clipperton is about {{convert|945|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Socorro Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo Archipelago]], the nearest land. Its ring-shaped atoll completely encloses a [[water stagnation|stagnant]] freshwater [[lagoon]], and is {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} in circumference. The rim averages {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width, reaching {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the west and narrows to {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the north-east, where sea waves occasionally spill over into the lagoon. Land elevations average {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though Clipperton Rock, a barren {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[volcano|volcanic]] outcrop in the south-east, is considerably higher and is the highest point. The surrounding reef is exposed at low tide.<ref name="ClippertonIsland">{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0705|name=Clipperton Island Shrubs and Grasslands|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

The lagoon is devoid of fish, and contains some deep basins with depths of {{convert|−43|and|−22|m|ft|abbr=on}}, including a spot known as ''Trou-Sans-Fond'', or "the bottomless hole", with [[sulfuric acid|acidic water]] at its base. The water is described as being almost [[Fresh water|fresh]] at the surface, and highly [[eutrophic]]. Seaweed beds cover approximately 45 percent of the lagoon's surface.<ref name="ClippertonIsland" />

While some sources have rated the lagoon water as [[potable|non-potable]],<ref>[http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm Clipperton Island Travel Tips], [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0828_030829_milbrandjournal1.html Lance Hildebrand's Journal]</ref> testimony from the crew of the [[tuna]] clipper M/V ''Monarch,'' stranded for 23 days in 1962 after their boat sank, indicates otherwise. Their report reveals that the lagoon water, while not tasting very good, was drinkable, though "muddy and dirty". Several of the castaways drank it, with no apparent ill effects.<ref>[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pp.8–9.</ref> Survivors of the ill-fated Mexican military [[colony]] in 1917 (see below) indicated that they were dependent upon [[rain]] for their water supply, catching it in old [[boat]]s they used for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pg.10.</ref> Aside from the lagoon and water caught from rain, no other freshwater sources are known to exist.

It has a tropical oceanic climate, with average temperatures of {{convert|20|–|32|C|F}}. The rainy season occurs from May to October, when it is subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. Surrounding ocean waters are warm, pushed by equatorial and counter-equatorial currents. It has no known natural resources, its [[guano]] having been depleted early in the 20th century. Although 115 species of fish have been identified in nearby waters the only economic activity in the area is [[tuna]] fishing.

===Flora and fauna===
When Snodgrass and Heller visited in 1898, they reported that "no land plant is native to the island".<ref>Snodgrass and Heller, 1902.</ref> Historical accounts from 1711, 1825 and 1839 show a low grassy or suffrutescent (partially woody) flora (Sachet, 1962). [[Coconut|Coconut palm]]s were introduced in the 1890s and a few still survive. Introduction of [[pig]]s by [[guano]] miners at the beginning of the 20th century reduced the crab population, which in turn allowed [[grassland]] to gradually cover about 80 percent of the land surface (Sachet, 1962). The elimination of these pigs in 1958 has caused most of this vegetation to disappear as millions of [[crab]]s (''Gecarcinus planatus'')<ref>Accepted name: ''Johngarthia planata'', Stimpson; see: http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/search/all/key/johngarthia+planata/match/1 ; http://crustac3a.tumblr.com/post/38610682919/this-crab-johngarthia-planata-is-one-of-the-few</ref> have returned. The result is virtually a sandy desert, with only 674 palms counted by [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] during the "Passion 2001" French mission, and five islets in the lagoon with grass that the terrestrial crabs cannot reach.

[[File:CarteLocal.gif|thumb|right|230px|Location of Clipperton Island]]

During Sachet's visit in 1958, the vegetation was found to consist of a sparse cover of spiny grass and low thickets, a creeping plant (''[[Ipomoea]]'' sp.), and stands of coconut palm. This low-lying herbaceous flora seems to be pioneer in nature, and most of it is believed to be composed of recently introduced [[species]]. Sachet suspected that ''[[Heliotropium curassavicum]]'' and possibly ''[[Portulaca oleracea]]'' were native, however (Sachet 1962). On the north-west side the most abundant species are ''[[Cenchrus echinatus]]'', ''[[Sida rhombifolia]]'', and ''Corchorus aestuans''. These plants compose a shrub cover up to 30&nbsp;cm in height and are intermixed with ''[[Eclipta]]'', ''[[Phyllanthus]]'', and ''[[Solanum]]'', as well as a taller plant, ''[[Brassica juncea]]''. One interesting feature observed is that the vegetation is arranged in parallel rows of species; dense rows of taller species alternate with lower, more open vegetation. This was assumed to be a result of the [[phosphate]] mining method of trench-digging.<ref name="ClippertonIsland" />

The only land animals known to exist are bright-orange crabs (which are poisonous to consume), birds, lizards and rats, the last of which seem to have arrived from recently wrecked ships.<ref name="ClippertonIsland_a">{{cite web|url=http://www.clipperton.fr/downloads/ArtPitman2006.pdf |title=Clipperton Island: Pig Sty, Rat Hole, and Booby Prize |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> Bird species include [[White Tern]]s, [[Masked Booby|Masked Boobies]], [[Sooty Tern]]s, [[Brown Booby|Brown Boobies]], [[Brown Noddy|Brown Noddies]], [[Black Noddy|Black Noddies]], [[Greater Frigatebird|Greater Frigates]], [[Coot]]s, Martins, [[Cuckoo]]s and [[Yellow Warbler]]s. [[Duck]]s have been reported in the lagoon.<ref name="ClippertonIsland" /> The island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]] because of the large breeding colony of Masked Boobies, with 110,000 individual birds recorded.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Clipperton|accessdate=2012-11-21 |work= BirdLife data zone: Important Bird Areas |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year= 2012}}</ref> The lagoon harbours millions of [[isopod]]s, which swimmers claim can deliver a painful sting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/n9ns-1992.html |title=1992 Clipperton Island Expedition |publisher=Qsl.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

A recent report (2006) by the [[NOAA]]'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center in [[La Jolla]], [[California]], indicates that the increased rat presence has led to a decline in both crab and bird populations, causing a corresponding increase in both vegetation and coconut palms. This report urgently recommended eradication of rats so that vegetation might be reduced and the island might return to its "pre-human" state.<ref name="ClippertonIsland_a" />

==History==

===Discovery and early claims===

The name ''Île de la Passion'' ({{lang-en|Passion Island}}) was officially given to Clipperton in 1711 by French discoverers Martin de Chassiron and Michel Du Bocage, commanding the French ships ''La Princesse'' and ''La Découverte''. They drew up the first map and annexed it to France. The first scientific expedition took place in 1725 under Frenchman M. Bocage, who lived on the island for several months. In 1858 France formally laid claim.

The name comes from [[John Clipperton]], an English [[pirate]] and [[privateer]] who fought the Spanish during the early 18th century, and who is said to have passed by the island. Some sources say he used it as a base for his raids on shipping, but there is no documentary evidence of this.<ref>Büch, Boudewijn. ''Eilanden'' ('Islands'). Holland, 1991, IScBN 9041330860</ref>

Other claimants included the United States, whose American Guano Mining Company claimed it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856; Mexico also claimed it due to activities undertaken there as early as 1848–1849. On November 17, 1858, Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&nbsp;III]] annexed it as part of the French colony of [[Tahiti]]. This did not settle the ownership question. On November 24, 1897, French naval authorities found three Americans working for the American Guano Company, who had raised the American flag. U.S. authorities denounced their act, assuring the French that they did not intend to assert American sovereignty.<ref>''[http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf Clipperton Islands Case (Mexico v. France)]'', Judicial Decisions Involving Questions of International Law (28 January 1931).</ref>

[[Mexico]] reasserted its claim late in the 19th century, and on December 13, 1897 sent the gunboat ''La Democrata'' to occupy and annex it. A colony was established, and a series of military governors were posted, the last one being [[Ramón Arnaud]] (1906–1916). France insisted on ''its'' ownership, and a lengthy diplomatic correspondence between the two nations led to the conclusion of a treaty on March 2, 1909, to seek the arbitration of King [[Victor Emmanuel&nbsp;III of Italy]], with each nation promising to abide by his determination.<ref>Original treaty between Mexico and France, French Foreign Ministry Archives, PDF file: [https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf Gouv-fr-PDF-19].</ref> His decision would not be rendered until 1931.

===Guano mining and the tragedy of 1917===
[[Image:SobrevivientesClipperton.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Survivors from Clipperton Island, 1917]]

The British Pacific Island Company acquired the rights to guano deposits in 1906 and built a mining settlement in conjunction with the Mexican government. That same year, a lighthouse was erected under the orders of [[List of Presidents of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. By 1914 around 100 people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;were living there, resupplied every two months by a ship from [[Acapulco]]. With the escalation of fighting in the [[Mexican Revolution]], the regular resupply visits ceased and the inhabitants were left to their own devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/voyage/about |title=About Clipperton Island &#124; |publisher=Clippertonproject.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>  The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warship ''Lexington'' visited in late 1915 and advised evacuation of all inhabitants, but the governor, [[Ramón Arnaud|Captain Arnaud]], declared that evacuation was not necessary.<ref name="clippertonproject">{{cite web|url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/voyage/about |title=About Clipperton Island &#124; |publisher=Clippertonproject.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>

By 1917 all but one of the male inhabitants had died. Many had perished from [[scurvy]], while others (including Captain Arnaud) died during an attempt to sail after a passing ship to fetch help. Lighthouse keeper Victoriano Álvarez was the last man on the island, together with 15 women and children.<ref name="Travel Blog">{{cite web|url=http://elainejobin.com/Elsewhere/Pacific/Clipperton_2010/000.html |title=Trip Report and Photos - Clipperton Island, 2010, Elain Jobin |publisher=Elainejobin.com |date=1917-07-18 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> Álvarez proclaimed himself "king" and began an orgy of rape and murder, before being killed by Tirza Rendon, who was the recipient of his unwanted attention.<ref name="clippertonproject" /> Almost immediately after Álvarez's death four women and seven children (the last survivors) were picked up by the US Navy gunship {{USS|Yorktown|PG-1|2}} on July 18, 1917.<ref name="clippertonproject" /> No more attempts were made to colonise it, though it was briefly occupied during the 1930s and 1940s.

The tragic tale of the Mexican colony has been the subject of several novels, including Ivo Mansmann's ''Clipperton, Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel'' ("Clipperton, Destinies on a Forgotten Island"); ISBN 3-354-00709-5 (in German, no English translation available) and Colombian writer [[Laura Restrepo]]'s ''La Isla de la Pasión'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref>Restrepo, Laura. ''La Isla de la Pasión'', 1989,  ISBN 978-0-06-081620-9</ref>

===Final arbitration of ownership===
On January 28, 1931, King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emanuel]] declared Clipperton to be a French possession.<ref>[http://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf Clipperton Islands Case (''Mexico v. France'') Judicial Decisions Involving Questions of International Law (28 January 1931]; [http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.2_heflin.pdf article by William Heflin that includes a discussion of the case]</ref> The French rebuilt the [[lighthouse]] and settled a military outpost, which remained for seven years before being abandoned.

===Recent developments===
The island was abandoned by the end of World War II after being briefly occupied by the US (1944–45). Since then it has been visited by sport fishermen, patrols of the French Navy, and by Mexican [[tuna]] and [[shark]] fishermen. There have been infrequent scientific and [[amateur radio]] expeditions, and in 1978 [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] visited with his team of divers and a survivor from the 1917 evacuation to film a [[television]] special called ''Clipperton: The Island that Time Forgot.''<ref>Simon Rogerson, [http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&v=5&sp=332382698484330872538 "Cousteau and the Pit"], ''Dive magazine'', July 19, 2006.</ref>

[[File:Brown booby.jpg|thumb|The Brown Booby]]

It was visited by ornithologist Ken Stager of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles County Museum]] in 1958. Appalled at the depredations visited by feral pigs upon the island's [[Brown Booby]] and [[Masked Booby]] colonies (reduced to 500 and 150 birds, respectively), Stager procured a [[shotgun]] and killed all 58 pigs. By 2003, the Booby colonies had 25,000 Brown Boobies and 112,000 Masked Boobies, the world's second-largest Brown Booby colony and its largest Masked Booby colony.<ref name="ClippertonIsland_a" />

When the independence of [[Algeria]] in 1962 threatened French nuclear testing sites in the African nation, the French Ministry of Defence considered Clipperton Island as a possible replacement. This was eventually ruled out due to the hostile climate and remote location. The French explored reopening the lagoon and developing a harbor for trade and tourism during the 1970s but this idea was abandoned. An automatic weather installation was completed on April 7, 1980, with data collected by this station being transmitted by satellite to [[Brittany]].

In 1981, the Academy of Sciences for Overseas Territories recommended that the island have its own economic infrastructure, with an airstrip and a fishing port in the [[lagoon]]. This would mean opening up the lagoon by creating a passage in the atoll rim. For this purpose, an agreement was signed with the French government, represented by the High Commissioner for French Polynesia, whereby the island became French state property. On October 13, 1986, a meeting took place regarding the establishment of a permanent base for fishing, between the high commissioner of [[French Polynesia]], representing the state, and the survey firm for the development and exploitation of the island (SEDEIC). Taking into account the economic constraints, the distance from markets, and the small size of the atoll, nothing apart from preliminary studies was ever undertaken to carry out this project. All plans for development were finally abandoned.

===Castaways===
In early 1962 the island provided a home to nine crewmen of the sunken tuna clipper MV ''Monarch'', stranded for 23 days from February 6 to March 1. They reported that the lagoon water was drinkable, though they preferred to drink water from the coconuts they found. Unable to use any of the dilapidated buildings, they constructed a crude shelter from cement bags and tin salvaged from [[Quonset hut]]s built by the American military 20 years earlier. Wood from the huts was used for firewood, and fish caught off the fringing reef combined with some potatoes and onions they had saved from their sinking vessel to augment the meager (as it turned out) supply of coconuts. The crewmen reported that they tried eating bird's eggs, but found them to be rancid, and they decided after trying to cook a "little black bird" that it did not have enough meat to make the effort worthwhile. Pigs had been eradicated, though the crewmen reported seeing their [[skeleton]]s around the atoll.  The crewmen were eventually discovered by another fishing boat and rescued by the United States Navy destroyer [[USS Robison (DDG-12)|USS ''Robison'']].<ref>[http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf Atoll Research Bulletin No. 94]. National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., December 15, 1962, pp.8–10.</ref>

In 1988, five Mexican fishermen became lost at sea after a storm during their trip along the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. They drifted within sight of the island but were unable to reach it.<ref>Arias, Ron. ''Five against the sea: A true story of courage and survival'', 1989</ref> Steven Longbaugh and David Heritage, two [[United States|American]] deckhands from a [[fishing boat]] based in [[California]], were stranded for three weeks in 1998. They were rescued after rebuilding a survival radio and using distress flares to signal for help.<ref>LaJoie, John. ''American Maritime Accident Report'', 1998</ref>

===Recent history===
[[File:Clipperton Island.png|thumb|left|180px|Satellite image of Clipperton Island]]

The Mexican and French oceanographic expedition SURPACLIP (UNAM Mexico and UNC Nouméa) made extensive studies in 1997. In 2001, French geographer [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] extended the 1997 studies through his French "Passion 2001" expedition, explaining the evolution of the ecosystem, and releasing several papers, a video film, and a website.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bruno Quintero |url=http://clipperton.fr |title=Clipperton ou Ile de La Passion |publisher=Clipperton.fr |date=1999-02-22}}</ref> In 2003 Lance Milbrand<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milbrandcinema.com/ |title=Lance Milbrand |publisher=Milbrandcinema.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> stayed for 41 days on a [[National Geographic Society]] expedition, recording his adventure in video, photos, and a written diary (see links below).

In 2005, the [[ecosystem]] was extensively studied for four months by a scientific mission organized by Jean-Louis Étienne, which made a complete inventory of mineral, plant, and animal species, studied algae as deep as 100&nbsp;m (330&nbsp;ft) below sea level, and examined the effects of pollution. A 2008 expedition from the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography collected sediment cores from the lagoon to study climate change over the last millennium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jsachs/lab/www/Research/Clipperton_2008/Clipperton_2008.html |title=Clipperton Atoll Expedition 2008 |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

On February 21, 2007, administration was transferred from the [[High Commissioner]] of the Republic in [[French Polynesia]] to the Minister of Overseas France.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_minor.html |title=French Minor Dependencies |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |date=}}</ref>

A recreational scuba diving expedition by the luxury liveaboard safari boat M/V ''Nautilus Explorer'' dived on the reefs from April 15 to 20, 2007 to observe the marine life and compare these observations with those reported by the Connie Limbaugh (Scripps) expeditions in 1956 and 1958. Commencing in 2010, the ''Nautilus Explorer'' will be running diving expeditions from [[Cabo San Lucas]] via [[Socorro Island]] every spring.

During the night of February 10, 2010, the ''Sichem Osprey'', a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] [[chemical tanker]], ran aground on its way from the [[Panama Canal]] to [[South Korea]]. The {{convert|170|m|adj=on}} ship contained [[xylene]], a clear, flammable volatile liquid commonly used as a solvent in rubber, leather and the printing industries. All 19 crew members were reported safe, and the vessel reported no leaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diver.net/bbs/posts002/81342.shtml |title='&#39;Diver.Net'&#39;, Retrieved, November 13, 2010 |publisher=Diver.net |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://reeftools.com/news/xylene-tanker-runs-aground-on-clipperton-island/ |title=ReefTools, Retrieved November 13, 2010 |publisher=Reeftools.com |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>  The vessel was refloated on March 6<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/search-results.htm;jsessionid=4ABF68DBDE9D889B43BBE23A30C751CD |title='&#39;Lloyds of London;'&#39; Retrieved, November 13, 2010 |publisher=Lloydslist.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> and returned to service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=249534000 |title='&#39;MarineTraffic.com'&#39; Retrieved, November 13, 2010 |publisher=Marinetraffic.com |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

In mid-March 2012, the crew from The Clipperton Project <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |title=The Clipperton Project, March 1, 2012 |publisher=Clippertonproject.com |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> noted the widespread presence of trash, particularly on the northeast shore and around the Rock. Debris including plastic bottles and containers create a potentially harmful environment to its flora and fauna. This trash is common to only two beaches (North East and South West) and the rest of the island is fairly clean. Other trash has been left over after the occupation by the Americans in 1944-45, the French in 1966-69, and the 2008 scientific expedition.

===Amateur radio DX-peditions===
The island has long been an attractive destination for amateur radio groups, due to its remoteness, difficulty of landing, permit requirements, romantic history, and interesting environment. While some radio operation was done ancillary to other expeditions, major DXpeditions include FO0XB (1978), FO0XX (1985), FO0CI (1992), FO0AAA (2000), and TX5C (2008). 

The most recent and most ambitious [[DX-pedition]] was the March, 2013 Cordell Expedition using the callsign TX5K,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tx5k.org |title=The 2013 Cordell Expedition to Clipperton Island}}</ref> organized and led by Dr. [[Robert Schmieder]]. As with previous Cordell Expeditions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cordell.org |title=Cordell Expeditions}}</ref> the Clipperton project combined radio operations with selected scientific investigations. The team of 24 radio operators made more than 114,000 contacts, breaking the previous record of 75,000. The activity included extensive operation on 6 meters, including EME (Earth-Moon-Earth, or moonbounce) contacts, the first from Clipperton. A notable accomplishment was the use of DXA, a real-time satellite-based online graphic radio log web page that allowed anyone anywhere with a browser to see the radio activity updated each minute. Scientific work carried out during the expedition included the first collection and identification of foraminifera, and extensive aerial imaging of the island using kite-borne cameras. The team included two scientists from the University of Tahiti and a TV crew from the French TV channel Thalassa."
