The British Isles also include three [[Crown Dependencies|dependencies of the British Crown]]: the [[Isle of Man]] and, by tradition, the [[Jersey|Bailiwick of Jersey]] and the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]], although the latter are not physically a part of the [[archipelago]].<ref>Oxford English Dictionary: "British Isles: a geographical term for the islands comprising Great Britain and Ireland with all their offshore islands including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands."</ref><ref>{{Cite book

The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. [[Ben Nevis]] rises to an [[summit (topography)|elevation]] of only {{convert|1344|m}}, [[Lough Neagh]], which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers {{convert|381|km2|sqmi}}. The climate is [[Temperateness|temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|marine]], with mild winters and warm summers. The [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by [[temperate rainforest]], although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover. The region was re-inhabited after the [[last glacial period]] of [[Quaternary glaciation]], by 12,000 BC in Great Britain and 8000 BC in Ireland. At that time, Great Britain was a [[Doggerland|peninsula of the European continent]] from which Ireland had become separated to form an island.

[[Gaels|Hiberni]] (Ireland), [[Pictish]] (northern Britain) and [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] (southern Britain) tribes inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquered by the Roman Empire]] from AD 43. The first [[Anglo-Saxons]] arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England.<ref>British Have Changed Little Since Ice Age, Gene Study SaysJames Owen for National Geographic News, 19 July 2005 [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0719_050719_britishgene.html]</ref> [[Viking]] invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change—particularly in England.  The subsequent [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], while control in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]], soon restricted only to [[The Pale]]. The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the [[British Empire]] and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century.  Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919–1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as [[Northern Ireland]].

[[Image:British-Isles-NW-European-shelf.png|thumb|right|alt=An image showing the geological shelf of the British Isles.|The British Isles in relation to the north-west [[Geography of Europe|European]] [[continental shelf]].]]

The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of [[tectonics|tectonic]] mountain building. These [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] form a complex geology which records a huge and varied span of Earth's history.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Goudie| first=Andrew S.| coauthors=D. Brunsden| title=The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas| year=1994| publisher=Clarendon Press| location=Oxford| page=2}}</ref> Of particular note was the [[Caledonian Orogeny]] during the [[Ordovician]] Period, c. 488–444 [[Annum|Ma]] and early [[Silurian]] period, when the [[craton]] [[Baltica]] collided with the [[terrane]] [[Avalonia]] to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed roughly the north western half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the [[Variscan orogeny]] in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] periods, forming the hills of [[Munster]], south-west England, and south Wales. Over the last 500&nbsp;million years the land which forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30°S, crossing the [[equator]] around 370&nbsp;million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.<ref><!--Goudie, ''The Environment of the British Isles, an Atlas''-->Ibid., p. 5.</ref>

The islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the [[Quaternary Period]], the most recent being the [[Devensian]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} As this ended, the central [[Irish Sea]] was de-glaciated and the [[English Channel]] flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form. Whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea.

The west coasts of Ireland and Scotland that directly face the Atlantic Ocean are generally characterised by long [[peninsulas]], and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are "smoother".

There are about [[List of the British Isles by area|136 permanently inhabited islands]] in the group, the largest two being Great Britain and Ireland.

==Flora and fauna==
{{See also|Fauna of Great Britain|Fauna of Ireland|Trees of Britain and Ireland}}

[[File:Irl-female red deer Killarney.jpg|thumb|right|Some female red deer in [[Killarney National Park]], Ireland.]]

The islands enjoy a mild climate and varied [[soils]], giving rise to a diverse pattern of [[vegetation]]. Animal and plant life in the archipelago is similar to that of the northwestern [[European continent]]. However, there are few numbers of [[species]] with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland, for example, is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. However, the only window during which this could occur was between the end of [[Pleistocene|the last Ice Age]] (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).

As with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of the mainland due to a small population and later development of trade and industry and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state [[Afforestation|forestation programmes]]. Almost all land outside of urban areas is [[Arable land|farmland]]. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England.  [[Oak]], [[elm]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[beech]] are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, [[pine]] and [[birch]] are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of [[grasses]] and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and [[marsh]]es host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].

Larger animals, such as [[wolf]], bear and [[reindeer]] are today extinct. However, some species such as [[red deer]] are protected. Other small mammals, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[fox]]es, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. [[Wild boar]]s have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently on the islands and another 200 migrate to them. Common types are the [[Common Chaffinch]], [[Common Blackbird]], [[House Sparrow]] and [[Common Starling]], all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[Red Grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes of the islands, in particular [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[perch]] and [[Esox|pike]]. [[Squalidae|Dogfish]], [[cod]], [[sole (fish)|sole]], [[pollock]] and [[Bass (fish)|bass]] are among the sea fish as well as [[mussels]], crab and [[oysters]] on the coastline. There are more than 21,000 species of insects found on the islands.

Neither Great Britain nor Ireland are inhabited by many [[reptiles]] or [[amphibians]]. Only three [[snakes]] are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];<ref>{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | date = | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate =17 August 2010 }}</ref> none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with [[weasels]], [[European Polecat|polecat]]s, [[wildcats]], most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], the [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and [[common toad]]s also being absent in Ireland. This patterns in true also for birds and insects. However, notable reversals of this theme include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of [[wood lice]], which are native to Ireland but not found on Great Britain.

Domestic animals native to the islands include the [[Connemara pony]], [[Shetland pony]], [[Irish wolfhound]] and several types of cattle and sheep.

[[Image:British Isles population density 2011 NUTS3.svg|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km² of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]].]]

The demographics of the British Isles today are characterised by a generally high density of population in England, which accounts for almost 80% of the total population of the islands. In elsewhere on Great Britain and on Ireland, high density of population is limited to areas around, or close to, a few large cities. The largest urban area by far is the [[Greater London Urban Area]] with 9 million inhabitants. Other major populations centres include [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] (2.4&nbsp;million), [[West Midlands conurbation]] (2.4&nbsp;million), [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] (1.6&nbsp;million) in England,<ref>http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/what-we-do/publication-scheme/published-ad-hoc-data/population/august-2012/mid-2010-urban-area-syoa-ests-england-and-wales.xls</ref> [[Greater Glasgow]] (1.2&nbsp;million) in Scotland <ref>[http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files2/stats/population-estimates/special-area/settlements-localities2010/2010-settlements-table2.pdf  Mid-2010 population estimates - Settlements in order of size] General Register Office for Scotland</ref> and  [[Greater Dublin Area]] (1.1&nbsp;million) in Ireland.<ref>http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf</ref>

The population of England rose rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries whereas the populations of Scotland and Wales have shown little increase during the 20th century, with the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951. Ireland for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area (about one third of the total population). However, since the [[Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine, which caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an [[Irish diaspora]] that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.

[[Image:British Isles Euler diagram 15.svg|thumb|250px|left|Euler diagram of various terms in the British Isles]]

There are two [[sovereign states]] in the isles: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called ''the Republic of Ireland'', governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming [[Northern Ireland]]. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply ''the United Kingdom'', which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, [[Jersey]] and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown Dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;<ref name="gov.je">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Counties of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and [[Northern Ireland]] in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have "[[Devolution|devolved]]" governments meaning that they have their own parliaments/assemblies and are self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For [[judicial]] purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.

Ireland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown Dependencies are all [[parliamentary democracies]], with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[Member of Parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups are required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state for all parts of the isles except for the Republic of Ireland, where the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].

Ireland and the United Kingdom are part of the European Union (EU). The Crown Dependencies are not a part of the European Union but have certain limited privileges and obligations that were negotiated as a part of the UK's accession to the EU.<ref name="gov.je"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union – Isle of Man Government – Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland area  part of the [[Schengen area]], that allow passport-free travel between EU members states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area had existed across the region. In 1997, this area required formal recognition during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union and is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].

Reciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens to full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the other states. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than that required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement arguing that, "the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries."<ref>Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, Ministry of Justice: London</ref>

The [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both and the Governments of [[Government of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Government of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] and the [[Government of Ireland]] also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland.

These arrangements were made following the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]]. Another body established under that agreement, the [[British-Irish Council]], is made up of the major political entities governing the islands. The [[British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body]] ({{lang-ga|Comhlacht Idir-Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na hÉireann}}) predates the British-Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislature. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).

The British-Irish Council does not have executive powers but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British-Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.<ref>[Communiqué of the British-Irish Council], February 2008</ref> Leading on from developments in the British-Irish Council, the chair of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary, [[Niall Blaney]], has suggested that the body should shadow the British-Irish Council's work.<ref>Martina Purdy, 28 February 2008 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7268911.stm Unionists urged to drop boycott], BBC: London</ref>

Many civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole. For example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[RNLI]], the life boats service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.<ref>[http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}, The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.</ref>

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
{{Main|History of the British Isles}}
At the end of the last [[Pleistocene|ice age]], what are now the British Isles were joined to [[Continental Europe|the European mainland]] as a mass of land extending north west from the modern-day northern coastline of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Ice covered almost all of what is now Ireland and Great Britain with the exception of most of modern-day [[Munster]] and much of what we now call England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from the mainland and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.

At the time of the [[Roman Empire]], about two thousand years ago, various tribes were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as [[Gaels|Hiberni]], the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as [[Picts]] and the southern two thirds by [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]. [[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|The Alfred Jewel (9th century)]][[Anglo-Saxons]] arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, having been [[Christianised]], traditionally by the Romano-Briton, [[Saint Patrick]]. As Europe, including Britain descended turmoil following in the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entering a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]], first to Great Britain and then to the continent, founding [[monasteries]] and [[universities]] and were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of the same nature.

[[Viking]] invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of [[Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the [[Channel Islands]] to this day.  A century later the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Dermot MacMurrough|a provincial king]] and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died the title of [[King of England]] and [[Lord of Ireland]] became entwined in one person.

By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England as from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as "the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.

[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|left|James VI of Scotland (James I of England)]]Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new class was Protestant and British the common people were, largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The "[[Glorious Revolution]]" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics.

The Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North American that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate however and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working class. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second-half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919–1922), with the six counties that formed [[Northern Ireland]] remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.

Irish newspapers are also available in the UK, and Irish state and private television is widely available in Northern Ireland.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Certain reality TV shows have embraced the whole of the islands, for example ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', seasons 3, 4 and 7 of which featured auditions in Dublin and were open to Irish voters, whilst the show previously known as ''Britain's Next Top Model'' became ''[[Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model]]'' in 2011. A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Man Booker Prize]] is awarded to authors from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.

Many globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including [[History of golf|golf]], [[History of association football|association football]], [[History of cricket|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and [[darts]], as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is [[association football]]. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the [[southern hemisphere]] rugby playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (Rugby Union)|Triple Crown]] as part of the [[Six Nations Championship]]. Also since 2001 the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the [[RaboDirect Pro12]].

The [[Ryder Cup]] in [[golf]] was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland. From 1979 onwards this was expanded to include the whole of Europe.
