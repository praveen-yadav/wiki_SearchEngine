'''Cape Town''' ({{lang-af|Kaapstad}} {{IPA-nl|ˈkɑːpstɐt|}}; {{lang-xh|iKapa}}) is the second-most populated city in [[South Africa]] after [[Johannesburg]],<ref name="S.Afr. CS 2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf |publisher=Statistics South Africa |title=Community Survey, 2007: Basic Results Municipalities |format=PDF |accessdate=23 March 2008}}</ref> and the provincial capital and [[primate city]] of the [[Western Cape]]. As the seat of the [[Parliament of South Africa|National Parliament]], it is also the legislative capital of the country. It forms part of the [[City of Cape Town]] [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]]. The city is famous for [[Port of Cape Town|its harbour]] as well as its natural setting in the [[Cape floral kingdom]], as well as for such well-known landmarks as [[Table Mountain]] and [[Cape Point]].

Located on the shore of [[Table Bay]], Cape Town was originally developed by the [[Dutch East India Company]] as a victualling (supply) station for Dutch ships sailing to [[East Africa]], [[India]], and the [[Far East]]. [[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s arrival on 6 April 1652 established the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town quickly outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the [[Castle of Good Hope]], becoming the economic and cultural hub of the [[Cape Colony]]. Until the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the development of Johannesburg, Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa. Today it is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, reflecting its role as a major destination for immigrants and [[expatriates]] to South Africa. {{As of|2011}} the metropolitan region had an estimated population of 3.74&nbsp;million.<ref name="census2011" /> The city was named the [[World Design Capital]] for 2014 by the [[International Council of Societies of Industrial Design]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cape Town Hosts Official WDC 2014 Signing Ceremony|url=http://www.worlddesigncapital.com/press-releases/cape-town-hosts-official-world-design-capital-2014-signing-ceremony/|publisher=World Design Capital|accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Cape Town}}
[[File:Charles Bell - Jan van Riebeeck se aankoms aan die Kaap.jpg|thumb|left|A painting of the arrival of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] in [[Table Bay]] (by [[Charles Davidson Bell|Charles Bell]])]]
The earliest known remnants in the region were found at Peers cave in [[Fish Hoek]] and date to between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Peers_Cave.html|title=The Antiquity of man|publisher=SouthAfrica.info}}</ref> Little is known of the history of the region's first residents, since there is no written history from the area before it was first mentioned by [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486. [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1497. In the late 16th century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English ships regularly stopped over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the [[Khoikhoi]] in exchange for fresh meat. In 1652, Jan van Riebeeck and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie}}, VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] (later replaced by the [[Castle of Good Hope]]). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the authorities to import slaves from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Many of these became ancestors of the first [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2009/05/01/coloured-people-of-the-western-cape-have-the-most-diverse-ancestry-in-the-world/ |title=Cape-Slavery-Heritage " Coloured People of the Western Cape have the most Diverse Ancestry in the World :: iBlog |publisher=Cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |title=Slavery and early colonisation , South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date=22 September 1927 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> Under Van Riebeeck and his successors as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, an impressive range of useful plants were introduced to the Cape – in the process changing the natural environment forever. Some of these, including grapes, cereals, ground nuts, potatoes, apples and citrus, had an important and lasting influence on the societies and economies of the region.<ref>Pooley, S. ‘Jan van Riebeeck as Pioneering Explorer and Conservator of Natural Resources at the Cape of Good Hope (1652–62),’  Environment and History 15 (2009): 3–33. {{doi|10.3197/096734009X404644}}</ref>

During the [[French Revolution]]ary and [[Napoleonic]] wars, the Netherlands was repeatedly occupied by France, and Great Britain moved to take control of Dutch colonies. Britain captured Cape Town in 1795, but the Cape was returned to the Netherlands by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the battle of [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]]. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Cape Town was permanently ceded to Britain. It became the capital of the newly formed [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s. With expansion, came calls for greater independence from Britain, with the Cape attaining [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|its own parliament]] in 1854, and a locally accountable Prime Minister in 1872. Suffrage was established according to the non-racial, but sexist [[Cape Qualified Franchise]].<ref>{{cite web

In 1910, Britain established the [[Union of South Africa]], which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British [[colony of Natal]]. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the [[Republic of South Africa]].

In the 1948 national elections, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] won on a platform of ''[[apartheid]]'' (racial segregation) under the slogan of "[[swart gevaar]]". This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the Cape's multiracial franchise, as well as to the [[Group Areas Act]], which classified all areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was [[District Six, Cape Town|District Six]]. After it was declared a whites-only region in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|title=Recalling District Six|date=19 August 2003}}</ref> Many of these residents were relocated to the [[Cape Flats]] and Lavender Hill. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a "[[Coloured]] labour preference area", to the exclusion of "[[Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantus]]", i.e. blacks.

Cape Town was home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. On [[Robben Island]], a former penitentiary island {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city, many famous political prisoners were held for years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, [[Nelson Mandela]] made his first public speech since his imprisonment,  from the balcony of [[Cape Town City Hall]] hours after being released on 11 February 1990. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|democratic election]], was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. Nobel Square in the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]] features statues of South Africa's four [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners: [[Albert Luthuli]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[F. W. de Klerk]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Since 1994, the city has struggled with problems such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], a surge in violent [[drug-related crime]] and more recent xenophobic violence.<!--, which has given the city a reputation for having one of the highest [[homicide]] rates in the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}--> At the same time, the economy has surged to unprecedented levels due to the boom in the tourism and the real estate industries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} With a [[Gini coefficient]] of 0.67, Cape Town has the highest rate of equality in South Africa.<ref>http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/cape-town-least-unequal-sa-city-1.1435199#.UjdA9KwazCR</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:CTfromTableMountain.jpg|thumb|left|740px|Cape Town's "city bowl" as viewed from Table Mountain]]
Cape Town is located at latitude 33.55° S (approx. the same as Sydney and Buenos Aires and equivalent to Casablanca and Los Angeles in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25° E. Table Mountain, with its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and with [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]] and [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop enclosing the central area of Cape Town, the so-called [[City Bowl]]. A thin strip of cloud, known colloquially as the "tablecloth", sometimes forms on top of the mountain. To the immediate south, the Cape Peninsula is a scenic mountainous spine jutting {{convert|40|km}} southwards into the Atlantic Ocean and terminating at Cape Point. There are over 70 peaks above {{Convert|1000|ft|m}} within Cape Town's official city limits. Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the Cape Flats, which extends over {{convert|50|km|-1}} to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Flats is situated on what is known as a rising marine plain, consisting mostly of sandy geology and confirming that at one point Table Mountain was itself an island.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.  The Cape Town region generally, with its Mediterranean climate, extensive coastline, rugged mountain ranges, coastal plains, inland valleys and semi-desert fringes, has much in common with Southern California.

=== Climate ===
Cape Town has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb''), with mild, moderately wet winters and dry, warm summers. Winter, which lasts from the beginning of June to the end of August, may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and strong north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of {{convert|18.0|C|0}} and minimum of {{convert|8.5|C|0}} <ref name="WMO">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm|title=World Weather Information Service – Cape Town |accessdate=4 May 2010 }}</ref>  Total annual rainfall in the city averages {{convert|515|mm|in|1}}. Summer, which lasts from early December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of {{convert|26.0|°C|0}} and minimum of {{convert|16.0|°C|0}}. The region can get uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning "mountain wind", blows from the [[Karoo]] interior for a couple of weeks in February or early March.  Late spring and early summer may sometimes feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the [[Cape Doctor]], so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a [[Pressure system#High-pressure system|high-pressure system]] which sits in the [[South Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]] to the west of Cape Town, known as the [[South Atlantic High]]. Cape Town's average amount of sunshine per year (3,100 hours) compares favourably with that of Los Angeles (3,300 hours) <ref name="la">{{cite web | url=http://www.los-angeles.climatemps.com/ | title=Los Angeles climate | publisher=climatemps.com | accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> and exceeds that of Athens and Madrid (2,900 hours).<ref name="madrid">{{cite web | url=http://www.madrid.climatemps.com/ | title=Madrid climate | publisher=climatemps.com | accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref>

Water temperatures range greatly, between {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic Seaboard, to {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} in False Bay. Average annual Ocean temperatures are between {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as [[San Francisco]] or [[Big Sur]]), and {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}} in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as [[Nice]] or [[Monte Carlo]]).

{{Main|Biodiversity of Cape Town}}
Located in a [[Conservation International|CI]] [[Biodiversity hotspot]] as well as the unique [[Cape Floristic Region]], the city of Cape Town has one of the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] of any equivalent area in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Pages/BrochuresBooklets.aspx |title=Brochures, booklets and posters |publisher=Capetown.gov.za |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> These protected areas are a [[World Heritage Site]], and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain - more than exist in the whole of the [[United Kingdom]] which has 1200 plant species and 67 endemic plant species.<ref>{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Unique Biodiversity Poster | url = http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiversity_poster-CT_Unique_Biodiv_SPECIES_2011-02.pdf | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 6 February 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Cape Town Tourism |url=http://www.capetown.travel/votefortablemountain/ |title=Vote for Table Mountain – Cape Town Tourism |publisher=Capetown.travel |date= |accessdate=2013-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafricaholiday.org.uk/places/p_western_cape.htm |title=Western Cape |publisher=Southafricaholiday.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-12}}</ref> Many of these species, including a great many types of [[protea]]s, are endemic to the mountain and can be found nowhere else.<ref>A.G. Rebelo, C. Boucher, N. Helme, L. Mucina, M.C. Rutherford et al. 2006. Fynbos Biome, in: L. Mucina & M.C. Rutherford (eds). ''The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.''</ref>

It is home to a total of 19 different [[phytochorion|vegetation types]], of which several are completely [[Endemism|endemic]] to the city and occur nowhere else in the world.<ref>http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/stats/Documents/Vegetation%20Types.mht</ref>
It is also the only habitat of hundreds of [[Endemism|endemic]] species,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_suppl_Endemic_spp_list_2010-03.pdf|title=Endemic Species of the city of Cape Town}}</ref> and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened. This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro-climates.

Table Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape [[Fynbos]]. The main vegetation type is endangered [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]],  but [[critically endangered]] [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Shale Renosterveld]] and [[Afromontane|Afromontane forest]] occur in smaller portions on the mountain.

Unfortunately, rapid [[population growth]] and [[Urbanisation|urban sprawl]] has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently Cape Town now has over 300 [[threatened]] plant species and 13 which are now [[extinct]]. The [[Cape Peninsula]], which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town, has the highest concentration of [[threatened species]] of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.<ref>http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf</ref>
Tiny remnants of [[critically endangered]] or [[Extinct|near extinct]] plants often survive on road sides, pavements and sports fields.<ref>[http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_8_threatened_species_2010-03.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>
The remaining ecosystems are partially protected through a system of over 30 [[List of nature reserves in Cape Town|nature reserves]] – including the massive [[Table Mountain National Park]].

== Suburbs ==
{{Main|List of Cape Town suburbs}}
Cape Town's urban geography is influenced by the contours of Table Mountain its surrounding peaks, the Durbanville Hills, and the expansive lowland region known as the Cape Flats. These geographic features in part divide the city into several commonly known groupings of suburbs (equivalent to districts outside South Africa), many of which developed historically together and share common attributes of language and culture.

=== City Bowl ===
[[File:City bowl.jpg|thumb|right|The City Bowl viewed from Lion's Head]]
{{Main|City Bowl}}
The City Bowl is a natural [[amphitheatre]]-shaped area bordered by Table Bay and defined by the mountains of [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]], [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]], Table Mountain and [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]].

The area includes the central business district of Cape Town, the harbour, the [[Company's Garden]], and the residential suburbs of [[De Waterkant, Cape Town|De Waterkant]], [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]], [[District Six]], [[Zonnebloem, Cape Town|Zonnebloem]], [[Gardens, Cape Town|Gardens]], [[Bo-Kaap]], [[Higgovale, Cape Town|Higgovale]], [[Oranjezicht, Cape Town|Oranjezicht]], [[Schotsche Kloof, Cape Town|Schotsche Kloof]], [[Tamboerskloof]], [[University Estate, Cape Town|University Estate]], [[Vredehoek, Cape Town|Vredehoek]], [[Walmer Estate, Cape Town|Walmer Estate]] and [[Woodstock, Cape Town|Woodstock]].

=== Southern Suburbs ===
{{Main|Southern Suburbs, Cape Town}}
The Southern Suburbs hug along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, southeast of the city centre. This area has mixed languages but is predominantly English-speaking, and includes, from north to south, [[Rondebosch]], [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]], [[Newlands, Cape Town|Newlands]], [[Mowbray]], [[Observatory]], [[Bishopscourt, Cape Town|Bishopscourt]], [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]], [[Wynberg, Cape Town|Wynberg]], [[Plumstead, Cape Town|Plumstead]], [[Ottery, Cape Town|Ottery]], and [[Bergvliet, Cape Town|Bergvliet]].

=== South Peninsula ===
[[File:Simonstown.jpg|thumb|right|The historical centre of Simon's Town]]
The South Peninsula is generally regarded as the area south of [[Muizenberg, Cape Town|Muizenberg]] on False Bay and [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] on the Atlantic Ocean, all the way to Cape Point. Until recently quite rural, the population of the area is growing quickly as new coastal developments proliferate and larger plots are subdivided to provide more compact housing.

=== Cape Flats ===
{{Main|Cape Flats}}
The Cape Flats is an expansive, low-lying, flat area situated to the southeast of the central business district of Cape Town. Described by some as 'Apartheid's dumping ground', from the 1950s the area became home to people the [[apartheid]] government designated as non-White. Race-based legislation such as the [[Group Areas Act]] and [[pass laws]] either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government-built townships in the Flats, or made living in the area illegal, forcing many people designated as [[Black people#South Africa|Black]] into informal settlements elsewhere in the Flats.

The Flats have since then been home to much of the population of Greater Cape Town, and most of the residents in the area are of African descent. This area includes the neighbourhoods of [[Mitchell's Plain]], [[Gugulethu]], [[Nyanga, Cape Town|Nyanga]], [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]], and [[Khayelitsha]].

== Government ==
[[File:CapeTownCityHall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cape Town City Hall]].]]
{{Main|City of Cape Town}}
Cape Town's local government is the City of Cape Town, which is a [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]]. Cape Town is governed by a 221-member [[city council]]. The city is divided into 111 electoral wards; each ward directly elects one member of the council, whilst the other 110 councillors are elected by a system of [[party-list proportional representation]]. The [[Mayor of Cape Town|Executive Mayor]] and Executive Deputy Mayor are chosen by the city council.

In the [[South African municipal election, 2011|local government elections of 18 May 2011]], the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) won an outright majority, taking 135 of the 221 council seats. The [[African National Congress]], the national ruling party, received 73 seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/197/Seat%20Calculation%20Detail/WP/CPT.pdf |title=Seat Calculation Detail: City of Cape Town |publisher=Independent Electoral Commission |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref> As a result of this victory [[Patricia de Lille]], the DA mayoral candidate, was inaugurated as Executive Mayor on 1 June.

[[File:Cape Town International Convention Centre.jpg|thumb|right|The main entrance to the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]]]]
Cape Town is the economic hub of the Western Cape Province, South Africa's second main economic centre and Africa's third main economic hub city. It serves as the regional manufacturing centre in the Western Cape. It also has the primary harbour and airport in the province. The large government presence in the city – both as the capital of the Western Cape and the seat of the [[Parliament of South Africa|National Parliament]] – has led to increased revenue and growth in industries that serve the government. Cape Town hosts many [[meeting|conferences]], particularly in the recently expanded [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]], which opened in June 2003 and is due for another expansion within the next year.{{when|date=April 2013}}{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Cape Town has recently enjoyed a booming real estate and construction market, because of the 2010 World Cup as well as many people buying summer homes in the city or relocating there permanently. Cape Town hosted 9 World Cup matches: Six 1st round matches, one second round, one quarter final and a semifinal. The central business district is under an extensive urban renewal programme, with numerous new buildings and renovations taking place under the guidance of the [[Cape Town Partnership]].<ref>[http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/econrep.asp ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Cape Town has four major commercial nodes, with Cape Town Central Business District containing the majority of job opportunities and office space. [[Century City (Cape Town)|Century City]], the [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]]/TygerValley strip and [[Claremont, Cape Town|Claremont]] commercial nodes are well established and contain many offices and corporate headquarters as well. Most companies headquartered in the city are insurance companies, retail groups, publishers, design houses, fashion designers, shipping companies, petrochemical companies, architects and advertising agencies. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Much of the produce is handled through the Port of Cape Town or [[Cape Town International Airport]]. Most major shipbuilding companies have offices and manufacturing locations in Cape Town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafricanboatbuilders.co.za|title=South African Boatbuilders Business Council}}</ref> The Province is also a centre of energy development for the country, with the existing [[Koeberg nuclear power station]] providing energy for the Western Cape's needs.

The Western Cape is an important tourist region in South Africa; the tourism industry accounts for 9.8% of the GDP of the province and employs 9.6% of the province's workforce. In 2010, over 1.5&nbsp;million international tourists visited the area.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.capetownroutesunlimited.org/ctru/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=18219|publisher=Cape Town Routes Unlimited|title=Annual Report 2010|isbn=0-621-35496-1|format=PDF}}</ref>

With the highest number of successful Information Technology companies in Africa, Cape Town is an important centre for the industry on the continent. Growing at an annual rate of 8.5% and an estimated worth of R77&nbsp;billion in 2010 nationwide the IT industry in Cape Town is becoming increasingly important to the city's economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/eng/pubs/news/2007/mar/154622|title=Cape Town Leads In Information Technology|date=27 March 2007}}</ref>

The city was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in South Africa, with the percentage of Capetonians pursuing business opportunities almost three times higher than the national average. Those aged between 18–64 were 190% more likely to pursue new business, whilst in Johannesburg, the same demographic group was only 60% more likely than the national average to pursue a new business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&ArticleID=1518-1786_2389511 |title=Cape Town breeds entrepreneurs: Fin24: Business |publisher=Fin24 |date=7 September 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

== Tourism ==
Cape Town is not only the most popular international tourist destination in South Africa, but Africa as a whole. This is due to its good climate, natural setting, and well-developed infrastructure. The city has several well-known natural features that attract tourists, most notably Table Mountain,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecape.org/|title=Table Mountain Aerial Cableway}}</ref> which forms a large part of the [[Table Mountain National Park]] and is the back end of the [[City Bowl, Cape Town|City Bowl]]. Reaching the top of the mountain can be achieved either by hiking up, or by taking the [[Table Mountain Cableway]]. [[Cape Point]] is recognised as the dramatic headland at the end of the [[Cape Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capepoint.co.za |title=Cape Point |publisher=Cape Point |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> Many tourists also drive along [[Chapman's Peak|Chapman's Peak Drive]], a narrow road that links [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]] with [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], for the views of the Atlantic Ocean and nearby mountains. It is possible to either drive or hike up [[Signal Hill (Cape Town)|Signal Hill]] for closer views of the City Bowl and Table Mountain.<ref>http://www.nbi.ac.za/frames/kirstfram.htm</ref>

Many tourists also visit [[List of beaches of Cape Town|Cape Town's beaches]], which are popular with local residents.<ref name="'CTbeaches'">{{cite web|url=http://www.safarinow.com/cms/cape-town-beaches/irie.aspx |title=Beaches, Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Safarinow.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> Due to the city's unique geography, it is possible to visit several different beaches in the same day, each with a different setting and atmosphere. Though the Cape's water ranges from cold to mild, the difference between the two sides of the city is dramatic. While the Atlantic Seaboard averages annual water temperatures barely above that of coastal California around {{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, the False Bay coast is very much warmer, averaging between {{convert|16|and|17|C|F}} annually. This is similar to water temperatures in much of the Northern [[Mediterranean]] (for example [[Nice]]). In summer, False Bay water averages slightly over {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} a common high. Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have very cold water due to the [[Benguela current]] which originates from the [[Southern Ocean]], whilst the water at [[False Bay]] beaches may be warmer by up to {{convert|10|C-change|0}} at the same moment due to the influence of the warm [[Agulhas Current|Agulhas current]], and the surface warming effects of the South Easter wind.<ref name="'CTbeaches'"/>

Both coasts are equally popular, although the beaches in affluent [[Clifton, Cape Town|Clifton]] and elsewhere on the Atlantic Coast are better developed with restaurants and cafés, with a strip of restaurants and bars accessible to the beach at [[Camps Bay]]. [[Boulders Beach]] near Simon's Town is known for its colony of [[African Penguin]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simonstown.com/tourism/penguins/penguins.htm|title=The African Penguin}}</ref> [[Surfing]] is popular and the city hosts the [[Red Bull Big Wave Africa]] surfing competition every year.

The city has several notable cultural attractions. The [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]], built on top of part of the [[dock (maritime)|docks]] of the Port of Cape Town, is the city's most visited tourist attraction. It is also one of the city's most popular shopping venues, with several hundred shops and the [[Two Oceans Aquarium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfront.co.za/ |title=V&A Waterfront |publisher=Waterfront.co.za |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ingrid Sinclair |url=http://www.aquarium.co.za |title=Two Oceans Aquarium Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Aquarium.co.za |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> The V&A also hosts the Nelson Mandela Gateway, through which [[ferry|ferries]] depart for [[Robben Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robben-island.org.za |title=Robben Island Museum |publisher=Robben-island.org.za |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> It is possible to take a ferry from the V&A to [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]], [[Simon's Town, Cape Town|Simon's Town]] and the [[Cape Fur Seal]] colonies on Seal and Duiker Islands. Several companies offer tours of the [[Cape Flats]], a mostly Coloured [[Township (South Africa)|township]], and [[Khayelitsha]], a mostly black township.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/todonight/Western-Cape/Townships/Township-BaBs-Discover-what-true-African-hospitality-is-all-about~11|title=Township stays}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

Cape Town is noted for its architectural heritage, with the highest density of [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch]] style buildings in the world. Cape Dutch style, which combines the architectural traditions of the Netherlands, Germany, France and Indonesia, is most visible in [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]], the old government buildings in the Central Business District, and along [[Long Street (Cape Town)|Long Street]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encounter.co.za/article/19.html|title=Cape Dutch Architecture|publisher=Encounter South Africa}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last1 = Dewar| first1 = David| last2 = Hutton-Squire| first2 = Martin| last3 = Levy| first3 = Caren| last4 = Menidis| first4 = Philip| last5 = Uytenbogaardt| first5 = Roelof| title = A Comparative Evaluation of Urbanism in Cape Town| year = 1977| publisher = University of Cape Town Press| isbn = 0-620-02535-2| pages = 20–98 }}</ref> The annual [[Coon Carnival|Cape Town Minstrel Carnival]], also known by its Afrikaans name of ''Kaapse Klopse'', is a large [[minstrel]] festival held annually on 2 January or ''"Tweede Nuwe Jaar"'' (Afrikaans: Second New Year).

The [[Artscape Theatre Centre]] is the main performing arts venue in Cape Town.

The city also encloses the 36 hectare [[Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden]] that contains protected natural forest and [[fynbos]] along with a variety of animals and birds. There are over 7,000 species in cultivation at Kirstenbosch, including many rare and threatened species of the [[Cape Floristic Region]]. In 2004 this Region, including Kirstenbosch, was declared a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanbi.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&Itemid=57&id=139 |title=Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden |publisher=Sanbi.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>

Cape Town's transport system links it to the rest of South Africa; it serves as the gateway to other destinations within the province. The [[Cape Winelands]] and in particular the towns of [[Stellenbosch, Western Cape|Stellenbosch]], [[Paarl, Western Cape|Paarl]] and [[Franschhoek, Western Cape|Franschhoek]] are popular day trips from the city for sightseeing and [[wine tasting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismcapewinelands.co.za/|title=Cape Winelands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winelands.co.za|title=The Western Cape wine lands}}</ref> [[Whale watching]] is popular amongst tourists: [[Southern Right Whale]]s and [[Humpback Whale]]s are seen off the coast during the breeding season (August to November) and [[Bryde's Whale]]s and [[Killer whale|Killer Whale]] can be seen any time of the year.<ref name="'CTwhale'">{{cite web|url=http://www.afton.co.za/whale-watching.htm|title=Cape Town Whale Watching|publisher=Afton Grove}}</ref> The nearby town of [[Hermanus]] is known for its Whale Festival, but whales can also be seen in False Bay.<ref name="'CTwhale'">{{cite web|url=http://www.afton.co.za/whale-watching.htm|title=Cape Town Whale Watching|publisher=Afton Grove}}</ref> [[Heaviside's Dolphin|Heaviside's dolphins]] are endemic to the area and can be seen from the coast north of Cape Town; [[Dusky Dolphin|Dusky dolphins]] live along the same coast and can occasionally be seen from the ferry to Robben Island.<ref name="'CTwhale'"/>

The only complete windmill in South Africa is [[Mostert's Mill]], [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]]. It was built in 1796 and restored in 1935 and again in 1995.

Cape Town's most popular sports by participation are [[cricket]], association football, swimming, and [[rugby union]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Woulidge| first = Sam| title = Time Out: Cape Town| year = 2006| publisher = Time Out Publishing| isbn = 1-904978-12-6| pages = 127–130: Sports }}</ref> In rugby union, Cape Town is the home of the [[Western Province (rugby)|Western Province]] side, who play at [[Newlands Stadium]] and compete in the [[Currie Cup]]. In addition, Western Province players (along with some from Wellington's [[Boland Cavaliers]]) comprise the [[Stormers]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]'s [[Super Rugby]] competition. Cape Town also regularly hosts the national team, the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], and hosted matches during the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], including the opening ceremony and game, as well as the [[All Blacks]] versus England semi-final that saw [[Jonah Lomu]] run in four tries.

Association football, which is better known as ''soccer'' in South Africa, is also popular. Two [[Football club|clubs]] from Cape Town play in the [[Premier Soccer League]] (PSL), South Africa's premier league. These teams are [[Ajax Cape Town]], which formed as a result of the 1999 amalgamation of the [[Seven Stars (South African Soccer Club)|Seven Stars]] and the [[Cape Town Spurs]] and newly promoted [[Chippa United]]. Cape Town was also the location of several of the matches of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA 2010 World Cup]] including a semi-final,<ref name="southafrica.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/2010/2010-faq.htm|title=SA 2010: frequent questions|publisher=southafrica.info|accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref> held in South Africa. The Mother City built a new 70,000 seat stadium ([[Cape Town Stadium]]) in the Green Point area.

In cricket, the [[Cape Cobras]] represent Cape Town at the [[Newlands Cricket Ground]]. The team is the result of an amalgamation of the [[Western Province Cricket]] and [[Boland Cricket]] teams. They take part in the [[Supersport Series|Supersport]] and [[Standard Bank Cup Series]]. The Newlands Cricket Ground regularly hosts international matches.

Cape Town has Olympic aspirations: in 1996, Cape Town was one of the five candidate cities shortlisted by the [[IOC]] to launch official candidatures to host the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. Although the games ultimately went to [[Athens]], Cape Town came in third place. There has been some speculation that Cape Town is seeking the South African Olympic Committee's nomination to be South Africa's bid city for the [[2020 Summer Olympic Games]].<ref>[http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=5&id=1049905279 South Africa Announces Bid For 2020 Summer Olympic Games], Gamesbids.com</ref>

=== Sports events ===
{{Further|List of sports events in Cape Town}}
The city of Cape Town has vast experience in hosting major national and international sports events.

The [[Cape Argus Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour]] is the world's largest individually timed cycle race{{spaced ndash}}and the first event outside Europe to be included in the International Cycling Union's Golden Bike Series. It sees over 35,000 cyclists tackling a {{convert|109|km|0|abbr=on}} route around Cape Town. The [[Absa Cape Epic]] is the largest full-service mountain bike stage race in the world.

Some notable events hosted by Cape Town have included the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and World Championships in various sports such as athletics, fencing, weightlifting, hockey, cycling, canoeing, gymnastics and others.

Cape Town was also a host city to the 2010 FIFA World Cup from 11 June to 11 July 2010, further enhancing its profile as a major events city. It was also one of the host cities of the [[2009 Indian Premier League]] cricket tournament.

== Education ==
Public primary and secondary schools in Cape Town are run by the [[Western Cape Education Department]]. This provincial department is divided into seven districts; four of these are "Metropole" districts{{spaced ndash}}Metropole Central, North, South, and East{{spaced ndash}}which cover various areas of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wced.wcape.gov.za/operations/emdc_links.html |title=Education Management and Development Centres (EMDCs) |accessdate=10 April 2008 |publisher=Western Cape Education Department |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409162520/http://wced.wcape.gov.za/operations/emdc_links.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 9 April 2008}}</ref> There are also many private schools, both religious and secular, in Cape Town.

=== Tertiary education ===
[[File:UCT Upper Campus landscape view.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[University of Cape Town]]'s main campus]]
Cape Town has a well-developed higher system of [[public university|public universities]]. Cape Town is served by three public universities: the [[University of Cape Town]] (UCT), the [[University of the Western Cape]] (UWC) and the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]] (CPUT). [[Stellenbosch University]], while not in the city itself, is 50-kilometres from the City Bowl and has additional campuses, such as the Tygerberg Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Bellville Business Park closer to the City.

Both the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University are leading universities in South Africa. This is due in large part to substantial financial contributions made to these institutions by both the public and private sector. UCT is an English-speaking institution. It has over 21,000 students and has an MBA programme that is ranked 51st by the Financial Times in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/econstats/pdf/compete.zip|title=Competitiveness factors|publisher=City of Cape Town}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> It is also the top-ranked university in Africa, being the only African university to make the world's Top 200 university list at number 146.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university/98/university-of-cape-town |title=University of cape town |publisher=Top Universities |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref> Since the [[African National Congress]] has come into governmental power, some restructuring of Western Cape universities has taken place and as such, traditionally non-white universities have seen increased financing, which has benefitted the University of the Western Cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetown.at/heritage/society/index.htm|title=Cape Town Society|publisher=CapeConnected}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/1998/01/20/PAGE7.HTM|title=Education Cosas critical of education funding|publisher=Dispatch Online}}</ref>

The public Cape Peninsula University of Technology was formed on 1 January 2005, when two separate institutions – [[Cape Technikon]] and [[Peninsula Technikon]] – were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English, although one may take courses in any of South Africa's official languages. The institution generally awards the [[National Diploma (South Africa)|National Diploma]].

Cape Town has also become a popular [[Study abroad in the United States|study abroad]] destination for many American college students. Many [[study abroad organization|study abroad providers]], such as [[Institute for the International Education of Students|IES Abroad]], offer semester, summer, short-term, and internship programs in partnership with Cape Town universities as a chance for American students to gain intercultural understanding.

== Transport ==

;Air
[[Cape Town International Airport]] serves both domestic and international flights. It is the second-largest airport in South Africa and serves as a major gateway for travellers to the Cape region. Cape Town has direct flights to most cities in South Africa as well as a number of international destinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/plan_trip/travel_tips/arriving/ctairport.htm|title=Cape Town International Airport|publisher=SouthAfrica.info}}</ref>

Cape Town International Airport recently opened a brand new central terminal building that was developed to handle an expected increase in air traffic as tourism numbers will increase in the lead-up to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.co.za/1998/05/17/news/cape/nct01.htm|work=Sunday Times |location=UK |title=R150-million upgrade kicks off one of the biggest developments in Cape Town's history|date=17 May 1998|first=Bobby|last=Jordan}}</ref> Other renovations include several large new parking garages, a revamped domestic departure terminal, a new Bus Rapid Transit system station and a new double-decker road system. The airport's cargo facilities are also being expanded and several large empty lots are being developed into [[office|office space]] and hotels.

The Cape Town International Airport was among the winners of the [[World Travel Awards]] for being Africa's leading airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctru.co.za/C3/CapeTownInternationalAirportamongtheWorld.pdf|title=Cape Town International Airport|publisher=Cape Town Routes Unlimited|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

;Sea
Cape Town has a long tradition as a port city. The Port of Cape Town, the city's main port, is in Table Bay directly to the north of the central business district. The port is a hub for ships in the southern Atlantic: it is located along one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world. It is also a busy container port, second in South Africa only to [[Durban]]. In 2004, it handled 3,161 ships and 9.2&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ports.co.za/port-operations.php|publisher=South African Port Operations|title=Introducing SAPO}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

[[Simon's Town, Cape Town|Simon's Town Harbour]] on the False Bay coast of the Cape Peninsula is the main base of the [[South African Navy]].

The Port of Cape Town (specifically the [[V&A Waterfront]]) made headlines worldwide during 2009 when plans to berth the iconic liner [[QE2]] were announced.

;Rail
The ''[[Shosholoza Meyl]]'' is the passenger rail operations of [[Spoornet]] and operates two long-distance passenger rail services from Cape Town: a daily service to and from Johannesburg via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] and a weekly service to and from Durban via [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]], [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]]. These trains terminate at [[Cape Town railway station]] and make a brief stop at [[Bellville railway station|Bellville]]. Cape Town is also one terminus of the luxury tourist-oriented [[Blue Train (South Africa)|Blue Train]] as well as the five-star [[Rovos Rail]].

[[Metrorail (Western Cape)|Metrorail]] operates a [[commuter rail]] service in Cape Town and the surrounding area. The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.

;Road
Three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]] start in Cape Town: the [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] which links Cape Town with [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Zimbabwe]]; the [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] which links Cape Town with [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]; and the [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] which links Cape Town with the [[Northern Cape Province]] and [[Namibia]]. The N1 and N2 both start in the Central Business District, and split to the east of the CBD, with the N1 continuing to the north east and the N2 heading south east past Cape Town International Airport. The N7 starts in [[Mitchells Plain]] and runs north, intersecting with the N1 and the N2 before leaving the city.

Cape Town also has a system of freeway and [[dual carriageway]] M-roads, which connect different parts of the city. The [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. The [[R300 (Western Cape)|R300]], which is informally known as the ''Cape Flats Freeway'', links [[Mitchells Plain]] with [[Bellville, South Africa|Bellville]], the N1 and the N2.

;Buses
[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services throughout the Cape Town metropolitan area. Several companies run long-distance bus services from Cape Town to the other cities in South Africa.

;Integrated Rapid Transit

Cape Town has embarked on Phase 1 of the IRT system with a total investment of close to R5&nbsp;billion.
Phase 1 will include a West Coast Service, Inner City Service and Airport Link. A 2010 Starter service to meet the requirements for the FIFA World Cup will include an Inner City Service, Stadium Shuttle and Airport Service. A total of 43 IRT Volvo buses have been ordered and are expected to be delivered during April and May.

;Taxis
Cape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.

Cape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and Victoria and Alfred Waterfront. There are about a thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.

Minibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8|publisher=CapeTown.org|title=Transport}}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy. These taxis make frequent unscheduled stops to pick up passengers, which can cause accidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1566/is_200209/ai_n7215423|title=South Africa's minibus wars: uncontrollable law-defying minibuses oust buses and trains from transit|publisher=LookSmart}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c2es.org/global-warming-in-depth/all_reports/transportation_in_south_africa/trans_sa_execsumm.cfm|title=Transportation in Developing Countries: Greenhouse Gas Scenarios for South Africa|publisher=Center for Climate and Energy Solutions}}</ref> With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often filled over their legal passenger allowance, making for high casualty rates when minibuses are involved in accidents. Minibuses are generally owned and operated in fleets, and inter-operator violence flares up from time to time, especially as [[Taxi wars in South Africa|turf wars]] occur over lucrative taxi routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enterpriseafrica.org/repository/docLib/20060427_MC_GPI_EATaxi_060323.pdf|format=PDF|title=Taxing Alternatives: Poverty Alleviation and the South African Taxi/Minibus Industry|publisher=Enterprise Africa!
