==Etymology and origins==
{{Further|Chrism|Christian (word)}}
{{see also|Holy Name of Jesus}}

The word ''Christ'' (or similar spellings) appears in English and most European [[languages|language]]s. It is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''Christós'' (transcribed in Latin as ''Christus'') in the [[New Testament]] as a [[description]] for Jesus. Christ is now often used as if it were a name, one part of the name "Jesus Christ", but is actually a title (the Messiah). Its usage in "Christ Jesus" emphasizes its nature as a title.<ref name=Miriam >{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |first=Wendy |last=Doniger |year=2000 |isbn=0-87779-044-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA212#v=onepage&q=%22Christ%20Jesus%22&f=false |page=212}}</ref><ref name=Pannenberg>{{cite book|title=Jesus God and Man |first=Wolfhart |last=Pannenberg |year=1968 |isbn=0-664-24468-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zWfvlpURwiIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q=%22the%20Christ%20of%20God%22&f=false |pages=30–31}}</ref>

In the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the word Christ was used to translate into Greek the [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] ''mashiach'' (messiah), meaning "anointed."<ref>{{cite book|title=Jesus of history, Christ of faith |first=Thomas |last=Zanzig |year=2000 |isbn=0-88489-530-0 |page=314}}</ref><ref name="nfcnqq">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=messiah |title=Etymology Online: ''messiah'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> ''Christós'' in classical [[Ancient Greek|Greek usage]] could mean ''covered in oil'', or anointed, and is thus a literal translation of [[messiah]].

The spelling ''Christ'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] [[Genitive]]: {{lang|grc|τοῦ Χριστοῦ}}, ''toú Christoú,''; [[Nominative]]: {{lang|grc|ὁ Χριστὸς}}, ''ho Christós'') in English was [[standardization|standardized]] in the 18th century, when, in the spirit of [[age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]], the spelling of certain words was changed to fit their [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] origins. Prior to this, in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]], the word was usually spelled ''Crist'' the ''i'' being pronounced either as {{IPAc-en|iː}}, preserved in the names of churches such as [[St Katherine Cree]], or as a short {{IPAc-en|ɪ}}, preserved in the modern pronunciation of Christmas. The spelling "Christ" is attested from the 14th century.<ref>{{OED|Christ}}</ref>

In modern and ancient usage, even within secular terminology, Christ usually refers to Jesus, building on the centuries old tradition of such use. 
Since the [[Apostolic Age]], the use of the definite article before the word Christ and its development into a proper name signifies its identification with Jesus as the promised Jewish messiah.<ref name=CathencChrist>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ}}</ref>

==Background and New Testament references==
[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|130px|First page of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century): "''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''".]]

At the time of Jesus, there was no single form of [[Second Temple Judaism]], and there were significant political, social and religious differences among the Jews.<ref name=Ekstrand147 >{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=1-60477-929-2 |pages=147–150}}</ref> However, for centuries the Jews had used the term ''moshiach'' ("anointed") to refer to their expected deliverer.<ref name= CathencChrist /> A large number of Old Testament passages were regarded as [[Messiah|messianic]] by the Jews, many more than are commonly considered messianic by Christians, and different groups of Jews assigned varying degrees of significance to them.<ref name=Ekstrand147 />

The Greek word ''messias'' appears only twice in the [[Septuagint]] of the promised prince ({{Bibleref2|Daniel|9:26}}; {{Bibleref2|Psalm|2:2}}). When a name was wanted for the promised one who was to be at once King and Savior, this title was used.<ref name= CathencMessiah >{{CathEncy|wstitle=Messiah}}</ref><ref name=Kasper >{{cite book|title=Jesus the Christ |first=Walter |last=Kasper |year=1976 |isbn=0-8091-2081-X |pages=104–105}}</ref> The [[New Testament]] states that the Messiah, long awaited, had come and describes this savior as "the Christ". In {{bibleref|Matt|16:16}} the apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<ref name=Ekstrand147 />

{{bibleref2|Mark|1:1|KJV}} ("The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God") identifies Jesus as both Christ and the [[Son of God]]. The divinity is re-affirmed in {{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|KJV}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=288}}</ref> Thereafter, Mark never applies Christ to Jesus as a name. {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:1}} uses Christ as a name and {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:16}} explains it again with: "Jesus, who is called Christ". In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus referred to himself as the Son of God far more frequently than in the [[Synoptic Gospel]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |pages=363-363}}</ref>

The use of the definite article before the word "Christ" and its gradual development into a proper name show the Christians identified the bearer with the promised Messiah of the Jews who fulfilled all the Messianic predictions in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the [[rabbis]].<ref name= CathencChrist />

While the Gospels of Mark and Matthew begin by calling Jesus both Christ and the Son of God, these are two distinct attributions. They develop in the New Testament along separate paths and have distinct theological implications. The development of both titles involves "the precursor", [[John the Baptist]]. At the time in [[Roman Judaea]] the Jews had been awaiting the "messiah". And many people were wondering who it would be. When John the Baptist appeared and began preaching, he attracted disciples who assumed he would be announced as the Messiah, or "the one" they had been awaiting. But the title Son of God was not attributed to John.

The first instance of his being called the Son of God appears during [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]] by John the Baptist. In the narrative, a voice from heaven called Jesus "My Son". In the [[Messengers from John the Baptist]] episode, in {{bibleref2|Matthew|11:2-6|NIV;KJV}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|7:18-23|NIV;KJV}},<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gospel of Matthew |first=Rudolf |last=Schnackenburg |authorlink=Rudolf Schnackenburg |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4438-3 |page=104}}</ref> when [[John the Baptist]] was in prison two of his disciples asked Jesus a question on his behalf: "Are you the one to come after me or shall we wait for another?"<ref name=mercer459>{{cite book|title=Mercer dictionary of the Bible |first1=Watson E. |last1=Mills |first2=Roger Aubrey |last2=Bullard |year=1998 |isbn=0-86554-373-9 |page=459}}</ref> indicating that John doubted the identity of Jesus as Christ at that time, see also [[Rejection of Jesus]].

In {{bibleref2|John|11:27|NIV;KJV}} Martha told Jesus "you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world", signifying that both titles were generally accepted (yet considered distinct) among the followers of Jesus before the [[Raising of Lazarus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=1-60477-929-2 |page=81}}</ref>

Explicit claims of Jesus being the Messiah are found in the Canonical Gospels in the [[Confession of Peter]] (e.g. {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16|9}}) and the words of Jesus before his judges in the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]].<ref name= CathencMessiah /><ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|16:13-20}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|8:27-30|9}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|9:18-20|9}}</ref> These incidents involve far more than a mere claim to the Messiahship; taken in their setting, they constitute a claim to be the Son of God.<ref name= CathencMessiah />

In the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin and [[Pilate]], it might appear from the narratives of Matthew and Luke that Jesus at first refused a direct reply to the high priest's question: "Art thou the Christ?" Although his answer is given merely as ''su eipas'' (thou hast said it), the Gospel of Mark states the answer as ''ego eimi'' (I am) and there are instances from Jewish literature in which the expression, "thou hast said it", is equivalent to "you are right".<ref name= CathencMessiah /> The Messianic claim was less significant than the claim to divinity which caused the high priest's horrified accusation of [[blasphemy]] and the subsequent call for the death sentence. Before Pilate on the other hand it was merely the assertion of his royal dignity which gave ground for his condemnation.<ref name= CathencMessiah />

In the [[Pauline Epistles]] the word Christ is so closely associated with Jesus that it is apparent that for the [[Early Christians]] there is no need to claim that Jesus is Christ, for that is considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul can use the term ''Christos'' with no confusion as to who it refers to, and as in {{bibleref2|1Corinthians|4:15|NIV;KJV}} and {{bibleref2|Romans|12:5|NIV;KJV}} he can use expressions such as "in Christ" to refer to the followers of Jesus.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=99}}</ref> Paul proclaimed him as the new Adam, who restored through obedience what Adam lost through disobedience.<ref name=Rahner731 >{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of theology: A concise Sacramentum mundi |first=Karl |last=Rahner |authorlink=Karl Rahner |year=2004 |isbn=0-86012-006-6 |pages=730–739}}</ref> The Pauline epistles are a source of some key Christological connections, e.g. {{bibleref2|Ephesians|3:17-19|9}} relates the [[love of Christ]] to the [[knowledge of Christ]], and considers the love of Christ as a necessity for knowing him.<ref name=WBarc152>{{cite book|title=The letters to the Galatians and Ephesians |first=William |last=Barclay |year=2002 |isbn=0-664-22559-4 |pages=152–153}}</ref>

There are also implicit claims to being the Christ in the words and actions of Jesus.<ref name= CathencMessiah /> Episodes in the life of Jesus and statements about what he accomplished during his public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]]. Although the Bible never says "Jesus is God", trinity based theology summarily claims: "Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man in one person, and will be so forever."<ref name="Grudem">{{cite book|last=Grudem |first=Wayne A. |title=Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine |publisher=Zondervan |year=1994 |isbn=0-310-28670-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2DUPWk9ng3wC&lpg=PP1&dq=isbn%3A0310286700&pg=PA529#v=onepage&q=%22fully%20God%22%20%22fully%20man%22&f=false |chapter=The Person Of Christ |page=529}}</ref>

==Pre-existence, Incarnation and Nativity==
{{see also|Pre-existence of Christ|Logos (Christianity)|Nativity of Jesus}}
[[File:Sainte-marie Madeleine2.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Anointing of Jesus]], c. 1450.]]
There are distinct, and differing, views among Christians regarding the existence of Christ before his conception. A key passage in the New Testament is {{bibleverse||John|1:1-18|NIV}} where John 1:17 specifically mentions that "grace and truth came through Jesus Christ." Those who believe in the [[Trinity]], consider Christ a pre-existent divine [[Hypostatic union|hypostasis]] called the [[Logos]] or the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word]]. Other, non-Trinitarian views, question the aspect of personal pre-existence or question the aspect of divinity, or both.

The concept of Christ as [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] derives from {{bibleverse||John|1:1|NIV}}: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." In the original Greek, ''[[Logos]]'' (λόγος) is used for "Word," and is often used untranslated. In the [[Christology]] of the Logos, Christ is viewed as the Incarnation of the "Divine Logos", i.e. The Word.<ref>{{cite book|title=A theology primer |first=Robert C. |last=Neville |year=1991 |isbn=0-7914-0849-3 |page=141}}</ref>

In the 2nd century, with his theory of "recapitulation", [[Irenaeus]] connected "Christ the Creator" with "Christ the Savior", relying on {{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:10|NIV}} ("when the times reach their fulfillment – to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ") to gather together and ''wrap up'' the cycle of the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ.<ref>{{cite book|title=Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era |first=Lisa D. |last=Maugans Driver |year=2009 |isbn=0-664-22897-6 |page=134}}</ref>

In the 2nd century, [[Irenaeus]] expressed his views of salvation in terms of the imitation of Christ and his theory of "recapitulation". For Irenaeus the imitation of Christ is based on God's plan of salvation, which involved Christ as the second Adam. He viewed the incarnation as the way in which Christ repaired the damage done by Adam's disobedience. For Irenaeus, salvation was achieved by Christ restoring humanity to the image of God, and he saw the Christian imitation of Christ as a key component on the path to salvation.<ref name=McKim >{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |page=80}}</ref> For Irenaeus Christ succeeded on every point on which Adam failed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Christ at the Center: The Early Christian Era |first=Maugans |last=Driver|year=2009 |isbn=0664228976  |page=134}}</ref> Irenaeus drew a number of parallels, e.g. just as in the fall of Adam resulted from the fruit of a tree, Irenaeus saw redemption and salvation as the fruit of another tree: the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|cross of crucifixion]].<ref name=McKim />

Following in the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline tradition]], in the 5th century [[Augustine of Hippo]] viewed Christ as the mediator of the [[New Covenant]] between God and man and as the conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God after the fall of Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |pages=85–86}}</ref> Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.<ref>{{cite book|title=An introduction to the theology of religions|first=Veli-Matti |last=Kärkkäinen |year=2003 |isbn=0-8308-2572-X |page=66}}</ref>

[[Martin Luther]] distinguished the history of salvation [[Law and Gospel|between the Old and the New Testament]], and saw a new dimension to salvation with the arrival of Christ.<ref>{{cite book|title=Systematic Theology, Volume 3 |first=Wolfhart |last=Pannenberg |year=2004 |isbn=0-567-08068-4 |page=84}}</ref>

The focus on human history was an important element of the biblically grounded 16th century theology of [[John Calvin]]. Calvin considered the [[Ministry of Jesus|first coming of Christ]] as the key turning point in human history. He viewed Christ as "the one through whom salvation began" and he saw the completion of Christ's plan of salvation as his death and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].<ref name=McKim161 >{{cite book|title=Theological turning points: Major issues in Christian thought |first=Donald K. |last=McKim |year=1989 |isbn=0-8042-0702-X |page=161}}</ref>

The use of "Χ," derived from Chi, the [[Greek alphabet]] initial, as an abbreviation for Christ (most commonly in the abbreviation "[[Χmas]]") is often misinterpreted as a modern secularization of the term. Thus understood, the centuries-old English word Χmas, is actually a shortened form of CHmas, which is, itself, a shortened form for Christmas. Christians are sometimes referred to as "Xians," with the 'X' replacing 'Christ.<ref>{{OED|X}}</ref>

A very early Christogram is the ''[[Chi Rho]]'' symbol formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in Christ ( {{lang-el|"Χριστός"}}), [[chi (letter)|chi]] = ch and [[rho (letter)|rho]] = r, to produce <big>☧</big>.<ref>{{cite book|title=Symbols of the Christian faith |first=Alva William |last=Steffler |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4676-9 |page=66}}</ref>
