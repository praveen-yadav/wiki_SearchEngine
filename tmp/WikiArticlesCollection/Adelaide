===Before European settlement===
Prior to its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous [[Kaurna people|Kaurna]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] nation (pronounced "Garner" or "Gowna").

===19th century===
South Australia was officially proclaimed as a new British colony on 28 December 1836, near [[The Old Gum Tree]] in what is now the suburb of [[Glenelg North, South Australia|Glenelg North]]. The event is commemorated in South Australia as [[Proclamation Day]].<ref>City of Holdfast Bay: [http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/page.aspx?u=1463 "Proclamation Day"]. Retrieved August 2012.</ref> The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, through the design made by the architect [[George Strickland Kingston]].<ref>Johnson and Langmead, [http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1082509 ''The Adelaide city plan : fiction and fact''], Wakefield Press, 1986.</ref> In 1823, Light had fondly written of the Sicilian city of [[Catania]]: "The two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square in the direction of north and south and east and west. They are wide and spacious and about a mile long", and this became the basis for the plan of Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Light chose, not without opposition, a site on rising ground close to the River Torrens, which was the chief early water supply for the fledgling colony. "[[Light's Vision]]", as it has been termed, has meant that the initial design of Adelaide required little modification as the settlement grew and prospered.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement<ref>Wakefield cites:

Editor Robert Gouger.</ref> Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen.<ref>Wakefield wrote about this under a pseudonym, purporting to be an Australian settler. His subterfuge was so successful that he confused later writers including [[Karl Marx]], who wrote "It is the great merit of E.G. Wakefield to have discovered not anything new about the Colonies, but to have discovered in the Colonies the truth of as to the condition of capitalist production in the mother-country.' ''Das Kapital'', Moscow, 1958, p 766"</ref>  Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land.<ref>''Plan of a Company to be Established for the Purpose of Founding a Colony in Southern Australia, Purchasing Land Therein, and Preparing the Land so Purchased for the Reception of Immigrants'', 1832; in Wakefield, Edward Gibbon, Prichard, M.

As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a gaol in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the ''[[South Australian Register]]'' was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales, and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named [[South Australia Police]]) in April 1838 under 21-year-old [[Henry Inman (police commander)|Henry Inman]].<ref>J.

Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and incompetent leadership. The first governor of South Australia, [[John Hindmarsh]], clashed frequently with others, in particular with the Resident Commissioner, [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over {{convert|405|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]]. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. Light's survey was completed in this period, and land was promptly offered for sale to early colonists. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from [[Encounter Bay]] in the south to [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] in the north.

[[George Gawler|Governor Gawler]] took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the ''Select Committee on South Australia'' in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the [[Adelaide Gaol]], police barracks, a hospital, a customs house and a wharf at [[Port Adelaide]]. In addition, houses for public officials and missionaries, and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during Gawler's governorship. Adelaide had also become economically self-sufficient during this period, but at heavy cost: as a result of Gawler's public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bail-outs from London to stay afloat. Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey|Governor Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.

Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the [[Murray River]] being successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a [[self-governing colony]] in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. [[Secret ballot]]s were introduced, and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.<ref>{{cite web | author=Blair, Robert D.| year=2001| title=Events in South Australian History 1834–1857 | work=Pioneer Association of South Australia |url=http://www.users.on.net/~rdblair/events-sa.htm | accessdate=10 May 2006}}</ref>

In 1860 the Thorndon Park reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. In 1867 gas street lighting was implemented, the [[University of Adelaide]] was founded in 1874, the [[South Australian Art Gallery]] opened in 1881 and the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.

===20th century===

Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom but, with the return of droughts, entered the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, later returning to prosperity under strong government leadership. [[Secondary sector of industry|Secondary industries]] helped reduce the state's dependence on [[primary sector of industry|primary industries]]. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Seventy thousand men and women enlisted<!-- When? To do what? -->{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].

The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors [[Holden]] and [[Chrysler Australia|Chrysler]]<ref>When Chrysler stopped manufacturing in Adelaide, [[Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited]] took over the [[Tonsley Park]] factory. After many years of mixed fortunes, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing at Tonsley Park on 27 March 2008.</ref> made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. A pipeline from [[Mannum, South Australia|Mannum]] brought [[River Murray]] water to Adelaide in 1954 and [[Adelaide International Airport|an airport]] opened at [[West Beach, South Australia|West Beach]] in 1955. An assisted migration scheme brought 215,000 immigrants of many nationalities, mainly European, to South Australia between 1947 and 1973.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  [[Flinders University]] and the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, South of the City.

The [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan Governments]] of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival' – establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts, building upon the biennial "[[Adelaide Festival of Arts]]" which commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]] between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands, before tough economic conditions due to the state bank collapse.<ref name="f1-move">{{cite web | title =Adelaide Street Circuit | publisher=Formula 1 Database |url=http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Adelaide_Street_Circuit | accessdate =13 June 2007}}</ref> The 1991 [[State Bank of South Australia|State Bank]] collapse plunged both Adelaide and South Australia into economic recession, and its effects lasted until 2004, when ratings agency [[Standard & Poor's]] reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating.<ref>{{Cite news | title = All-round country |work=The Australian | page = 14 | date = 29 September 2004}}</ref>  Recent years have seen the [[Clipsal 500]] [[V8 Supercars]] race make use of sections of the former Formula One circuit.

==Geography==
[[File:Adelaide metropolitan area map.svg|upright|thumb|Adelaide's metropolitan area]]
Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the coast to the foothills, and {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] at its northern extent to [[Sellicks Beach, South Australia|Sellicks Beach]] in the south. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], the Adelaide Metropolitan Region has a total land area of {{convert|870|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is at an average elevation of {{convert|50|m|ft|}} above sea level. [[Mount Lofty]] is east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of {{convert|727|m|ft|}}. It is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]].

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaides beachside suburbs.  Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the [[Cleland Conservation Park]] and [[Belair National Park]]. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and [[Onkaparinga River National Park|Onkaparinga]] catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the [[Happy Valley Reservoir]] supplying around 40% and the much larger [[Mount Bold Reservoir]] 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

[[File:King William Street-Adelaide.jpg|thumb|right|King William Street, one of the widest main streets in an Australian capital city, viewed from Victoria Square.]]
Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel [[William Light]]. His plan, now known as '''Light's Vision''', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's design was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first Governor, John Hindmarsh. Light persisted with his design against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous; Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable grid layout and a beautiful green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''], 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.</ref>

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and "country towns", and the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway]].

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways – A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm}}</ref> The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is possibly an example of well-thought-out urban planning. The newer suburban areas as a whole, however, are not as integrated into the urban layout as much as older areas, and therefore place more stress on Adelaide's transportation system – although not on a level comparable with Melbourne or Sydney.

In the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 "Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Adelaide}}
Adelaide has a warm [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Tapper |first=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First |editor=Gray, Kathleen |page=300}}</ref> where most of the rain falls in the winter months. Despite this, Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid Köppen's BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80&nbsp;mm. Frosts are occasional, with the most notable having occurred in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is uncommon, except for very light falls at Mount Lofty and some places in the Adelaide Hills, with the most recent occurrence being in July 2013.

==Governance==
{{Main|Government of South Australia}}
[[File:Parliament House, Adelaide.jpg|right|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide]] on North Terrace houses the [[Parliament of South Australia]].]]
Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the [[Government of South Australia]]. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the [[City of Adelaide]]. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the state government's collaboration with the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The state parliament's Capital City Committee<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au |title=Capital City Committee |date = October 2008 |publisher=Government of South Australia and Adelaide City Council |accessdate=20 June 2009 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090618221636/http://www.capcity.adelaide.sa.gov.au/ | archivedate= 18 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref> is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.

==Local governments==
{{Further|Local Government areas of South Australia}}
The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between eighteen [[Local Government Areas of South Australia|local government areas]], including, at its centre, the [[City of Adelaide]], which administers the [[Adelaide city centre]], [[North Adelaide]], and the surrounding [[Adelaide Parklands]]. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, [[James Hurtle Fisher]], was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Adelaide|Lord Mayor]], the current being Lord Mayor [[Stephen Yarwood]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/will-a-change-of-mayor-really-change-anything-about-the-adelaide-city-council/story-e6frea83-1225954026458 |title=Will a change of mayor really change anything about the Adelaide City Council? |publisher=The Advertiser |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref>

As of 2011 Census, Adelaide had a metropolitan population of more than 1,225,235,<ref name="ABS2011">[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/4GADE?opendocument&navpos=220 2011 Census QuickStats > Greater Adelaide] Australian Bureau of Statistics, 28 March 2013. Retrieved 15 August 2013.</ref> making it Australia's fifth largest city. In the 2002–03 period the population grew by 0.6%, while the national average was 1.2%. Some 76.7%{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.

Major areas of population growth in recent years were in outer suburbs such as [[Mawson Lakes, South Australia|Mawson Lakes]] and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,413 flats, units or apartments.<ref name="ABS2011" />

High socioeconomic areas include a number of the coastal suburbs, most of the inner north-eastern, eastern, south-eastern and inner southern suburbs, the Adelaide Hills and [[North Adelaide]]. Almost a fifth (17.1%){{citation needed|date=August 2013}} of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.

Overseas-born Adelaideans composed 29.8% of the total population. The north-western suburbs (such as [[Woodville, South Australia|Woodville]] and [[Athol Park, South Australia|Athol Park]]) and suburbs close to the CBD have a higher ratio of overseas-born residents. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (7.0%), Italy (1.6%), India (1.4%), China (1.3%) and [[Vietnam]] (1.0%). The most-spoken languages other than [[Australian English|English]] were Italian (2.6%), Greek (1.9%), [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (1.3%), Vietnamese (1.3%), and [[Cantonese]] (0.7%).<ref name="ABS2011" />

===Religion===
Adelaide was founded on a vision of religious tolerance which attracted a wide variety of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as ''The City of Churches''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1455 |title=Religion: Diversity |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=1466 |title=Religious freedom |accessdate=15 November 2013 }}</ref>
However, approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of the least religious cities in Australia.
Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Catholic]] (21.3%), [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] (12.6%), [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] (7.6%) and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] (3.5%).<ref>[http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2011/quickstat/4GADE?opendocument&navpos=220 2011 Census – Greater Adelaide]</ref>

===Age structure===
Overall, Adelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. More than a quarter (27.5%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55&nbsp;years or older, in comparison to the national average of 25.6%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), which composed 17.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.3%.<ref name="ABS2011" />

Manufacturing, defence technology, high tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide at the [[General Motors Holden]] plant in [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]].<ref>[http://www.southaustralia.biz/fact_sheets/fact_automotive.biz.pdf ''South Australia Fact Sheet: Automotive'']{{dead link|date=November 2011}}, Business South Australia.  {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.southaustralia.biz/fact_sheets/fact_automotive.biz.pdf|date =20110726013520}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>  Adelaide has over 40% of Australia's high-tech electronics industry which designs and produces electronic systems that are sold worldwide for applications in medical, communications, defence, automotive, food and wine processing and industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The revenue of Adelaide's electronics industry has grown at about 15% per annum since 1990, and in 2011 exceeds A$4 billion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The electronics industry in Adelaide employs over 12,000 people or 14% of all manufacturing employment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  The South Australian economy, very closely tied to Adelaide's, still enjoys a trade surplus and has higher per capita growth than Australia as a whole.<ref>[http://www.southaustralia.biz/PDFs/economic_performance_update_dec05.pdf ''South Australia's Economic Performance Update], December 2005, Business South Australia. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

The [[State Bank of South Australia|collapse of the State Bank in 1992]] resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4&nbsp;billion). The collapse had meant that successive governments had enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which had been a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.<ref>[http://www.southaustralia.biz/news/sa_creditrating.htm ''South Australia's Credit Rating the Highest''], Business South Australia. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

The global media conglomerate [[News Corporation]] was founded in and until 2004 incorporated in Adelaide and is still considered its 'spiritual' home by [[Rupert Murdoch]]. Australia's largest oil company, [[Santos Limited|Santos]], prominent South Australian brewery, [[Coopers Brewery|Coopers]], major national retailer [[Harris Scarfe]] and Australia's second largest listed investment company [[Argo Investments Limited]] call Adelaide their home.

===Defence industry===
Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1&nbsp;billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. Seventy-two percent of Australian defence companies are in Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The principal government military research institution, the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation]], and other defence technology organisations such as [[BAE Systems Australia]] and Lockheed Martin Australia, are north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called "Edinburgh Parks", adjacent to [[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].

Others, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are in or near [[Technology Park, Adelaide|Technology Park]]. [[ASC Pty Ltd]], based in the industrial suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]], was charged with constructing Australia's [[Collins class submarine|''Collins'' class submarines]] and more recently the A$6&nbsp;billion contract to construct the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s new [[Hobart class destroyer|air-warfare destroyers]].<ref>[http://www.defencesa.com/ ''South Australia: The Defence Industry Choice], Defence SA.</ref>

===Employment statistics===
There are 466,829 employed people in Adelaide, with 62.3% full-time and 35.1% part-time. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards part-time (which includes casual) employment, increasing from 11.6% of the workplace in 1991, to over a third today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Each quarter, The Real Estate Institute of South Australia (REISA) publishes a list of median house sale prices by suburb. Due to the small size of many of Adelaide's suburbs, the low volumes of sales in these suburbs, and (over time) the huge variations in the numbers of sales in a suburb in a quarter, statistical analysis of "the most expensive suburb" is unreliable; the suburbs appearing in the "top 10 most expensive suburbs this quarter" list is constantly varying. Quarterly Reports for the last two years can be found on the REISA website.<ref>[http://www.reisa.com.au/publicinfo/median-house-prices Median house prices], The Real Estate Institute of South Australia (REISA)<br />

==Education and research==
{{Main|South Australia#Education|l1=Education in South Australia}}
Education forms an increasingly important part of the city's economy, with the South Australian Government and educational institutions attempting to position Adelaide as "Australia's education hub" and marketing it as a "Learning City."<ref name="eduhub">{{cite news |first=Verity |last=Edwards |title=Education attracts record numbers |work=The Weekend Australian |date=3 May 2008 }}</ref> The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 23,300, of which 2,380 are secondary school students.<ref name="eduhub"/> In addition to the city's existing institutions, foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses in order to increase its attractiveness as an education hub.<ref name="UCL">{{cite news |first=Lucy |last=Hodges |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/brave-new-territory-university-college-london-to-open-a-branch-in-australia-835571.html |title=Brave new territory: University College London to open a branch in Australia |work=The Independent (UK) |date=29 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heinz.cmu.edu.au/about-heinz-australia/index.aspx |title=About Heinz Australia: Carnegie Mellon Heinz College |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University}}</ref>

===Primary and secondary education===
At the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and [[Catholic school]]s. All schools provide education under the [[South Australian Certificate of Education]] (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.

===Tertiary education===
There are three public universities local to Adelaide, as well as one private university and  three constituent colleges of three foreign universities. The [[Flinders University of South Australia]], the [[University of Adelaide]], the [[University of South Australia]] and [http://www.tua.edu.au/ Torrens University Australia] - part of the [http://www.laureate.net/ Laureate International Group] are based in Adelaide.

While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the [[vine cuttings]] that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the [[Barossa Valley]].

After the Second World War, British, Italian, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Polish people|Polish]] and other European immigrants settled in Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The conclusion of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975 saw an influx of Indo-Chinese immigrants to Adelaide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} ''See: [[Immigration history of Australia]]''

===Arts and entertainment===
Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers of both major political parties. The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] and [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]] were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970, and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] and, in 1976, the [[State Opera of South Australia]].

Over time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Adelaide Writers' Week]], and [[WOMADelaide]], all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (that month is sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]] celebration), [[Tasting Australia]] (a biennial food and wine affair), and the [[Royal Adelaide Show]] (an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]]). There are also many international cultural fairs, most notably the German [[Schützenfest]] and Greek [[Glendi]]. Adelaide is also home to the [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant]], the world's largest [[Santa Claus parade|Christmas parade]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} As the state capital, Adelaide is also home to a great number of cultural institutions with many along the boulevard of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], with around 35,000 works, holds Australia's second largest state-based collection.

Situated adjacent are the [[South Australian Museum]] and [[State Library of South Australia]], while the [[Adelaide Botanic Garden]], [[National Wine Centre]] and [[Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute]] are nearby in the [[East End, Adelaide|East End]] of the city. In the back of the State Library lies the [[Migration Museum, Adelaide|Migration Museum]] is Australia's oldest museum of its kind. Contemporary art scenes include the [[Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia]].  [[Adelaide Festival Centre]], on the banks of the Torrens, is the focal point for much of the cultural activity in the city and home to the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]], with other venues including the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]] and the city's many smaller theatres, pubs and cabaret bars.

The [[music of Adelaide]] has produced various musical groups and individuals who have achieved both national and international fame. This includes the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Youth Orchestra]], rock bands: [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[The Superjesus]], [[Wolf & Cub]], roots/blues group [[The Audreys]], internationally acclaimed metal acts [[I Killed The Prom Queen]] and [[Double Dragon (band)|Double Dragon]], popular Australian hip-hop outfit [[Hilltop Hoods]], pop acts like [[Sia Furler|Sia]], [[Orianthi]], [[Guy Sebastian]], and [[Wes Carr]], as well as internationally successful tribute act The [[Australian Pink Floyd Show]].

Noted rocker [[Jimmy Barnes]] spent most of his youth in the northern suburb of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]]. Paul Kelly grew up in Adelaide and was head prefect at Rostrevor College. The first ''[[Australian Idol]]'' winner, [[Guy Sebastian]], hails from the north-eastern suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]]. American musician [[Ben Folds]] used to base himself in Adelaide when he was married to Australian Frally Hynes. Folds recorded a song about Adelaide before he moved away from the city. In addition to its own WOMADelaide, Adelaide attracts several touring music festivals, including [[Big Day Out]], [[Creamfields Australia|Creamfields]], [[Future Music Festival|Future Music]], [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway]], [[Parklife Festival|Parklife]], [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]], [[Stereosonic]] and [[Summadayze]]

Adelaide also plays host to two of Australia's leading contemporary dance companies. The [[Australian Dance Theatre]] and [[Leigh Warren & Dancers]] contribute to state festivals and perform nationally and internationally. [[Restless Dance Theatre]] is also based in Adelaide and is nationally recognised for working with disabled and non-disabled dancers to use movement as a means of expression.

====Concert venues====
Adelaide pop-concert venues (past and present) include: [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]]; [[Adelaide Festival Theatre]]; [[Adelaide Oval]]; [[Apollo Stadium]]; [[Memorial Drive Park]]; [[Thebarton Theatre]].

===Media===
[[File:Advertiser Building.JPG|right|thumb|[[Keith Murdoch|Sir Keith Murdoch House]], named after the founder of ''[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]]'', is the headquarters for the publisher of Adelaide's daily newspaper, ''The Advertiser''.]]

====Newspapers====
Newspapers in Adelaide are dominated by [[News Corporation]] publications—Adelaide being the birthplace of News Corporation itself. The only South Australian daily newspaper is ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', published by News Corporation six days a week. The same group publishes a Sunday paper, the ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]''.

There are eleven suburban community newspapers published weekly, known collectively as the ''[[Messenger Newspapers]]'', also published by a subsidiary of News Corporation. ''[[The Independent Weekly]]'' was a small independent newspaper providing one alternative view, but abolished its print edition in November 2010 and now exists as a digital daily newsletter only. Two national daily newspapers are circulated in the city: ''[[The Australian]]'' and its weekend publication, ''The Weekend Australian'', also published by News Corporation; and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' published by [[John Fairfax Holdings|Fairfax]]. Interstate dailies, ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', published by Fairfax, are also typically available. ''[[The Adelaide Review]]'' is a free paper published fortnightly, and other independent magazine-style papers are published, but are not as widely available.

====Television====
All of the five Australian national television networks broadcast [[High-definition television|high definition digital]] services in Adelaide. They share three transmission towers on the ridge near the summit of Mount Lofty.  Two other transmission sites are located at Grenfell Street and Elizabeth Downs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital television reception in Craigmore/Hillbank|url=http://www.archive.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/128912/Craigmore-Hillbank_Fact_Sheet_-_Final_-_Web_ready.pdf|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref>  The two government-funded stations are run by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC1) and the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS One). The [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]] both own their Adelaide stations ([[SAS-7]] and [[ADS-10]] respectively).

Adelaide's [[NWS-9]] is affiliated with the [[Nine Network]] and was owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] until the sale to [[WIN Corporation]] in May 2007. New digital-only channels available in addition to ABC1, Seven, Nine, Ten and SBS One include [[One HD]], [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]], [[ABC2]], [[ABC3]], [[ABC News 24]], [[SBS Two]], [[7Two]], [[7mate]], [[GEM HD]] and [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]]. Adelaide also has a [[Community television in Australia|community television]] station, [[44 Adelaide]]. The [[Foxtel]] [[pay TV]] service is available as cable television in a few areas, and as satellite television to the entire metropolitan area. It is resold by a number of other brands, mostly telephone companies.

As part of a nation-wide phase-out of [[analogue television]] in Australia, Adelaide's analogue television service was shut down on 2 April 2013.<ref>[http://myswitch.digitalready.gov.au/default.aspx?search=5000 mySwitch]. Myswitch.digitalready.gov.au. Retrieved on 16 July 2013.</ref>

====Radio====
There are twenty radio stations that serve the metropolitan area, as well as four community stations that serve only parts of the metropolitan area. Of the twenty full coverage stations, there are six commercial stations, six community stations, six national stations and two narrowcast stations.

==Sport==
The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are [[Australian rules football]], [[association football|association football (soccer)]], [[cricket]], [[netball]] and [[basketball]]. Adelaide is the home of two [[Australian Football League]] teams: the [[Adelaide Crows]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power]], and one [[A-League]] soccer team, [[Adelaide United]]. A local [[Australian rules football]] league, the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]], is made up of nine teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1907. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.

Adelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/01/17/australian-sport-owes-much-to-little-old-adelaide/ Australian sport owes much to little old Adelaide], The Roar, Retrieved on 21 January 2010.</ref> Most large sporting events take place at either [[AAMI Stadium]] (the home base of the [[Adelaide Crows]] and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power's]] home game venue) or the historic [[Adelaide Oval]], home of the [[Southern Redbacks]] and the [[Adelaide Strikers]] cricket teams. As it has since 1884, [[Adelaide Oval]] hosts an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of [[One Day International]] cricket matches. [[Memorial Drive Park]], adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host the Adelaide International (now known as the [[Brisbane International]]), a major men's tennis tournament in the lead-up to the Australian Open before the tournament was moved to [[Brisbane]] in 2009. Adelaide's professional football team, [[Adelaide United]], play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is [[Hindmarsh Stadium]], which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few purpose-built soccer stadia in Australia.

For two years (1997 and 1998), Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level [[rugby league]], this came after the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] had been playing a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval starting in 1991. The [[Adelaide Rams]] were formed and played in the breakaway [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] (SL) competition in [[1997 Super League (Australia) season|1997]] before moving to the new [[National Rugby League]] in [[1998 NRL season|1998]]. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a deal with the NRL, the clubs owners [[News Limited]] (who were also owners of the SL) closed the club only weeks before the start of the [[1999 NRL season|1999 season]]. In 2008 the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks]], a Sydney NRL club, and the South Australian Government announced a three-year contract in which the Sharks will play a single home game each season at Hindmarsh. Unfortunately this only happened for 2009. From 2010 the [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] signed an agreement to play one home game per season at the Adelaide Oval for three years with the hope of establishing a strong supporter base in Adelaide.

Adelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the [[Adelaide 36ers]] who play in the [[National Basketball League Australia|NBL]] and the women's team, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] who play in the [[Women's National Basketball League|WNBL]]. The 36ers play their home games at the [[Adelaide Arena]] while the Lightning also play at the Adelaide Arena. Adelaide has a professional [[netball]] team, the [[Adelaide Thunderbirds]], who play in the trans-Tasman netball competition, the [[ANZ Championship]], with home games played at [[ETSA Park]]. The Thunderbirds also occasionally play games or finals at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, while international netball matches are usually played at either the Entertainment Centre or the Adelaide Arena.

Since 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas has hosted the [[Tour Down Under]] bicycle race, organised and directed by Adelaide based [[Mike Turtur]] (Turtur won an [[Summer Olympics|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] for Australia in the [[Cycling at the 1984 Summer Olympics|4000m Team pursuit]] at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Olympics]]). The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted [[UCI ProTour]] status.

Adelaide maintains a franchise in the [[Australian Baseball League]], the [[Adelaide Bite]]. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium is [[Coopers Stadium]]. Their name stems from the local [[Great Australian Bight]], and from the abundance of local [[Great White Shark]]s.

Adelaide also has an Ice Hockey team, "Adelaide Adrenaline" in the [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] (AIHL). They were national champions in 2009.<ref>[http://www.adelaideadrenaline.com.au/ Adelaide Adrenaline] Accessed 29 May 2013.</ref>

The [[Australian Grand Prix]] for [[Formula One]] racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] which was laid out in the city's eastern parklands.<ref name="f1-move"/> The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful [[Adelaide 500|Clipsal 500]] for [[V8 Supercar]] racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a [[rallying|rally]] of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.

The [[World Solar Challenge]] race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide will host the [http://www.worldbowls2012.com/ 2012 World Bowls Championships] at Lockleys Bowling Club. Adelaide will become the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.

==Infrastructure==

===Health===
Adelaide's first hospital is the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]] (RAH). Founded in 1840, it is one of the major hospitals in Adelaide and is a [[teaching hospital]] of the University of Adelaide. It has a capacity of 705 beds. Two other RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are in the suburbs of Adelaide – the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in [[Northfield, South Australia|Northfield]], and the [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] Campus Mental Health Service. Four other large hospitals in the Adelaide area are the [[Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide|Women's and Children's Hospital]] (305 beds), which is on King William Road in North Adelaide; the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] (340 beds) in Woodville, the [[Flinders Medical Centre]] (580 beds), in Bedford Park and in the northern suburbs, and the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] (198 beds) in Elizabeth. These hospitals are also associated with medical schools. The Women's and Children's, the Queen Elizabeth and the Lyell McEwin are affiliated with the [[University of Adelaide]], Flinders Medical Centre is affiliated [[Flinders University]], and the Lyell McEwin is also affiliated with the [[University of South Australia]].

In June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital at the east end of the city. The new 800-bed hospital has a cost of A$1.85 billion and was planned to be named the "Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital" after the [[Marjorie Jackson|former Governor of South Australia]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Owen | first = Michael | title =800 beds, helipad and train station: Our 'Marj' hospital | newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | page = 5 | date = 7 June 2007 |url=}}</ref> However, in 2009, at the former governor's request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility. Construction started in June 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2016.<ref>[http://www.sahp.com.au/index.php/faq The new Royal Adelaide Hospital FAQ's]</ref>

In addition, major upgrades would see the Flinders Medical Centre become the primary centre for health care for the southern suburbs, while upgrades for the [[Lyell McEwin Hospital]] in Elizabeth would see that become the centre for the northern suburbs. The trio of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the [[Modbury Hospital]] and the Noarlunga Hospital would become specialist elective surgery centres. The Repatriation General Hospital would also expand its range of speciality areas beyond veterans' health to incorporate stroke, orthopaedic rehabilitation and aged care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=1712 |title='News: New $1.7&nbsp;billion hospital spearheads health reform' |publisher=Ministers.sa.gov.au |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> With the "Global Financial Crisis" of 2008, it remains to be seen if and how these initiatives will proceed.

The largest not-for-profit provider of community health care within Adelaide is the [[Royal District Nursing Service (South Australia)]]  which provides out of hospital care and hospital avoidance care, which in turn eases pressure on the South Australia public hospital system.

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Adelaide}}
[[File:GlenelgTramCityWest.jpg|right|thumb|Tram at the former City West terminus of the [[Glenelg Tram]]line. The line has since been extended to the [[Adelaide Entertainment Centre]].]]
Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide public transport system, which is managed by and known as the [[Adelaide Metro]]. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|metropolitan railways]], and the Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]], which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]]. There are further plans to extend the tram to [[Port Adelaide]] and [[Semaphore, South Australia|Semaphore]]. A [[Central Business District|CBD]] tram loop too, is being considered and the latest [[Adelaide Airport]] master plan has also revealed a tram extension to the airport in the near future.<ref>[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/city-loop-in-tram-proposal/story-e6frea6u-1226032608322 City loop extension in tram proposal]</ref><ref>[http://www.adelaideairport.com.au/assets/pdfs/master-planning/Vol2MaterPlanDec2009.pdf Master Plan – Adelaide Airport]</ref>

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a "twenty-minute city", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metro Malcontent – The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |format=PDF |year=2005|url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\document_677.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2008}} (1.18MB)</ref>

The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:
*The [[South Eastern Freeway]] (colloquially referred to as the freeway), connects the south-east corner of the Adelaide Plain to the Adelaide Hills and beyond to [[Murray Bridge]] and [[Tailem Bend]], where it then continues as National Highway 1 south-east to Melbourne.
*The [[Southern Expressway]] (colloquially referred to as the SEXY), is an [[reversible lane|interchangeable one-way road]] connecting the outer southern suburbs with the inner southern suburbs and the city centre. It duplicates the route of the Main South Road, taking the peak traffic load into the city in the morning, and out of the city in the evening. Works commenced in early 2012 to upgrade to a dual direction expressway and are expected to be completed by mid-2014.<ref>[http://dpti.sa.gov.au/southern_expressway_duplication/faqs Southern Expressway Duplication]</ref>
*The [[Port River Expressway]] (colloquially referred to as the PREXY), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern "entrance" to the metropolitan area.
*The [[Northern Expressway]] (colloquially referred to as the NEXY, formerly referred to as the [[Sturt Highway]] extension), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler bypass road|Gawler Bypass]] to the Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.

There are also plans for major upgrades to busy sections of [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], including road widening, underpasses and overpasses. The underpass of [[Anzac Highway]] was completed in 2009. Further planned underpasses during the first stage of the project include Grange Road, Port Road, the Glenelg Tramline and the Outer Harbour railway line.<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/southroad_upgrade/index.asp South Road Upgrade'']{{dead link|date=November 2011}} {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/southroad_upgrade/index.asp|date =20110719234054}}{{dead link |date=November 2011}}</ref> An overpass between Regency Road and the Port River Expressway commenced construction in 2012.

====Airports====
The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial Airports, [[Adelaide Airport|Adelaide]] and [[Parafield Airport|Parafield]].
[[Adelaide Airport]], in Adelaide's western suburbs, served in excess of 7.0 million passengers annually.<ref>[http://annualreport.adelaideairport.com.au/pdf/AAL%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf Adelaide Airport Limited Annual Report]</ref> The dual international/domestic terminal named T1 incorporates glass aero bridges and has the ability to cater for the [[Airbus A380]].<ref>{{Cite news | last = Innes | first = Stuart | title = Super airliner cleared to land at our new airport | newspaper=The Advertiser (Adelaide) | date = 10 January 2005 |url=}}</ref> The airport is designed to handle 27 aircraft simultaneously and is capable of processing 3,000 passengers per hour. Unusually for a major city, it is only 7&nbsp;kilometres (4.4&nbsp;mi) from the [[Adelaide city centre]].

Adelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the [[Adelaide Electric Supply Company]], which was nationalised by the [[Thomas Playford IV|Playford]] government in 1946,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/norrie-sir-charles-willoughby-moke-11254 | title = Biography – Sir Charles Willoughby Moke Norrie | publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography | author = P.A.

Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the [[John Olsen|Olsen]] Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP [[Trevor Crothers]] resigned from the party and voted with the government.<ref>[http://www.electricity-week.com.au/erisk7/article/315187/function.pg-connect Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing wins ETSA Power, Utilities for $3.5 billion] Electricity Week 13 December 1999</ref><ref>Marshall, Vern [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58398249.html South Australia] [[Australian Journal of Politics and History]] Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1 December 1999 [[HighBeam Research]] accessed 17 June 2012</ref> The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110318191.html Power crisis 'as bad as California'] [[COMTEX]] News Network 19 November 2003 [[HighBeam Research]] accessed 17 June 2012</ref> In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115625174.html Privatisation 'will cost state billions'] [[COMTEX]] News Network, Inc. 21 April 2004 [[HighBeam Research]] accessed 17 June 2012</ref>  In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} These price increases and large subsides have led to South Australia paying the highest retail price for electricity in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/renewables-blowout-as-wind-solar-hit-harder-than-tax/story-fn59niix-1226397210436 | title = Renewables blowout as wind, solar hit harder than tax | publisher = The Australian | author1 = Sid Maher | author2 = Michael Owen | date = 16 June 2011 | accessdate =16 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/power-prices-to-be-highest-in-the-world/story-e6frea83-1226305741810 | title = South Australia's power prices set to become highest in the world says Energy Users Association of Australia | author = Claire Peddie | publisher = AdelaideNow | date = 21 March 2012 | accessdate =16 June 2012 }}</ref>

SA Power Networks now distributes electricity from transmission companies to end users. Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Some of the major companies are: [[TRUenergy]], which generates electricity; [[ElectraNet]], which transmits electricity from the generators to the distribution network, [[Lumo Energy]] and [[AGL Energy]], which retails gas and electricity.<ref name="EnergySA1">{{cite web | title=Industry structure | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050624044124/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/dhtml/ss/section.php?sectID=12&tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}</ref> Substantial investment has been made in maintenance and reinforcement of the electricity supply network to provide continued reliability of supply.

Adelaide derives most of its electricity from a gas-fired plant operated by [[AGL Energy]] at [[Torrens Island Power Station, South Australia|Torrens Island]], with more coming from power stations at [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Pelican Point Power Station|Pelican Point]], and from connections to the national grid. Gas is mainly supplied from the [[Moomba, South Australia|Moomba]] Gas Processing Plant in the [[Cooper Basin]], and is piped to Adelaide and other areas within the state.<ref name="EnergySA2">{{cite web | title=Supply Security | work=Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure |url=http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&tempID=1 | accessdate=5 May 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050624044821/http://www.energy.sa.gov.au/pages/conventional/planning/supply/security.htm:sectID=10&tempID=1 |archivedate = 24 June 2005}}</ref> South Australia also generates 18% of its electricity from [[wind power]], and has 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.sa.gov.au/subject/Water,+energy+and+environment/Energy/Renewable+energy/Wind+energy/Wind+energy+in+South+Australia | title = Wind Energy in South Australia | publisher = Government of South Australia | accessdate =16 June 2011}}</ref>

Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: [[Mount Bold Reservoir|Mount Bold]], [[Happy Valley Reservoir|Happy Valley]], [[Myponga Reservoir|Myponga]], [[Millbrook Reservoir|Millbrook]], [[Hope Valley Reservoir|Hope Valley]], [[Little Para Reservoir|Little Para]] and [[South Para Reservoir|South Para]]. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the [[River Murray]]. A sea water desalination plant capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) is currently in construction and expected to be completed during 2012. The provision of water services is by the government-owned [[SA Water]].
