The '''Virgin Islands''',<ref>The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007 (which refers to the territory as the "Virgin Islands" – not, for the avoidance of doubt, as the "British Virgin Islands").</ref> commonly known as the '''British Virgin Islands''' ('''BVI'''), is a [[British overseas territory]] located in the [[Caribbean]] to the east of [[Puerto Rico]]. The islands make up part of the [[Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands archipelago]], the remaining islands constitute the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]] and the [[Spanish Virgin Islands]].

The official name of the Territory is still simply the "Virgin Islands", but the prefix "British" is often used to distinguish it from the neighbouring American territory which changed its name from the "[[Danish West Indies]]" to "Virgin Islands of the United States" in 1917. British Virgin Islands government publications continue to begin with the name "The Territory of the Virgin Islands", passports simply refer to the "Virgin Islands", and all laws begin with the words "Virgin Islands". Moreover, the Territory's Constitutional Commission has expressed the view that "every effort should be made", to encourage the use of the name "Virgin Islands".<ref>[http://www.dgo.gov.vg/spawpdfs/Report%20of%20Virgin%20Islands%20Constitutional%20Commissioners%202005.pdf Report of Virgin Islands Constitutional Commissioners 2005]</ref>

The British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of [[Tortola]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Anegada]], and [[Jost Van Dyke]], along with over fifty other smaller islands and [[cay]]s. About 15 of the islands are inhabited. The capital, [[Road Town]], is situated on Tortola, the largest island, which is approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide. The islands have a population of about 27,800, of whom approximately 23,000 live on Tortola.

British Virgin Islanders are classed as [[British Overseas Territories citizen]]s and since 2002 have had full [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. Although the territory is not part of the [[European Union]] and not directly subject to EU law, its citizens are deemed to be citizens of the EU as well.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/octs_and_greenland/index_en.htm "EU relations with Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs)," European Commission website], accessed 5 December 2012</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the British Virgin Islands}}

The Virgin Islands were first settled by the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] from South America around 100 BC (though there is some evidence of [[Amerindian]] presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC).<ref>Wilson, Samuel M. ed. ''The Indigenous People of the Caribbean''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1997. ISBN 0-8130-1692-4</ref> The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the 15th century when they were displaced by the more aggressive [[Caribs]], a tribe from the [[Lesser Antilles]] islands, after whom the [[Caribbean Sea]] is named.

The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus gave them the fanciful name ''Santa Ursula y las Once Mil Vírgenes'' (Saint Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins), shortened to ''Las Vírgenes'' (The Virgins), after the legend of [[Saint Ursula]].

The [[Spanish Empire]] claimed the islands by discovery in the early 16th century, but never settled them, and subsequent years saw the English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Danish all jostling for control of the region, which became a notorious haunt for pirates. There is no record of any native Amerindian population in the British Virgin Islands during this period, although the native population on nearby [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] was decimated.

The Dutch established a [[Dutch Virgin Islands|permanent settlement]] on the island of [[Tortola]] by 1648. In 1672, the English captured Tortola from the Dutch, and the English annexation of [[Anegada]] and [[Virgin Gorda]] followed in 1680. Meanwhile, over the period 1672–1733, the Danish gained control of the nearby islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] and Saint Croix.

[[File:St Phillips Church, Tortola.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The ruins of [[St. Phillip's Church|St Phillip's Church, Tortola]], one of the most important historical ruins in the Territory.]]
The British islands were considered principally a strategic possession, but were planted when economic conditions were particularly favourable. The British introduced [[sugar cane]] which was to become the main crop and source of foreign trade, and slaves were brought from Africa to work on the sugar cane plantations. The islands prospered economically until the middle of the nineteenth century, when a combination of the [[Slavery in the British Virgin Islands|abolition of slavery in the Territory]], a series of disastrous hurricanes, and the growth in the [[sugar beet]] crop in Europe and the United States<ref>In the United Kingdom, a major market for sugar from the Territory, the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846]] also created a considerable downward effect on the price of Caribbean sugar cane.</ref> significantly reduced sugar cane production and led to a period of economic decline.

In 1917, the United States purchased St. John, St. Thomas, and St. Croix from Denmark for US$25 million, renaming them the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

The British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the [[British Leeward Islands]] or with [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], with an administrator representing the British Government on the Islands. The island gained separate colony status in 1960 and became autonomous in 1967. Since the 1960s, the islands have diversified away from their traditionally agriculture-based economy towards tourism and financial services, becoming one of the wealthiest areas in the Caribbean.

==Geography==
[[File:GB Virgin Islands.png|thumb|right|500px|Map of British Virgin Islands (Note: Anegada is farther away from the other islands than shown)]]
{{Main|Geography of the British Virgin Islands}}

The British Virgin Islands comprise around sixty tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, to tiny uninhabited [[islets]]. They are located in the [[Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands archipelago]], a few miles east of the US Virgin Islands. The [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] lies to the north of the islands, and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lies to the south. Most of the islands are volcanic in origin and have a hilly, rugged terrain. Anegada is geologically distinct from the rest of the group and is a flat island composed of limestone and coral.

In addition to the four main islands of [[Tortola]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Anegada]], and [[Jost Van Dyke]], other islands include:

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of the British Virgin Islands}}
The British Virgin Islands enjoy a tropical climate, moderated by [[trade wind]]s. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, [[Road Town]], typical daily maxima are around {{convert|32|°C|1}} in the summer and {{convert|29|°C|1}} in the winter. Typical daily minima are around {{convert|24|°C|1}} in the summer and {{convert|21|°C|1}} in the winter. Rainfall averages about {{convert|1150|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March. Hurricanes occasionally hit the islands, with the hurricane season running from June to November.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of the British Virgin Islands}}
[[File:Old LegCo Building, Road Town.jpg|right|thumb|Legislative Council building in [[Road Town]]. The High Court sits upstairs.]]
Executive authority in British Virgin Islands is vested in [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] and is exercised on her behalf by the [[Governor of the British Virgin Islands]]. The Governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[British Government]]. Defence and Foreign Affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

A [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|new constitution]] was adopted in 2007 (the Virgin Islands Constitution Order, 2007)<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/pdfs/uksiem_20071678_en.pdf Explanatory Memorandum to the Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007]</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/contents/made The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007]</ref> and came into force when the [[Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands|Legislative Council]] was dissolved for the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 2007|2007 general election]]. The Head of Government under the new constitution is the [[Premier of the British Virgin Islands|Premier]] (prior to the new constitution the office was referred to as [[Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]]), who is elected in a general election along with the other members of the ruling government as well as the members of the opposition. A Cabinet is nominated by the Premier and appointed by the Governor. The Legislature consists of the Queen (represented by the Governor) and a [[unicameral]] [[House of Assembly]] made up of 13 elected members plus the Speaker and the Attorney-General.

The current Governor is [[William Boyd McCleary]] (since 2010). The current Premier is [[Orlando Smith]] (since 9 November 2011).

===Subdivisions===
{{Main|Districts of the British Virgin Islands}}
The British Virgin Islands is divided into 9 electoral districts. Eight of the nine districts are partly or wholly on Tortola, and encompass nearby neighbouring islands. Only the ninth district (Virgin Gorda and Anegada) does not include any part of Tortola. The Territory is also technically divided into 5 administrative districts (one for each of the four largest islands, and then a fifth for all other islands), and into 6 civil registry districts (three for Tortola, Jost Van Dyke, Virgin Gorda and Anegada) although these have little practical relevance today.

===Law and criminal justice===
{{Main|Law of the British Virgin Islands}}

Crime in the British Virgin Islands is comparatively low by Caribbean standards (and indeed compared to the neighbouring US Virgin Islands).<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://gocaribbean.about.com/od/healthandsafety/a/CaribCrimeStats.htm|title=Which Caribbean Islands are the Safest, Most Dangerous?|publisher=About.com|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>  However statistics and hard data are relatively rare, and are not regularly published by Governmental sources in the British Virgin Islands.  Although homicides are rare,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/how-safe-caribbean-island-island-look-386480|title=How safe is the Caribbean? An Island by Island Look|publisher=International Business Times|date=22 December 2011}}</ref> property crime is not uncommon.  The British and US Virgin Islands sit at the axis of a major drugs transshipment point between Latin America and the continental United States.  The [[Drug Enforcement Administration|American DEA]] regards the adjacent US territories of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as a "High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://bvibeacon.com/2/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1674:special-report-us-sees-shift-in-cocaine-trafficking&catid=68:special-reports&Itemid=60|title=US sees shift in cocaine trafficking|publisher=[[BVI Beacon]]|date=9 February 2012}}</ref>  A cooperation agreement exists between the British Virgin Islands and the US Coastguard allowing American forces to pursue suspected drug traffickers through the territorial waters of the British Virgin Islands.  In August 2011 a joint raid between the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|American DEA]] and local British Virgin Islands police arrested a number of British Virgin Islands residents who are accused of being involved in major drugs [[transshipment]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/states/newsrel/2011/mia082511.html|title=Thirteen Indicted for Airdropping Multi-Hundred Kilogram Quantities of Cocaine in the Caribbean Sea and for Money Laundering Offenses|author=US Justice Department|date=25 August 2011|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref> although their extradition to the United States has become bogged down in endless legal wrangling.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=Article&articleID=1350646462|title=Gov't Pursues Extradition Of Bob Hodge To North Carolina|publisher=BVI Platinum|date=19 October 2012}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Roadtown, Tortola.jpg|right|thumb|[[Road Town]], Tortola, British Virgin Islands]]
{{Main|Economy of the British Virgin Islands}}

As an [[offshore financial centre]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Islands resent crackdown of the tax havens by G-20|url=http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2009/05/09/business/doc4a04ef4f516e1869586320.txt|author=Ben Fox|agency=Associated Press|date=9 May 2009|accessdate=2011-10-11}}</ref> the British Virgin Islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the Caribbean region, with a per capita average income of around $38,500 (2004 est.)<ref>CIA. [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vi.html Economy: British Virgin Islands]. The World Factbook, CIA publications, 19 December. 2006. Retrieved 25 December. 2006.</ref>

The "twin pillars" of the economy are tourism and financial services. Politically, tourism is the more important of the two, as it employs a greater number of people within the Territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (for example, taxi drivers and street vendors). Economically however, financial services associated with the territory's status as an offshore financial centre are by far the more important. 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).

===Tourism===
[[File:TheBaths VirginGorda BVI.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Baths]], Virgin Gorda]]

Tourism accounts for approximately 45% of national income. The islands are a popular destination for US citizens. In 2006 a total of 825,603 people visited the islands (of whom 443,987 were cruise ship passengers). Tourists frequent the numerous white sand beaches, visit [[The Baths|The Baths on Virgin Gorda]], [[Snorkeling|snorkel]] the [[coral reef]]s near Anegada, or experience the well-known bars of Jost Van Dyke. The BVI are known as one of the world's greatest sailing destinations, and charter sailboats are a very popular way to visit less accessible islands. Every year since 1972 the BVI has hosted the Spring Regatta, which is a seven-day collection of sailing races throughout the islands. A substantial number of the tourists who visit the BVI are [[cruise ship]] passengers, although they produce far lower revenue per head than charter boat tourists and hotel based tourists. They are nonetheless important to the substantial (and politically important) taxi driving community.

===Financial services===
Financial services account for over half of the income of the Territory.  The majority of this revenue is generated by the licensing of [[offshore company|offshore companies]] and related services.  The British Virgin Islands is a significant global player in the [[offshore financial centre|offshore financial services industry]].  In 2000 [[KPMG]] reported in its survey of [[Tax haven|offshore jurisdictions]] for the United Kingdom government that over 41% of the world's offshore companies were formed in the British Virgin Islands.  Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]]. 

As such the British Virgin Islands is frequently labelled as a "[[tax haven]]" by campaigners and NGOs,<ref name= GuardianNov2012>{{cite news|first1=David|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/nov/25offshore-secrets-revealed-shadowy-side|title=Offshore secrets revealed: the shadowy side of a booming industry|last1=Leigh|first2=Harold|last2=Frayman|first1=James|last2=Ball|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 November 2012|accessdate=March 2013}}</ref> and has been expressly named in anti-tax haven legislation in other countries on various occasions.<ref>See for example the [[Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act]]</ref>  Successive Governments in the British Virgin Islands have fought against the tax haven label, and made various commitments to tax exchange and recording beneficial ownership information of companies following the [[39th G8 summit|2013 G8 summit]].  On 10 September 2013 British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said "I do not think it is fair any longer to refer to any of the Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies as tax havens.  They have taken action to make sure that they have fair and open tax systems.  It is very important that our focus should now shift to those territories and countries that really are tax havens."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international-adviser.com/news/tax---regulation/jersey-guernsey-iom-revel-in|title=Jersey, Guernsey, IoM revel in Cameron’s ‘not tax havens’ comments|author=International Adviser|date=12 September 2013}}{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-24034768|title=David Cameron: Crown dependency tax haven banner 'not fair'|author=[[BBC News]]|date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

===Agriculture and industry===

Agriculture and industry account for only a small proportion of the islands' GDP. Agricultural produce includes fruit, vegetables, sugar cane, livestock and poultry, and industries include rum distillation, construction and boat building.

===Currency===

The official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the [[United States dollar]] (US$) since 1959, a currency also used by the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

===Workforce===

The British Virgin Islands is heavily dependent on migrant workers, and over 50% of all workers on the islands are of a foreign descent. The national labour-force is estimated at 12,770, of whom approximately 59.4% work in the service sector but less than 0.6% are estimated to work in agriculture (the balance in industry).<ref name="The Times">{{cite web|url=http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/North_America/British_Virgin_Islands#workforce|title=British Virgin Islands – workforce|author=''[[The Times]]''|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in the British Virgin Islands}}

There are {{convert|113|km|mi|0}} of roads. The main airport ([[Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport]], also known as Beef Island Airport) is located on Beef Island, which lies off the eastern tip of Tortola and is accessible by the [[Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, British Virgin Islands|Queen Elizabeth II Bridge]]. [[Cape Air]], [[LIAT]], BVI Airways and Air Sunshine are amongst the airlines offering scheduled service. Virgin Gorda and Anegada have their own smaller airports. Private air charter services such as Fly BVI and [[Island Birds]] Air Charter fly directly to all three islands from any major airport. The main harbour is in [[Road Town]]. There are also ferries that operate within the British Virgin Islands and to the neighbouring United States Virgin Islands. As in the UK, cars in the British Virgin Islands [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Jurisdictions with left-hand traffic|drive on the left]], however they differ in that nearly all cars are [[left hand drive]],<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/north-central-america/british-virgin-islands/ British Virgin Islands (British Overseas Territory)]</ref> being imported from the United States. The roads are often quite steep, narrow and winding, and ruts can be a problem when it rains.

[[Cyril E. King Airport]] in the US Virgin Islands has flights to a wider range of destinations, so is also used for travelling to the British Virgin Islands.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of the British Virgin Islands}}

As of August 2013, the results of the 2010 census still had not been published. However, census officials have speculated that the final population count will be around 30,000 people reflecting strong population growth.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=Article&articleID=1313535652 http://www.bviplatinum.com  Virgin Islands Platinum News, 17 August 2011 "Census Report Likely To Show Population Increased By Approximately 7,000"]</ref>
At the time of the 2003 census the population was around 21,730. The majority of the population (83%) are [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]], descended from slaves brought to the islands by the British. Other large ethnic groups include those of British and other European origin.

The 2004 Census reports:
* 83.4% [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|African]]
* 7% European/Caucasian
* 9.6% Others*
{{Smaller|* Includes [[Indo-Caribbean|Indian]], Carib/Amerindian, Black/Carib mixed, and mixed-race Hispanic}}

About 4% of the population is of Hispanic origin, irrespective of race, primarily from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The territory has also been recently relieving immigrants from many islands in [[Lesser Antilles]]. The islands are heavily dependent upon migrant labour. In 2004, migrant workers accounted for 50% of the total population. 32% of workers employed in the British Virgin Islands work for the Government.

Unusually, the Territory has one of the highest drowning mortality rates in the world being higher than other high risk countries such as China and India.<ref>[http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.usla.org/resource/resmgr/lifeguard_library/drowningfactsheetwhosep03.pdf "Drowning", publication World Health Organization]</ref> 20% of deaths in the British Virgin Islands during 2012 were recorded as drownings.<ref name="ReferenceA">The BVI Beacon, Thursday, August 15, 2013 article entitled "Report: Passports up, marriages down last year".</ref><ref>Annual Report of the Civil Registry and Passport Office for 2012 which includes "For the 20 percent that represented drowning, all were tourists who died from snorkelling or diving in the VI waters in and around caves at [[Norman Island]], as well as near [[Virgin Gorda]]...The Virgin Islands should, therefore put safety measures in place such as the dissemination of information to hotels, dive shops and marinas." The same report confirms that the deaths of 86 persons were recorded in the Territory during 2012.</ref> All of the drownings were those of tourists.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Virgin Islands}}

===Language===
{{Main|Virgin Islands Creole}}
The primary language is English, although there is a local [[Virgin Islands Creole|dialect]]. Spanish is spoken by [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] and [[Dominican people|Dominican]] immigrants.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of the Virgin Islands}}

The traditional music of the British Virgin Islands is called ''fungi'' after the local [[cornmeal]] dish with the same name, often made with [[okra]]. The special sound of fungi is due to a unique local fusion between African and European music. It functions as a medium of local history and folklore and is therefore a cherished cultural form of expression that is part of the curriculum in BVI schools. The fungi bands, also called "scratch bands", use instruments ranging from [[calabash]], washboard, [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and [[ukulele]], to more traditional western instruments like keyboard, banjo, guitar, bass, triangle and saxophone. Apart from being a form of festive dance music, fungi often contains humorous social commentaries, as well as BVI oral history.<ref>Penn, Dexter J.A. [http://dexterpenn.smugmug.com/gallery/4068409 Music of the British Virgin Islands: Fungi]. Retrieved 13 January 2008.</ref> The popular singer [[Iyaz]] is from the British Virgin Islands. In the music video for his song [[Replay (Iyaz song)|Replay]] he had the flag of the British Virgin Islands in the background.

==Sport==
{{See also|Cricket in the West Indies}}
Because of its location and climate the British Virgin Islands has long been a haven for sailing enthusiasts. Sailing is regarded as one of the foremost sports in all of the BVI. Calm waters and steady breezes provide some of the best sailing conditions in the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Best Sailing|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/caribbean/0217020116.html|accessdate=2011-12-16}}</ref> Many sailing events are held in the waters of this country, the largest of which is a week-long series of races called the Spring Regatta.

This is the premier sailing event of the Caribbean, with several races hosted each day. Boats include everything from full-size mono-hull yachts to dinghies. Captains and their crews come from all around the globe to attend these races. The Spring Regatta is part race, part party, part festival. There are races, games, and music during the day, and some partying at night. The Spring Regatta is normally held during the first week of April.<ref>http://www.vacationtortola.com/Yacht-Races.html</ref>
