'''Diogo Cão''' ({{IPA-pt|diˈoɣu ˈkɐ̃w̃}}; in old [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: '''Cam''') was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[exploration|explorer]] and one of the most notable [[navigators]] of the [[Age of Discovery]], who made two voyages sailing along the west coast of [[Africa]] to [[Namibia]] in the 1480s.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Armas Diogo Cão.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Diogo Cão's Coat of Arms]]
He was born in [[Vila Real, Portugal|Vila Real]] (some say in [[Évora]]), in the middle of the 15th century, ca. 1452, the illegitimate son of Álvaro Fernandes or Gonçalves Cão, [[fidalgo]] of the [[Royal Household]], himself the illegitimate son of Gonçalo Cão. He married and had four children: Pedro Cão, Manuel Cão, André Afonso Cão, and Isabel Cão.

He was the first European known to sight and enter the [[Congo River]] and to explore the West African coast between [[Cape St. Catherine]] and [[Cape Cross]], almost from the [[equator]] to [[Walvis Bay]] in Namibia.

===First voyage===
When King [[John II of Portugal]] revived the work of [[Henry the Navigator]], he sent out Cão (about midsummer (?) 1482) to open up the African coast still further beyond the [[equator]]. The mouth and [[estuary]] of the Congo was now discovered (perhaps in August 1482), and marked by a [[Padrão]], or stone pillar (still existing, but only in fragments) erected on [[Shark Point]], attesting the sovereignty of [[Portugal]]; the great river was also ascended for a short distance, and intercourse was opened with the natives of the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Bakongo]] kingdom. Cão then coasted down along the present [[Angola]] (Portuguese West Africa), and erected a second pillar, probably marking the termination of this voyage, at [[Cape Santa Maria]] (the Monte Negro of these first visitors). He certainly returned to Lisbon by the beginning of April 1484, when John II ennobled him, made him a cavaleiro ([[knight]]) of his [[household]] (he was already an escudeiro or [[esquire]] in the same), and granted him an annuity and a coat of arms (April 8, 1484 and April 14, 1484). In the return he discovered the Island of [[Annobón]].

===Second voyage===
That Cão, on his second voyage of 1484-1486, was accompanied by [[Martin Behaim]] (as alleged on the latter's [[Nuremberg]] globe of 1492) is very doubtful. But it is known that the explorer revisited the Congo and erected two more pillars beyond the furthest of his previous voyage. The first was at another Monte Negro, the second at [[Cape Cross]]. The Cape Cross pillar probably marked the end of his progress southward, some 1,400 kilometers. Cão ascended the [[Congo River]] (which he thought led towards the realm of [[Prester John]]), up to the neighborhood of the site of [[Matadi]]. There, in October or November, 1485, near the falls of [[Ielala]], he left an inscription engraved on the stone which testifies of its passage and that of his men : ''"Aqui chegaram os navios do esclarecido rei D.João II de [[Portugal]] - Diogo Cão, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa."'' ("Here arrived the ships of the enlightned king [[John II of Portugal]] – Diogo Cão, Pero Anes, Pero da Costa”. 

According to one authority (a legend on the 1489 map of [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]]), Cão died off Cape Cross; but [[João de Barros]] and others wrote of his return to the Congo, and subsequent taking of a native envoy to Portugal. The four pillars set up by Cão on his two voyages have all been discovered ''in situ'', and the inscriptions on two of them from Cape Santa Maria and Cape Cross, dated 1482 and 1485 respectively, are still to be read and have been printed. The Cape Cross padrão is now at [[Kiel]] (replaced on the spot by a granite facsimile); those from the Congo estuary and the more southerly Monte Negro are in the Museum of the Lisbon Geographical Society.

==In literature==

Diogo Cão is the subject of ''Padrão'', one of the best-known poems in [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s book [[Mensagem]], the only one published during the author's lifetime. He also figures strongly in the 1996 novel ''Lord of the Kongo'' by [[Peter Forbath]].
