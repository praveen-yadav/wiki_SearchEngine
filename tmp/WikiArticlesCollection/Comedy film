'''Comedy film''' is a genre of [[film]] in which the main emphasis is on [[humour]]. These films are designed to entertain the audience through amusement, and often work by exaggerating characteristics of real life for humorous effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/comedyfilms.html |title=Comedy Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> 

Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (the [[black comedy]] being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/comedyfilms2.html |title=Comedy Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> Comedy, unlike other [[film genre]]s, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former [[stand-up comics]] transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as ''[[Wag the Dog]]'' and ''[[Man of the Year (2006 film)|Man of the Year]]'').

==Types==
A '''[[comedy of manners]]''' film satirises the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. The plot of the comedy is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].

'''Slapstick'''  ([[The Three Stooges]] is an excellent example of this kind of comedy) relies predominately on visual depictions of events, and therefore does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies.

In a '''fish out of water comedy film''', the main character or character finds himself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humour. Situations can be swapping gender roles, as in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982); an age changing role, as in ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in ''[["Crocodile" Dundee]]'', and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comic effect. Some films including people fitting the "fish-out-of-water" bill including ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' and ''[[A Serious Man]]''.

A '''[[Parody film|parody or spoof film]]''' is a comedy that satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974).

The '''anarchic comedy film''', as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority.<ref>{{cite web|title=Absurd Comedy|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/absurd-comedy-d622|publisher=Allmovies}}</ref>  The genre dates from the silent era, and the most famous examples of this type of film would be those produced by [[Monty Python]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sexton|first=Timothy|title=Anarchic Comedy from the Silent Era to Monty Python|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/news/anarchic-comedy-silent-era-monty-python-173500945.html|publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}</ref>   Others include ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933) and ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' .

The '''[[black comedy]]''' film deals with normally [[taboo]] subjects, including, death, murder, sexual relations, suicide and war, in a satirical manner.  Examples include ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The Loved One]]'' (1965), ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989), ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989), ''[[Your Friends & Neighbors]]'' (1998), ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), and ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008).

'''[[Gross out]] films''' are a relatively recent development, and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or "toilet" humour. Examples include ''[[Porky's]]'' (1982), ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (1994), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999).

The '''[[romantic comedy film]]''' sub-genre typically involves the development of a relationship between a man and a woman. The stereotyped plot line follows the "boy-gets-girl", "boy-loses-girl", "boy gets girl back again" sequence. Naturally there are innumerable variants to this plot, and much of the generally light-hearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tensions between the pair. Examples of this style of film include ''[[It's a Wonderful World (1939 film)|It's a Wonderful World]]'' (1939), ''[[The Shop Around the Corner]]'' (1940), ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), and ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994).

It was not uncommon for the early [[romantic comedy film]] to also be a '''[[screwball comedy film]]'''. This form of comedy film was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty [[repartee]], some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and more recently ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972).

===Hybrid genres===
====Action comedy====
Films in this sub-genre blend comic antics and action where the film stars combine wit and one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as [[Eddie Murphy]] started taking more action oriented roles such as in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. These type of films are often [[buddy films]], with mismatched partners such as in ''[[Midnight Run]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''. [[Slapstick]] [[martial arts films]] became a mainstay of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] through the work of [[Jackie Chan]] among others. It may also focus on [[superhero]]es such as ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'' or ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]''.

====Comedy horror====
Comedy horror is a type of horror film in which the usual dark themes are treated with a humorous approach. These films are either use goofy horror clichés such as in ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Haunted Mansion (film)|Haunted Mansion]]'' and ''[[Scary Movie]]'' where campy styles are favoured.  Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as ''[[An American Werewolf In London]]''. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over the top violence and gore such as in ''[[Dead Alive]]'' (1992), ''[[Evil Dead]]'' (1981), and ''[[Club Dread]]'' - such films are sometimes known as ''splatstick'', a portmanteau of the words ''splatter'' and ''slapstick''. It would be reasonable to put ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in this category.

====Fantasy comedy====
Fantasy comedy films are types of films that uses [[magic (fantasy)|magic]], [[supernatural]] and or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning many of the fantasy conventions on their head such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool, the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' and ''[[Shrek]]''.

====Sci-fi comedy====
Sci-fi comedy films, like most hybrid genre of comedy use the elements of [[science fiction films]] to over the top extremes and exaggerated science fiction stereotypical characters. Examples of these types of films include ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Evolution (film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Innerspace]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', ''[[Men in Black (series)|Men in  Black]]'' and ''[[The World's End]]''.

====Military comedy====
{{anchor|Service comedy}}Military comedy films involve comic situations in a military setting.  When a film is primarily about the experience of civilians called into military service and being trained, it may be referred to as a "service comedy".  Military and service comedies include:

==History==
===1895&ndash;1930===
Comic films began to appear in significant numbers during the era of silent films, roughly 1895 to 1930. The visual humour of many of these silent films relied on slapstick and [[burlesque]]. A very early comedy short was ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé|Watering the Gardener]]'' (1895) by the [[Lumière brothers]]. In American film, the most prominent comic actors of the silent era were [[Charlie Chaplin]] (although born in England, his success was principally in the U.S.), [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]]. In his native France and throughout the world, [[Max Linder]] was a major comic feature and might qualify as the first true film star.

A popular trend during the 1920s and afterward was comedy in the form of animated cartoons. Several popular characters of the period received the cartoon treatment. Among these were [[Felix the Cat]], [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], and [[Betty Boop]].

===1930&ndash;1950s===
Toward the end of the 1920s, the introduction of sound into movies made possible dramatic new film styles and the use of verbal humour. During the 1930s, the silent film comedy was replaced by dialogue from film comedians such as the [[W. C. Fields]] and the [[Marx Brothers]]. [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], who had made a number of very popular short silent films, used the arrival of sound to deepen their well-formed screen characterizations and enhance their visual humour, and went on to great success in talking films. The comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] was one of the last silent film hold-outs, and his films during the 1930s were devoid of dialogue, although they did employ sound effects.

Screwball comedies, such as produced by [[Frank Capra]], exhibited a pleasing, idealized climate that portrayed reassuring social values and a certain optimism about everyday life. Movies still included slapstick humour and other physical comedy, but these were now frequently supplemental to the verbal interaction. Another common comic production from the 1930s was the short subject. [[Hal Roach]] Studio specialized in this form. While [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] was prolific, producing 190 [[Three Stooges]] releases, alone. These non-feature productions only went into decline in the 1950s when they were migrated to the television.

In the [[United Kingdom]], film adaptations of stage [[farce]]s were popular in the early 1930s, while the [[music hall]] tradition strongly influenced film comedy into the 1940s with [[Will Hay]] and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]] among the top comedy stars of the time. In England in the late 1940s, [[Ealing Studios]] achieved popular success as well as critical acclaim with a series of films known collectively as the "Ealing comedies", from 1947 to 1957. They usually included a degree of social comment, and featured ensemble casts which often included [[Alec Guinness]] or [[Stanley Holloway]]. Among the most famous examples were ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' (1951) and ''
[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955).

With the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], [[Hollywood]] became focused on themes related to the conflict. Comedies portrayed military themes such as service, civil defense, boot-camp and shore-leave. The war-time restrictions on travel made this a boom time for Hollywood, and nearly a quarter of the money spent on attending movies.

The post-war period was an age of reflection on the war, and the emergence of a competing medium, the television. In 1948, television began to acquire commercial momentum and by the following year there were nearly a hundred television transmitters in American cities.

By the 1950s, the television industry had become a serious competition for the movie industry. Despite the technological limitations of the TV medium at the time, more and more people chose to stay home to watch the television. The Hollywood studios at first viewed the television as a threat, and later as a commercial market. Several comic forms that had previously been a staple of movie theaters transitioned to the television. Both the short subject and the cartoon now appeared on the television rather than in the theater, and the "B" movie also found its outlet on the television.

As television became filled with family-oriented comedies, the 1950s saw a trend toward more adult social situations. Only the [[Walt Disney]] studios continued to steadily release family comedies. The release of comedy films also went into a decline during this decade. In 1947 almost one in five films had been comic in nature, but by 1954 this was down to ten percent.

The 1950s saw the decline of past comedy stars and a certain paucity of new talent in Hollywood. Among the few popular new stars during this period were [[Judy Holliday]] and the comedy team phenom of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]]. Lewis followed the legacy of such comedians as Keaton and Harold Lloyd, but his work was not well received by critics in the United States (in contrast to [[France]] where he proved highly popular.)

The [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film industry]] produced a number of highly successful film series, however, including the [[Doctor in the House|Doctor series]], the [[St. Trinian's]] films and the increasingly bawdy ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' films. [[John and Roy Boulting]] also wrote and directed a series of successful [[satire]]s, including ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956) and ''[[I'm All Right, Jack]]'' (1959). As in the United States, in the next decade much of this talent would move into television.

A number of French comedians were also able to find an [[English language|English speaking]] audience in the 1950s, including [[Fernandel]] and [[Jacques Tati]].

===1960s&ndash;1980s===
The next decade saw an increasing number of broad, star-packed comedies including ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), ''[[Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965). By the middle of the decade, some of the 1950s generation of American comedians, such as [[Jerry Lewis]], went into decline, while [[Peter Sellers]] found success with international audiences in his first American film ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]''. The bumbling [[Inspector Clouseau]] was a character Sellers would continue to return to over the next decade.

Toward the end of the 1950s, darker humour and more serious themes had begun to emerge, including satire and social commentary. ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) was a satirical comedy about [[Cold War]] paranoia, while ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967) featured sexual themes in a way that would have been impossible only a few years previously.

In 1970, the [[black comedy|black comedies]] ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch 22]]'' and ''[[M*A*S*H (film)|M*A*S*H]]'' reflected the anti-war sentiment then prevalent, as well as treating the sensitive topic of suicide. ''M*A*S*H'' would be toned down and brought to television in the following decade as a long-running series.

Among the leading lights in comedy films of the next decade were [[Woody Allen]] and [[Mel Brooks]]. Both wrote, directed and appeared in their movies. Brooks' style was generally slapstick and zany in nature, often parodying film styles and [[genre]]s, including [[Universal Horror|Universal horror films]] (''[[Young Frankenstein]]''), [[western (genre)|westerns]] (''[[Blazing Saddles]]'') and [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] films (''[[High Anxiety]]''). Following his success on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and on film with ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'' [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]] Neil Simon would also be prominent in the 1970s, with films like ''[[The Sunshine Boys (film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]''. Other notable film comedians who appeared later in the decade were [[Richard Pryor]], [[Steve Martin]] and [[Burt Reynolds]].

Most [[British comedy]] films of the early 1970s were spin-offs of [[television series]], including ''[[Dad's Army]]'' and ''[[On the Buses]]''. The greatest successes, however, came with the films of the [[Monty Python]] team, including ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'' (1971), ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' in 1979.

In 1980, the gag-based comedy ''[[Airplane!]]'', a [[Parody|spoof]] of the previous decade's disaster film series was released and paved the way for more of the same including ''[[Top Secret!]]'' (1984) and the ''[[Naked Gun]]'' films. Popular comedy stars in the 1980s included [[Dudley Moore]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Many had come to prominence on the American TV series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', including [[Bill Murray]], [[Steve Martin]] and [[Chevy Chase]]. Eddie Murphy made a success of comedy-[[action film]]s including ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982) and the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' series (1984&ndash;1993).

Also popular were the films of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] such as ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''. He would later become best known for the ''[[Home Alone]]'' series of the early 1990s. The latter film helped a revival in comedies aimed at a family audience, along with ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'' and its sequels.

===1990s–2010s===
One of the major developments of the 1990s was the re-emergence of the romantic comedy film, encouraged by the success of ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' in 1989. Other examples included ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' (1995) and ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' (1998) from the [[United States of America|United States]], and ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' (1998) and ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' (1999) from the [[United Kingdom]]. Spoofs remained popular as well, especially with the ''[[Scary Movie]]'' series and ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'' series.

Probably more representative of [[British humour]] were the working class comedies ''[[Brassed Off]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Full Monty]]'' (1997). Other [[British comedy|British comedies]] examined the role of the [[Asian people|Asian]] community in British life, including ''[[Bhaji on the Beach]]'' (1993), ''[[East Is East (film)|East Is East]]'' (1999), ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002), ''[[Anita and Me]]'' (2003) and ''[[Death at a Funeral (2007 film)|Death at a Funeral]]''.

Also there were "stoner" comedies, which usually involve two guys on an adventure with random things happening to them along the way. Big movies of this sub-genre would be "[[The Big Lebowski]]", ''[[Dude, Where's My Car]]'', ''[[Big Nothing]]'', ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]'', and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''. These movies usually have drug-related jokes and crude content.

Another development was the increasing use of "[[gross-out humour]]" usually aimed at a younger audience, in films like ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' and its sequels, and ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]''. In mid-2000s, the trend of "gross-out" movies is continuing, with adult-oriented comedies picking up the box office. But serious black comedies (also known as dramatic comedies or [[dramedy|dramedies]]) were performing also well, such as ''[[The Weather Man]]'', ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' and ''[[Shopgirl]]''. In late 2006, ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' blended vulgar humour with cultural satire.
