The '''Cornish Nationalist Party''' (CNP), {{lang-kw|Party Kenethlegek Kernow}}, was a [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]], led by Dr [[James Whetter]] which campaigned for [[independence]] for [[Cornwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partikenethlekkernewek.fortunecity.com/index1.html |title=Cornwall's full potential as an independent nation  |publisher=Partikenethlekkernewek.fortunecity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> It was formed by people who left Cornwall's main nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] on 28 May 1975.<ref name="autogenerated1">''Mebyon Kernow and Cornish Nationalism'' by Dick Cole, Bernard Deacon, and Gary Tregidda</ref>

A separate party with a similar name (the Cornish National Party)<ref name="autogenerated1"/> existed from 1969.<ref>[http://www.gosw.gov.uk/gosw/docs/254795/dev_of_language_literature.doc In 1969 a CNP was formed.]</ref> 

The split with [[Mebyon Kernow]] was down to the same debate that was occurring in most of the political parties campaigning for [[self-governance|autonomy]] from the United Kingdom at the time (for example the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]]), whether to be a [[centre-left]] party appealing to the electorate on a [[social democracy|social democratic]] line, or whether to appeal emotionally on a [[centre-right]] cultural line. Another subject of the split was whether to embrace [[devolution]] as a first step to full [[independence]] (or as the sole step if this was what the electorate wished) or for it to be "all or nothing".

The CNP essentially represented a more [[right wing]] outlook, who were not willing to accept that economic arguments were more likely to win votes than cultural. The CNP worked to preserve the identity of Cornwall and improve its economy, and encouraged links with Cornish people overseas and with other regions which have distinct identities. It also gave support to the Cornish language, and commemorated [[Thomas Flamank]], a leader of the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497|Cornish Rebellion]] in 1497, at an annual ceremony at [[Bodmin]] on 27 June each year.

While the CNP were not a racist organisation there was a perceived image problem relating to the similarly-styled [[British National Party]] (BNP). Today, the Cornish Nationalist Party is seen as more of a pressure group as they do not put up candidates for any elections, although their visibility and influence within Cornwall is negligible. {{As of|2012}}, they are not registered on the UK political parties register; [[Mebyon Kernow]] are the only registered political party based in Cornwall{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. A news story appeared in April 2009 claiming that the CNP had reformed following a conference in [[Bodmin]],<ref name="thisiscornwall1">http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/news/Cornish-Nationalist-Party-regroups-contest-elections/article-876558-detail/article.html</ref> however it did not contest any elections that year.

Dr Whetter and the CNP still publish a quarterly journal, ''The Cornish Banner'' (''An Baner Kernewek''). This is done within the actions of the Roseland Institute.
