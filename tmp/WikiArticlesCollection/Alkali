In [[chemistry]], an '''alkali''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|k|əl|aɪ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''al-qaly'' القلي, القالي ) is a [[base (chemistry)|basic]], [[ionic compound|ionic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of an [[alkali metal]] or [[alkaline earth metal]] [[chemical element]]. Some authors also define an alkali as a base that dissolves in [[water]]. A solution of a soluble base has a [[pH]] greater than 7.0. The [[adjective]] '''alkaline''' is commonly, and  '''alkalescent''' less often, used in [[English language|English]] as a [[synonym]] for basic, especially for [[soluble]] bases. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the [[acid-base reaction theories|Arrhenius]] definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.

==Etymology==
The word "alkali" is derived from Arabic ''al qalīy'' (or ''alkali''),<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chambers's encyclopaedia]]: a dictionary of universal knowledge, Volume 1|publisher=J.B. Lippincott & Co|year=1888|page=148}}</ref> meaning ''the calcined ashes'' (see [[calcination]]), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called [[potash]] and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with [[calcium hydroxide]] (''slaked lime''), a far more strongly basic substance known as ''caustic potash'' ([[potassium hydroxide]]) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft [[soap]]s, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of [[saponification]], one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element [[potassium]], which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol '''K''' (from the German name [[Kalium]]), which ultimately derived from al'''k'''ali.

==Common properties==
Alkalis are all Arrhenius bases, ones which form hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous [[solution]]s include:
* Moderately concentrated solutions (over 10<sup>−3</sup> M) have a pH of 7.1 or greater. This means that they will turn [[phenolphthalein]] from colorless to pink.
* Concentrated solutions are [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] (causing chemical burns).
* Alkaline solutions are slippery or soapy to the touch, due to the [[saponification]] of the fatty substances on the surface of the skin.
* Alkalis are normally [[solubility|water soluble]], although some like [[barium carbonate]] are only soluble when reacting with an acidic aqueous solution.

==Difference between alkali and base==
The terms "base" and "alkali" are often used interchangeably, particularly outside of the context of [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]].

There are various definitions for the concept of an alkali. Alkalis are  sometimes defined as a subset of the bases. However, two subsets are commonly chosen.
* A basic salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=alkali Alkali | Define Alkali at Dictionary.com]. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.</ref> (This includes Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> but excludes NH<sub>3</sub>.)

The second subset of bases is also called an "Arrhenius base".

==Alkali salts==

Alkali salts are soluble hydroxides of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], of which common examples are:

* [[Sodium hydroxide]] (often called "caustic soda")
* [[Potassium hydroxide]] (commonly called "caustic potash")
* [[wikt:lye|lye]] (generic term, for either of the previous two, or even for a mixture)
* [[Calcium hydroxide]] (saturated solution known as "[[limewater]]")
* [[Magnesium hydroxide]] is an example of an atypical alkali since it has low solubility in water (although the dissolved portion is considered a strong base due to complete dissociation of its ions).

==Alkaline soil==
Soils with pH values higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline. These soils can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although some plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like [[cabbage]] and fodder like [[buffalograss]]{{dn|date=September 2013}}), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with pHs between 6.0 and 6.8), and [[alkaline soil]]s can cause problems.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chambers's encyclopaedia]]: a dictionary of universal knowledge, Volume 1|publisher=J.B. Lippincott & Co|year=1888|page=148}}</ref>

==Alkali lakes==

In ''[[alkali lake]]s'' (or ''[[soda lake]]s''), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts, giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake.

Examples of alkali lakes:
*[[Alkali Lake (Oregon)|Alkali Lake]], [[Lake County, Oregon]] 
*[[Baldwin Lake (San Bernardino County, California)|Baldwin Lake]], [[San Bernardino County, California]]
*[[Mono lake]], near [[Owens Valley]] in [[California]]
*[[Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan]] <!-- Not Blueberry lake, ref see http://www.pnr-rpn.ec.gc.ca/nature/whp/sanctuaries/dc01s12.en.html -->
*[[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]], [[Lake County, Oregon]]
*[[Tramping Lake, Saskatchewan]]
*[[Lake Magadi]] in Kenya
*[[Lake Turkana]] in [[Kenya]] (the largest alkali lake in the world)
* There are also alkali lakes in the outback of [[Australia]].
