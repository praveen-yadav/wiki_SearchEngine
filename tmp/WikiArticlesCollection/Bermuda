Its nearest [[landmass]] is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], about {{convert|1030|km}} to the west-northwest. It is about {{convert|1239|km}} south of [[Cape Sable Island]], [[Nova Scotia]], and {{convert|1770|km}} northeast of [[Miami]]. Its [[capital city]] is [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]].

Bermuda was discovered in 1505 by [[Spain|Spanish]] sea captain [[Juan de Bermúdez]], after whom the islands are named. He claimed the apparently uninhabited islands for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Although he paid two visits to the archipelago, Bermúdez never landed on the islands because he did not want to risk crossing over the dangerous [[reef]] surrounding them. Subsequent Spanish or other visitors are believed to have released the [[feral]] pigs that were abundant on the island when European settlement began. In 1609, the [[Virginia Company]], which had established [[Virginia]] and [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] on the American continent two years earlier, established a settlement, founded in the aftermath of a hurricane, when the crew of the sinking ''[[Sea Venture]]'' steered it on the reef so they could get ashore.

It was first administered as an extension of Virginia by the Company until 1614, before its successor, the [[Somers Isles Company]], took over until 1684. At that time, the company's charter was revoked and the Crown took over administration. The islands became a British colony following the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 unification]] of the parliaments of Scotland and England, which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] became part of Canada in 1949, Bermuda became the oldest (and, since the return of [[Hong Kong]] to China in 1997, the most populous) remaining British Overseas Territory. Its first capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], was established in 1612. It is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the New World.<ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web |title=Bermuda – History and Heritage |date=6 November 2007 |work=Smithsonian|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html |accessdate=3 December 2008}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Bermuda}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

Bermuda is a group of low-lying islands located in the Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the [[Sargasso Sea]], roughly 580 [[nautical miles]] ({{convert|1070|km|0|abbr=on}}) east-southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]] on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] and roughly 590 nautical miles ({{convert|1100|km|0|abbr=on}}) southeast of [[Martha's Vineyard]] of [[Massachusetts]]. It is 898.2 nautical miles ({{convert|1663.5|km|1|abbr=on}}) from [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]], and 667.374 nautical miles ({{convert|1235.976|km|2|abbr=on}}) from [[Cape Sable Island]], in [[Nova Scotia, Canada|Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. The island lies due east of [[Fripp Island]], [[South Carolina]]. It has {{convert|103|km|0|abbr=on}} of coastline. The two [[Corporation|incorporated]] [[Municipal government|municipalities]] in Bermuda are the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] and the [[St. George, Bermuda|Town of St George]]. Bermuda is divided into nine parishes, which have some localities called villages, such as [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]] and [[Somerset Village, Bermuda|Somerset Village]].
[[File:View from top of Gibbs Lighthouse Bermuda.jpg|right|thumb|View from the top of Gibb's Hill Lighthouse]]

Although usually referred to in the singular, the territory consists of 181{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} islands, with a total area of {{convert|53.3|km2|1|abbr=off}}. The largest island is ''Main Island'', sometimes called Bermuda. Compiling a list of the islands is often complicated, as many have more than one name (as does the entire archipelago, which has also been known historically as ''La Garza'', ''Virgineola'', and the ''Isle of Devils''. Somers Isles is often rendered "Somers Islands", or mistaken for "Summer Isles"). Despite its small land mass, place names are repeated; there are, for example, two islands named ''Long Island,'' three bays named ''Long Bay'' (on Somerset, Main, and Cooper's islands), two Horseshoe Bays (one in Warwick, on the Main Island, the other at Morgan's Point, formerly Tucker's Island), there are two roads through cuttings called ''Khyber Pass'' (one in Warwick, the other in St. George's Parish), and ''[[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's Town]]'' is located on ''[[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St George's Island]]'' within ''[[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]'' (each known as ''St George's''). There is a [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|Hamilton Parish]] in addition to the City of Hamilton (which is in [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke Parish]]).

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Bermuda}}
[[File:Bermuda wv.jpg|right|thumb|Residential scene in Bermuda]]
Bermuda has a [[humid subtropical climate]]<ref name=climate/><ref>{{cite web |last=Ritter |first= Michael E. |title=The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography |year=2006 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_subtropical.html |accessdate=28 October 2008}}</ref> on the border of [[tropical climate]]. It is warmed by the nearby [[Gulf Stream]], due to the [[westerlies]], which carry warm, humid air eastwards over Bermuda, helping to keep winter temperatures above freezing. The climate is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Winters are mild and windy, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, although [[cold front]]s bring Arctic [[air mass]]es that can result in rapid temperature drops. Atlantic winter storms, often associated with these cold fronts, can produce powerful, gusting winds and heavy rain. Factoring in the [[wind chill]], the [[felt air temperature]] in winter can fall below freezing, {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, even though the actual temperature rarely drops below {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature recorded between 1949 and 1999 was {{convert|6.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}, in February 1950.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Summary for January 2009|publisher=[[Bermuda Weather Service]]|date=4 February 2003|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2009-02.html|accessdate =25 February 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Bermuda is within the [[tropical cyclone|hurricane belt]]. Located along the Gulf Stream, it is often directly in the path of hurricanes recurving in the westerlies, although they usually begin to weaken as they approach the island. The island's small size means that direct [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] of hurricanes are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to Bermuda was [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 3]] [[Hurricane Fabian]] on 5 September 2003.

The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall, which is collected on roofs and catchments (or drawn from underground lenses) and stored in tanks. Each dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.

The average annual temperature of the sea is {{convert|73.1|°F|1}}, from {{convert|65.4|°F|1}} in February to {{convert|82.8|°F|1}} in August.<ref name=BWS/>

===Flora and fauna===
{{main|Flora and fauna in Bermuda}}
[[File:Juvenile Bermuda Cedar at Ferry Reach.jpg|thumb|Young Bermuda cedar at Ferry Reach]]

When discovered, Bermuda was uninhabited and mostly dominated by forests of [[Juniperus bermudiana|Bermuda cedar]], with [[mangrove]] [[marsh]]es along its shores. Only 165 of the island's current 1000 [[vascular plant]] species are considered [[indigenous (ecology)|native]], and of those 15, including the cedar, are [[endemism|endemic]].

Many species of palm trees have been introduced to Bermuda.  [[Coconut palms]] are found on Bermuda making it the furthest north location for the natural growth of this species.  While coconuts grow on Bermuda, the lack of heat does not usually allow them to properly set fruit.

The only [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] [[mammal]]s of Bermuda are five species of bats, all of which also occur in the eastern United States: ''[[Lasionycteris noctivagans]]'', ''[[Lasiurus borealis]]'', ''[[Lasiurus cinereus]]'', ''[[Lasiurus seminolus]]'' and ''[[Perimyotis subflavus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grady, F.V. and Olson, S.L. |year=2006|title= Fossil bats from Quaternary deposits on Bermuda (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae)|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume= 87|issue=1|pages=148–152|doi=10.1644/05-MAMM-A-179R1.1}}</ref> Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda includes its national bird, the [[Bermuda Petrel]] or Cahow. It was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s, and is important as an example of a [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus]] species. The government has a program to protect it, including restoration of a habitat area. The [[Bermuda Rock Skink]] was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species of [[terrapin]], previously thought to have been introduced, predated the arrival of humans in the archipelago. As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status.

==History==
{{main|History of Bermuda}}

===Pre-settlement===
Bermuda was discovered in 1505 by Spanish explorer [[Juan de Bermudez]].<ref name=Morison1974>{{cite book |last=Morison III |first=Samuel |title=The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492–1616 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1974 |location=New York |page=}}</ref> It is mentioned in ''Legatio Babylonica'', published in 1511 by historian [[Pedro Mártir|Pedro Mártir de Anglería]], and was also included on Spanish charts of that year. Both Spanish and Portuguese ships used the islands as a replenishment spot to take on fresh meat and water. Legends arose of [[spirit]]s and devils, now thought to have stemmed from the calls of raucous birds (most likely the [[Bermuda Petrel]], or ''Cahow'') and the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs. Combined with the frequent storm-wracked conditions and the dangerous reefs, the archipelago became known as the '''Isle of Devils.''' Neither Spain nor Portugal tried to settle it.

===Settlement by the English===
[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] wrote one of the first [[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles|histories of Bermuda]] (in concert with [[Virginia]] and [[New England]]).]]
For the next century, the island is believed to have been visited frequently, but not settled. After the failure of the first two English colonies in Virginia, a more determined effort was initiated by King [[James I of England]] (James VI of Scotland), who granted a Royal Charter to the [[Virginia Company]].

It established a colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. Two years later, a [[flotilla]] of seven ships left England under the Company's Admiral, Sir [[George Somers]], and the new Governor of Jamestown, Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], with several hundred settlers, food and supplies to relieve the colony of Jamestown.<ref>{{cite web| title=Sir George Somers (1554–1610)| author=Mark Nicholls| publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia| url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Somers_Sir_George_1554-1610 |  date=3 May 2011}}</ref> Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir [[Francis Drake]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. The flotilla was broken up by a storm. As the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was taking on water, the Admiral of the company, drove it on the reef and gained the shores safely with smaller boats - all the 150 passengers and a dog survived. They stayed 10 months, starting a new settlement and building two small ships to sail to Jamestown. (William Shakespeare's play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' is thought to have been inspired by [[William Strachey]]'s account of this shipwreck.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=Hobson |title=A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest |publisher=Viking |year=2009 |pages=191–199}}</ref> The island was claimed for the English Crown, and the charter of the Virginia Company was later extended to include it.

In 1610, all but three of the survivors of the ''Sea Venture'' sailed on to Jamestown. Among them was [[John Rolfe]], whose wife and child died and were buried in Bermuda. Later in Jamestown he married [[Pocahontas]], a daughter of the powerful [[Chief Powhatan|Powhatan]], leader of a large confederation of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes. In 1612 intentional settlement of Bermuda began with the arrival of the ship ''Plough.'' St George's was settled that year and designated as Bermuda's first capital. It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the [[New World]].<ref name=Smithsonian/>

In 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]], named after the admiral who saved his passengers from the ''Sea Venture''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bearboat.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/tvlbt-bda-bd-11feb09_sailingtravel1.pdf |format=PDF|title=Bermuda's 400th Birthday |publisher=Bearboa.files.wordpress.com |date=11 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-attractions.com/bermuda_0002ae.htm |title=Somers Garden |publisher=Bermuda, Bermuda-attractions.com}}</ref> Many Virginian place names refer to the archipelago, such as Bermuda City, and [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]]. The first British coins to circulate in North America were struck in Bermuda.

===Company colony===
Because of its limited land area, Bermuda has had difficulty with over-population. In the first two centuries of settlement, it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable. Before the [[American War of Independence|American Revolution]] more than ten thousand Bermudians (over half of the total population through the years) gradually emigrated, primarily to the [[Southern United States|American South]]. As Great Britain displaced Spain as the dominant European imperial power, it opened up more land for colonial development. A steady trickle of outward migration continued. With seafaring the only real industry in the early decades, by the end of the 18th century, at least a third of the island's manpower was at sea at any one time.

The archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the [[New World]]. In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises.<ref>Meggs, Martin. "Developing a Small Island GIS: the Bermuda Experience".  Bermuda Department of Planning.</ref>

In 1649, the [[English Civil War]] raged and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was beheaded in Whitehall, London. In Bermuda, related tensions resulted in civil war on the island; it was ended by militias. The majority of colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the Crown. Dissenters, such as [[Puritan]]s and independents, were pushed to [[the Bahamas]].<ref>Forbes, Keith: [http://www.bermuda-online.org/ "About Bermuda Online"], ''The Royal Gazette'' Ltd.

In the 17th century, the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as it needed Bermudians to farm in order to generate income from the land. Agricultural production met with limited success, however. The Bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to England were reportedly worth more than their contents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the Company's charter in 1684, and the Company was dissolved.

===Maritime economy===
Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the whole island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century.

Bermudian sailors and merchants relied on more than export of salt, however. They vigorously pursued whaling, [[privateering]], and the merchant trade. Vessels sailed the normal shipping routes, but were required to engage an enemy vessel no matter the size or strength. As a result many ships were destroyed.

The [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for speed and maneuverability. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}}, one of the fastest vessels in the [[Royal Navy]], carried the news of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] to England.

===Bermuda and the American War of Independence===
[[American Revolution|American independence]] led to great changes for Bermuda. Prior to the war, with no useful landmass or natural resources, Bermuda was largely ignored and left to its own devices by the London government. By being so deeply involved in trade, Bermuda merchants and financiers had played roles out of proportion to the colony's size in relation to the development of the Triangle Trade, and the trans-Atlantic English and British empires.

Its people were settlers and founders of new colonies, especially in the American South. Its merchant fleet and a web of expatriate Bermudian merchants dominated trade through a number of American [[Atlantic Seaboard]] ports and the West Indies. Bermudians fished for cod on the [[Grand Banks]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and were involved in the lumber industry in [[Central America]]. Most importantly, they dominated the North American salt trade with ''de facto'' control of the [[Turks Islands]].

Had Bermuda not been so remote from the American coastline, and the Royal Navy not enjoyed supremacy on that part of the Atlantic, it would almost certainly have been the fourteenth colony to join the rebellion. The close economic, family, and historical ties ensured Bermudians were strongly sympathetic with the rebels at the start of the War. They supplied the rebels illegally with ships, salt and gunpowder. As the war progressed, economic realities caused Bermudians to seize opportunities; they turned to privateering against the Americans.

The end of the war, however, was to cause profound change in Bermuda, though some of those changes would take decades to crystallise. Following the war, with the build up of Naval and military forces in Bermuda, the primary leg of the Bermudian economy became defence infrastructure. Even after tourism began later in the 19th century, Bermuda remained, in the eyes of London, a base more than a colony. The Crown strengthened its political and economic ties to Bermuda, and the colony's independence on the world stage was diminished.

The war had removed Bermuda's primary trading partners, the American colonies, from the empire, and dealt a harsh blow to Bermuda's merchant shipping trade. This also suffered due to the deforestation of Bermuda, as well as the advent of metal ships and steam propulsion, for which it did not have raw materials. During the course of the following [[War of 1812]], the primary market for Bermuda's salt disappeared as the Americans developed their own sources. Control of the Turks had passed to the [[Bahamas]] in 1819.

By the end of the 19th century, except for naval and military facilities, Bermuda was considered a quiet, rustic backwater. It had been superseded in the development of the English-speaking Atlantic world.

===Fortress Bermuda===
[[File:Devonshire Redoubt (Bermuda).png|thumb|left|An illustration of the Devonshire Redoubt, Bermuda, 1614.]]

After the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours. In 1811, it started building the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|large dockyard]] on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], in the west of the chain, to serve as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. To guard it, the [[British Army]] built up a large [[Bermuda Garrison]], and heavily fortified the archipelago.

During the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States, the British attacks on [[Burning of Washington|Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake]] were planned and launched from Bermuda, where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station had recently been moved from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]].
[[File:The Harbor at St. George, Bermuda from Sugar Loaf Hill.jpg|thumb|right|The harbor at St. George]]In 1816, James Arnold, the son of [[Benedict Arnold]], fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible US attacks.<ref>Howes, James: [http://www.atlascom.us/keys.htm "Attack on Baltimore Launched from Bermuda in 'War of 1812'"] 2005</ref> Today, the National Museum of Bermuda, which incorporates the [http://www.bmm.bm/ "Maritime Museum"], occupies the [[Keep]] of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artefacts of the base's military history.

As a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern US coast, during the American Civil War [[Confederate States]] [[blockade runners]] used it as a base for runs to the South to evade Union naval vessels and deliver much needed war goods from England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a public museum.

===Anglo-Boer War===
During the [[Anglo-Boer War]] (1899–1902), 5,000 [[Boer]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were housed on five islands of Bermuda. They were located according to their views of the war. "Bitterenders" (Afrikaans: [[Bittereinders]]), who refused to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, were interned on Darrell's Island and closely guarded. Other islands such as Morgan's Island held 884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, Burt's Island 607, and Port's Island held 35.<ref>[http://www.angloboerwar.com/other-information/89-prisoner-of-war-camps/1838-camp-for-boers-bermuda Camps for Boers – Bermuda].

The most famous prisoner was [[Fritz Joubert Duquesne]], who escaped from Bermuda during the [[First World War]], settled in the US and became a spy for [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]]. He claimed to have sabotaged and sunk [[HMS Hampshire (1903)|HMS ''Hampshire'']], on which [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the head of the British Army, died in 1916.

Lord Kitchener's brother, Lt. Gen. Sir [[Frederick Walter Kitchener|Walter Kitchener]], had been the [[Governor of Bermuda]] from 1908 until his death in 1912. His son, Major Hal Kitchener, bought [[Hinson's Island, Bermuda|Hinson's Island]] (with his partner, Major Hemming, another First World War aviator). The island had formerly been part of the Boer POW camp, housing teenaged prisoners from 1901 to 1902.

===Economic and political development===
In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by sea. The United States 1930 [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] enacted protective tariffs. It cut off Bermuda's once-thriving agricultural export trade to the US and encouraged its development of tourism as an alternative.

[[File:Bermuda harbour 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Hamilton Harbour in the mid-1920s.]]
After several failed attempts, in 1930 the first aeroplane reached Bermuda. A [[Stinson Detroiter]] seaplane flying from [[New York]], it had to land twice in the ocean: once because of darkness and again to refuel. Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the [[Royal Air Force]] (then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]]) established a station at the Royal Naval Dockyard to repair (and supply replacement) float planes for the fleet. In 1936 [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Luft Hansa]] began to experiment with seaplane flights from [[Berlin]] via the Azores with continuation to New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldqslcards.com/UNUSUAL_PLACE.pdf |format=PDF |title=Unusual Place – Unusual Story – Heroic Crew  |publisher=Oldqslcards.com|accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1937, [[Imperial Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] began operating scheduled flying-boat airline services from New York and [[Baltimore]] to [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda]]. In 1948, regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based aeroplanes began to [[Kindley Air Force Base|Kindley Field]] (now [[L.F. Wade International Airport]]), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s–1970s. By the end of the 1970s, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy (see [[#Economy|Economy of Bermuda]]).

[[File:The Queen of Bermuda in Bermuda, late 1952 or very early 1953.jpg|thumb|The S.S. ''Queen of Bermuda'' in Hamilton Harbour, December 1952{{\}}January 1953.]]
[[File:The Queen of Bermuda departing the island in December 1952 or January 1953.jpg|thumb|The S.S. ''Queen of Bermuda'' departing the island in December 1952{{\}}January 1953.]]
The Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military garrison, continued to be important to Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in [[World War II]], US military installations also were located in Bermuda (see "Military" section below and [[Military of Bermuda]]).

Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, voting was dependent on a certain level of property ownership. (see "Politics" section, below, and [[Politics of Bermuda]]). On 10 March 1973, the Governor of Bermuda [[Richard Sharples]] was assassinated by local [[Black Power]] militants during a period of civil unrest.

==Parishes and municipalities==
[[File:Bermuda-divmap.png|thumb|Parishes of Bermuda.]]

Bermuda is divided into nine [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] and two incorporated [[municipalities]].

Bermuda's nine parishes are:
* [[Devonshire Parish|Devonshire]]
* [[Hamilton Parish|Hamilton]]
* [[Paget Parish|Paget]]
* [[Pembroke Parish|Pembroke]]
* [[Sandys Parish|Sandys]]
* [[Smith's Parish|Smith's]]
* [[Southampton Parish, Bermuda|Southampton]]
* [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's]]
* [[Warwick Parish|Warwick]]

Bermuda's two incorporated municipalities are:
* [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] (city)
* [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] (town)

Bermuda's three informal villages are:
* [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]]
* [[Somerset Village, Bermuda|Somerset Village]]
* [[Tucker's Town, Bermuda|Tucker's Town]]

Jones Village (in Warwick), Cashew City (St. George's), Claytown (Hamilton), Middle Town (Pembroke), and [[Tucker's Town]] (St. George's) are neighborhoods; Dandy Town and North Village are sports clubs, and Harbour View Village is a small [[public housing]] development.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Bermuda}}

The current ruling party in Bermuda is the [[One Bermuda Alliance]], commonly referred to as the OBA. They were voted into power in December 2012 after Bermuda was ruled by the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] for 14 years, from 1998 to 2012.

===State organization===
Executive authority in Bermuda is vested in [[Elizabeth II|the monarch]] and is exercised on her behalf by the [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]]. The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[British Government]]. The current governor is [[George Fergusson (diplomat)|George Fergusson]]; he was sworn in on 23 May 2012.<ref>{{Cite news |title=New Governor : 'challenges are crime and the economy' |date=23 May 2012 |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20120523/NEWS/120529990 |newspaper=Royal Gazette |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> There is also a Deputy Governor (currently David Arkley[[Justice of the Peace|JP]]).<ref>Taylor, Matthew.

It must approve any changes to the Constitution of Bermuda. Bermuda is classified as a British Overseas Territory, but it is the oldest British colony. In 1620, a Royal Assent granted Bermuda limited self-governance; its [[Parliament of Bermuda|Parliament]] is the fifth oldest in the world, behind the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the [[Tynwald]] of the [[Isle of Man]], the [[Althing]] of [[Iceland]], and [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]] of [[Poland]].<ref>Pethen, Valarie: ''Bermuda Report'', Second Edition 1985–1988, p. 17.

The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on 1 June 1967; it was amended in 1989 and 2003. The head of government is the [[Premier of Bermuda|premier]]. A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially by the governor. The legislative branch consists of a [[bicameral parliament]] modelled on the [[Westminster system]]. The [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] is the upper house, consisting of 11 members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and the leader of the opposition. The [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], or lower house, has 36 members, elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to represent geographically defined constituencies.

[[Elections in Bermuda|Elections]] must be called at no more than five-year intervals. The [[Bermudan general election, 2012|most recent]] took place on December 17, 2012. Following this election, the [[One Bermuda Alliance]] took power, with [[Craig Cannonier]] succeeding [[Paula Cox]], of the [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]], as [[List of Premiers of Bermuda|Premier]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Clifford |first=Ivan |title=Bermuda PLP 14-year reign ends with premier also losing seat |url=http://www.caribbean360.com/index.php/news/bermuda_news/645454.html#axzz2FRs2XLhO |publisher=[[Caribbean360]] |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kent |first=Jonathan |title=Cannonier: 'Bermuda has seen a new day' |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20121217/NEWS/712179887 |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=Royal Gazette |date=18 December 2012}}</ref>

There are few accredited diplomats in Bermuda. The United States maintains the largest diplomatic mission in Bermuda, comprising both the United States Consulate and the [[US Customs and Border Protection]] Services at the [[L.F. Wade International Airport]]. The current US Consul General is Robert Settje, who took office in August 2012.  The United States is Bermuda's largest trading partner (providing over 71% of total imports, 85% of tourist visitors, and an estimated $163&nbsp;billion of US capital in the Bermuda insurance/re-insurance industry), and an estimated 5% of Bermuda residents are US citizens, representing 14% of all foreign-born persons). The American diplomatic presence is an important element in the Bermuda political landscape.

===Role in international relations===
As a British Overseas Territory, Bermuda does not have a seat in the [[General Assembly of the United Nations|United Nations]]; it is represented by Britain in matters of [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|foreign affairs]]. To promote its economic interests abroad, Bermuda maintains representative offices in cities such as London<ref>[http://www.londonoffice.gov.bm/ Bermuda Government office in London]. Londonoffice.gov.bm. Retrieved 15 August 2012.</ref> and [[Washington D.C.]]<ref>[http://www.dcoffice.gov.bm/ Bermuda Government office in Washington, D.C.], Dcoffice.gov.bm. Retrieved 15 August 2012.</ref>

Bermuda's proximity to the US had made it attractive as the site for summit conferences between British Prime Ministers and US Presidents. The first summit was held in December 1953, at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], to discuss relations with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Participants included Churchill, US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and French Premier [[Joseph Laniel]].

In 1957, a second summit conference was held. The British Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], arrived earlier than President Eisenhower, to demonstrate they were meeting on British territory, as tensions were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the [[Suez Canal]].  Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. The meeting was called to discuss Cold War tensions arising from construction of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name="Visitors"/>

The most recent summit conference in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1990, when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met US President George Bush.<ref name="Visitors">{{cite web | author=Keith Forbes | title= Bermuda's distinguished visitors over the years | work=Royal Gazette | url= http://www.bermuda-online.org/specialvisitors.htm | accessdate =22 September 2007 }}</ref>

Direct meetings between the President of the United States and the [[Premier of Bermuda]] have been rare. The most recent meeting was on 23 June 2008, between Premier [[Ewart Brown]] and President [[George W. Bush]]. Prior to this, the leaders of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=rg>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Kent|title=Premier meets the President | url=http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d86c3730030004&sectionId=48|work=[[The Royal Gazette]]|date=24 June 2008 |accessdate =24 July 2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref>

They were accused of training to assist [[Taliban]]'s military. They were cleared as safe for release from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006. But US domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China, their country of citizenship, because the US government determined that China was [[human rights in China|likely to violate]] their human rights.

In September 2008, the men were cleared of all suspicion and Judge Ricardo Urbina in Washington ordered their release. However, domestic opposition to their admittance to the United States was very strong{{Citation needed |reason=no one protested |date=May 2010}} and, until Bermuda and [[Palau]] agreed to accept them in June 2009, the US failed to find a home for them.

The secret bilateral discussions that led to prisoner transfers between the US and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from the United Kingdom, which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda being a British territory. The British Foreign Office issued the following statement: "We've underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility. We have made clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate."

As of May 2013 all four Uyghurs still live in Bermuda, however do not posses Bermudian status and remain stateless posing problems for emergency medical situations and finding certain jobs. However, granting them Bermudian status would require a change in Bermudian laws, causing a large debate within Bermuda's parliament on what steps should be taken.<ref>Johnson, Ayo.

====Caribbean Community====
Despite lying nearer to the United States and to Canada, to both of which it historically had political and trade links, than to the Caribbean, Bermuda became an associate member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bermuda-online.org/bdagovt.htm |title= Bermuda Government today |work=Bermuda-Online.org |accessdate =9 July 2010 |quote=In July 2003, Bermuda formally joined the Caribbean Community as an Associate Member (non-voting member), in certain areas but not in others. This specifically excludes free movement of Caribbean nationals to Bermuda, and any prospect of Bermuda joining CARIFTA or its newest free trade organization; the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). Membership of the Caribbean Community costs Bermuda about US$90,000 a year. Direct trade between Bermuda and Caribbean countries is also welcomed and encouraged, especially given the close or extended family links many Bermudians have with Caribbean islands or territories.&nbsp;... All visitors to Bermuda who are nationals of and resident in Caribbean islands must come via the USA or Canada or United Kingdom and must have appropriate visas to come via those countries. Effective January 2003, all Jamaican nationals who are not Bermudian must also have a visa to enter Bermuda on business or vacation.}}</ref><ref>[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/bermuda.jsp?menu=community Bermuda profile], Caribbean Community (CARICOM)</ref>

This is a [[socio-economic]] bloc of nations in or near the Caribbean Sea.  Other outlying member states include the Co-operative Republic of [[Guyana]] and the Republic of [[Suriname]] in South America, along with [[Belize]] in Central America. The [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], an associate member of CARICOM, and the Commonwealth of [[The Bahamas]], a full member of CARICOM, are in the Atlantic, but near to the Caribbean. Other nearby nations or territories, such as the United States, are not members (although the US Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] has [[observer status]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] announced in 2007 they would seek ties with CARICOM). Bermuda, at roughly a thousand miles from the Caribbean Sea, has little trade with, and little economically in common with, the region, and joined primarily to strengthen cultural links.

Among some scholars,{{Who|date=August 2010}} "the Caribbean" can be a socio-historical category, commonly referring to a cultural zone characterised by the legacy of slavery (a characteristic Bermuda shared with the Caribbean and the US) and the plantation system (which did not exist in Bermuda). It embraces the islands and parts of the neighboring continent, and may be extended to include the Caribbean Diaspora overseas.<ref name="acs-aec.org">Norman Girvan (2001) [http://web.archive.org/web/20110615225544/http://www.acs-aec.org/About/SG/Girvan/Speeches/rei1.htm Reinterpreting the Caribbean]. in ''New Caribbean Thought'', Folke Lindahl and Brian Meeks (eds.), UWI Press. pp. 3 ff.

Although Bermuda began as an extension of Virginia and has long had close ties with the US Atlantic Seaboard and Canadian Maritimes as well as the UK, the last century has seen considerable immigration from the [[West Indies]] (the last century and a half has also seen continued immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands, although these immigrants faced greater difficulties in making their immigration permanent, as they lacked British citizenship, mostly spoke no English, and required renewal of work permits in order to remain beyond an initial period. From the 1950s onwards, immigration laws were relaxed, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada, which many Black politicians accused the government of using as a ploy to counter the West Indian immigration that had already been continuing for decades, and which had resulted in a shift of the balance of Blacks to Whites in Bermuda).

The PLP, the party in government when the decision to join CARICOM was made, has been dominated for decades by West Indians (the prominent roles of West Indians among Bermuda's black politicians and labour activists predating party politics in Bermuda, as exemplified by Dr. [[E. F. Gordon]]),<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110616/ISLAND11/706149914/-1 The Royal Gazette:] "Dr EF Gordon – fought tirelessly for equal rights for black Bermudians". 14 June 2011.</ref> and the descendants of West Indians (such as Dame [[Lois Browne-Evans]]), and places a strong emphasis on Bermuda's connection with the West Indies, though many Bermudians, Black or White, without West Indian forebears objected strenuously (despite the political power achieved by West Indian-Bermudians, West Indians have long been subjected to the animosity of ethnic-Bermudians, Black and White, who derided them as "jump-ups").

Opinion polls conducted by Bermudian newspapers, ''The Royal Gazette'' and ''The Bermuda Sun'', showed clear majorities of Bermudians as opposed to joining CARICOM. The UBP, which had been in Government from 1968 to 1998, objected on the basis that joining CARICOM was detrimental to Bermuda's interests: Other than large-scale West Indian immigration to Bermuda throughout the 20th century, Bermuda's trade with the West Indies is negligible, its primary economic partners being the US, Canada, and UK (there are not even direct air or shipping links); CARICOM is moving towards a single economy, which Bermuda would not be able to form part of without disastrous effects on its own economy; the Caribbean islands are generally competitors to Bermuda's already ailing tourism industry; participation in CARICOM would involve considerable investment of money and the time of government officials that could more profitably be spent elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20021219/COMMENT/312199980 Welcome to Caricom].

Once known as "the Gibraltar of the West" and "Fortress Bermuda", the defence of Bermuda remains the responsibility of the British government. For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda became the Royal Navy's Western Atlantic headquarters, before which the Bermuda government had maintained [[militia]] for the defence of the colony. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, these militias became superfluous and were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony did raise [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].

Due to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.

In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the United Kingdom granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received in exchange. However, one of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km²|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[German Navy|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.

The original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a seaplane base until the mid-1960s, became the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex and provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as Naval Facility Bermuda (NAVFAC Bermuda), a [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].

Canada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head, in the West End of the islands during this time.

In the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small [[Royal Navy]] supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS Malabar]], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.

Bermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and children of Bermudians had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey, who, when promoted to that rank at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.

Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription in which balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.

[[File:Bermudian-dollars-$50.jpg|thumb|$50 Bermudian banknote.]]

Since switching from the [[Bermudian pound]] in 1970, Bermuda's currency has been the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the US dollar similar to Hong Kong. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars.<ref>[http://www.bm.butterfieldgroup.com/Rates/Foreign_Exchange/ Bank of Butterfield Exchange Rate Page]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}.

According to the Bermuda Government's Economic Statistics Division, Bermuda's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] was $5.85&nbsp;billion in 2007, or $91,477 per-capita, giving Bermuda the highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name=Gazette17Dec08>[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20081217/NEWS/312179971 Bermuda leads in GDP per capita], ''The Royal Gazette'' (17 December 2008).</ref>

Bermuda is an [[offshore financial centre]], which results from its minimal standards of business regulation/laws and direct [[taxation]] on personal or corporate income.  Bermuda has one of the highest consumption taxes in the World and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system. Bermudas's consumption tax is equivalent to local income tax to local residents and funds necessary Governmental and infrastructural costs to live in a civilized society.  The local tax system depends upon import duties, payroll taxes and [[consumption tax]]es. The legal system is derived from that of the United Kingdom, with recourse to English courts of final appeal. However, foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://photos.state.gov/libraries/hamilton/19452/pdfs/CCG2011final.pdf |format=PDF |title= US Commercial Service: Doing Business in Bermuda |publisher=Photos.state.gov |date= 15 August 2012}}</ref>

Having no corporate income tax, Bermuda is a popular tax avoidance location.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Bermuda}}

Bermuda's 2010 Census put Bermuda's population at 64,237. The ethnic makeup of Bermuda is 54% black, 31% white, 8% multiracial, 4% Asian, and 4% other races.<ref name="Bermuda 2010 Census"/> Native Bermudians made up 67% of the population, compared 29% non-natives, however, 79% of residents had Bermudian status.  A significant segment of the white population is of Portuguese ancestry (10%), the result of immigration from Portuguese islands (especially the [[Azores]]) during the past 160 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~portwestind/diaspora/waves_of_migration.htm |title=The Portuguese of the West Indies |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=31 July 2001 |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref>

Some islanders, especially in [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St David's]], trace their ancestry to Native Americans, and many more may be ignorant of such ancestry. Hundreds were shipped to Bermuda, possibly from as far as Mexico{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The best known examples were the [[Algonquian peoples]] who were exiled from the [[New England]] colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, notably in the aftermaths of the [[Pequot War]], and [[King Philip's War]].

Several thousand [[expatriate]] workers, principally from Britain, Canada, the West Indies, [[South Africa]] and the US, also reside in Bermuda, primarily engaged in specialised professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, government employment figures stated that 11,223 (29%) were non-Bermudians.<ref>''Bermuda Sun'', 4 April 2007.</ref>

===Education===
{{See also|List of schools in Bermuda}}
The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system:

* An ''aided school'' has all or a part of its property vested in a body of trustees or board of governors and is partially maintained by public funding or, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, has received a grant-in-aid out of public funds.

* A ''maintained school'' has the whole of its property belonging to the Government and is fully maintained by public funds.

* A ''private school'', not maintained by public funds and which has not, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, received any capital grant-in-aid out of public funds. The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.

Warwick Academy, one of the oldest schools in the western hemisphere is in the parish of Warwick, Bermuda.

Prior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated and when the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formally maintained "white" schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools. The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained.

At present there are 26&nbsp;schools in the Bermuda Public School System, 18 of which are primary schools, five are middle schools, two senior schools and one special school. There is also an Alternative Programme provided for students with behavioural challenges who cannot function in the public mainstream. There is one aided primary school, two aided middle schools and one aided senior school.

For higher education, the [[Bermuda College]] offers various [[associate degrees]] and other certificate programmes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bermuda College |url=http://www.bercol.bm/ |accessdate =10 February 2008 }}</ref> Bermuda does not have any four-year colleges or universities.

In May 2009, Bermudian Government's application was approved to become a contributory member of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI). Bermuda's membership is slated to allow Bermudian students to enter the University at an agreed upon subsidised rate possibly as early as the 2009/2010 school year. UWI also agrees that their Open Campus (online degree courses) would become open to Bermudian students in the future, with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to the Open Campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bermuda joins the UWI Family |url=http://cavehill.uwi.edu/news/releases/release.asp?id=132 |accessdate =19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://sta.uwi.edu/news/releases/release.asp?id=280 |title=Bermuda joins the UWI Family |date = 14 May 2009 |work=sta.uwi.edu}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Bermuda}}
{{see also|Holidays in Bermuda}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

Bermuda's culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population: Native American, Spanish-Caribbean, English, Irish, and Scots cultures were evident in the 17th century, and became part of the dominant British culture. English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.

A second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.

The first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] has achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally.

Bermuda's proximity to the United States, as well as its origin as part of [[Virginia]], means that many aspects of US culture are reflected in, or incorporated into, Bermudian culture. Many non-Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda their home, or have had homes here, including [[A. J. Cronin]] and [[F. Van Wyck Mason]], who wrote on Bermudian subjects.

Actors such as [[Oona O'Neill]], [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]], [[Diana Dill]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Will Kempe (actor)|Will Kempe]], and most famously, [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], grew up here or have lived here as adults. Other native or resident film and television figures in Bermuda include producer [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], and cartoonist and [[Muppet]] man, [[Michael Frith]].

===Arts===
West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. While calypso appealed more to the visitors than to the locals, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaican]] immigrants.

[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gombey]] dancers from Bermuda, at 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, DC.]]

Bermuda's early literature consisted of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the island. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, "Battle of the Summer Islands" (1645).<ref>Edmund Waller [http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem Hunter: "Battle of the Summer Islands"].

[[Music of Bermuda|Music]] and dance are important in Bermuda. Noted musicians have included local icons [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], who performed for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]], singer-songwriter [[Heather Nova]] and her brother [[Mishka]]; [[tenor]] [[Gary Burgess]], classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]] and, more recently, dancehall artist [[Collie Buddz]].

The dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] Dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001 they performed in [[Washington, DC]] at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the Mall (see photo).

Bermudian [[Gina Swainson]] was crowned "[[Miss World]]" in 1979.

Bermuda hosts an annual international film festival, which shows many independent films. One of the founders is film producer and director [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], co-founder of the [[Rankin/Bass]] production company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bermudafilmfest.com/ |title=Index |publisher=bermudafilmfest.com |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref>

Bermuda watercolours painted by local artists are sold at various galleries. Hand-carved cedar sculptures are another specialty. One such {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} sculpture, created by Bermudian sculptor Chesley Trott, is installed at the airport's baggage claim area. In 2010, his sculpture ''The Arrival'' was unveiled near the bay to commemorate the freeing of slaves from the American brig ''[[Enterprise (slave ship)|Enterprise]]'' in 1835. Local artwork may also be viewed at several galleries around the island. [[Alfred Birdsey]] was one of the more famous and talented watercolourists; his impressionistic landscapes of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] and the surrounding sailboats, homes, and bays of Bermuda are world-renowned.

Local resident Tom Butterfield founded the Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art in 1986, initially featuring works about Bermuda by artists from other countries. He began with pieces by American artists, such as [[Winslow Homer]], [[Charles Demuth]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], who had lived and worked here. He has increasingly supported the development of local artists, arts education, and the arts scene.<ref>[http://washington.cbslocal.com/top-lists/tom-butterfield/ Tom Butterfield], CBS DC, 6 July 2011; accessed 5 April 2013.</ref> In 2008, the museum opened its new building, constructed within the Botanic Gardens.<ref>[http://www.bermudamasterworks.com/ Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art], official website; accessed 5 April 2013.</ref>

===Main sights===
[[File:BDA Bermuda.jpg|thumb|One of Bermuda's pink-sand beaches at Astwood Park.]]

Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, [[cerulean]] blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are located along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a designated [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers can explore numerous [[shipwreck|wrecks]] and [[coral reefs]] in relatively shallow water (typically {{convert|30|-|40|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} in depth), with virtually unlimited visibility.

===Sports===
{{main|Sports and recreation in Bermuda}}

Many sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the Nineteenth Century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the [[Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players in 1885. They soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including cricket, [[Association football|football]], [[Rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic, and the officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.

[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But [[India]] defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI) and therefore Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well-known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual "Cup Match" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday.

In 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16–17 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season ending tournament is between only four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|US Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda again in 2008 and 2009. Bermudian Quinn Talbot was once the World one-armed golf champion.

The Government announced in 2006 that it would provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Among Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]], [[Ralph Bean (footballer)|Ralph Bean]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team in order to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team plays in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]].

[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}</ref>

Bermuda has developed a proud [[Rugby Union]] community. The Bermuda Rugby Union team won the 2011 Caribbean championships –defeating Guyana in the final– they previously beat The Bahamas and [[Mexico national rugby union team|Mexico]] to take the crown. Rugby 7's is also played, with four rounds scheduled to take place in the 2011–2012 season.

The [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]] held [[Spring Training]] in Bermuda in 1913.  Yankee owner [[Frank J. Farrell]] was said to be so pleased with the experience that  he considered moving the Yankee training camp to Bermuda permanently.<ref>{{cite web|author=February 16, 2011 |url=http://www.yankeeanalysts.com/2011/02/it-happens-every-spring-a-110-year-retrospective-of-yankees-spring-training-2549 |title=It Happens Every Spring: A 110-Year Retrospective of Yankees Spring Training &#124; New York Yankees blog, Yankees blog, A blog about the New York Yankees |publisher=The Yankee Analysts |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://springtrainingonline.com/teams/ny-yankees.htm |title=New York Yankees |publisher=Springtrainingonline.com |date=2008-12-06 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>
