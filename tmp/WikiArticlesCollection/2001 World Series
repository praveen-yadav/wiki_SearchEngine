The '''2001 World Series''', the 97th edition of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series|championship series]], took place between the [[2001 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] of the [[National League]] and the [[2001 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] of the [[American League]]. The Diamondbacks won the best-of-seven series four games to three. The series was one of the most memorable, featuring two extra-inning games and three late-inning comebacks. It ended on a Game 7 [[Glossary of baseball (W)#walk-off home run|walk-off hit]] in the form of a bases loaded bloop single off the bat of [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]. This was the third World Series to end in this way after {{wsy|1997}} and {{wsy|1991}}.

This was the first World Series ever played in the state of Arizona and the Mountain Time Zone. With the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game#Tie games; rain delays; home-field advantage in World Series|All-Star Game]] format change in 2003, the World Series would not open in the city of the [[National League]] champion again until {{wsy|2010}}. This was the last World Series not to feature a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team until {{wsy|2008}}. This was also the first World Series to end in November.

With the win by the Diamondbacks, the franchise became the first World Series champion from a [[Western United States|Far West state]] other than California.

[[Randy Johnson]] and [[Curt Schilling]] were the co-MVPs of the 2001 World Series, combining for a 4–0 record and a 1.40 ERA and striking out 45 Yankees in {{frac|39|1|3}} innings.

==Background==
The Arizona Diamondbacks reached the Series in just their fourth season, breaking a record previously held by the [[Florida Marlins]], and took on the three-time defending champion New York Yankees, who had won the World Series in four of the last five years and tried to become the first team to win four straight titles since the Yankees' five consecutive titles from {{wsy|1949}} to {{wsy|1953}}. Arizona captured the best of seven games Series, four games to three, thereby dethroning the defending World Champions and earning their first title.

Arizona won the first two games at home handily, but New York won the next three in close contests at the Yankee Stadium, including two dramatic ninth-inning comebacks against Arizona closer [[Byung-Hyun Kim]]. Arizona won the sixth game handily with [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]] pitching a masterful game. Randy pitched in relief of Curt Schilling in Game 7. The Diamondbacks won that game by the score of 3–2, ending when [[Jay Bell]] scored the winning run on a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#bloop|bloop]] single by [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], in the bottom of the ninth inning off the Yankees' ace closer, [[Mariano Rivera]]. Johnson, credited with the Game 7 win, became the first pitcher ever to win three games in the same World Series since [[1968 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]' [[Mickey Lolich]] in {{wsy|1968}}.

The home team won every game in the Series. This had only happened twice before, in {{wsy|1987}} and {{wsy|1991}} also in domed ballparks; in the two earlier championships, the [[Minnesota Twins]] won the Series. This Series was the subject of an [[HBO]] documentary ''Nine Innings from Ground Zero'' in 2004.

Though the series was played to the maximum seven games, the Diamondbacks outscored the Yankees 37–14 as a result of large margins of victory achieved by Arizona in [[Bank One Ballpark]] relative to the one run margins the Yankees achieved at Yankee Stadium. Arizona held powerhouse New York to an .183 batting average, the lowest ever in a seven-game World Series. The previous record was .185 by the [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[1985 World Series]] when they lost to the [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]].

===September 11 and the month of November===
Due to the postponement of MLB games as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]], the World Series began Saturday, October 27, 2001, the latest start date ever for a World Series until the [[2009 World Series]], which started on October 28. The last three games were the first major-league games (other than exhibitions) played in the month of November. This was just the fourth time that no World Series champion was decided within the traditional month of October. The previous three occurrences were in {{wsy|1904}} (no series), {{wsy|1918}} (series held in September due to World War I), and {{wsy|1994}} (no series due to [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|work stoppage]]). Additionally, the Series took place in New York City only seven weeks after the attacks, representing a remarkable boost in morale for the fatigued city.

The game was opened in New York by [[United States]] [[President]] [[George W. Bush]], who threw the [[ceremonial first pitch]], a strike to Yankees backup catcher [[Todd Greene]]. Bush became the first sitting US [[President]] to throw a World Series first pitch since [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in {{wsy|1956}}. He also threw the baseball from the mound where the pitcher would be set (unlike most ceremonial first pitches which are from in front of the mound) and threw it for a strike. Chants of ''"[[U-S-A! cheer|U-S-A]], U-S-A"'' rang throughout Yankee Stadium. Yankees starter [[Roger Clemens]] allowed only three hits and struck out nine in seven innings of work.  Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] pitched two innings for the save. [[Scott Brosius]] broke a sixth inning tie with a run scoring RBI single to left field.

Arizona manager [[Bob Brenly]] gambled and started [[Curt Schilling]] on three days' rest. It was a good decision as Schilling pitched seven strong innings, allowing just one run, Shane Spencer's solo homer in the third, and three hits. Yankees' [[Orlando Hernandez]] pitched {{frac|6|1|3}} solid innings, but gave up a game-tying upper deck home run to Mark Grace in the fourth. The Diamondbacks took a 3–1 lead in the top of the eighth on an [[Erubiel Durazo]] double and a fielder's choice, which prompted Brenly to bring in closer [[Byung-Hyun Kim]] for a two inning save. Kim, at 22, became the first Korean-born player ever to play in the MLB World Series. Kim struck out the side in the eighth, but the Yankees began their comeback in the bottom of the ninth inning. First, Jeter tried bunting, but was thrown out by one step. Then [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] lined an opposite-field single in front of left fielder Luis Gonzalez. After [[Bernie Williams (born 1968)|Bernie Williams]] struck out, [[Tino Martinez]] hit a two-run home run on the first pitch he saw from Kim over the right-center field wall, tying the game 3–3. Brenly stuck with his closer as the game headed into extra innings. When the scoreboard clock in Yankee Stadium passed midnight, World Series play in November began, with the message on the scoreboard "Welcome to November Baseball". Derek Jeter
hit an opposite field walk-off home run on a 3–2 pitch count from Kim. This walk-off home run gave the Yankees a 4–3 victory and tied the Series at two games apiece, making Jeter the first player to hit a November home run and earning him the tongue-in-cheek nickname of "[[Derek Jeter|Mr. November]]". <!--Jeter would become only the third person in New York City sports history to get such a nickname, following [[Reggie Jackson]], who got "Mr. October" for hitting three home runs in the [[1977 World Series]] to help the Yankees to a World Series win and [[Mark Messier]], who got "Mr. June" for captaining the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] to the [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup in 1994]], as that happened in the month of June.-->

For Game 5, Brenly started [[Miguel Batista]], who pitched a strong {{frac|7|2|3}} scoreless innings. Mussina bounced back from his poor Game 1 start, but allowed solo home runs to [[Steve Finley]] and [[Rod Barajas]] in the fifth. With the Diamondbacks leading 2–0 in the ninth, Brenly again went to his closer, and for the second night in a row Byung-Hyun Kim failed to hold the lead. [[Jorge Posada]] doubled to open the inning, but Kim retired the next two batters. Then, with two outs in the ninth [[Scott Brosius]] hit a 1–0 pitch over the left field wall to tie the game at two. Yankee Stadium erupted after the Brosius home run. For the second straight night, the game went into extra innings following a ninth-inning home run and the Yankees won it in the twelfth when [[Alfonso Soriano]] knocked in [[Chuck Knoblauch]] with a base hit off [[Albie Lopez]]. New York went ahead three games to two in the series as the teams headed back to Arizona. In the top of the ninth inning, with the Yankees down 2–0, [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] (retiring after the series) was serenaded by Yankees fans chanting his name in unison.

The Diamondbacks rocked Yankees starter Andy Pettitte for six runs after two innings and nine more runs against reliever [[Jay Witasick]] in one and a third innings before [[Randy Choate]] and [[Mike Stanton (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Stanton]] kept them scoreless for the rest of the game. The Diamondbacks hit six doubles and [[Danny Bautista]] batted 3-for-4 with five RBIs. The team set a World Series record with 22 hits and defeated the New York Yankees in its most lopsided postseason loss in 293 postseason games. The 15–2 win evened the series at three games apiece and set up a Game 7 for the ages between Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, again pitching on three days' rest.

It was a matchup of two twenty-game winners in the Series finale that would crown a new champion. Clemens at 39 years old became the oldest Game 7 starter ever. Schilling had already started two games of the Series and pitched his 300th inning of the season on just three days' rest. The two aces matched each other inning by inning and after seven full innings, the game was tied at 1–1. The Diamondbacks scored first in the sixth inning with a [[Steve Finley]] single and a [[Danny Bautista]] double (Bautista would be called out at third base). The Yankees responded with an RBI single from [[Tino Martinez]], which drove in [[Derek Jeter]]. Brenly stayed with Schilling into the eighth, and the move backfired as [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit a solo home run on an 0–2 pitch. After Schilling got one out, he gave up a single to [[David Justice]], and he left the game trailing 2–1. Brenly brought in [[Miguel Batista]] to get out [[Derek Jeter]] and then in an unconventional move, brought in the previous night's starter Randy Johnson, who had thrown 104 pitches, in relief to keep it a one-run game. It proved to be a smart move, as Johnson retired all four Yankees he faced.

With the Yankees ahead 2–1 in the bottom of the eighth, manager [[Joe Torre]] turned the game over to his ace closer [[Mariano Rivera]] for a two-inning save. Rivera struck out the side in the eighth, including Arizona's Luis Gonzalez, Matt Williams, and Danny Bautista, which lowered his ERA in the postseason to a major league-best of 0.70 {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}. Although he was effective in the eighth, this game would end in the third ninth-inning comeback of the Series.

Mark Grace led off the inning with a single to center on a 1–0 pitch. Rivera's errant throw to second base on a bunt attempt by Damian Miller on an 0–1 pitch put runners on first and second. Derek Jeter tried to reach for the ball, but got tangled in the legs of pinch-runner [[David Dellucci]], who was sliding in an attempt to break up the double play. Rivera appeared to regain control when he fielded [[Jay Bell]]'s bunt and threw out Dellucci at third base, but third baseman [[Scott Brosius]] decided to hold onto the baseball instead of throwing to first to complete the [[double play]]. Midre Cummings was sent in to pinch-run for Damien Miller. With Cummings at second and Bell at first, the next batter, [[Tony Womack]], hit a double down the right-field line on a 2–2 pitch that evened the score and earned Mariano Rivera a blown save. Bell advanced to third and the Yankees pulled the infield and the outfield in as the potential winning run stood at third with fewer than two outs. After Rivera hit [[Craig Counsell]] with an 0–1 pitch, the bases were loaded. On an 0–1 pitch, [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]] lofted a soft single over the drawn-in Derek Jeter that barely reached the outfield grass, plating Jay Bell with the winning run. This ended New York's bid for a fourth consecutive title and brought Arizona its first championship within its fourth year of existence, making the Diamondbacks the fastest expansion team to win a World Series, as well as the first major professional sports championship for the state of Arizona. This was the first time since {{wsy|1991}} that the home team won in all seven games of a World Series.

In 2009, Game 7 was chosen by ''Sports Illustrated'' as the [[List of 2009 all-decade Sports Illustrated awards and honors#Major League Baseball|Best Postseason Game of the Decade]] (2000–2009).

==Media coverage==
For the second consecutive year, [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] carried the World Series over its network with its top broadcast team, [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]] (himself a [[List of New York Yankees broadcasters|Yankees broadcaster]]). This was the first year of Fox's exclusive rights to the World Series (in the previous contract, Fox only broadcast the World Series in even numbered years while [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] broadcast it in odd numbered years), which it has held ever since (this particular contract also had given Fox exclusive rights to the entire baseball postseason, which aired over its family of networks; the contract was modified following [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s purchase of [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]] shortly after the World Series ended, as ESPN regained their postseason rights following a year of postseason games on ABC Family, Fox Family's successor). [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio]] provided national radio coverage for the fourth consecutive year, with [[Jon Miller]] and [[Joe Morgan]] calling the action.

Locally, the Series was carried over [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]] in the Phoenix area and [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York. [[Greg Schulte]] called play-by-play for the Diamondbacks while [[John Sterling (sportscaster)|John Sterling]] and [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]] alternated duties on the Yankees coverage. This would be Sterling and Kay's last World Series working together, and Game 7 would be the last Yankee broadcast on WABC. Kay moved to television and the new [[YES Network]] the following season and [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] picked up radio rights to the Yankees. It was Kay who announced Derek Jeter's game-winning home run in Game 4 of the series and subsequently anointed him as "Mr. November".

==Aftermath==
After the Yankees lost the World Series, several players moved onto other teams or retired, the most notable changes being the signing of [[Jason Giambi]] to replace Martinez, and the retirements of Brosius and O'Neil. Martinez would later finish his career with the Yankees in 2005 after spending the previous three years in St. Louis and Tampa Bay. The Yankees would lose the [[2003 World Series]] to the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] and wouldn't win another World Series until 2009, when they defeated the defending champions, the [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], in six games. 

After winning the NL West again in 2002 the [[2002 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] were swept 3–0 by [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] in the [[2002 National League Division Series|NLDS]]. From here they declined, losing 111 games in 2004 as Bob Brenly was fired during that season. Arizona would not win another NL West title until 2007. Schilling was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] after the 2003 season and in 2004 helped lead them to their first world championship since 1918. He helped them win another championship in 2007 and retired after four years with Boston, missing the entire 2008 season with a shoulder injury. Johnson was traded to the Yankees after the 2004 season, a season that saw him throw a [[perfect game]] against the [[2004 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]], though he would be traded back to the Diamondbacks two years later and finish his career with the [[San Francisco Giants]] in 2009. Three Diamondbacks from 2001 are still active, [[Rod Barajas]] (now with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]), [[Miguel Batista]] (who last pitched with the [[New York Mets]] in 2012), and [[Lyle Overbay]] (rejoined the Diamondbacks in August 2011). All these players have since played with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]; Barajas and Overbay at the same time (2008 and 2009). Only [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Alfonso Soriano]] remain from the 2001 AL champion Yankees.

From 2004 through 2007, the Yankees' misfortune in the postseason continued, with the team losing the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] to the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in 2004, the [[2005 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2005 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Anaheim]] in 2005, the [[2006 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2006 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit]] in 2006, and the [[2007 American League Division Series|ALDS]] to [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] in 2007. [[Joe Torre]]'s contract was allowed to expire and he was replaced by [[Joe Girardi]] in 2008, a season in which the Yankees would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1993.

[[Buster Olney]], who covered the Yankees for the ''[[New York Times]]'' before joining ESPN, would write a book titled ''[[The Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty]]''. The book is a play by play account of Game 7 in addition to stories about key players, executives, and moments from the 1996–2001 dynasty. In a 2005 reprinting, Olney included a new epilogue covering the aftermath of the 2001 World Series up to the Boston Red Sox epic comeback from down 3–0 in the 2004 ALCS.

{{as of|2013}}, this is the state of [[Arizona]]'s only world championship among the [[major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|four major professional sports]].<!-- while the Cardinals have two NFL Championships, both were won while the club was based in Chicago) -->
