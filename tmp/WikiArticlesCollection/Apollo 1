-->'''Apollo 1''' (initially designated '''Apollo Saturn-204''' and '''AS-204''') was scheduled to be the first manned mission of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Apollo program|Apollo manned lunar landing program]], with a target launch date of February 21, 1967. A cabin fire during a launch pad test on January 27 at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Pad 34]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] killed all three crew members—Command Pilot [[Gus Grissom|Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom]], Senior Pilot [[Edward Higgins White|Edward H. White II]] and Pilot [[Roger B. Chaffee]]—and destroyed the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM).<ref name="MarAprChron"/> The name ''Apollo 1'', chosen by the crew, was officially retired by [[NASA]] in commemoration of them on April 24, 1967.<ref name="MarAprChron"/>

Immediately after the fire, NASA convened the ''Apollo 204 Accident Review Board'' to determine the cause of the fire. Although the ignition source was never conclusively identified, the astronauts' deaths were attributed to a wide range of lethal design and construction flaws in the early Apollo Command Module. The manned phase of the project was delayed for 20 months while these problems were corrected.

The [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle, SA-204, scheduled for use on this mission, was later used for the first unmanned [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) test flight, [[Apollo 5]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/bellcomm/bci_sec_21.html |title=Apollo Program |year=2001 |work=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |series=Bellcomm, Inc Technical Library Collection |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |location=Washington, D.C. |page=Subseries III.D.3. |nopp=y |id=Accession No. XXXX-0093 |accessdate=January 26, 2013}}</ref> The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on [[Apollo 7]] in October 1968.

==Mission background==
AS-204 was to be the first manned test flight of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) to Earth orbit, launched on a Saturn IB rocket. AS-204 was to test launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the [[spacecraft]] performed.<ref>[[#moonport|Benson 1978]]: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch18-1.html Chapter 18-1 – The Fire That Seared The Spaceport, "Introduction"]</ref>

[[File:Apollo1-Crew 01.jpg|thumb|left|Grissom, White, and Chaffee pose in front of their Apollo 1 space vehicle on the launch pad on January 17, 1967, ten days before the fatal fire]]
The CSM for this flight, number 012 built by [[North American Aviation]] (NAA), was a [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Development history|Block I]] version designed before the [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This was incorporated into the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the [[Moon landing]] flights.

[[File:Załogi misji Apollo 1 S66-30238.jpg|thumb|right|Official portrait of prime and backup crews for AS-204, as of April 1, 1966. The backup crew (standing) of McDivitt (center), Scott (left) and Schweickart were replaced by Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham in December 1966]]
NASA announced on March 21, 1966, that Grissom, White and Chaffee had been selected to fly the first manned mission. [[James McDivitt]], [[David Scott]] and [[Rusty Schweickart|Russell Schweickart]] were named as the backup crew, and [[Wally Schirra|Walter Schirra]], [[Donn F. Eisele|Donn Eisele]] and [[Walter Cunningham]] were named as the prime crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an unmanned test flight of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight designated AS-278, in which AS-207 would launch the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and dock with the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.

At the time, NASA was studying the possibility of flying the first Apollo mission as a joint [[space rendezvous]] with the final [[Project Gemini]] mission, [[Gemini 12]] in November 1966.<ref>{{cite news |title=3 Crewmen Picked For 1st Apollo Flight |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HIwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=krcFAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo&pg=4087%2C7171310 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |location=West Palm Beach, FL |date=March 22, 1966 |page=1 |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}</ref> But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical.<ref>{{cite news |title=Apollo Shot May Come This Year |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WjNbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jU8NAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo&pg=1914%2C190638 |agency=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=The Bonham Daily Favorite |location=Bonham, TX |date=May 5, 1966 |page=1 |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}</ref> This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.<ref name="SP4029">{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |series=NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |year=2004 |month=September |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00-061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 1 - The Fire: 27 January 1967 |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01a_Summary.htm}}</ref> Grissom was resolved to keep his craft in orbit for a full 14 days if there was any way to do so.

By December 1966, the second Block I flight AS-205 was canceled as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo 1. McDivitt's crew was now promoted to prime crew of the Block II / LM mission, re-designated AS-258 because the AS-205 launch vehicle would be used in place of AS-207. A third manned mission was planned to launch the CSM and LM together on a [[Saturn V]] (AS-503) to an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO), to be crewed by [[Frank Borman]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and [[William Anders]]. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart had started their training for AS-278 in CM-101 when the Apollo 1 accident occurred.

===Mission insignia===
Grissom's crew received approval in June 1966 to design a mission patch with the name ''Apollo 1''. The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The [[Moon]] is seen in the distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American Aviation employee Allen Stevens.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eugene |last=Dorr |url=http://genedorr.com/patches/Apollo/Ap01.html |title=Space Mission Patches – Apollo 1 Patch |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><!--  Note: the genedorr.com site quotes Deke Slayton's book "Deke!: U.S. Manned Space : from Mercury to the Shuttle", ISBN 978-0-312-85503-1, for the premise that the crew designed the patch.

===Spacecraft problems===
[[File:A1prayer.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Apollo 1 crew expressed their concerns about their spacecraft's problems by presenting this parody of their crew portrait to ASPO manager Joseph Shea on August 19, 1966]]
The Apollo Command/Service Module spacecraft was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design. In October 1963, [[Joseph Francis Shea|Joseph F. Shea]] was named Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) manager, responsible for managing the design and construction of both the CSM and the LM.
When North American shipped spacecraft CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966, there were 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes, and an additional 623 engineering change orders were made after delivery.<ref name="sea5" /> Grissom was so frustrated with the inability of the training simulator engineers to keep up with the actual spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/grissom.htm |title=Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew - Gus Grissom |last=White |first=Mary C. |work=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 29, 2008}}</ref> and hung it on the simulator.<ref name='chariots8-7'>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by [[Samuel C.

In a spacecraft review meeting held with Shea on August 19, 1966 (a week before delivery), the crew expressed concern about the amount of flammable material (mainly nylon netting and [[Velcro]]) in the cabin, which the technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place. Though Shea gave the spacecraft a passing grade, after the meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer, with the inscription:
<blockquote>It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go over your head.<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 184</ref></blockquote>
Shea gave his staff orders to tell North American to remove the flammables from the cabin, but did not supervise the issue personally.<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 185</ref>

==Accident==

===Plugs-out test===
[[File:AS-204 - hatch.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Block I hatch, as used on Apollo 1, consisted of two pieces, and required pressure inside the cabin be no greater than atmospheric in order to open. A third outer layer, the boost protective hatch cover, is not shown]]
The launch simulation on January 27, 1967, was a "plugs-out" test to determine whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on (simulated) internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. Passing this test was essential to making the February 21 launch date. The test was considered non-hazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or [[cryogenics]], and all [[pyrotechnic fastener|pyrotechnic]] systems were disabled.<ref name="SP4029" />

At 1:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (1800 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]) on January 27, first Grissom, then Chaffee, and White entered the Command Module fully pressure-suited, and were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecraft's oxygen and communication systems. There was an immediate problem: Grissom noticed a strange odor in the air circulating through his suit which he compared to "sour buttermilk", and the simulated countdown was held at 1:20&nbsp;pm, while air samples were taken. No cause of the odor could be found, and the countdown was resumed at 2:42&nbsp;pm. (The accident investigation found this odor not to be related in any way to the fire.)<ref name="SP4029" />

Three minutes after the count was resumed, the hatch installation was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, which was part of the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch and from launch escape rocket exhaust in the event of a launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially but not fully latched in place, because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at {{convert|16.7|psi|bar|abbr=on|lk=on}}, 2 psi higher than atmospheric pressure.<ref name="SP4029" />

Further problems included episodes of high oxygen spacesuit flow, which tripped an alarm. The likely cause was determined to be the astronauts' movements, which were detected by the spacecraft's inertial guidance [[gyroscope]] and Grissom's stuck-open microphone. The open microphone was part of the third major problem, with the communications loop connecting the crew, the [[Operations and Checkout Building]] and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The problems led Grissom to remark: "How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't talk between three buildings?" The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40&nbsp;pm while attempts were made to fix the problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20&nbsp;pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.<ref name="SP4029" />

===Fire===
[[File:Apollo 1's Command Module - GPN-2003-00057.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Exterior of the Command Module was blackened from eruption of the fire after the cabin wall failed]] 
The crew members were using the time to run through their checklist again, when a voltage transient was recorded at 6:30:54 (23:30:54 GMT). Ten seconds later (at 6:31:04), Chaffee exclaimed "Hey!", and scuffling sounds followed for two seconds. White then reported, "I've got a fire in the cockpit!". Some witnesses said that they saw White on the television monitors, reaching for the inner hatch release handle as flames in the cabin spread from left to right and licked the window. The final voice transmission is believed to have come from Chaffee. Six seconds after White's report of a "fire in the cockpit", a voice cried out, "There's a bad fire!". The sound of the spacecraft's hull rupturing was heard immediately afterwards, followed by "I'm burning up!" and a scream. The transmission then ended abruptly at 6:31:21, only 17 seconds after the first report of fire. The cabin had ruptured due to rapidly expanding gases from the fire, which over-pressurized the Command Module to {{convert|29|psi|bar|lk=on|abbr=on}}.

Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rockets in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel. It took five minutes to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed it out of the way to one side.<ref name="SP4029" />

The initial phase of the fire lasted only about 15 seconds before the Command Module's hull ruptured. As the cabin depressurized, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread rapidly, beginning the second phase. The third phase began when most of the atmosphere was consumed. At this point, the fire largely stopped, but massive amounts of smoke, dust, carbon monoxide, and fumes now filled the cabin. Although the cabin lights remained lit, the ground crew was at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared they found the bodies but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing them took nearly 90 minutes.<ref name="SP4029" />

==Investigation==
As a result of the in-flight failure of the [[Gemini 8]] mission on March 17, 1966, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Robert Seamans]] wrote and implemented ''Management Instruction 8621.1'' on April 14, 1966, defining ''Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures''. This modified NASA's existing accident procedures, based on military aircraft accident investigation, by giving the Deputy Administrator the option of performing independent investigations of major failures, beyond those for which the various Program Office officials were normally responsible. It declared, "It is NASA policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/13.html |title = NASA Management Instruction 8621.1 April 14, 1966 |last= Seamans |first=Robert C., Jr. |date=April 5, 1967 |work=Apollo 204 Review Board Final Report |publisher=NASA |accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> 

Immediately after the Apollo 1 fire, Seamans directed establishment of the ''Apollo 204 Review Board'' chaired by [[Langley Research Center]] director Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut [[Frank Borman]], spacecraft designer [[Maxime Faget]], and six others. To avoid the possible appearance of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator [[James E. Webb]] got the approval of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] for an internal NASA investigation, and notified appropriate leaders of Congress. According to Webb's official NASA bio:

:"...Webb went to President Lyndon Johnson and asked that NASA be allowed to handle the accident investigation and direct the recovery from the accident. He promised to be truthful in assessing blame and pledged to assign it to himself and NASA management as appropriate."<ref>{{cite web |title=James E. Webb |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Biographies/webb.html |work=NASA History Office |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}</ref>

Seamans immediately ordered all Apollo 1 hardware and software impounded, to be released only under control of the Board. On February 3, two members, a Cornell University professor and North American's Chief engineer for Apollo, left the Board, and a [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] professor joined. After thorough [[stereoscopy|stereo photographic]] documentation of the CM-012 interior, the board ordered its disassembly using procedures tested by disassembling the identical CM-014, and conducted a thorough investigation of every part. The board also reviewed the astronauts' autopsy results and interviewed witnesses. Seamans sent Webb weekly status reports of the investigation's progress, and the Board issued its final report on April 5, 1967.

According to the Board, Grissom suffered severe [[burn|third degree burns]] on over a third of his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was [[cardiac arrest]] caused by high concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]]. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.<ref name="sea5">{{cite book |first=Robert C., Jr. |last=Seamans |authorlink=Robert Seamans |publisher=NASA History Office |title=Report of Apollo 204 Review Board |chapter=Findings, Determinations And Recommendations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Apollo204/find.html |date=April 5, 1967 |accessdate=October 7, 2007}}</ref> 

The review board identified five major factors which combined to cause the fire and the astronauts' deaths:

===Ignition source===
The review board determined that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several [[electric arc]]s in the interior equipment. However, they were unable to conclusively identify a single ignition source. They determined that the fire most likely started near the floor in the lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit.<ref name="sea5"/> It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly. The engulfed area on the left contained the manual depressurization valve which would have been used to vent the cabin atmosphere to the outside. Consequently, the astronauts were unable to reach it, however this was in any case insufficient to prevent heat and pressure buildup.<ref name="PartV" />

They noted a silver-plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the center couch had become stripped of its [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door. This weak point in the wiring also ran near a junction in an [[ethylene glycol]]/water cooling line which had been prone to leaks. The [[electrolysis]] of ethylene glycol solution with the silver [[anode]] was a notable hazard which could cause a violent [[exothermic reaction]], igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's corrosive test atmosphere of pure, high-pressure oxygen.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ertel |first1=Ivan D. |last2=Newkirk |first2=Roland W. |last3=Brooks |first3=Courtney G. |title=The Apollo Spacecraft: A Chronology |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/contents.htm#Volume%20IV |accessdate=July 12, 2013 |volume=IV |year=1969–1978 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |id=NASA SP-4009 |oclc=23818 |lccn=69-60008 |chapter=Part 2 (B): Recovery, Spacecraft Redefinition, and First Manned Apollo Flight: May 1967 |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4009/v4p2b.htm |display-authors=2}}</ref><ref>In 1967 a vice president of North American Aviation, John McCarthy, speculated that Grissom had accidentally "scuffed the insulation of a wire" while moving about the spacecraft, but his remarks were ignored by the review board and strongly rejected by a congressional committee. [[Frank Borman]], who had been the first astronaut to go inside the burned spacecraft, testified, "We found no evidence to support the thesis that Gus, or any of the crew members kicked the wire that ignited the flammables." A 1978 history of the accident written internally by NASA said at the time, "the spark that led to the fire still has wide currency at Kennedy Space Center. Men differ, however, on the cause of the scuff."

In 1968, a team of MIT physicists went to Cape Kennedy and performed a static discharge test in the CM-103 Command Module while it was being prepared for the launch of [[Apollo 8]]. With an [[electroscope]], they measured the approximate energy of static discharges caused by a test crew dressed in nylon flight pressure suits and reclining on the nylon flight seats. The MIT investigators found sufficient energy for ignition discharged repeatedly when crew-members shifted in their seats and then touched the spacecraft's aluminum panels.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Flammable materials in the cabin===
The review board cited "many types and classes of combustible material" close to ignition sources. The NASA crew systems department had installed {{convert|34|sqft|m2}} of Velcro throughout the spacecraft, almost like carpeting. This Velcro was found to be flammable in a high-pressure 100% oxygen environment. Up to 70 pounds of other non-metallic flammable materials had also crept into the design.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} 

[[Buzz Aldrin]] states in his book ''Men From Earth'' that the flammable material had been removed (per the crew's August 19 complaints and Joseph Shea's order), but was replaced prior to the August 26 delivery to Cape Kennedy.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}

===Pure oxygen atmosphere===
[[File:Apollo 1 crew prepare to enter their spacecraft in the altitude chamber at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|right|The Apollo 1 crewmen enter their spacecraft in the [[altitude chamber]] at Kennedy Space Center, October 18, 1966]]
The plugs-out test had been run to simulate the launch procedure, with the cabin pressurized with pure oxygen at the nominal pre-launch level of {{convert|16.7|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, 2 psi above standard sea level atmospheric pressure. This is more than five times the 3 psi partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere, and provides an environment in which materials not normally considered highly flammable will burst into flame.

The high-pressure oxygen atmosphere was consistent with that used in the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen. After liftoff, the pressure would have been reduced to the in-flight level of {{convert|5|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30.<ref>[[#moonport|Benson 1978]]: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch18-3.html Chapter 18-3 – The Spacecraft Comes to KSC]</ref>

When designing the Mercury spacecraft, NASA had considered using a nitrogen/oxygen mixture to reduce the fire risk near launch, but rejected it based on two considerations. First, nitrogen used with the in-flight pressure reduction carried the clear risk of [[decompression sickness]] (known as "the bends"). But the decision to eliminate the use of any gas but oxygen was crystalized when a serious accident occurred on April 21, 1960, in which [[McDonnell Aircraft]] test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin / spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber. The problem was found to be nitrogen-rich (oxygen-poor) air leaking from the cabin into his spacesuit feed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Giblin |first=Kelly A. |year=1998 |month=Spring |title ='Fire in the Cockpit!' |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081120153024/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}
</ref> North American Aviation had suggested using an oxygen/nitrogen mixture for Apollo, but NASA overruled this. The pure oxygen design also carried the benefit of saving weight, by eliminating the need for nitrogen tanks.

In his monograph ''Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions'', Deputy Administrator Seamans wrote that NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment was not to run a fire test on the Command Module prior to the plugs-out test.<ref name="toughDecisions">{{cite book | last=Seamans |first=Robert C., Jr. |title=Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions |url=http://history.nasa.gov/monograph37.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 14, 2013 |volume=No. 37 |year=2005 |publisher=NASA |series=Monographs in Aerospace History |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-160-74954-4 |lccn=2005003682 |id=NASA SP-2005-4537 |pages=76–77}}</ref> In the first episode of the 2009 [[BBC]] documentary series ''NASA: Triumph and Tragedy'', Jim McDivitt said that NASA had no idea how a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning.<ref>{{IMDb episode|1469957|One Small Step}}</ref> Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film [[In the Shadow of the Moon (film)|''In the Shadow of the Moon'']].<ref>{{IMDb title|0925248|In the Shadow of the Moon|(2007)}}</ref>

====Other oxygen fires====
Several fires in high-oxygen environments had been known to occur prior to the Apollo fire. For example, in 1962, [[United States Air Force|USAF]] Colonel B. Dean Smith was conducting a test of the [[Gemini space suit]] with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]] when a fire broke out, destroying the chamber. Smith and his partner narrowly escaped.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=B.

Other oxygen fire occurrences are documented in certain U.S. reports archived in the [[National Air and Space Museum]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/research/arch/findaids/bellcomm/bci_print.html |title=Bellcomm, Inc Technical Library Collection |year=2001 |work=National Air and Space Museum |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Accession No. XXXX-0093 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref> such as:

===Hatch design===
The higher than atmospheric cabin pressure made it impossible for the senior pilot to remove the inner hatch, until the excess cabin pressure (16.7 psi absolute, 2 psi above ambient) had been vented. Emergency procedure called for the command pilot to open the cabin vent first,<ref name="SP4029" /> but this was located near the origin of the fire, and while the system could easily vent the normal pressure, it was utterly incapable of handling the extra increase in pressure (to at least 29 psi absolute) caused by the fire.<ref name="PartV">
{{citation |last=Seamans |first=Robert C., Jr. |title=Apollo 204 Review Board Final Report |publisher=NASA |date=April 5, 1967 |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Part V: Investigation and Analyses |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/Apollo204/invest.html |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollo204/content.html}}</ref>

North American had originally suggested the hatch open outward and use [[explosive bolt]]s to blow the hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in [[Project Mercury]]. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's ''[[Mercury-Redstone 4#Liberty Bell 7|Liberty Bell 7]]'' flight, so the [[Plug door|inward-opening hatch]] was selected early in the Block I design.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} 

Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to [[Deke Slayton|Donald K. Slayton]]'s testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks and at the end of flight, rather than for emergency exit.<ref name="port182">[[#moonport|Benson 1978]]: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch18-2.html Chapter 18-2 – The Fire That Seared The Spaceport, "Predictions of Trouble"]</ref>

===Emergency preparedness===
The board noted that: the test planners had failed to identify the test as hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps, sliding doors, and sharp turns.<ref name="sea5"/>

==Political fallout==
[[File:NASA Administration Before the Senate Regarding Apollo 1 - GPN-2002-000084.jpg| right|thumb| 240px|Deputy Administrator Seamans, Administrator Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George E. Mueller]], and Apollo Program Director Phillips testify before a Senate hearing on the Apollo accident]]
Committees in both houses of the [[United States Congress]] with oversight of the space program soon launched investigations, including the [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences|Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]], chaired by Senator [[Clinton Presba Anderson|Clinton P. Anderson]]. Seamans, Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator Dr. [[George Mueller (NASA)|George E. Mueller]], and Apollo Program Director [[Major general (United States)|Maj Gen]] [[Samuel C. Phillips]] were called to testify before Sen. Anderson's committee.

In the February 27 hearing, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Walter Mondale|Walter F. Mondale]] asked Webb if he knew of a "report" of extraordinary problems with the performance of North American Aviation on the Apollo contract. Webb replied he did not, and deferred to his subordinates on the witness panel. Mueller and Phillips responded they too were unaware of any such "report".

However, in late 1965, just over a year before the accident, Phillips had headed a "[[tiger team]]" investigating the causes of inadequate quality, schedule delays, and cost overruns in both the Apollo CSM and the Saturn V second stage (for which North American was also prime contractor.) He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to Mueller and Seamans, and also presented them in a memo to North American president [[John Leland Atwood|John L. Atwood]], to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to Atwood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/phillip1.html |title=The Phillips Report |publisher=NASA History Office |accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref> Mondale said he had been told of the existence of the "Phillips report", and Seamans was afraid that Mondale might be in possession of a hard copy of the presentation, so he said tentatively that contractors have occasionally been given negative reviews, but that he knew of no such extraordinary report. Mondale raised controversy over "the Phillips Report", despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such before Congress, and was angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, and questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor. On May 11, Webb issued a statement defending the selection. On June 9, Seamans filed a seven-page memorandum documenting the process that led to North American's selection in November 1961. Webb eventually provided a controlled copy of Phillips' memo to Congress. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.<ref name="toughDecisions" />

The committee noted in its final report NASA's testimony that "the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident",<ref>[[#Anderson|Anderson 1968]], p. 7</ref> but stated in its recommendations: 
<blockquote>"Notwithstanding that in NASA's judgment the contractor later made significant progress in overcoming the problems, the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations to the attention of the committee."<ref>[[#Anderson|Anderson 1968]], p. 11</ref></blockquote> 

Freshman Senators [[Edward Brooke|Edward W. Brooke III]] and [[Charles H. Percy]] jointly wrote an ''Additional Views'' section appended to the committee report, chastising NASA more strongly than Anderson for not having disclosed the Phillips review to Congress. Mondale wrote his own, even more strongly worded Additional View, accusing NASA of "evasiveness, ... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate Congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy."<ref>[[#Anderson|Anderson 1968]], p. 16</ref>

The potential political threat to Apollo blew over, due in large part to the support of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who at the time still wielded a measure of influence with the Congress from his own Senatorial experience. He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy.

Internal acrimony developed between NASA and North American over assignment of blame. North American argued unsuccessfully it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted Atwood, and demanded either he or Chief Engineer [[Harrison Storms|Harrison A. Storms]] resign. Atwood elected to fire Storms.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Other Side of the Moon |series=Project Apollo |last1=Burke |first=James (presenter) |authorlink=James Burke (science historian) |last2=Low |first2=George |authorlink2=George Low |last3=Myers |first3=Dale D. |authorlink3=Dale D.

===Command Module redesign===
After the fire, the Apollo program was grounded for review and redesign. The Command Module was found to be extremely hazardous and in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin).<ref name="PartV" />

It was decided that remaining Block I spacecraft would only be used for unmanned Saturn V test flights. All manned missions would use the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Major differences between Block I and Block II|Block II spacecraft]], to which many Command Module design changes were made:

* The cabin atmosphere at launch was changed to 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen at sea-level pressure: {{convert|14.7|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. During ascent the cabin rapidly vented down to {{convert|5|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, releasing approximately 2/3 of the gas originally present at launch. The vent then closed and the environmental control system maintained a nominal cabin pressure of 5 psi as the spacecraft continued into vacuum. The cabin was then very slowly purged (vented to space and simultaneously replaced with 100% oxygen), so the nitrogen concentration fell asymptotically to zero over the next day. Although the new cabin launch atmosphere was significantly safer than 100% oxygen, it still contained almost three times the amount of oxygen present in ordinary sea level air (20.9% oxygen). This was necessary to ensure a sufficient partial pressure of oxygen when the astronauts removed their helmets after reaching orbit. (60% of 5 psi is 3 psi, compared to 20.9% of 14.7 psi, or 3.07 psi in sea-level air.)

* The environment within the astronauts' pressure suits was not changed. Because of the rapid drop in cabin (and suit) pressures during ascent, [[decompression sickness]] was likely unless the nitrogen had been purged from the astronauts' tissues prior to launch. They would still breathe pure oxygen, starting several hours before launch, until they removed their helmets on orbit. Avoiding the "bends" was considered worth the residual risk of an oxygen-accelerated fire within a suit.

* Nylon used in the [[Gemini space suit|Block I suit]]s was replaced in the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Block II suit]]s with [[Beta cloth]], a non-flammable, highly melt-resistant fabric woven from [[Glass (fiber)|fiberglass]] and coated with Teflon.

* Block II had already been planned to use a completely redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened in less than ten seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the [[explosive bolt]]s used on Project Mercury.
* Flammable materials in the cabin were replaced with self-extinguishing versions.
* Plumbing and wiring were covered with protective [[thermal insulation|insulation]].
* 1,407 wiring problems were corrected.

Thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance.

===New mission naming scheme===
The astronauts' widows asked ''Apollo 1'' be reserved for the flight their husbands never made, and on April 24, 1967, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, announced this change officially: AS-204 would be recorded as Apollo 1, "first manned Apollo Saturn flight – failed on ground test".<ref name="MarAprChron">

The manned flight hiatus allowed work to catch up on the Saturn V and Lunar Module, which were encountering their own delays. Apollo 4 flew in November 1967. Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34, later reassembled at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|Launch complex 37B]] and used to launch Apollo 5, an unmanned Earth orbital test flight of the first Lunar Module LM-1, in January 1968. A second unmanned Saturn V AS-502 flew as [[Apollo 6]] in April 1968, and Grissom's backup crew of [[Wally Schirra]], [[Don Eisele]], and [[Walter Cunningham]], finally flew the first manned mission AS-205, Apollo 7, in a Block II CSM in October 1968.

===Launch Complex 34===
{{Main|Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34}}

After the Apollo 1 fire, [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]] was subsequently used only for the launch of Apollo 7 and later dismantled down to the concrete launch pedestal, which remains at the site ({{Coord|28.52182|N|80.561258|W|type:landmark_region:US-FL_scale:10000}}) along with a few other concrete and steel-reinforced structures. The pedestal bears two plaques commemorating the crew. Each year the families of the Apollo 1 crew are invited to the site for a memorial, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center includes the site in its tour of the historic Cape Canaveral launch sites.

In January 2005, three granite benches, built by a college classmate of one of the astronauts, were installed at the site on the southern edge of the launch pad. Each bears the name of one of the astronauts and his military service insignia.

===Stars, landmarks on the Moon and Mars===
* Apollo astronauts frequently aligned their spacecraft [[inertial navigation]] platforms and determined their positions relative to the Earth and Moon by sighting sets of stars with optical instruments. As a practical joke, the Apollo 1 crew named three of the stars in the Apollo catalog after themselves and introduced them into NASA documentation. [[Gamma Cassiopeiae]] became ''Navi'' – Ivan (Gus Grissom's middle name) spelled backwards. [[Iota Ursae Majoris]] became ''Dnoces'' – "Second" spelled backwards, for Edward H. White II. And [[Gamma Velorum]] became ''Regor'' – Roger (Chaffee) spelled backwards. These names quickly stuck after the Apollo 1 accident and were regularly used by later Apollo crews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.postland.html |title=Post-landing Activities |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |year=2006 |work=Apollo 15 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070802025232/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a15/a15.postland.html |archivedate=August 2, 2007 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}} Section 105:11:33.</ref>

==Remains of CM-012==
The Apollo 1 Command Module has never been on public display. After the accident, the spacecraft was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate the cause of the fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA [[Langley Research Center]] in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.

On February 17, 2007, the parts of CM-012 were moved approximately {{convert|90|ft|m}} to a newer, environmentally controlled warehouse.<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Weil |title=Ill-Fated Apollo 1 Capsule Moved to New Site |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701760.html| work=The Washington Post |page=C5 |date=February 18, 2007}}</ref> Only a few weeks earlier, Gus Grissom's brother Lowell publicly suggested CM-012 be permanently entombed in the concrete remains of [[Launch Complex 34]].<ref name="pilotonlineapolloone">{{cite news |title=Burned Apollo I capsule moved to new storage facility in Hampton |first=Diane |last=Tennant |work=[[The Virginian-Pilot|PilotOnline.com]] |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/224831 |date=February 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref>
