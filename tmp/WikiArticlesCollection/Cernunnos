[[Image:Detail of antlered figure on the Gundestrup Cauldron.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "Cernunnos" type antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]].]]
'''Cernunnos''' is the conventional name given in [[Celtic studies]] to depictions of the "[[horned god]]" of [[Celtic polytheism]]. The name itself is only attested once, on the 1st-century [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], but depictions of a horned or antlered figure, often seated cross-legged and often associated with animals and holding or wearing [[torc]]s, are known from other instances.

Nothing is known about the god from literary sources, and details about his name, his cult or his significance in Celtic religion are unknown. Speculative interpretations identify him as a god of nature or fertility.<ref>{{cite book |last=Green |first=Miranda |title=Animals in Celtic Life and Myth |pages=227–8 |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>

==Name==
[[File:Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|Cernunnos on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]]]]
The theonym ''[C]ernunnos''  appears on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], a [[Gallo-Roman]] monument dating to the early 1st century CE, to label a god depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.<ref name="A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227">A. Kingsley Porter, "A Sculpture at Tandragee," ''Burlington Magazine'' 65 (1934), p. 227, pointing out the relative maturation of the antlers.</ref> Both antlers have [[torc]]s hanging from them.<ref name="Maier"/>

The name has been compared to a divine epithet ''Carnonos'' in a Celtic inscription written in [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]] at [[Montagnac, Hérault|Montagnac]], [[Hérault]] (as καρνονου, ''karnonou'', in the [[dative case]]).<ref>Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 106–107.</ref>
A [[Vulgar Latin|Gallo-Latin]] [[adjective]] ''carnuātus'', "horned," is also found.<ref>Equivalent to Latin ''cornutus'', "horned"; Delamarre, citing J. Vendryes, ''Revue Celtique'' 42 (1925) 221–222.</ref>

The [[Proto-Celtic]] form of the theonym is reconstructed as either *''Cerno-on-os''{{dubious|date=October 2010}} or *''Carno-on-os''. The [[augmentative]] ''-on-'' is characteristic of theonyms, as in [[Maponos]], [[Epona]], [[Matronae]], and [[Sirona]].<ref>Delamarre, citing M. Lejeune, ''Lepontica'' (Paris 1971), p. 325.</ref>
Maier (2010) states that the etymology of ''Cernunnos'' is unknown, as the Celtic word for "horn" has an ''a'' (as in ''Carnonos'').<ref name="Maier">Bernard Maier, ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Alfred Kröner, 1994; Boydell, 2000), p. 69 [http://books.google.com/books?id=7AvdTqwucfwC&pg=PA69&dq=%22the+etymology+of+whose+name+is+unclear%22&hl=en&ei=2E3ETPjlFcWOnwfrmpHZCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20etymology%20of%20whose%20name%20is%20unclear%22&f=false online.]</ref>

Gaulish ''karnon'' "horn" is  cognate with Latin ''cornu'' and Germanic ''*hurnaz'', English ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European *ḱer-|*k̑r̥no-]]}}''.<ref>[[Pokorny (1959)]] "k̑er-, k̑erə-; k̑rā-, k̑erei-, k̑ereu"[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0929.html]</ref>
The etymon ''karn-'' "horn" appears in both [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Galatian language|Galatian]] branches of [[Continental Celtic]]. [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] glosses the Galatian word ''karnon'' (κάρνον) as "Gallic trumpet", that is, the Celtic military horn listed as the [[carnyx]] (κάρνυξ) by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], who notes the instrument's animal-shaped bell.<ref>Delamarre; Greek text and English translation of the passage from Eustathius' [[Homeric epics|Homeric]] [[commentary (philology)|commentaries]] given by Edward Wigan, "Account of a Collection of Roman Gold Coins," ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 5 (1865), p. 11 [http://books.google.com/books?id=0VwUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA11&dq=carnyx+Eustathius&hl=en&ei=yEPDTMPmA4SfnAf__a3UCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=carnyx%20Eustathius&f=false online.]</ref> The root also appears in the names of [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic polities]], most prominent among them the [[Carnutes]], meaning something like "the Horned Ones,"<ref>Also ''[[Carni]]'' and ''[[Carnonacae]]''.</ref> and in several  [[personal name]]s found in inscriptions.<ref>Such as ''Carnarus, Carnatus, Carneolus, Carnius'' and ''Carnicus''; Altay Coşkun with Jürgen Zeidler, "'Cover Names' and Nomenclature in Late Roman Gaul: The Evidence of the Bordelaise Poet Ausonius" (2003), p. 33.</ref>

==Epigraphic evidence==
The name ''Cernunnos'' occurs only on the "[[Pillar of the Boatmen]]" (''Pilier des nautes''),<ref>Koch, ''Celtic Culture'', p. 396 [http://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&pg=PA396&dq=Cernunnos+inauthor:Koch&hl=en&ei=Cj7ETMaaO8yRnwfE6dz1CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Cernunnos%20inauthor%3AKoch&f=false online.]</ref> now displayed in the [[Musée National du Moyen Age]] in [[Paris]].

The distinctive stone pillar is an important monument of [[Gallo-Roman religion]]. Its [[low relief]]s depict and label by name several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], and [[Castor (mythology)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (mythology)|Pollux]], along with Gallic deities such as [[Esus]], [[Smertrios]], and [[Tarvos Trigaranus]]. The name ''Cernunnos'' can be read clearly on 18th century drawings of the inscriptions, but the initial letter has been obscured since, so that today only  a reading ''[_]ernunnos'' can be verified<ref>Phyllis Fray Bober, ''Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity'',

Additional evidence is given by one inscription on a metal plaque from [[Steinsel-Rëlent]] in [[Luxembourg]], in the territory of the Celtic [[Treveri]].

==Iconography==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
[[File:God of Etang sur Arroux possible depiction of Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|God of [[Etang-sur-Arroux]], a possible depiction of Cernunnos. He wears a [[torc]] at the neck and on the chest. Two [[snakes]] with ram heads encircle him at the waist. Two cavities at the top of his head are probably designed to receive [[deer]] antlers. Two small human faces at the back of his head indicate that he is [[polycephaly|tricephalic]]. [[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]].]]

The god labelled ''[C]ernunnos'' on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]] is  depicted with stag's antlers in their early stage of annual growth.<ref name="A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227"/> Both antlers have [[torc]]s hanging from them. The lower part of the relief is lost, but the dimensions suggest that the god was sitting cross-legged, providing a direct parallel to the antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

In spite of the name ''Cernunnos'' being attested nowhere else, it is commonly used in Celtological literature as describing all comparable depictions of horned/antlered deities.

This "Cernunnos" type in Celtic iconography is often portrayed with animals, in particular the [[stag]], and also frequently associated with the [[ram-horned serpent]], and less frequently [[bull]]s (at [[Rheims]]), [[dog]]s and [[rat]]s. Because of his frequent association with creatures, scholars often describe Cernunnos as the "[[Lord of the Animals]]" or the "Lord of Wild Things", and Miranda Green describes him as a "peaceful god of nature and fruitfulness".<ref>Green, Miranda (1992) ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'', p. 228.</ref>

The ''Pilier des nautes'' links him with sailors and with commerce, suggesting that he was also associated with material wealth as does the coin pouch from the Cernunnos of Rheims (Marne, Champagne, France)—in antiquity, Durocortorum, the ''civitas'' capital of the [[Remi]] tribe—and the stag vomiting coins from Niedercorn-Turbelslach (Luxembourg) in the lands of the [[Treveri]]. The god may have symbolised the fecundity of the [[Red Deer#Distribution_and_habitat|stag-inhabited forest]].

Other examples of "Cernunnos" images include a [[petroglyph]] in [[Val Camonica]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. The antlered human figure has been dated as early as the 7th century BCE or as late as the 4th.<ref>Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," p. 221, especially note 103.</ref> An antlered child appears on a relief from [[Vendeuvres]], flanked by serpents and holding a purse and a torc.<ref>Anne Ross, "Chain Symbolism in Pagan Celtic Religion," ''Speculum'' 34 (1959), p. 42.</ref> The best known image appears on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] found on [[Jutland]], dating to the 1st century BC, thought to depict Celtic subject matter though usually regarded as of Thracian workmanship.

Among the [[Celtiberians]], horned or antlered figures of the Cernunnos type include a "[[Janus]]-like" god from [[Candelario]] ([[Salamanca]]) with two faces and two small horns; a horned god from the hills of [[Ríotinto]] ([[Huelva]]); and a possible representation of the deity Vestius Aloniecus near his altars in [[Lourizán]] ([[Pontevedra]]). The horns are taken to represent "aggressive power, genetic vigor and fecundity."<ref>Francisco Marco Simón, "Religion and Religious Practices of the Ancient Celts of the Iberian Peninsula," ''e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies'' 6 (2005), p. 310.</ref>

Divine representations of the Cernunnos type are exceptions to the often-expressed view that the Celts only began to picture their gods in human form after the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest of Gaul]].<ref>Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," p. 221.</ref>
The Celtic "horned god", while well attested in iconography, cannot be identified in description of Celtic religion in [[Roman ethnography]] and does not appear to have been given any ''[[interpretatio romana]]'', perhaps due to being too distinctive to be translatable into the Roman pantheon.<ref>Jane Webster, "Creolizing the Roman Provinces," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 105 (2001), p. 222; distinctiveness of Cernunnos also in William Van Andringa, "Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 87–88.</ref>
While Cernunnos was never assimilated, scholars have sometimes compared him functionally to Greek and Roman divine figures such as [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]],<ref>David M. Robinson and Elizabeth Pierce Belgen, "Archaeological Notes and Discussions," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 41 (1937), p. 132.</ref> [[Actaeon]], specialized forms of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Dis Pater]], the latter of whom [[Julius Caesar]] said was considered the ancestor of the Gauls.<ref>Phyllis Fray Bober, “Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity,” ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 55 (1951), p. 15ff.</ref>

==Possible reflexes in Insular Celtic==
There have been attempts to find the ''cern'' root in the name of [[Conall Cernach]], the foster brother of the Irish hero [[Cuchulainn]]<ref>Porter, "A Sculpture at Tandragee," p. 227.</ref> in the [[Ulster Cycle]]. In this line of interpretation, ''Cernach'' is taken as an epithet with a wide semantic field — "angular; victorious; bearing a prominent growth" — and Conall is seen as "the same figure" as the ancient Cernunnos.<ref>John Koch, entry on "Cernunnos," ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 396.</ref>

==Possible connection to Saint Ciarán==
Some see the qualities of Cernunnos subsumed into the ''life'' of [[Ciarán|Saint Ciarán of Saighir]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]].  When he was building his first tiny cell, as his [[Hagiography|hagiograph]] goes, his first disciple and monk was a boar that had been rendered gentle by God.  This was followed by a fox, a badger, a wolf and a stag.<ref>{{cite book| last = Mac Cana| first = Proinsias| title = Celtic Mythology| origyear = 1970| year = 1973| publisher = The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited| location = London| isbn = 0-600-00647-6| pages = 47–8}}</ref>

==Neopaganism==
In [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[Neopaganism]] a [[Horned God]] is revered; this divinity syncretises a number of horned or antlered gods from various cultures, including Cernunnos. The Horned God reflects the seasons of the year in an annual cycle of life, death and rebirth.<ref>Farrar, Stewart & Janet, ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''</ref>

In the tradition of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], the Horned God is sometimes specifically referred to as Cernunnos, or sometimes also as Kernunno.<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 52-53</ref>
