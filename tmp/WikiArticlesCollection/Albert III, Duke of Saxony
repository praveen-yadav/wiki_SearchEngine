'''Albert III''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht}}) (27 January 1443 – 12 September 1500) was a [[rulers of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]. He was nicknamed '''Albert the Bold''' or '''Albert the Courageous''' and founded the ''Albertine line'' of the [[House of Wettin]].

==Biography==
[[File:Dresden Fürstenzug 086.JPG|thumb|left|Ernest, Elector of Saxony (1464–1486), Frederick II, Elector of Saxony (1428–1464) and Albert III, Duke of Saxony (1486–1500); from left to right, [[Fürstenzug]], Dresden, Germany]]
Albert was born in [[Grimma]] as the third and youngest son (but fifth child in order of birth) of [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II the Gentle, Elector of Saxony]], and Margarete of Austria, sister of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Later, he was a member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].

After escaping from the hands of [[Kunz von Kaufungen]], who had abducted him together with his brother [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]], he spent some time at the court of the emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] in [[Vienna]].

In [[Cheb|Eger (Cheb)]] on 11 November 1464 Albert married [[Sidonie Podiebrad|Zdenka (Sidonie)]], daughter of [[George of Podebrady]], King of [[Bohemia]]; but failed to obtain the Bohemian Crown on the death of George in 1471.

After the death of his father in 1464, Albert and Ernest ruled their lands together, but in 1485 a division was made by the [[Treaty of Leipzig]], and Albert received the [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]], together with some adjoining districts, and founded the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin.

Regarded as a capable soldier by the emperor, Albert (in 1475) took a prominent part in the campaign against [[Charles the Bold]], [[duke of Burgundy]], and in 1487 [[Siege of Wiener-Neustadt|led an expedition]] against [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of Hungary, which failed owing to lack of support on the part of the emperor.

In 1488 he was appointed [[List of Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor]] of the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] (until 1493{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}) and marched with the imperial forces to free the Roman king [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] from his imprisonment at Bruges, and when, in 1489, the King returned to Germany, Albert was left as his representative to prosecute the war against the rebels. He was successful in restoring the authority of Maximilian in [[Holland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Brabant (duchy)|Brabant]], but failed to obtain any repayment of the large sums of money which he had spent in these campaigns.

His services were rewarded in 1498 when Maximilian bestowed upon him the title of Hereditary Governor (''potestat'') of [[Friesland]], but he had to make good his claim by force of arms. He had to a great extent succeeded, and was paying a visit to Saxony, when he was recalled by news of a fresh rising. [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] was captured, but soon afterwards the duke died at [[Emden]]. He was buried at Meissen.

Albert, who was a man of great strength and considerable skill in feats of arms, delighted in tournaments and knightly exercises.  His loyalty to the emperor Frederick, and the expenses incurred in this connection, aroused some irritation among his subjects, but his rule was a period of prosperity in Saxony.
