'''Bézout's identity''' (also called '''Bezout's lemma''') is a theorem in the elementary [[number theory|theory of numbers]]: let ''a'' and ''b'' be [[integer]]s, not both zero, and let ''d'' be their [[greatest common divisor]]. Then there exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that
: <math> ax+by=d </math>
In addition, i) ''d'' is the smallest positive integer that can be written as 
{{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by'',}}
and ii) every integer of the form 
{{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by'' }}
is a multiple of ''d''. ''x'' and ''y'' are called '''Bézout coefficients''' for (''a'', ''b''); they are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients (in fact one of the two pairs such that <math>|x|<\left |\frac{b}{d}\right |</math> and <math>|y|<\left |\frac{a}{d}\right |</math>) can be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].

Bézout's lemma is true in any [[principal ideal domain]], but there are [[integral domain]]s in which it is not true.

==History==

[[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Étienne Bézout]] (1730–1783) proved this identity for polynomials.<ref>Bézout, [http://books.google.fr/books?id=FoxbAAAAQAAJ&hl=en&pg=PP5#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Théorie générale des équations algébriques''] (Paris, France:  Ph.-D. Pierres, 1779).</ref> However, this statement for integers can be found already in the work of another French mathematician, [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]] (1581–1638).<ref>

Deux nombres premiers entre eux estant donnez, treuver le moindre multiple de chascun d’iceux, surpassant de l’unité un multiple de l’autre.”  (Given two numbers [which are] relatively prime, find the lowest multiple of each of them [such that] one multiple exceeds the other by unity (1).)  This problem (namely, ax - by = 1) is a special case of Bézout’s equation and was used by Bachet to solve the problems appearing on pages 199 ff.

==Non-uniqueness of solutions==

After one pair of Bézout coefficients (''x'', ''y'') has been computed (using [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] or some other algorithm), all pairs have the form
:<math>\left(x+k\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)},\ y-k\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right),</math>
where {{math|''k''}} is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.

Among these pairs of Bézout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy 
:<math> |x| < \left |\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)}\right |\quad \text{and}\quad |y| < \left |\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right |.</math>
This relies on a property of [[Euclidean division]]: given two integers ''c'' and ''d'', if ''d'' does not divide ''c'', there is exactly one pair {{math|(''q'',''r'')}} such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=0 < ''r'' < {{!}}''d''{{!}}}}, and another one such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=0 < -''r'' < {{!}}''d''{{!}}}}.

Extended Euclidean algorithm always produces one of these two minimal pairs.

===Example===

Let ''a'' = 12 and ''b'' = 42, gcd(12, 42) = 6. Then we have the following Bézout's identities, with the Bézout coefficients written in red for the minimal pairs and in blue for the other ones.

:<math>
\begin{align}
\vdots \\
12 &\times \color{blue}{-10} & + \;\; 42  &\times \color{blue}{3} &= 6 \\
12 &\times \color{red}{-3} & + \;\;42  &\times \color{red}{1} &= 6 \\
12 &\times \color{red}{4}  & + \;\;42  &\times\color{red}{-1} &= 6 \\
12 &\times \color{blue}{11} & + \;\;42  &\times \color{blue}{-3} &= 6 \\
12 &\times \color{blue}{18} & + \;\;42  &\times \color{blue}{-5} &= 6 \\
\vdots
\end{align}
</math>

==Bézout's identity for several integers==

Bézout's identity can be extended to more than two integers: if 
:<math>\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = d</math> 

then there are integers <math>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</math> 

such that

:<math>d = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n,</math>

has the following properties
# ''d'' is smallest positive integer of this form
# every number of this form is a multiple of ''d''
# ''d'' is a [[greatest common divisor]] of ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, meaning that every common divisor of ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> divides ''d''

==Bézout's identity for polynomials==
{{main|Polynomial greatest common divisor#Bézout's identity and extended GCD algorithm}}
Bézout's identity works for [[polynomial]] in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] over a [[field (mathematics)]] exactly in the same ways as for integers. In particular the Bézout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the [[Extended Euclidean algorithm]].

As the common [[root of a polynomial|root]]s of two polynomials are the roots of their greatest common divisor, Bézout's identity and [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] imply the following result: ''Given two univariate polynomials f and g with coefficients in an field, there exist two polynomials a and b such that af'' + ''bg'' = 1 ''if and only if f and g have no common root in any [[algebraically closed field]] (commonly the field of [[complex number]]s)''.

The generalization of this result to any number of polynomials and indeterminates is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].

==Bézout's identity for principal ideal domains==
As noted in the introduction, Bézout's identity works not only in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers, but also in any other [[principal ideal domain]] (PID).
That is, if ''R'' is a PID, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''R'', and ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'',
then there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. The reason: the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''Ra''+''Rb'' is principal and indeed is equal to ''Rd''.
An integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds is called a [[Bézout domain]].

==Proof==
Bézout's lemma is a consequence of the [[Euclidean division]] defining property, namely that the  division by a nonzero integer ''b'' has a [[remainder]] strictly less than |''b''|. The proof that follows may be adapted for any [[Euclidean domain]]. For given nonzero integers ''a'' and ''b'' there is a nonzero integer {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} ''as'' + ''bt''}} of minimal absolute value among all those of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' with ''x'' and ''y'' integers; one can assume ''d'' &gt; 0 by changing the signs of both ''s'' and ''t'' if necessary. Now the remainder of dividing either ''a'' or ''b'' by ''d'' is also of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' since it is obtained by subtracting a multiple of {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} ''as'' + ''bt''}} from ''a'' or ''b'', and on the other hand it has to be strictly smaller in absolute value than ''d''. This leaves 0 as only possibility for such a remainder, so ''d'' divides ''a'' and ''b'' exactly.
If ''c'' is another common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', then ''c'' also divides ''as'' + ''bt'' = ''d''. Since ''c'' divides ''d'' but is not equal to it, it must be less than ''d''. This means that ''d'' is the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''; this completes the proof.
