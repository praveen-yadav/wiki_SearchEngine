A '''cult film''', also commonly referred to as a '''cult classic''', is a [[film]] that has acquired a [[cult following]]. Cult films are known for their dedicated [[fanbase]], an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and [[audience participation]].  Inclusive definitions allow for major Hollywood productions, especially [[box office bomb]]s, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, [[transgressive art|transgressive]] films, shunned by the [[mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]].  The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror [[classificatory disputes about art]]. The term ''cult movie'' as well as ''midnight movie'' was first used by critics and viewers in 1970, for the New York [[premiere]] of ''[[El topo]]'' by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]. 

Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and [[film censorship|suppressed]] films kept alive by dedicated fans.  In some cases, reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release, sometimes for their [[camp (style)|camp]] value.  Some cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films.  After failing in the cinema, some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or big sellers on home video.  Others have inspired their own [[film festival]]s.

Since the late 1970s, cult films have become increasingly more popular and mainstream, which has drawn accusations that Hollywood studios have begun trying to artificially create cult films.  Films are frequently stated to be an "instant cult classic" now, sometimes before they are released.  Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release.  At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, thanks to spreading [[viral marketing|virally]] through [[social media]].  Easy access to cult films, via [[video on demand]] and [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] have led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films. Overbroad usage has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless term.

In 2008, ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film.  Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a [[transgressive art|transgressive]] element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to white males and mainstreaming of cult films.  Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements.  Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior.  Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria.  Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in [[structuration]], where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized.  Ernest Mathijs focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword.<ref name=cineaste>{{cite journal| last1=Church| first1=David| last2=Hills| first2=Matt| last3=Hunter| first3=I.

That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident.<ref name=cineaste />  This ambiguity leads critics of [[postmodernism]] to accuse cult films of being beyond criticism as the emphasis is now on personal interpretation rather than critical analysis or [[metanarrative]]s.<ref name=shiel />  However, these inherent dichotomies can lead critics to pronounce beloved cult films to be "so bad it's good"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evil Dead – Cult Classic or Low-Budget Rubbish?|url=http://www.thelondonfilmreview.com/articles/debate-the-evil-dead-cult-classic-or-low-budget-rubbish/|work=The London Film Review|accessdate=2013-05-19}}</ref> or for audiences to be split between ironic and earnest fans.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Jason|title=Cult horror House finally finds home in Toronto|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2010/07/22/cult_horror_house_finally_finds_home_in_toronto.html|accessdate=2013-05-19|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2010-07-22}}</ref>

Quoting Jeffrey Sconce, Jancovich et al. define cult films in terms of [[paracinema]], marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography.  However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their "subcultural ideology" and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term.  Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally.  At the same time, they point out that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than than a rebellion against it.  This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as [[defamiliarization]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|last1=Jancovich|first1=Mark|last2=Reboll|first2=Antonio Làzaro|last3=Stringer|first3=Julian|last4=Willis|first4=Andy|year=2003|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3|pages=1–3|chapter=Introduction|display-editors=4}}</ref>  This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream.  This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream.<ref name=alamo>{{cite journal| last=de Ville| first=Donna| title=Cultivating the Cult Experience at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema| journal=Scope| year=2011| issue=20| url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=20&id=1306|accessdate=2013-06-04| issn=1465-9166}}</ref>  Xavier Mendik also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content, especially if it is transgressive.  Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.<ref name=sheep>{{cite journal|last=Sélavy|first=Virginie|title=Interview with Xavier Mendik|journal=Electric Sheep|date=2008-05-01|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2008/05/01/interview-with-xavier-mendik/|accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref>

Cult films have existed since the early days of cinema. ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), for example, was an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''.  Stoker's widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy.  All known copies of the film were destroyed, and ''Nosferatu'' become an early cult film, kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Phil|title=The Bootleg Files: "Nosferatu"|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/2056/|work=[[Film Threat]]|accessdate=2013-04-29|authorlink=Phil Hall (US writer)|date=2007-10-26}}</ref>  Chuck Kleinhans identifies the [[Marx Brothers]] as making other early cult films.<ref name=cineaste />  On their original release, some highly regarded classics from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] were panned by critics and audiences, relegated to cult status. ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) was a cult film for years, quoted often and championed by fans, before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ventura|first=Elbert|title=The Greatest One-Off in Movie History|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/11/the_greatest_oneoff_in_movie_history.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=2010-11-09}}</ref>  During this time, American [[exploitation film]]s and imported European [[art film]]s were marketed similarly. Although critics [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] argued against arbitrary divisions into [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture|low]] culture, American films settled into rather rigid genres, but European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions.  These exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films.<ref name=betz>{{cite book| last=Betz| first=Mark| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Art, Exploitation, and Underground|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|202–205}}  Much like later cult films, these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation, influenced by live theater and vaudeville.<ref name=alamo />

Modern cult films grew from 1960s [[counterculture]] and [[underground film]]s, popular among those who rejected mainstream Hollywood films.  These underground film festivals led to the creation of [[midnight movie]]s, which attracted cult followings.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|title=The Weirdo Element|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/mar/02/5|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-04-27|date=2007-03-01}}</ref> These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier [[avant-garde film]]s.<ref name=shiel />  Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream, peaking with the release of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), which finally found its audience several years after its release.  Eventually, the rise of home video would marginalize midnight movies once again after which many directors joined the burgeoning [[independent film]] scene or went back underground.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|title=Cult Cinema|year=2011|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=9781444396430|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&pg=PT27|chapter=Cult Movie Contexts: Midnight Movies|location=Malden, MA}}</ref>  Home video would give a second life to box office flops, as positive [[word-of-mouth]] or excessive replay on cable television led these films to develop an appreciative audience,<ref name=cult-dead>{{cite news|last=Kirkland|first=Bruce|title=Cult Movies Are All But Dead|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/04/05/cult-movies-are-all-but-dead|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|accessdate=2013-04-27|date=2013-04-08}}</ref> as well as obsessive replay and study.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pevere|first=Geoff|title=Room 237, The Shining and Our Obsession with Cult Films|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/room-237-the-shining-and-our-obsession-with-cult-films/article11816475/|accessdate=2013-05-14|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2013-05-13}}</ref>  For example, ''[[The Beastmaster]]'' (1982), despite its failure at the box office, became one of the most played movies on American cable television<ref>{{cite journal|last=Browne|first=David|title=Dar He Goes Again|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307943,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2013-05-06|date=1993-09-10|issue=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Chris|title="Beastmaster" Actor Has Kept Busy|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/180144/BEASTMASTER-ACTOR-HAS-KEPT-BUSY.html?pg=all|accessdate=2013-05-06|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=1991-08-28}}</ref> and developed into a cult film.<ref name=bbc-cult />  Home video and television broadcasts of cult films were initially greeted with hostility.

Releases from major studios – such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), which was distributed by [[Universal Studios]] – can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video.  Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture.  With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues.  The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as ''The Big Lebowski'', can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among somewhat more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers.  Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klinger|first=Barbara|title=Becoming Cult: The Big Lebowski, Replay Culture and Male Fans|url=http://library.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/data/guides/english/klinger_lebowski.pdf|work=[[University of Oregon]]|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>

The early cult horror films of [[Peter Jackson]] were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and [[Cinema of New Zealand|its cinema]].  As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jackson's career trajectory.  ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994) acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealand's national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.<ref>{{cite book| last=Wu| first=Harmony H.| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=84–104| chapter=Trading in Horror, Cult, and Matricide|display-editors=4}}</ref>

Ernest Mathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management.  Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time.  They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours.  Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular.  Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentine's Day.  These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Time Wasted|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-03-29|volume=11|issue=10|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/03/time-wasted-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>  Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor.  These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers.  New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of ''[[It's A Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947).  These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Television and the Yuletide Cult|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-01-08|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/01/television-and-the-yuletide-cult-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>  Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting society's taboos and testing one's fears.  Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween.  Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community.  Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Threat or Treat: Film, Television, and the Ritual of Halloween|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2009-10-30|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://flowtv.org/2009/10/threat-or-treat-film-television-and-the-ritual-of-halloween-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

Despite their oppositional nature, cult films can produce celebrities.

==Transgression and censorship==

Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s.  Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of [[European art cinema]] and [[experimental film]], the gritty subject matter of [[Italian neorealism]], and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation.  Some also used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time.  In the 1980s, [[Nick Zedd]] identified this movement as the [[Cinema of Transgression]] and later wrote a manifesto.  Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led Joan Hawkins to label them as "downtown culture".  These films acquired a legendary reputation, as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as ''[[The Village Voice]]''.  Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film.<ref name=hawkins>{{cite book| last=Hawkins| first=Joan| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Midnight Sex–Horror Movies|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|224–230}}  Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Mary Frances|title=Darkness rules for Batman fans in Vancouver|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=375dc063-9e4f-41c6-bd1e-b653d6cb6314|accessdate=2013-07-08|newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]]|date=2008-07-20}}</ref>  Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' (2002), which broke many rules of teenage [[slasher film]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allsop|first=Samara L.|title=Battle Royale – Challenging Global Stereotypes Within the Constructs of a Contemporary Japanese Slasher Film|journal=The Film Journal|year=2002|issue=7|url=http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue7/battleroyale.html|accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref>  The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stadler|first=Jane|title=The Cult of Aeon Flux|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2007-09-29|volume=6|issue=7|url=http://flowtv.org/2007/09/cult-of-%C3%A6on-flux/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>  Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.<ref name=spoons>{{cite journal| last=McCulloch| first=Richard| title='Most people bring their own spoons': The Room's Participatory Audiences as Comedy Mediators| journal=Participations| year=2011| volume=8| issue=2| url=http://www.participations.org/Volume%208/Issue%202/2d%20McCulloch.pdf| accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref>{{rp|197}}

According to Ernest Mathijs, critical reception is important to a film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy.  Topicality, which can be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response.  Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy, such as a [[moral panic]], which provides opposition.  Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film.  These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar.  However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important.  While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist.  Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status.<ref>{{cite book| last=Mathijs| first=Ernest| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=109–123| chapter=The Making of a Cult Reputation|display-editors=4}}</ref>  Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, such as [[Rex Reed]]'s comments about Korean culture.<ref name=extreme />  Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as Joe Bob Briggs and [[Roger Ebert]] dueling over ''[[I Spit On Your Grave]]'' (1978).

Peter Hutchings, noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known in part for their excesses.  Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways which break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms.  Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema.  [[Film censorship]] can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films.  Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors.  Fans will sometimes express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema.<ref name=hutchings>{{cite book| last=Hutchings| first=Peter| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=The Argento Effect|display-editors=4}}</ref>{{rp|131–134}}  In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted.<ref name=extreme />   Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films.<ref name=sick />  Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny,<ref>{{cite news|last=Jupp|first=Emily|title=Terrible Acting, Flimsy Sets, Wanton Misogyny...Tommy Wiseau's The Room Becomes a Cult Hit|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/terrible-acting-flimsy-sets-wanton-misogynytommy-wiseaus-the-room-becomes-a-cult-hit-8515346.html|accessdate=2013-05-19|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=2013-03-01}}</ref> using these films as catharsis for the things that they hate most in life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ranade|first=Raj|title=A Really Bad Movie Becomes a Cult Classic|url=http://www.ct.com/entertainment/movies/nm-ht06filmtheroom-20130207,0,3237824.story|work=[[WCCT-TV]]|publisher=[[Tribune Broadcasting]]|accessdate=2013-06-05|date=2013-02-05}}</ref>  Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire.

Films that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films.  [[Jean Rollin]] worked within ''[[fantastique#Cinéma Fantastique|cinéma fantastique]]'', a very unpopular genre in France.  Influenced by American films and early French fantasists, he drifted between art, exploitation, and pornography.

The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy.

Matt Hills' concept of the "cult blockbuster" involves cult followings inside larger, mainstream films.  Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings.  The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and [[fan work]]s.  Hills identifies three different cult followings for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Matt|title=The Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context|year=2006|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London New York|isbn=9781904764823|pages=160–169|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I8mxughWAOEC&pg=PA160|editor-first=Ernest|editor-last=Mathijs|chapter=Realising the Cult Blockbuster: The Lord of the Rings Fandom and Residual/Emergent Cult Status in 'The Mainstream'}}</ref>  Emma Pett identifies ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985) as another example of a cult blockbuster.

Cult films can create their own subculture.  ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''{{'}}s cult following has established its own customs and norms of behavior, which are often at direct odds with mainstream society.  These less restrictive norms encourage individuality and experimentation, a theme seen in the film.  Although fans received mainstream disapproval for their activities, they stuck together and formed long-lasting bonds.  Eventually, peer pressure drove fans to engage in standardized audience participation rituals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Call|first=T. D.|title=The Subculture of the Rocky Horror Picture Show|journal=Think Magazine|date=2009-12-06|origyear=1998|url=http://www.think-magazine.com/culture/31-artists/503-the-subculture-of-the-rocky-horror-picture-show.html|accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref>  Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans, cult film fandom can include many newer, less experienced members.<ref name=spoons />{{rp|190–191}}  Familiar with the film's reputation and having watched clips on YouTube, these fans may take the next step and enter the film's fandom.  If they are the majority, they may alter or ignore long-standing traditions, such as audience participation rituals; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized, but accepted rituals will bring subcultural capital to veteran fans introducing them to the newer members.  Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions.  Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing, but longtime fans often cite the community itself.  Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film, as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself.  Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation.<ref name=spoons />{{rp|200–211}}  Fans of cult films, as in [[media fandom]], are frequently producers instead of mere consumers.  Unconcerned with traditional views on intellectual property, these fan works are often unsanctioned, transformative, and ignore [[Canon (fiction)|fictional canon]].<ref>{{cite book| last1=Mathijs| first1=Ernest| last2=Sexton| first2=Jamie| title=Cult Cinema| year=2011| publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]| isbn=9781405173742| page=57|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&pg=PA57| chapter=Fandom and Subculture: Fan Studies: Early Approaches| location=Chichester, West Sussex Malden, MA}}</ref>

Like cult films themselves, magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness.  They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism.  Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital.  Specialist stores on the fringes of society (or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery.<ref name=hollows />{{rp|45–47}}  By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded.  Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation.  Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute.  When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed.  Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the "[[the Other]]".  Commercial aspects of fandom (such as magazines or books) can also be defined in terms of "otherness" and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated.  Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used.<ref name=trivia />{{rp|192–197}}  In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital.  Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a "sick film", will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.<ref name=sick />

The critic [[Michael Medved]] characterized examples of the "so bad it's good" class of low-budget cult film through books such as ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''.

===Midnight movies===
Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli describes [[midnight movie]]s as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America,<ref name=midnight />{{rp|27}} and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to Libertarian, united in their anti-establishment attitude and punk aesthetic.<ref name=hawkins />{{rp|223}} These films are resistant to simple categorization, defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences.  Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively.<ref name=midnight>{{cite book|last=Crowder-Taraborrelli|first=Tomas F.|title=Cult Pop Culture: How the Fringe Became Mainstream: How the Fringe Became Mainstream, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9780313357817|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqd92sX1hAoC&pg=PA27|editor-first=Bob|editor-last=Batchelor|chapter=Midnight Movies and the Phenomenon of the Cult Film}}</ref>{{rp|27–30}}  Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s.  Like the surrealists and dadaists, they not only satirically attacked society but also the very structure of film – a counter-cinema that deconstructs narrative and traditional processes.<ref name=hawkins />{{rp|224–226}}  In the late 1980s and 1990s, midnight movies transitioned from underground showings to home video viewings; eventually, a desire for community brought a resurgence, and ''The Big Lebowski'' kick-started a new generation.  Demographics shifted, and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them.  Although studios expressed skepticism, large audiences were drawn to box office flops, such as ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001) and ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|title=Cult Rapture|journal=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|date=2003-09-17|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/09.17.03/cult-0338.html|accessdate=2013-07-28}}</ref>  Today, midnight movies are more popular than ever and strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight.  Mainstream cinemas, eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits, have begun abandoning midnight screenings.  Although classic midnight films have dropped off in popularity, they still bring reliable crowds.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Mark|last2=Kaufman|first2=Amy|title=Moviegoing at the Midnight Hour|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/04/entertainment/la-et-mn-ca-new-midnight-movies-20130505|accessdate=2013-07-28|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2013-05-04}}</ref>

===Art, exploitation, and genre films===
Although seemingly at odds with each other, [[art film|art]] and [[exploitation film]]s are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response.

Anime, which is often highly franchised, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity.  The ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' franchise, for example, provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies.

Cult films are often approached in terms of [[auteur theory]], which states that the director's creative vision drives a film.  This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics.<ref name=hutchings />{{rp|135}}  Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult.<ref name=cineaste />  According to Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism.  Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship.  By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans.  Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Greg|title=Artists in the Audience: Cults, Camp, and American Film Criticism|year=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=9780691089553|pages=87–88|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fukKSOOc0dYC&pg=PA87}}</ref>  Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs.  This may take the place of – and even ignore – political readings of the director.  Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture.  While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation.  Someone like [[George Romero]], whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Joe|title="They Have the Oscars": Oppositional Telebranding and the Cult of the Horror Auteur|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-07-16|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/07/oppositional-telebranding-and-the-cult-of-the-horror-auteur/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>
