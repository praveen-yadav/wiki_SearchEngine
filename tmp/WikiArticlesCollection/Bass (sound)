'''Bass''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|s}} {{respell|BAYSS|'}}; {{lang-it|basso}}, deep, low) describes [[Pitch (music)|tone]]s of low [[frequency]] or [[range (music)|range]].  In musical compositions, these are the lowest parts of the [[harmony]].

==Musical role==
Played in a [[musical ensemble]] such as through techno music, rap or 'drum and bass' on a computer, or via an [[orchestra]], such notes are frequently used to provide a [[counterpoint]] or counter-[[melody]], in a [[harmony|harmonic]] context either to outline or juxtapose the progression of the [[chord (music)|chord]]s, or with [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] to underline the [[rhythm]]. In popular music the bass part most often provides harmonic and rhythmic support, usually playing the root or fifth of the chord and stressing the strong beats. "The bass differs from other voices because of the particular role it plays in supporting and defining harmonic motion. It does so at levels ranging from immediate, chord-by-chord events to the larger harmonic organization of a entire work."<ref>Cadwallader, Allen (1998). ''Analysis of Tonal Music: A Schenkerian Approach'', p. 45. ISBN 0195102320.</ref>

==Kinds of bass harmony==
In [[classical music]], different forms of bass are: ''basso concertante'', or ''basso recitante'', the bass of the little chorus, the bass which accompanies the softer passages of a composition, as well as those passages which employ the whole power of the ensemble, generally played by the [[violoncello]]s in orchestral music; ''contrabass'' (“under bass”), is described as that part which, when there are two bass lines in a composition, is performed by the [[double bass]]es, the violoncellos taking the upper bass or ''basso concertante''; ''basso ripieno'', the bass of the grand chorus, that bass which joins in the full passages of a composition, and, by its depth of tone and energy of stroke, affords a powerful contrast to the lighter and softer passages or movements.<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Bass (music)}}</ref>
