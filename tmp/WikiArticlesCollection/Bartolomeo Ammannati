[[File:Fountains of Neptune.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]]'' (''Fontana del Nettuno'') on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]]]
'''Bartolomeo Ammannati''' (18 June 1511 – 13 April 1592) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[Sculpture|sculptor]], born at [[Settignano]], near [[Florence]]. He studied under [[Baccio Bandinelli]] and [[Jacopo Sansovino]] (assisting on the Library of St. Mark's, the ''[[Biblioteca Marciana]]'', Venice) and closely imitated the style of [[Michelangelo]].

He was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture.  He designed many buildings in [[Rome]], which included work at the [[Villa Giulia]] complex (in collaboration with [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola|Vignola]] and [[Vasari]]), also at  [[Lucca]] and Florence.  His work at the completion of [[Pitti Palace]], commissioned by Eleonora of Toledo, wife of [[Cosimo I]], is one of his most celebrated achievements (1558–1570), respecting the original style of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. He was also named ''Console'' of the prestigious [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] of Florence, founded by the Duke Cosimo I, at 13 January 1563, under the influence of Vasari.

He was then employed in 1569 to build the beautiful bridge over the [[Arno]], known as [[Ponte Santa Trinita]] and one of his most celebrated works.  The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, have resisted the fury of the river, which has swept away several other bridges at different times.  It was destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and rebuilt in 1957.

Another of his most important works was the marble and bronze ''[[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]]'' (''Fontana del Nettuno'') for the [[Piazza della Signoria]]. The assignment was originally given to the ageing [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli]]. On his death, Ammannati won the competition for the continuing of this assignment over other famous sculptors, such as [[Benvenuto Cellini]] and [[Vincenzo Danti]]. He worked between 1563 and 1565 on the original block of marble (chosen by Bandinelli), together with his assistants, among which [[Giambologna]]. He took Grand Duke [[Cosimo I]] as model for Neptune's face. When the work on the ungainly sea god was finished, [[Michelangelo]] scoffed at Ammannati that he had ruined a beautiful piece of marble: "Ammannati, Ammanato, che bell' marmo hai rovinato!"  Ammannati continued working on this fountain for another ten years, adding, in a [[mannerist]] style,  around the perimeter suave bronze reclining river gods,  laughing [[satyr]]s and marble sea horses emerging from the water. The whole gives nevertheless a coherent impression. The fountain served as an example for future fountain-makers.

Other famous sculptures by Ammannati include:
* the marble statue ''Victory'' (1540), [[Museo Nazionale del Bargello]], Florence
* the marble statue ''[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] with the Swan'' in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence.
* the bronze statue of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (1558–59), in the [[Prado Museum]] ([[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).
* the marble statue ''Parnassus'' (1563), Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence
* the stone statue ''Allegory of Winter'' (1563–65), [[Villa Medici]], Castello
* the bronze statue ''Goddess Opi'' (1572–75), [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence

In 1550 Ammannati married [[Laura Battiferri]], an elegant poet and an accomplished woman. Later in his life he had a religious crisis, influenced by [[Counter-Reformation]] piety, which resulted in condemning his own works depicting [[nudity]], and he left all his possessions to the [[Jesuits]].

He died in Florence in 1592.
