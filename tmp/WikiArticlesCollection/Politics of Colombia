{{Politics of Colombia}}

The '''Politics of Colombia''' take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Colombia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a  [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of [[Congress of Colombia|congress]], the [[Senate of Colombia|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of Colombia]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

==Constitutional reforms==
[[Colombia]]'s present constitution, enacted on July 5, 1991, strengthened the administration of justice with the provision for introduction of an [[adversarial system]] which ultimately is to entirely replace the existing [[Napoleonic Code]]. Other [http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/40/40 significant reforms] under the new constitution provide for civil divorce, dual nationality, the election of a vice president, and the election of departmental governors. The constitution expanded citizens' basic rights, including that of "tutela," under which an immediate court action can be requested by an individual if he or she feels that their constitutional rights are being violated and if there is no other [[legal recourse]].

The national government has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

==Executive branch==

The president is elected for a four-year term and, since 2005, can be re-elected for one consecutive term. The 1991 constitution reestablished the position of [[Vice President of Colombia|vice president]], who is elected on the same ticket as the president. By law, the vice president will succeed in the event of the president's resignation, illness, or death.

==Legislative branch==
{{See also|Congress of Colombia}}

Colombia's bicameral Congress consists of a 102-member [[Senate of Colombia]] and a 161-member [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia]]. Senators are elected on the basis of a nationwide ballot, while representatives are elected in multi member districts co-located within the 32 national departments. The country's capital is a separate capital district and elects its own representatives. Members may be re-elected indefinitely, and, in contrast to the previous system, there are no alternate congressmen. Congress meets twice a year, and the president has the power to call it into special session when needed.

==Judicial branch==

The civilian judiciary is a separate and independent branch of government. Guidelines and the general structure for Colombia's administration of justice are set out in Law 270 of March 7, 1996. Colombia's legal system has recently begun to incorporate some elements of an oral, accusatorial system. The judicial branch's general structure is composed of four distinct jurisdictions (civilian, administrative, constitutional, and special). Colombia's highest judicial organs include the Supreme Court, the Council of State, the Constitutional Court, and the Superior Judicial Council. This sometimes leads to conflicting opinions since there is no one court which clearly has authority over the decisions of the other three.
