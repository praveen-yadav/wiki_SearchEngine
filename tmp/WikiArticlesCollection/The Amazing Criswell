:''For the mentalist Kreskin (born 1935), see [[The Amazing Kreskin]].''

'''Jeron Criswell King''' (August 18, 1907&nbsp;&ndash; October 4, 1982), born '''Jeron Criswell Konig''', and known by his stage-name '''The Amazing Criswell''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|z|w|ɛ|l}}, was an American [[parapsychology|psychic]] known for wildly inaccurate predictions. In person, he went by '''Charles Criswell King''', and was sometimes credited as '''Jeron King Criswell'''.

Criswell was flamboyant with spit curled hair, a [[wikt:stentorian|stentorian]] style of speaking, and a [[sequin]]ed [[Black tie|tuxedo]]. He owned a [[coffin]] in which he claimed to sleep. He grew up in a troubled family in [[Indiana]] with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. The casket appeared in one of [[Ed Wood|Ed Wood's]] later works, the 1971 [[pornography|pornographic]] film, ''[[Necromania]]''.

==Career==
Criswell said he had once worked as a [[radio announcer]] and news broadcaster. He began buying time on a local Los Angeles television station in the early 1950s to run [[infomercials]] for his "Criswell Family Vitamins". To fill the time, he began his Criswell Predicts part of the show. They made him a minor, off-beat celebrity in Los Angeles and around Hollywood, and his friendship with old show-business types like [[Mae West]] and rising fringe celebrities like [[Korla Pandit]] made Criswell an entertaining presence at parties. His fame brought him appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Jack Paar Show]]'' (1957–1962) and he published two books of predictions and recorded one long playing record featuring 84 minutes of his predictions in his own voice. Criswell found cinematic infamy in the movies of Ed Wood.

==Predictions==
[[File:Plan 9 from Outer Space - Criswell Predicts.ogv|thumb|250px|"Criswell Predicts" scene in [[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]]]
Criswell's predictions were nationally syndicated and he appeared on the television show ''Criswell Predicts'' on KLAC Channel 13 (now [[KCOP|KCOP-13]]) in Los Angeles as well as being recorded for syndication. His announcer was Bob Shields, who later played the judge on ''[[Divorce Court]]''. Criswell wore heavy makeup in public after his live program was broadcast in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Only selected people were allowed in the KCOP studio during his broadcast.

Criswell wrote several books of predictions, including 1968's ''Criswell Predicts: From Now to the Year 2000.'' In it, he claimed that [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of [[Natural rubber|rubber]], leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks.<ref>[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-1.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 1)]</ref> He predicted mass [[cannibalism]]<ref name=predicts>[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-5.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 5)]</ref> and the [[End time|end of planet Earth]], which he set as happening on August 18, 1999.<ref name="predicts"/>

Criswell was a student of history. He believed history repeated itself, that the United States were the "modern Romans". Each day, he read the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' looking for clues for his predictions.

Some sources claim Criswell's most famous prediction was on ''[[Jack Paar|The Jack Paar Program]]'' (1962–65) in March 1963, when he predicted [[John F. Kennedy]] would not run for reelection in 1964 because [[John F. Kennedy assassination|something]] was going to happen to him in November 1963.<ref>[http://c-e-n-t-e-r.com/ed_interview.html C-E-N-T-E-R ART PROJECT interview with Criswell biographer Edwin L. Canfield]</ref>

Sources say that Criswell never claimed to be a real psychic; however, those who knew him, such as actress and fellow ''Plan 9'' alumna [[Maila Nurmi]] ("Vampira"), believed he was. According to writer [[Charles A. Coulombe]], whose family rented an apartment from him, Criswell told Coulombe's father "[I] had the gift, but&nbsp;... lost it when I started taking money for it."

==Private life==
Criswell married a former [[speakeasy]] dancer named [[Halo Meadows]], who appeared on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', and whom Coulombe describes as "quite mad": "Mrs Criswell had a huge standard [[poodle]] (named "Buttercup") which she was convinced was the [[reincarnation]] of her cousin Thomas.<ref name="criswellpredicts.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.criswellpredicts.com/criswell.htm |title=Who Was Criswell? |publisher=Criswell Predicts |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> She spent a great deal of time [[Sun tanning|sunbathing]]&nbsp;... which, given her size, was not too pleasing a sight."

[[Mae West]] used Criswell as her personal psychic, he once predicted her rise to [[President of the United States]], whereupon she, Criswell and George Liberace, the brother of showman [[Liberace]], would take a rocket to the moon.<ref name="criswellpredicts.com"/> Criswell and West were great friends and she would lavish him with home-cooked food she had delivered to the studio that he shared with [[Maila Nurmi]] ("Vampira").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/85365/haunted-world-of-ed-wood-jr |title=Watch Haunted World of Ed Wood, Jr. online &#124; Free |publisher=Hulu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> It is said that West sold Criswell her old luxury cars for five dollars.<ref name="criswellpredicts.com"/> He died in 1982.

==Legacy==

In 1955, Mae West, known as ''[[The Fabulous Mae West]]'', wrote and recorded a song called "Criswell Predicts".<ref name="criswellpredicts.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicnotmusic.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/mae-west-sings-about-criswell/ |title=Mae West Sings About Criswell &#124; Music/ Not Music |publisher=Musicnotmusic.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref>

In 1994, Criswell was portrayed in the [[Tim Burton]] biopic, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', by actor [[Jeffrey Jones]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109707/</ref>

In 1997, including Sean Phillip Mabrey,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o3L539Xb5g |title=Plan 9 From Outer Space: The Musical (1/4) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> have played Criswell in ''Plan 9 from Outer Space: The Musical'', written by David G. Smith.

In 1999, the film, ''Devil Girls'', featured a portrayal of Criswell by Rob Gorden.<ref name="imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198417/</ref><ref name="imdb.com"/>

In 2005, Criswell and the ''Plan 9'' cast were lampooned in an episode of the television series, ''[[Deadly Cinema]]'', and clips of this episode were featured in the documentary, ''Vampira: The Movie''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vampirathemovie.com/cast.php |title=Cast of Vampira: The Movie |publisher=Vampirathemovie.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref>

In 2006, Craig Brown played Criswell in ''Plan Live From Outer Space'', a stage adaptation of ''[[Plan 9 From Outer Space]]'' which won a Canadian Comedy Award the following year.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1108860/</ref>

In 2009, a teaser trailer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh-gdpJxJo |title=Plan 9 Teaser Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> was released by Darkstone Entertainment for the upcoming John Johnson film ''Plan 9'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plan9movie.com/ |title=PLAN 9 |publisher=Plan9movie.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> a remake of ''Plan 9 From Outer Space''. The voice of popular television [[horror host]] [[Mr. Lobo]] can be heard narrating the trailer as Criswell. He will also star in the film as Criswell who has a much larger role in this re-imagining of the original [[Ed Wood]] story. In addition, for the purpose of promoting the film on the internet, Mr. Lobo has produced 62 episodes of ''Criswell Predicts!''<ref>{{cite web|author=from Darkstone Entertainment 3 years ago not yet rated |url=http://vimeo.com/11636849 |title=Criswell Predicts! #7 - Community of the Universe on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=from Darkstone Entertainment 3 years ago not yet rated |url=http://vimeo.com/11616048 |title=Criswell Predicts! #6 - Body Modification on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> which is a parody and homage to Criswell’s original television program of the same name ''sans'' the exclamation mark.
