A '''benzodiazepine''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ɛ|n|z|ɵ|d|aɪ|ˈ|æ|z|ɨ|p|iː|n}} (sometimes colloquially "'''benzo'''"; often abbreviated "'''BZD'''") is a [[psychoactive drug]] whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a [[benzene]] ring and a [[diazepine]] ring. The first such drug, [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), was [[Serendipity|discovered accidentally]] by [[Leo Sternbach]] in 1955, and made available in 1960 by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]], which has also marketed the benzodiazepine [[diazepam]] (Valium) since 1963.<ref name=isbn0-19-517668-5/>

Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) at the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]], resulting in [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]] ([[Sleep induction|sleep-inducing]]), [[anxiolytic]] (anti-anxiety), [[anticonvulsant]], and [[muscle relaxant]] properties; also seen in the applied pharmacology of high doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines are [[anterograde amnesia|amnesic]]-[[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] actions.<ref name=ip2002/> These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[seizure]]s, [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[alcohol withdrawal]] and as a [[premedication]] for medical or dental procedures.<ref name=pmid18175099/> Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short-, intermediate- or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.<ref name=sddat/>

In general, benzodiazepines are safe and effective in the short term, although cognitive impairments and [[paradoxical effect]]s such as aggression or behavioral [[disinhibition]] occasionally occur. A minority react reverse and contrary to what expected. For example, a state of panic may worsen considerably following intake of a benzodiazepine.<ref name=pmid18922233/> Long-term use is controversial due to concerns about adverse psychological and physical effects, increased questioning of effectiveness and because benzodiazepines are prone to cause [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], [[physical dependence]], and, upon cessation of use after long term use, a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]].<ref name=pmid18671662/><ref name=pmid19062773/> Due to adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines, in general, leads to improved physical and mental health.<ref name=tdamobd2004 /><ref name=asapdacg /> The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]].<ref name=tdamobd2004/><ref name=ohop/>

There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major [[teratogens]], uncertainty remains as to whether they cause [[cleft palate]] in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure;<ref name=ACOG /> they are known to cause [[Neonatal withdrawal|withdrawal symptoms in the newborn]]. Benzodiazepines can be taken in [[overdose]]s and can cause dangerous [[coma|deep unconsciousness]]. However, they are much less toxic than their predecessors, the [[barbiturate]]s, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken; however, when combined with other [[central nervous system depressants]] such as [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[opiate]]s, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases.<ref name=pmid9780123/> Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other [[Drug abuse|drugs of abuse]].<ref name=Charlson_2009/><ref name=pmid10707430/><ref name=pmid10622686/> In addition, all benzodiazepines are listed in [[Beers Criteria|Beers List]], which is significant in clinical practice. Moreover, in [[geriatric medicine]], if benzodiazepines are necessary, those with short half-lives (e.g. [[lorazepam]] & [[oxazepam]]) are preferred, as they do not require [[Liver#Physiology|hepatic oxidation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Panic disorder===
Due to their effectiveness, tolerability, and rapid onset of anxiolytic action, benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder.<ref name="pmid15762816">{{cite journal |author=Stevens JC, Pollack MH |title=Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=21–27 |year=2005 |pmid=15762816|quote=The frequent use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety is likely a reflection of their effectiveness, rapid onset of anxiolytic effect, and tolerability.}}</ref> However, there is disagreement among expert bodies regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder. The views range from those that hold that benzodiazepines are not effective long-term <ref name=cgftmamoa2004/> and that they should be reserved for treatment-resistant cases<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Borwin Bandelow |author2=Josef Zohar |author3=Eric Hollander |author4=Siegfried Kasper |author5=Hans-Jürgen Möller |author6=WFSBP Task Force on Treatment Guidelines for Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders  |lastauthoramp=1 |title=World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders |publisher=Informa Healthcare |journal=The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=171–99 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12516310 |doi= 10.3109/15622970209150621 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15622970209150621 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> to that they are as effective in the long term as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].<ref name=APA/>

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) guidelines<ref name="APA">{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/pracGuide/loadGuidelinePdf.aspx?file=PanicDisorder_2e_PracticeGuideline |format=PDF |title= APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Panic Disorder, Second Edition |author=Work Group on Panic Disorder |date=January 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 }}</ref> note that, in general, benzodiazepines are well tolerated, and their use for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, [[SSRI]]s, [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and psychotherapy should be based on the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of [[substance abuse]]. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.<ref name=APA/>

Guidelines issued by the UK-based [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), carried out a systematic review using different methodology and came to a different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of [[placebo-controlled studies]], they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and [[physical dependence]] develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including [[rebound anxiety]] occurring after six weeks or more of use.<ref name=cgftmamoa2004>{{cite web |author=McIntosh A, Cohen A, Turnbull N ''et al.'' |title=Clinical guidelines and evidence review for panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg022fullguideline.pdf |publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-06-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Barbui C, Cipriani A |title=Proposal for the inclusion in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines of a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor for Generalised Anxiety Disorder |url=http://who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/17/application/Section24_GAD.pdf |publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}</ref> Nevertheless, benzodiazepines continue to be prescribed for the long-term treatment of [[anxiety disorders]], although specific [[antidepressants]] and psychological therapies are recommended as the [[first-line treatment]] options with the [[anticonvulsant]] drug [[pregabalin]] indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cloos JM, Ferreira V |title=Current use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=90–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19122540 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831a473d }}</ref> NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without [[agoraphobia]] is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines.

Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally; however, very occasionally lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of [[panic attack]]s.<ref name="BNF_2009"/>

===Generalized anxiety disorder===
Benzodiazepines have robust efficacy in the short-term management of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD), but were not shown to be effective in producing long-term improvement overall.<ref name="pmid17881433">{{cite journal |author=Martin JL, Sainz-Pardo M, Furukawa TA, Martín-Sánchez E, Seoane T, Galán C |title=Benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: heterogeneity of outcomes based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials |journal=J.

Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) recommends benzodiazepines [[alprazolam]], [[bromazepam]], [[lorazepam]], and [[diazepam]] only as a second-line choice, if the treatment with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines can be used for a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating [[rumination (psychology)|ruminative worry]], the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.<ref name="pmid16933543">{{cite journal |author=Canadian Psychiatric Association |title=Clinical practice guidelines.

===Insomnia===
[[File:Normison.jpg|thumb|Normison ([[temazepam]]) 10 mg tablets]]

Benzodiazepines can be useful for short-term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness.<ref name=nice-hypnotics>{{cite web |author=|title=Technology Appraisal Guidance 77.

Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, [[rebound insomnia]], and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by [[rebound insomnia]] and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.<ref name="handbook_of_integrative">{{Cite book | last1 = D.

It is not clear as to whether the new [[nonbenzodiazepine]] hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar.<ref name=nice-hypnotics/><ref name="ahrq"/> According to the US [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines.<ref name="ahrq">{{cite web |author=Buscemi N, Vandermeer B, Friesen C, Bialy L, Tubman M, Ospina M, Klassen TP, Witmans M |title=Manifestations and Management of Chronic Insomnia in Adults.

NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.<ref name=nice-hypnotics/>

It has been argued that long-term use of [[hypnotics]] and overprescribing of these drugs represents an unjustifiable risk, especially to the elderly, and is harmful for the [[public health]] in general.<ref name="therbull">{{cite journal |title=What's wrong with prescribing hypnotics? |journal=Drug Ther Bull |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=89–93 |year=2004 |pmid=15587763 |doi=10.1136/dtb.2004.421289 | laysummary = http://www.nelm.nhs.uk/en/NeLM-Area/Evidence/Drug-Class-Focused-Reviews/Whats-wrong-with-prescribing-hypnotics/ }}</ref>

===Seizures===
Prolonged convulsive [[epileptic seizure]]s are a [[medical emergency]] that can usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent [[anticonvulsants]]. In a hospital environment, [[intravenous]] [[clonazepam]], [[lorazepam]], and [[diazepam]] are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, lorazepam due to its faster onset and diazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so [[rectal]] diazepam or (more recently) [[buccal mucosa|buccal]] [[midazolam]] are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.<ref name=SIGN70>{{cite web |url=http://sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign70.pdf |title=Diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults |accessdate=2009-06-05 |author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network |year=2005 |pages=17–9 }}</ref><ref name=NICECG020>{{cite book |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG020fullguideline.pdf |title=Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Review for the Epilepsies: diagnosis and management in adults and children in primary and secondary care |accessdate=2009-06-02 |author=Stokes T, Shaw EJ, Juarez-Garcia A, Camosso-Stefinovic J, Baker R |year=2004 | month = October |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |pages=61, 64–65 | location = London }}</ref>

===Alcohol withdrawal===
[[Chlordiazepoxide]] is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for [[alcohol detoxification]],<ref name="pmid9270461">{{cite journal |author=Ashworth M, Gerada C |title=ABC of mental health.

On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to [[breakthrough seizure]]s, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. [[Oxazepam]] and [[lorazepam]] are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with [[cirrhosis]], because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through [[Glucuronidation|conjugation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kraemer KL, Conigliaro J, Saitz R |title=Managing alcohol withdrawal in the elderly |journal=Drugs Aging |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=409–25 |year=1999 |pmid=10408740 |doi=10.2165/00002512-199914060-00002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Prater CD, Miller KE, Zylstra RG |title=Outpatient detoxification of the addicted or alcoholic patient |journal=[[American Family Physician]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=1175–83 |year=1999 | month = September |pmid=10507746 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990915ap/1175.html }}</ref>

===Anxiety===
Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in the treatment of acute anxiety, as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals;<ref name=cgftmamoa2004/> however, they are not recommended beyond 2–4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long-term effectiveness. As for insomnia, they may also be used on an irregular/"as-needed" basis, such as in cases where said anxiety is at its worst. Compared to other pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines are twice as likely to lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation. Psychological therapies and other pharmacological therapies are recommended for the long-term treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. Antidepressants have higher remission rates and are, in general, safe and effective in the short and long term.<ref name=cgftmamoa2004/>

===Other indications===
Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a wide range of conditions:
* They can be very useful in intensive care to sedate patients receiving [[mechanical ventilation]] or those in extreme distress.

===Cognitive effects===
The short-term use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple areas of cognition, the most notable one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete anterograde amnesia.<ref name="isbn0-683-30128-4"/> However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view is that many of the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after quitting benzodiazepines. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.

While the definitive studies are lacking, the former view received support from a 2004 meta-analysis of 13 small studies.<ref name="pmid14731058">{{cite journal |author=Barker MJ, Greenwood KM, Jackson M, Crowe SF |title=Cognitive effects of long-term benzodiazepine use: a meta-analysis |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=2004 |pmid=14731058 |doi=10.2165/00023210-200418010-00004}}</ref><ref name="pmid15762814">{{cite journal |author= Stewart SA |title= The effects of benzodiazepines on cognition |journal= J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue= Suppl 2 |pages=9–13 |year=2005 |pmid=15762814 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0202.pdf }}</ref> This meta-analysis found that long-term use of benzodiazepines was associated with moderate to large adverse effects on all areas of cognition, with [[visuospatial]] memory being the most commonly detected impairment.

The authors of the meta-analysis<ref name="pmid14731058"/> and a later reviewer<ref name="pmid15762814"/> noted that the applicability of this meta-analysis is limited because the subjects were taken mostly from withdrawal clinics; the coexisting drug, alcohol use, and psychiatric disorders were not defined; and several of the included studies conducted the cognitive measurements during the withdrawal period.

===Long-term effects===
The [[long-term effects of benzodiazepine]] use can include [[cognitive impairment]] as well as affective and behavioural problems. Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur.

{{Main|Benzodiazepine dependence|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|post-acute withdrawal syndrome}}

====Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal====
The main problem of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence|dependence]]. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use.<ref name=tdamobd2004 /> In general, tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur.<ref name="pmid10779253" /> However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy<ref name="pmid16528135">{{cite journal |author=Nardi AE, Perna G |title=Clonazepam in the treatment of psychiatric disorders: an update |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=131–42 |year=2006 |month=May |pmid=16528135 |doi=10.1097/01.yic.0000194379.65460.a6 }}</ref> and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs<ref name=Perugi /><ref name=cgftmamoa2004 /> and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use.<ref name=tdamobd2004 /> The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear.<ref name="pmid15762818">{{cite journal |author=Otto MW, Bruce SE, Deckersbach T |title=Benzodiazepine use, cognitive impairment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: issues in the treatment of a patient in need |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=34–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15762818 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0206.pdf }}</ref> Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and "the memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose".<ref name="pmid15078112">{{cite journal |author=Chouinard G |title=Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=7–12 |year=2004 |pmid=15078112 |url=http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v65s05/v65s0502.pdf }}</ref>

Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt reduction of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms — [[Rebound effect|rebound]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]]. Rebound symptoms are the return of the symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of [[physical dependence]].<ref name="pmid15078112"/>

The most frequent symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, [[tremor]]s, agitation, fearfulness, and [[Spasm|muscle spasms]].<ref name="pmid15078112"/> The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], hypersensitivity to stimuli, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidal]] behavior, [[psychosis]], [[seizures]], and [[delirium tremens]].<ref name="isbn0-19-856667-0">{{cite book |author=Harrison PC, Gelder MG, Cowen P |title=Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry |edition=5th |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |pages=461–2 |chapter=The misuse of alcohol and drugs |isbn=0-19-856667-0 }}</ref> Severe symptoms usually occur as a result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal.

Benzodiazepines have a reputation with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large part due to the withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested,<ref name=pmid19062773 /> but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, [[environmental stresses]], and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.<ref name=tdamobd2004 /><ref name="BNF_2009"/>{{rp|183–184|date=November 2012}}

[[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s are contraindicated during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they are [[cross tolerant]] with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence.<ref name=tdamobd2004 /> Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another.

==Pharmacology==
Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure, and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the [[allosteric]] modification of a specific kind of [[neurotransmitter receptor]], the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]], which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines.<ref name="isbn0-12-088397-X"/> Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.<ref name="pmid9504140"/><ref name="pmid16780077"/>

Benzodiazepine drugs are substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines, although the chemical term can refer to many other compounds that do not have useful pharmacological properties. Different benzodiazepine drugs have different side groups attached to this central structure. The different side groups affect the binding of the molecule to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and so modulate the pharmacological properties.<ref name="isbn0-12-088397-X"/> Many of the pharmacologically active "classical" benzodiazepine drugs contain the 5-phenyl-1''H''-benzo[''e''][1,4]diazepin-2(3''H'')-one substructure (see figure to the right).<ref name=CAS>[[CAS registry number]]:{{CAS|2898-08-0|1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one}}; other names: Ro 05-2921, dechlorodemethyldiazepam.</ref>

[[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s also bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties. While the nonbenzodiazepines are by definition structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, both classes of drugs possess a common [[pharmacophore]] (see figure to the lower-right), which explains their binding to a common receptor site.<ref name="isbn0-471-21384-5">{{cite book |author=Madsen U, Bräuner-Osborne H, Greenwood JR, Johansen TN, Krogsgaard-Larsen P, Liljefors T, Nielsen M, Frølund B |editor=Gad SC |title=Drug Discovery Handbook |publisher=Wiley-Interscience/J.

Benzodiazepines work by increasing the efficiency of a natural brain chemical, [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], to decrease the excitability of [[neuron]]s. This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect on many of the functions of the brain.

GABA controls the excitability of neurons by binding to the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]].<ref name="isbn0-12-088397-X">{{cite book |author=Olsen RW, Betz H |editor=Siegel GJ, Albers RW, Brady S, Price DD (eds.) |title=Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=291–302 |chapter=GABA and glycine |isbn=0-12-088397-X }}</ref> The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is a [[multiprotein complex|protein complex]] located in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]] of neurons. All GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors contain an [[ion channel]] that conducts [[chloride]] ions across neuronal [[cell membrane]]s and two binding sites for the [[neurotransmitter]] gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while a subset of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, which in turn increases the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's [[membrane potential]]. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and [[action potential|firing]] is less likely.
Different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and, therefore, control distinct [[biological neural network|neuronal circuits]]. Hence, activation of different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions.<ref name="pmid16376150">{{cite journal |author=Rudolph U, Möhler H |title=GABA-based therapeutic approaches: GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtype functions |journal=Current Opinion in Pharmacology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |year=2006 |pmid=16376150 |doi=10.1016/j.coph.2005.10.003 }}</ref> In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as anxiolytic or hypnotic.

The subset of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that also bind benzodiazepines are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors (BzR). The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor is a [[heteromer]] composed of five subunits, the most common ones being two ''α''s, two ''β''s, and one ''γ'' (α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>γ). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α<sub>1-6</sub>, β<sub>1-3</sub>, and γ<sub>1-3</sub>). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors that are made up of different combinations of subunit subtypes have different properties, different distributions in the brain and different activities relative to pharmacological and clinical effects.<ref name="pmid8783370">{{cite journal |author=Johnston GA |title=GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor pharmacology |journal=Pharmacol Ther |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=173–98 |year=1996 |pmid=8783370 |doi=10.1016/0163-7258(95)02043-8 }}</ref> Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the α and γ subunits on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. Binding also requires that alpha subunits contain a [[histidine]] amino acid residue, (''i.e.'', [[GABRA1|α<sub>1</sub>]], [[GABRA2|α<sub>2</sub>]], [[GABRA3|α<sub>3</sub>]], and [[GABRA5|α<sub>5</sub>]] containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors). For this reason, benzodiazepines show no affinity for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing [[GABRA4|α<sub>4</sub>]] and [[GABRA6|α<sub>6</sub>]] subunits with an [[arginine]] instead of a histidine residue.<ref name="pmid15157182">{{cite journal |author=Wafford KA, Macaulay AJ, Fradley R, O'Meara GF, Reynolds DS, Rosahl TW |title=Differentiating the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor subtypes |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=32 |issue=Pt3 |pages=553–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15157182 |doi=10.1042/BST0320553 }}</ref>

Once bound to the benzodiazepine receptor, the benzodiazepine [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] locks the benzodiazepine receptor into a conformation in which it has a greater affinity for the [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] [[neurotransmitter]]. This increases the frequency of the opening of the associated chloride [[ion channel]] and [[hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizes]] the membrane of the associated neuron. The inhibitory effect of the available GABA is potentiated, leading to sedatory and anxiolytic effects. Furthermore, different benzodiazepines can have different affinities for BzRs made up of different collection of subunits. For instance, those with high activity at the α<sub>1</sub> are associated with stronger [[hypnotic]] effects, whereas those with higher affinity for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing α<sub>2</sub> and/or α<sub>3</sub> subunits have good anti-anxiety activity.<ref name="pmid9824848">{{cite journal |author=Hevers W, Lüddens H |title=The diversity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.

A benzodiazepine can be placed into one of three groups by its [[elimination half-life]], or time it takes for the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting [[active metabolites]], such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into [[desmethyldiazepam]]. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are [[partial agonists]].<ref name=sddat>{{cite book |author=Dikeos DG, Theleritis CG, Soldatos CR |chapter=Benzodiazepines: effects on sleep |pages=220–2 |title=Sleep Disorders: Diagnosis and Therapeutics |editor=Pandi-Perumal SR, Verster JC, Monti JM, Lader M, Langer SZ (eds.) |publisher=Informa Healthcare |year=2008 |isbn=0-415-43818-7 }}</ref><ref name="manual" />
* Short-acting compounds have a median half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, [[rebound insomnia]] may occur upon discontinuation, and they might cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day [[rebound anxiety]] with prolonged usage. Examples are [[brotizolam]], [[midazolam]], and [[triazolam]].
* Intermediate-acting compounds have a median half-life of 12–40 hours. They may have some residual effects in the first half of the day if used as a [[hypnotic]]. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are [[alprazolam]], [[estazolam]], [[flunitrazepam]], [[clonazepam]], [[lormetazepam]], [[lorazepam]], [[nitrazepam]], and [[temazepam]].
* Long-acting compounds have a half-life of 40–250 hours. They have a risk of accumulation in the elderly and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, but they have a reduced severity of [[rebound effects]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. Examples are [[diazepam]], [[clorazepate]], [[chlordiazepoxide]], and [[flurazepam]].

==Interactions==
Individual benzodiazepines may have different [[drug interaction|interactions]] with certain drugs. Depending on their [[metabolism]] pathway, benzodiazepines can be roughly divided into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through [[glucuronidation]], such as [[lorazepam]], [[oxazepam]], and [[temazepam]], and, in general, have few drug interactions.<ref name="isbn0-444-50998-4">{{cite book |editor=Meyler L, Aronson JK |title=Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs: the International Encyclopedia of Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions |edition=15th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=429–43 |isbn=0-444-50998-4 }}</ref>

Many drugs, including [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], some [[antibiotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, and [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They reduce the rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], the antibiotic [[rifampicin]], and the [[anticonvulsants]] [[carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]], accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action.<ref name="isbn1-58829-211-8"/><ref name="biadmtad">{{cite journal |author=Norman TR, Ellen SR, Burrows GD |title=Benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders: managing therapeutics and dependence |journal=Med J Aust |volume=167 |issue=9 |pages=490–5 |year=1997 |pmid=9397065 |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/mentalhealth/course/06norman.pdf }}</ref> Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, [[opioid]]s and other [[depressant|central nervous system depressants]] potentiates their action.

It was marketed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] from 1960 branded as ''Librium''.]]

The first benzodiazepine, [[chlordiazepoxide]] (''Librium''), was synthesized in 1955 by [[Leo Sternbach]] while working at [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] on the development of tranquilizers. The pharmacological properties of the compounds prepared initially were disappointing, and Sternbach abandoned the project. Two years later, in April 1957, co-worker Earl Reeder noticed a "nicely crystalline" compound left over from the discontinued project while spring-cleaning in the lab. This compound, later named chlordiazepoxide, had not been tested in 1955 because of Sternbach's focus on other issues. Expecting the pharmacology results to be negative and hoping to publish the chemistry-related findings, researchers submitted it for a standard battery of animal tests. However, the compound showed very strong [[sedative]], [[anticonvulsant]], and [[muscle relaxant]] effects. These impressive clinical findings led to its speedy introduction throughout the world in 1960 under the brand name ''Librium''.<ref name="pmid34039">{{cite journal |author=Sternbach LH |title=The benzodiazepine story |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=1979 |pmid=34039 |doi=10.1021/jm00187a001 |quote=During this cleanup operation, my co-worker, Earl Reeder, drew my attention to a few hundred milligrams of two products, a nicely crystalline base and its hydrochloride.

The new group of drugs was initially greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest-ever [[class-action lawsuit]] against [[drugs manufacturers|drug manufacturers]] in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 [[law firms]] that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of [[benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King MB |title=Is there still a role for benzodiazepines in general practice? |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=42 |issue=358 |pages=202–5 |year=1992 |pmid=1389432 |pmc=1372025 }}</ref> The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; [[legal aid]] had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest.

In 2010, formerly classified documents from a [[Medical Research Council (UK)]] meeting of experts emerged and revealed that the MRC was aware of research 30 years ago that suggested that benzodiazepines could cause brain damage in some people similar to that which occurs from alcohol abuse and failed to follow-up with larger clinical trials. The MRC turned down research proposals in the 1980s by Professor Lader and also proposals by Professor Ashton in 1995 to study whether benzodiazepines had permanent effects on the brain. The MRC responded that it has always been open to research proposals in this area that meet required standards. It was further alleged that the MRC documents were relevant to a large class-action lawsuit, which started in the mid-1980s against drug companies and one solicitor stated that it was strange that the MRC had 'hidden' the documents. [[Jim Dobbin]], MP and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, described the documents as a "huge scandal," given the large number of people who experience symptoms such as physical, cognitive, and psychological problems as a result of benzodiazepine use, which can persist even after withdrawing.<ref name=dltbd30ya>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html |title=Drugs linked to brain damage 30 years ago |author=Nina Lakhani |date=7 November 2010 |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |location=United Kingdom }}</ref>

Overall, [[anecdotal evidence]] suggests that [[temazepam]] may be the most psychologically [[Substance dependence|habit-forming (addictive)]] benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions in some parts of the world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzab.htm |title=Benzodiazepine abuse |publisher=Benzo.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.<ref name="pmid1786493">{{cite journal |author=Farré M, Camí J. |title=Pharmacokinetic considerations in abuse liability evaluation |journal=Br J Addict. |volume=86 |issue=12 |pages=1601–6 |year=1991 |month=December|pmid=1786493 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1991.tb01754.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Busto U, Sellers EM. |title=Pharmacokinetic determinants of drug abuse and dependence.

==Veterinary use==
Benzodiazepines are used in [[veterinary]] practice in the treatment of various disorders and conditions. As in humans, they are used in the first-line management of [[seizures]], [[status epilepticus]], and [[tetanus]], and as maintenance therapy in epilepsy (in particular, in cats).<ref name = MVM>{{cite book |editor=Kahn CM, Line S, Aiello SE |title=[[Merck Veterinary Manual|The Merck Veterinary Manual]]|year=2005 |publisher=Wiley |edition=9th |isbn=978-0-911910-50-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Frey HH |title=Anticonvulsant drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy |journal=Probl Vet Med |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=558–77 |year=1989 |pmid=2520134 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Podell M |journal=Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract |title=Seizures in dogs |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=779–809 |year=1996 |pmid=8813750 }}</ref> They are widely used in small and large animals (including horses, swine, cattle and exotic and wild animals) for their anxiolytic and sedative effects, as pre-medication before surgery, for induction of [[anesthesia]] and as adjuncts to anesthesia.<ref name = MVM/><ref name=Adams>{{cite book |author=Gross ME |chapter=Tranquilizers, α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonists, and related agents |editor=Adams RH (ed.) |title=Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |edition=8th |publisher=Iowa State University Press |year=2001 |pages=325–33 |isbn=0-8138-1743-9 }}</ref>
