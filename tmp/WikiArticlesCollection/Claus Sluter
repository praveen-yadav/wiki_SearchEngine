'''Claus Sluter''' (born 1340s in [[Haarlem]];<ref>[http://www.rkd.nl/rkddb/dispatcher.aspx?action=search&database=ChoiceArtists&search=priref=203655] Netherlands Institute for Art History</ref> died in 1405 or 1406, [[Dijon]]) was a sculptor of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] origin.<ref>{{cite book | author = Murray, P. & L. | year = 1997 | title = Penguin dictionary of art and artists | edition = 7th edition | pages = 492 | location = London | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn = 0-14-051300-0 }}</ref> He was the most important northern European sculptor of his age and is considered a pioneer of the "northern realism" of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] that came into full flower with the work of [[Jan van Eyck]] and others in the next generation.

Sluter probably worked in [[Brussels]] before moving to the Burgundian capital of [[Dijon]], where from 1385 to 1389 he was the assistant of [[Jean de Marville]], Court Sculptor to [[Philip the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. From 1389 to his death he was Court Sculptor himself, with the rank of ''[[valet de chambre]]''. He was succeeded by his nephew [[Claus de Werve]].

He restored the monumental scale and naturalism of the classical era to figural sculpture.  His later work is highly emotional, using facial expressions, figural stance, and drapery; this can be particularly seen in the heavy folds of cloth that so many later imitators draped around their figures. His most famous surviving work is the ''[[Well of Moses]]'' (1395â€“1403), created for the [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]] of [[Champmol]] built by Philip the Bold just outside Dijon (at the time - now part of the city). It still stands at the original site, within the grounds of what is now the Psychiatric Hospital and is open to the public. A few steps away from [[Well of Moses|The Well of Moses]] one finds the portal of the former chapel of [http://www.pauldoolan.com/2012/07/well-of-moses.html Champmol]. This includes five figures sculpted by Sluter. Sluter was also responsible for the main part of the work on [[Champmol#Tombs of the Dukes|Philip's tomb]], which (restored and partly reconstructed) has been moved to the Museum of Fine Arts which is housed in the former ducal palace in Dijon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Claus Sluter and Claus de Werve, Mourners, from the Tomb of Philip the Bold|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/claus-sluter-and-claus-de-werve-mourners-from-the-tomb-of-philip-the-bold.html|work=[[Smarthistory]]|publisher=[[Khan Academy]]|accessdate=13 January 2013|author=Beth Harris|coauthors=Steven Zucker}}</ref>

Sluter was one of the sculptors of the famous [[mourners of Dijon]], which occupy niches below the tombs of Philip the Bold, his wife Margaret, and John the Fearless.
