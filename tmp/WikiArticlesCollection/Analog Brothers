'''Analog Brothers''' is an experimental hip-hop crew featuring Ice Oscillator also known as [[Ice-T]] (keyboards, drums, vocals), Keith Korg also known as [[Kool Keith]] (bass, strings, vocals), Mark Moog also known as Marc Live (drums, ''violyns'' and vocals), Silver Synth also known as Black Silver (synthesizer, lazar bell and vocals), and Rex Roland also known as Pimp Rex (keyboards, vocals, production). Its album ''Pimp to Eat'' featured guest appearances by various members of [[Rhyme Syndicate]], [[Odd Oberheim]], [[Jacky jasper]] (who appears as Jacky Jasper on the song "We Sleep Days" and H-Bomb on "War"), D.J. Cisco from S.M., the [[Synth-a-Size Sisters]] and Teflon.

While the group only recorded one album together as the Analog Brothers, a few bootlegs of its live concert performances, including freestyles with original lyrics, have occasionally surfaced online. After ''Pimp to Eat'', the Analog Brothers continued performing together in various line ups. [[Kool Keith]] and Marc Live joined with [[Jacky jasper]] to release two albums as KHM. Marc Live rapped with Ice T's group SMG. Marc also formed a group with Black Silver called Live Black, but while five of their tracks were released on a demo CD sold at concerts, Live Black's first album has yet to be released.

In 2008, [[Ice-T]] and Black Silver toured together as Black Ice, and released an album together called [[Urban Legends (Black Ice)|Urban Legends]].

In addition to all this, the Analog Brothers continue to make frequent appearances on each other's solo albums.
