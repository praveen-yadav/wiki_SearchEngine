'''Aeclanum''' (also spelled '''Aeculanum''', {{lang-it|Eclano}}) was an ancient town of [[Samnium]], southern [[Italy]], c. 25&nbsp;km east-southeast of [[Beneventum]], on the [[Via Appia]] (near the modern [[Mirabella Eclano]]).

It became the chief town of the [[Hirpini]] after [[Benevento|Beneventum]] had become a [[Rome|Roman]] [[colony]].

[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] captured it in 89 BC by setting on fire the wooden breastwork by which it was defended, and new fortifications were erected.

[[Hadrian]], who repaired the Via Appia from Beneventum to this point, made it a colony; it has ruins of the city walls, of an [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], baths and an [[amphitheatre]]; nearly 400 inscriptions have also been discovered.

Two different routes to [[Apulia]] diverged at this point, one (Via Aurelia Aeclanensis) leading through the modern [[Ariano]] to [[Herdoniae]], the other (the Via Appia of the Empire) passing the [[Ampsanctus|Lacus Ampsanctus]] and going on to [[Aquilonia]] and [[Venusia]]; while the road from Aeclanum to [[Abellinum]] (mod.  [[Avellino]]) may also follow an ancient line.

In der Spätantike war die Stadt Bischofssitz; bekanntester Bischof war im 5. Jahrhundert der Pelagianer Julian von Aeclanum (auf das Bistum geht das Titularbistum Aeclanum der römisch-katholischen Kirche zurück).

In late antiquity the city was an episcopal see. The most well known of the [[bishop]]s of Aeclanum was [[Julian of Eclanum]]  during the 5th century. With the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasion of Italy it was annexed to the [[Duchy of Benevento]], until it was finally destroyed by the Byzantines of [[Constans II]] in 663, reducing to a small hamlet known as '''Quintodecimo''' (referring to its distance of 15 miles from Benevento). However, until today Aeclanum is a [[titular diocese]] of the [[Catholic Church]]
