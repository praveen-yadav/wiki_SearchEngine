'''Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈaːjɑks}}), also referred to as '''AFC Ajax''', '''Ajax Amsterdam''' or simply '''Ajax''' (after the [[Ajax (mythology)|legendary Greek hero]]), is a Dutch professional [[Association football|football]] [[Football team|club]] based in [[Amsterdam]]. Historically, Ajax is the most successful club in the [[Netherlands]], with 32 [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie titles]] and 18 [[KNVB Cup]]s. Along with [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[Feyenoord]], it is one of the country's "big three" clubs  who have dominated Dutch football, as well as being the only three clubs that have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]] from the top division.

Ajax is historically one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]], Ajax were the seventh most successful European club of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news | title = Europe's Club of the Century | publisher = International Federation of Football History & Statistics | date = 11 September 2009 | url = http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d | accessdate = 2009-09-12}}</ref> The club is one of the five teams that has [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|earned the right]] to keep the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971–1973.

== History ==
{{main|History of AFC Ajax}}
Ajax was founded in Amsterdam on 18 March 1900. With five national championships (1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, 1939), Ajax was the most successful Dutch team of the nineteen thirties. In 1955, professional football was finally permitted in the Netherlands. Ajax achieved their first [[Eredivisie]] championship in 1957 and again in 1960.

[[File:Cruijff afscheidswedstrijd bij Ajax.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johan Cruijff]] played at Ajax between 1959–73 and 1981–83, winning 3 European Cups; his No. 14 is the only squad number Ajax has ever retired. Cruyff came back to manage the club from 1985–88.]]

Ajax won the championship in 1966 and 1967, scoring a record breaking 122 goals including 33 from [[Johan Cruyff|Johan Cruijff]], and again in 1968, and reached the European Cup final of 1969 against [[A.C. Milan]]. In 1969–70 Ajax won the Dutch league championship, winning 27 out of 34 games and scoring 100 goals.

The 1971 European Cup final saw Ajax beat [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] 2–0 with goals from [[Dick van Dijk]] and [[Arie Haan]]. Ajax completed the treble of European Cup, Dutch National Championship and the KNVB Cup in 1972 before adding the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]. In 1973, Ajax won a third consecutive European Cup and another Dutch championship.

The departure of [[Johan Cruijff]] for [[FC Barcelona]] in 1973 signalled the end of this period of success. In 1977, Ajax won their first domestic championship since 1973. Johan Cruijff returned to the club in 1981, with the club producing some talented youngsters in the mid-1980s such as [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]].

Cruijff returned in 1985 as the new manager and Ajax ended the season with 120 goals, of which 37 were from [[Marco van Basten|van Basten]]. Ajax won the [[1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup|'87 Cup Winners' Cup]] and reached the final again the following season. Cruijff departed prior to the second [[Cup Winners' Cup]] final and with most of the 80's stars such as van Basten also leaving, Ajax once again declined.

Managed by [[Louis van Gaal]], Ajax won the 1992 [[UEFA Cup]]. [[Dennis Bergkamp]] scored six goals in the competition and was the top goalscorer in Dutch football in 1991 and 1992.

Ajax won the [[1994–95 UEFA Champions League]] and the league title. The season saw an unbeaten run in the national league and the final season for Frank Rijkaard, while striker [[Patrick Kluivert]] came off the bench to score a late winner to beat [[A.C. Milan]] in the final of the Champions League. Ajax went on to beat Brazilian side [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] on penalties to win the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]. The following season, Ajax lost to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on penalties in the European Cup final.

However, the subsequent period saw the departure of manager van Gaal along with an exodus of many key players including [[Clarence Seedorf]] in 1995; [[Edgar Davids]], [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Finidi George]], and [[Nwankwo Kanu]] in 1996; [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Marc Overmars]], and [[Winston Bogarde]] in 1997; [[Ronald de Boer]] and [[Frank de Boer]] in 1998; and [[Edwin van der Sar]] and [[Jari Litmanen]] in 1999.

==Youth program==
{{main|Ajax Youth Academy|Ajax Hellas Youth Academy}}
The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth program that has produced many Dutch talents over the years – [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], national team top scorer [[Patrick Kluivert]], and former national team coach [[Marco van Basten]]. Dutch national first-team players [[Rafael van der Vaart]], [[Ryan Babel]], [[Wesley Sneijder]], [[Maarten Stekelenburg]], [[Eljero Elia]], [[André Ooijer]], [[John Heitinga]] and [[Nigel de Jong]] had also came through the ranks at Ajax and all are now playing for top-flight clubs. Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent.<ref>{{cite news|title= Ajax wants a foothold in the U.S.|publisher= ESPN|date=|url= http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6609795/soccer-ajax-method-catch-us|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> First team regulars [[Siem de Jong]], [[Urby Emanuelson]] and [[Gregory van der Wiel]] are former youth internationals who made the successful step up to the senior side.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hamilton |first=Chloe |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/lessons-of-the-dutch-school-1578912.html |title=Lessons of the Dutch school – Sport |publisher=The Independent |date=22 October 1995 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=627320.html |title=Grooming talent the Ajax way |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= How a Soccer Star Is Made|work=The New York Times|date=|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Soccer-t.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>

Due to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio [[Jan Vertonghen]], [[Toby Alderweireld]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]] along with winger [[Tom de Mul]], all of whom are full internationals as well as Dutch international [[Vurnon Anita]] as well as [[Javier Martina]] from [[Curaçao]].

Ajax has also expanded its talent searching program to South Africa with [[Ajax Cape Town FC|Ajax Cape Town]]. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of [[Rob Moore (South African Entrepreneur)|Rob Moore]]. Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name [[Ajax Orlando Prospects|Ajax America]], until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African internationals [[Steven Pienaar]], [[Thulani Serero]] and Cameroonian international [[Eyong Enoh]].

In 1995, the year Ajax won the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with [[Edwin van der Sar]] in goal; players such as [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Frank de Boer]], and [[Danny Blind]] in defense; [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], and [[Clarence Seedorf]] in midfield; and [[Patrick Kluivert]] and [[Marc Overmars]] in attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/grassroots/features/video/videoid=1562470.html |title=Inside the Ajax academy on |publisher=Uefa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref>

[[Image:Amsterdam Arena Aerial.jpg|thumb|Exterior of Stadium]]
In 2011 AFC Ajax opened its first youth academies outside of the Netherlands, when the club partnered up with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy in Greece to open the [[Ajax Hellas Youth Academy]]. The offices are based in [[Nea Smyrni]], [[Attica (region)|Attica]], with the main training facility located on the island of [[Corfu]], hosting a total of 15 football youth academies throughout Greece and [[Cyprus]]. Eddie van Schaik heads the organization as coach and consultant, introducing the Ajax football philosophy at the various Greek football training camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajaxhellas.gr/youth_academy/en/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&layout=item&id=1&Itemid=2 |title=The Academy |publisher=AjaxHellas.gr|date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.care24.gr/diatrofologos-ajax-hellas/ |title=Η νέα Κλινική Διαιτολόγος – Διατροφολόγος του Ajax Hellas |publisher=Care24.gr|date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}</ref>

==Stadium==
{{Main|Het Houten Stadion|De Meer Stadion|Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam ArenA}}
Ajax' first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was called "[[Het Houten Stadion]]" (''The Wooden Stadium''). Ajax later played in the stadium built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam Olympics]]. This stadium, designed by [[Jan Wils]], is known as the [[Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)|Olympic Stadium]]. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member Daan Roodenburgh. The stadium could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.

In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the [[Amsterdam ArenA]] This was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 52,000 people. The average attendance in 2006/07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The ArenA has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the ArenA has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–2009 season groundstaff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.

The much-loved De Meer stadium was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters AJAX, nowadays in place on the façade of the youth training grounds [[Sportpark De Toekomst|De Toekomst]], near the Amsterdam Arena.

===Crest===
In 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the clubs promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the clubs new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the [[Greeks|Greek]] hero [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]]. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html |title=History of the Ajax logo |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date=20 September 1928 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>

===Colors===
Ajax originally played in an all-black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the flag of [[Flag of Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]. However, when, under manager [[Jack Kirwan]], the club got promoted to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the [[Eredivisie]]), Ajax were forced to change their colours because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.

===Kits===

Ajax's shirts have been [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by [[TDK]] from 1982 to 1991, and by [[ABN AMRO]] from 1991 to 2008. [[AEGON]] has replaced ABN AMRO as the new head sponsor for a period of at least seven years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=64367 | title=AEGON new head sponsor AFC Ajax | work=Ajax.nl | accessdate=2007-10-17 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071019015912/http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=64367| archivedate= 19 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> On 1 April 2007, Ajax wore a different sponsor for the match against [[Heracles Almelo]]: ''Florius''.

===AFC Ajax N.V.===
{{Main|AFC Ajax N.V.}}
AFC Ajax are the only Dutch club with an [[Initial public offering]] (IPO). The club is registered as a [[Naamloze vennootschap]] (N.V.) listed on the stock exchange [[Euronext]] Amsterdam, since 17 May 1998. With a launch price of ƒ25,- (Guilders) the club managed to a bring their total revenue up to € 54 million euros (converted) in their first year on the market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/ajax/article1882997.ece |title=God van de handel liet Ajax in de steek |publisher=NRC.nl|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref> After short lived success however the rate dropped, at one point as low as € 3,50. Criticism was brought forth that the legal grid for a naamloze vennootschap would not be suitable for a Football club, and that the sports related ambitions would suffer from the new commercial interests of the now listed Ajax. Shares of the company in the year 2008 were valued at approximately € 5,90 per share.<ref>{{en icon}} [http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AJAX.AS#chart2:symbol=ajax.as;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined AFC Ajax chart], Yahoo.com</ref>

In 2008 a Commission under guidance of honorary member Uri Coronel concluded, that the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] was of no value to the club, and that measures should be taken to exit the stock exchange by purchasing back all public shares.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110823131227/http://www.depers.nl/sport/218320/Ajax-beslist-snel-over-beursnotering.html Ajax beslist nog dit jaar over beursnotering], De Pers, 1 juli 2008</ref> How possible it would be for Ajax to achieve, and the likelihood of this ever happening has been in doubt by the public as Ajax remain on the stock exchange, where its chief competitors are [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.AFC_Ajax_NV.46101384cd08980e.html |title=AFC Ajax NV Company Information |publisher=Hoovers|date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>

==Other teams==

===Reserves team===
{{Main|Jong Ajax}}
[[Jong Ajax]] (''formerly more commonly known as Ajax 2'') is the reserve team of AFC Ajax. The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/10788/Eredivisie/article/detail/3334299/2012/10/19/De-Boer-laat-herstelde-Sulejmani-bij-Jong-Ajax.dhtml |title=De Boer laat 'herstelde' Sulejmani bij Jong Ajax |publisher=Volkskrant|date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>

Since 1992 Jong Ajax have competed in the [[Beloften Eredivisie]], competing against other reserve teams such as [[Jong PSV]], [[FC Groningen|Jong FC Groningen]] or [[AZ (football club)|Jong AZ]]. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the [[KNVB Reserve Cup]] three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the [[Beloften Eredivisie]] title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual [[KNVB Cup]], even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager [[Jan Olde Riekerink]] in 2001-02, when a semi-final loss to [[FC Utrecht]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|Penalty shoot-out]] after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax vs. Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=575358&sec=europe&root=europe&cc=5739 |title=Dutch KNVB Cup - ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>

Their home matches are played at [[Sportpark De Toekomst]], except for the occasional match in the [[Amsterdam Arena]]. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the course of the season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/sport/3492234/jong-psv-vervangt-katwijk-in-eerste-divisie.html |title=Jong PSV vervangt Katwijk in eerste divisie |publisher=NU.nl |accessdate=2013-07-04}}</ref> Furthermore the team is not eligible for promotion to the [[Eredivisie]] or to participate in the [[KNVB Cup]].

==Rivalries==
''As one of the traditional [[Big Three (Netherlands)|big three clubs]] in the [[Netherlands]], Ajax have amassed a number of intense rivalries over the years. Listed below are the most significant of the rivalries involving Ajax Amsterdam.''

===Rivalry with Feyenoord===
{{Main|De Klassieker}}
[[Feyenoord]] from [[Rotterdam]] are Ajax's arch rivals. Every year both clubs play the "[[De Klassieker]]" ("The Classic"), a match between the teams from the two largest cities of the Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/dossier/alles-over-de-klassieker-ajax-dompelt-feyenoord-in-rouw.htm |title=Alles over De Klassieker: Ajax dompelt Feyenoord in rouw |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>  During the seventies, Ajax and Feyenoord were the only two clubs in the Netherlands who were able to clinch national titles, as well as achieve continental and even global success.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elenganche.es/2013/08/de-klassieker-ajax-feyenoord-y-el-orgullo-%E2%80%98oranje%E2%80%99.html |title=De Klassieker: Ajax-Feyenoord y el orgullo ‘oranje’ |publisher=El Enganche|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>  A meeting between the two clubs became the measure for who was truly the best club in the Netherlands. The Klassieker is the most famous of all the rivalries in the Netherlands and the matches are always sold out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpdetijd.nl/2013-08-19/ajax-feyenoord-klassiekste-niet-klassieker-in-lange-reeks-klassiekers/ |title=Ajax – Feyenoord ‘klassiekste niet-Klassieker in lange reeks Klassiekers’ |publisher=HP.nl|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>  The fixture is seen in the public eye as "''The graceful and elegant football of Ajax, against the indomitable fighting spirit of Feyenoord''". The confidence of the Capital versus the Blue collar mentality of [[Rotterdam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/sport/772781-1308/feyenoord-en-ajax-is-haat |title='Feyenoord en Ajax is haat' |publisher=BNR.nl|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> Matches are known for their tension and violence, both on and off the pitch. Over the years several violent incidents have taken place involving rival supporters, leading to the current prohibition of away-supporters in both stadiums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/7135955/Feyenoords-latest-clash-with-Ajax-peaceful-thanks-to-absent-friends.html |title=Feyenoord's latest clash with Ajax peaceful thanks to absent 'friends' |publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> The lowest point was reached on 23 March 1997, when supporters of both clubs meet on a field near [[Beverwijk]], where Ajax-supporter Carlo Picornie was fatally injured, the incident is commonly referred to as the "Battle of Beverwijk".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/2118764/2008/03/20/Stervend-in-de-modder.dhtml |title=Stervend in de modder |publisher=AD.nl|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

===Rivalry with PSV===
[[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] are also a rival of Ajax, but in terms of tension and rivalry, these matches are not as loaded as the duels with Feyenoord. The rivalry has existed for some time with PSV and stems from various causes, such as the different interpretations of whether current national and international successes of both clubs correlates and the supposed opposition between the [[Randstad]] and the province. The matches between these two teams is commonly referred to as "De Topper" ("The Topper"), and involves the two most trophy-laden sides in Dutch football and is essentially a clash of two competing schools of thought in Dutch football. Historically PSV compete with a workmanlike ethic, preferring a more robust 4-3-1-2 or 4-2-3-1, typically shunning the seductive 4-3-3 approach favoured in Amsterdam. While [[Rinus Michels]] and [[Johan Cruijff]] helped to innovate [[Total Football]] in the sixties and seventies, a different philosophy was honed in [[Eindhoven]] by [[Kees Rijvers]] and [[Guus Hiddink]] in the late seventies and eighties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ajax-psv-philosophical-rivalry-dominates-dutch-mindset#2rZB5iOBKmfBu5ym.99 |title=Ajax-PSV: a philosophical rivalry that dominates the Dutch mindset |publisher=Fourfourtwo.com |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> This in turn has created one of the more philosophical rivalries in football, an ideological battleground, which is gradually becoming as heated and intense as the matches Ajax and Feyenoord partake in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/alles-over-de-topper-in-de-eredivisie-tussen-ajax-en-psv.htm |title=Alles over de topper in de Eredivisie tussen Ajax en PSV |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

===Rivalries with other clubs===
Aside from Feyenoord and PSV, Ajax have several other rivalries, although in most cases the sentiment is mostly felt by the opposition and is more directed towards Ajax, with one of them being [[FC Utrecht]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalcentraal.nl/nieuws/56261/rivaliteit-tussen-fans-ajax-en-fc-utrecht-opvallend |title=Rivaliteit tussen fans Ajax en FC Utrecht opvallend |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> Although the rivalry is more felt on the [[Utrecht]] side then with Ajax, matchups between the two sides are often quite intense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/sport/988786-1209/zo-n-rivaliteit-moeilijk-te-begrijpen |title=Zulke rivaliteit moeilijk te begrijpen |publisher=BNR.nl|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> Both teams have fanatic supporters, and clashes off the pitch are more often the rule than the exception. The same goes for [[ADO Den Haag]], with both supporter-groups often getting in conflicts, when ADO-Hooligans set fire to the Supporters home of Ajax, and Ajax-Hooligans subsequently broke into the Supporters home of ADO tensions between the two clubs rose. In 2006 Supporters from both clubs were banned from attending away matches for five years, due to frequent violent outbreaks and clashes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/820449/2006/04/25/Poging-brandstichting-supportershome-Ajax.dhtml |title=Poging brandstichting supportershome Ajax |publisher=Volkskrant|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

Further teams who share a rivalry with Ajax include [[FC Twente]], [[FC Groningen]] and [[AZ (football club)|AZ]]. Although the latter are often regarded by Ajax-supporters as the clubs little brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=193936 |title=Ajax is de buurman, rivaliteit is groot, het betekent iets voor de mensen |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> Being from nearby [[Alkmaar]], and with both clubs sharing the same [[Province]], match-ups between the two sides are commonly known as the "De Noord-Hollandse Derby" ("North Holland Derby") and are often very competitive, intense and loaded fixtures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/nl/match/46410/afc-ajax-vs-az/report |title=Noord-Hollandse derby makkelijke prooi Ajax |publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

Past rivalries include local Amsterdam derbies between Ajax and clubs such as [[Blauw-Wit Amsterdam|Blauw-Wit]], [[Door Wilskracht Sterk|DWS]] and [[De Volewijckers]] (who later merged to become [[FC Amsterdam]] in 1972).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/424276/1996/03/30/Blauw-Wit-de-club-van-het-Stadion-kwam-zag-en-verdween.dhtml |title=Blauw Wit, de club van het Stadion, kwam, zag en verdween |publisher=Volkskrant|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> The tension between the local sides lessened however, as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the Amsterdam clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/webshop/product/sporen-van-ajax.htm |title=Sporen van Ajax |publisher=Voetbal Internatinoal|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> The last Amsterdam derby to take place in an official league match was when Ajax defeated FC Amsterdam 5-1, on March 19, 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/923-Europe/6986-dutch-derby-days |title=Dutch derby days |publisher=When Saturday Comes|accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

Historically, Ajax was popularly seen as having "Jewish roots", although not an official Jewish club like the city's [[WV-HEDW]] Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 1930s when the home stadium was located next to a Jewish neighbourhood of [[Amsterdam-Oost]] and opponents saw many supporters walking through the Nieuwmarkt/Waterloopleinbuurt (de Jodenhoek) to get to the stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2006/12/09/ajax-en-de-joden.aspx |title=de alternatieve bron voor sportnieuws |publisher=Sportgeschiedenis.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}</ref> The city of Amsterdam was historically referred to as a [[Mokum]] city, Mokum (מקום) being the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] word for "place" or "safe haven",<ref>[http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/dictionary/m Yiddish Dictionary Online]</ref> and as [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] chants and name calling developed and intensified at the old [[De Meer Stadion]] from frustrated supporters of opposing clubs, Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish<ref name="nyt">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB153FF93BA15750C0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 Amsterdam Journal; A Dutch Soccer Riddle: Jewish Regalia Without Jews] – New York Times, 28 March 2005</ref>) responded by embracing Ajax's "Jewish" identity: calling themselves "super Jews", chanting "Jews, Jews" ("Joden, Joden") at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the [[Star of David]] and the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]].<ref name="nyt" /><ref name="understanding">[http://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC&lpg=PA197&dq=ajax%20jews&client=safari&pg=PA196 Understanding football hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Clubs] by Ramon Spaaij, published 2006</ref>

This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture.<ref name="understanding" /> At one point ringtones of "[[Hava Nagila]]", a [[Hebrew]] [[folk song]], could be downloaded from the club's official website.<ref name="nyt" /> Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their [[antisemitic]] rhetoric, chanting slogans like "[[Hamas]], Hamas/Jews to the [[gas chamber|gas]]" ("Hamas, hamas, joden aan het gas"), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving [[Nazi salute]]s, etc.<ref name="nyt" /><ref>{{cite web|title = Ajax and the Jewish Issue | url = http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html | publisher = ajax-usa.com | accessdate =20 May 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070113235308/http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html |archivedate=February 16, 2005}}</ref> The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games.<ref name="nyt" />

In the 2000s the club began trying to persuade fans to drop their Jewish image.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E7DB153FF93BA15750C0A9639C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Amsterdam Journal; A Dutch Soccer Riddle: Jewish Regalia Without Jews | first=Craig S. | last=Smith | date=28 March 2005 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

Played against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], winners of the 1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup, it actually went ahead as 'a celebration of the I Centenary of Rangers F.C.' (See below) because [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] were serving a one-year ban at the time imposed by UEFA for the misbehaviour of their fans. That victory meant Ajax had won every tournament (5 in total) they entered that year, a feat [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] achieved in 1967 (with 6 trophies) and [[Barcelona F.C.|Barcelona]] (also 6 trophies) repeated in 2009)

{{main|Club van 100 (AFC Ajax)}}
The Club van 100 is the official list of [[Association football|Football]] players who have appeared in one hundred or more official matches for AFC Ajax. The club currently has a total of 150 members with [[Daley Blind]] being the latest addition.<ref>[http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuwsarchief/Ajax-nieuwsartikel/Blind-150ste-in-Club-van-100.htm Blind 150ste in Club van 100 (Dutch)] Ajax.nl, 18 August 2013</ref> The record for league appearances is held by '''Mr. Ajax''' himself [[Sjaak Swart]], who appeared in 463 league matches for Ajax 1.<ref>[http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/1948009/2010/07/28/Suarez-in-club-van-100-bij-Ajax.dhtml Suarez in 'club van 100' bij Ajax (Dutch)] AD.nl, 28 July 2010</ref> There is a beneficiary team called Lucky Ajax, which was initiated by Sjaak Swart. Lucky Ajax participate in at least one match a year, usually in the name of charity, and commonly at football ceremonies to bid farewell to retiring players. One of the prerequisites for playing on Lucky Ajax, which is invitational only, is that you are a member of the Club van 100, having made at least 100 official match appearances for Ajax Amsterdam in the first team of the club.<ref>[http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/ajax/21511585/__Sjaak_Swart_wordt_75_jaar__.html Swart wordt 75 jaar in Olympisch Stadion (Dutch)] De Telegraaf, 25 April 2013</ref>

==Lucky Ajax==
Lucky Ajax are a beneficiary team that was initiated by Sjaak Swart in the seventies, competing in at least one match a year, usually in the name of charity and/or to bid farewell to retiring former Ajax players. The team is made up of various members of the [[Club van 100 (AFC Ajax)|Club van 100]] of Ajax who will come out of retirement for this match to face the Ajax squad that is current of that year.<ref>[https://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuwsarchief/Ajax-nieuwsartikel/181839/Lucky-Ajax-speelt-altijd-om-de-eer.htm Lucky Ajax speelt altijd om de eer (Dutch)] Ajax.nl, 15 April 2012</ref> Past participants have included [[Barry Hulshoff]], [[Sonny Silooy]], [[Simon Tahamata]], [[Ronald Koeman]], [[Tscheu La Ling]], [[Gerrie Mühren]], [[John van 't Schip]], [[Brian Roy]], [[Stanley Menzo]], [[Peter van Vossen]] and [[Fred Grim]].<ref>[http://www.ajax.nl/Ajax-Nieuws/Ajax-nieuwsarchief/Ajax-nieuwsartikel/184835/Lucky-Ajax-wint-unieke-Oude-Klassieker.htm Lucky Ajax wint unieke 'Oude Klassieker' (Dutch)] Ajax.nl, 15 April 2012</ref> The name Lucky Ajax is derived from the famous "''Lucky Ajax''" nickname from how people used to refer to the club when Ajax would either win a match by chance, by a decision of a referee, or by coincidence such as was said to be the case during the infamous [[De Mistwedstrijd|Mistwedstrijd]] (Fog Match).<ref>[http://www.bequickzutphen.nl/columns-2/396-column-sjaak-swart-hoe-nu-verder Column: Sjaak Swart; hoe nu verder?

[[Marvin Zeegelaar]] wore the shirt number In preparation for the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12 season]] in one preseason match, while [[Aras Özbiliz]] wore the number 14 shirt in one preseason match ahead of the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12 season]] as well.
