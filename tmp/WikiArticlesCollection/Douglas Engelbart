'''Douglas Carl Engelbart''' (January 30, 1925&nbsp;– July 2, 2013) was an American [[engineer]] and [[inventor]], and an early computer and [[List of Internet pioneers|Internet pioneer]]. He is best known for his work on the challenges of [[human–computer interaction]], particularly while at his [[Augmentation Research Center]] Lab in [[SRI International]], resulting in the invention of the [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]], and the development of [[hypertext]], networked computers, and precursors to [[graphical user interface]]s. These were demonstrated at [[The Mother of All Demos]] in 1968.

In the early 1950s, he decided that instead of "having a steady job" (such as his position at NASA's Ames Research Center) he would focus on making the world a better place, especially through the use of computers. Engelbart was therefore a committed, vocal proponent of the development and use of computers and [[computer network]]s to help cope with the world’s increasingly urgent and complex problems. Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed "[[bootstrapping|bootstrapping strategy]]". He designed the strategy to accelerate the rate of innovation of his lab.

Under Engelbart's guidance, the Augmentation Research Center developed, with funding primarily from [[DARPA]], the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] to demonstrate numerous technologies, most of which are in modern widespread use; this included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at [[The Mother of All Demos]] in 1968. The lab was transferred from SRI to Tymshare in the late 1970s, which was acquired by McDonnell Douglas in 1984, and NLS was renamed Augment. At both Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas, Engelbart was limited by a lack of interest in his ideas and funding to pursue them, and retired in 1986. 

In 1988, Engelbart and his daughter Christina launched the Bootstrap Institute (later known as [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]) to promote his vision, especially at Stanford University; this effort did result in some DARPA funding to modernize the user interface of Augment. In December 2000, United States President Bill Clinton awarded Engelbart the National Medal of Technology, the United States' highest technology award. In December 2008, Engelbart was honored by SRI at the 40th Anniversary celebration of the 1968 "Mother of All Demos".

==Early life and education==
Engelbart was born in [[Portland, Oregon]] on January 30, 1925, to Carl Louis Engelbart and Gladys Charlotte Amelia Munson Engelbart. His ancestors were of [[Germans|German]], [[Swedes|Swedish]] and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] descent.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|last=Lowood|first=Henry|url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/main1-ntb.html|title=Douglas Engelbart Interview 1|work=[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/histsci/ssvoral/engelbart/ Stanford and the Silicon Valley: Oral History Interviews]|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=1986-12-19|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

He was the middle of three children, with a sister Dorianne (3 years older), and a brother David (14 months younger). They lived in Portland in his early years, and moved to Johnson Creek in the countryside  when he was 9 or 10, after the death of his father. He graduated from Portland's [[Franklin High School (Portland, Oregon)|Franklin High School]] in 1942.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://history-computer.com/People/EngelbartBio.html|title=Biography of Douglas Engelbart|first=Georgi|last=Dalakov|publisher=History of Computers|accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>

Midway through his college studies at [[Oregon State University|Oregon State College]] at Corvallis, near the end of World War II, he was drafted into the United States Navy, serving two years as a [[radar]] technician in the [[Philippines]]. On a small island, in a tiny hut on stilts, he first read [[Vannevar Bush]]'s article "[[As We May Think]]", which greatly inspired him.<ref name="bio"/> He returned to Oregon State College and completed his Bachelor's degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1948. While at Oregon State College, he was a member of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/resourcedocs/about-resources/Citation-Recipients.pdf|title=Citation Recipients|publisher=[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]|page=5|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigep.org/about/who-we-are/history-and-facts/prominentalumni/business/|title=Prominent Alumni: Business|publisher=[[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> He was hired by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] at the [[Ames Research Center]], where he worked through 1951.<ref name="cv">{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|first=Douglas|last=Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|url=http://dougengelbart.org/about/cv.html|accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>

==Career and accomplishments==
[[File:SRI Computer Mouse.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mouse (computing)#Early mice|first prototype of a computer mouse]], as designed by [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]] from Engelbart's sketches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137400/mouse40.html|title=The computer mouse turns 40|first=Benj|last=Edwards|publisher=[[Macworld]]|date=2008-12-09|accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>]]

===Guiding philosophy===
Engelbart's career was inspired in December 1950 when he was engaged to be married and realized he had no career goals other "than a steady job, getting married and living happily ever after".<ref name=OBrien1999>{{cite news |url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_23592605 |title=Douglas Engelbart's lasting legacy |date=1999-02-09 |author=Tia O'Brien |work=San Jose Mercury News |accessdate=2013-07-04}}</ref> Over several months he reasoned that:
# he would focus his career on making the world a better place;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/colloquium/colloquium.html|title=The Unfinished Revolution II: Strategy and Means for Coping with Complex Problems|work=Colloquium at Stanford University|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|date=April 2000|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>
# any serious effort to make the world better requires some kind of organized effort;
# harnessing the collective human intellect of all the people contributing to effective solutions was the key;
# if you could dramatically improve how we do that, you'd be boosting every effort on the planet to solve important problems — the sooner the better; and
# computers could be the vehicle for dramatically improving this capability.<ref name=OBrien1999/>

In 1945, Engelbart had read with interest [[Vannevar Bush]]'s article "As We May Think",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dougengelbart.org/events/vannevar-bush-symposium.html#2|title=The MIT/Brown Vannevar Bush Symposium: Influence on Doug Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> a call to action for making knowledge widely available as a national peacetime grand challenge. He had also read something about the recent phenomenon of computers, and from his experience as a radar technician, he knew that information could be analyzed and displayed on a screen. He envisioned intellectual workers sitting at display "working stations", flying through information space, harnessing their collective intellectual capacity to solve important problems together in much more powerful ways. Harnessing collective intellect, facilitated by interactive computers, became his life's mission at a time when computers were viewed as number crunching tools.<ref name="aughum">{{cite web|title=Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework|first=Douglas C|last = Engelbart |work=SRI Summary Report AFOSR-3223, Prepared for: Director of Information Sciences, Air Force Office of Scientific Research|publisher=SRI International, hosted by [[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|url = http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html |date=October 1962|accessdate= 2013-08-11}}</ref>

He enrolled in graduate school in electrical engineering at [[University of California, Berkeley]], graduating with a Master of Science degree in 1953, and a Ph.D. in 1955.<ref name="cv"/> As a graduate student at Berkeley he assisted in the construction of the California Digital Computer project [[CALDIC]]. His graduate work led to several patents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/patents.html|title=U.S. Patents held by Douglas C. Engelbart|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, [[Digital Techniques]], to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.<ref name="pursuit">{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/history/engelbart.html|title=A Lifetime Pursuit|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2013-08-11}}<!--|quote=Within a year, however, he was tipped off by a colleague that if he kept talking about his "wild ideas" he'd be an acting assistant professor forever. So he ventured back down into what is now Silicon Valley, in search of more suitable employment.--></ref>

===SRI and the Augmentation Research Center===
Engelbart took a position at [[SRI International]] (known then as Stanford Research Institute) in [[Menlo Park, California]] in 1957. He initially worked for [[Hewitt Crane]] on magnetic devices and miniaturization of electronics; Engelbart and Crane became close friends.<ref>{{cite book|title=What the Dormouse Said|author=Markoff, John|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cTyfxP-g2IIC&pg=PT70&lpg=PT70|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|page=70|isbn=1101201088}}</ref> At SRI, Engelbart gradually obtained over a dozen patents (some resulting from his graduate work), and by 1962 produced a report about his vision and proposed research agenda titled ''Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework''.<ref name="aughum"/>

This led to funding from [[DARPA|ARPA]] to launch his work. Engelbart recruited a research team in his new [[Augmentation Research Center]] (ARC, the lab he founded at SRI). Engelbart embedded a set of organizing principles in his lab, which he termed "[[bootstrapping|bootstrapping strategy]]". He designed the strategy to accelerate the rate of innovation of his lab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/bootstrapping-strategy.html|title=About an Accelerative Bootstrapping Strategy|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref><ref name="scopus">{{Scopus|id=6701716173}}</ref><ref name="dblp">{{DBLP|id=Engelbart:Douglas_C=}}</ref><ref name="microsoft">{{AcademicSearch|1367057}}</ref> 

The ARC became the driving force behind the design and development of the [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as [[bitmap]]ped screens, the mouse, [[hypertext]], collaborative tools, and precursors to the [[graphical user interface]].<ref name="acm">{{ACMPortal|id=81100342853}}</ref> He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas back in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals, who could only use computers through intermediaries (see [[batch processing]]), and when software tended to be written for [[vertical application]]s in proprietary systems.
[[Image:Apple Macintosh Plus mouse.jpg| thumb|Two [[Macintosh Plus|Apple Macintosh Plus]] mice, 1986]]

Engelbart applied for a [[patent]] in 1967 and received it in 1970, for the wooden shell with two metal wheels ([[computer mouse]] – {{US patent |3541541}}), which he had developed with [[William English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], his lead engineer, a few years earlier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1633972.stm|title=Mouse inventor strives for more|first=Alfred|last=Hermida|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2001-11-05|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> In the patent application it is described as an ''"X-Y position indicator for a display system"''. Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the "mouse" because the tail came out the end. His group also called the on-screen cursor a "bug", but this term was not widely adopted.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/Archive/AugmentingHumanIntellect62/Display1967.html |title=Display-Selection Techniques for Text Manipulation| author1-link = William English (computer engineer)| first1 = William K | last1 = English | first2 = Douglas | last2 = Engelbart | first3 = Melvyn L | last3 = Berman|work=Stanford MouseSite|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate = 2012-07-29}}</ref>

He never received any royalties for his mouse invention. During an interview, he said "[[SRI International|SRI]] patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value. Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to [[Apple Computer]] for something like $40,000."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.superkids.com/aweb/pages/features/mouse/mouse.html|title=Doug Engelbart: Father of the Mouse| publisher =SuperKids| first= Andrew|last= Maisel| accessdate= 2012-06-17}}</ref> Engelbart showcased the [[chorded keyboard]] and many more of his and ARC's inventions in 1968 at the so-called [[the Mother of All Demos|Mother of All Demos]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Engelbart|first= Douglas C.|coauthors= et al|title = SRI-ARC.

===Tymshare and McDonnell Douglas===

Engelbart slipped into relative obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated from him and left his organization for [[Xerox PARC]], in part due to frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, [[timesharing|timeshare]] (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and social: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.<ref name="ACMTuring1997"/><ref name=OBrien1999/>

Engelbart served on the board of directors of [[Erhard Seminars Training]] (EST). Several key ARC personnel were also involved. Although EST had been recommended by other researchers, the controversial nature of EST and other social experiments reduced the morale and social cohesion of the ARC community.<ref name="bard"/>

The 1969 [[Mike Mansfield|Mansfield Amendment]], which ended military funding of non-military research, the end of the [[Vietnam War]], and the end of the [[Apollo program]] reduced ARC's funding from ARPA and [[NASA]]. SRI's management, which disapproved of Engelbart's approach to running the center, placed the remains of ARC under the control of [[artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Bertram Raphael]], who negotiated the transfer of the laboratory to a company called [[Tymshare]]. Engelbart's house in [[Atherton, California]] burned down during this period, causing him and his family further problems. Tymshare took over [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] and the lab that Engelbart had founded, hired most of the lab's staff including its creator as a Senior Scientist, renamed the software ''Augment'', and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. Tymshare was already somewhat familiar with NLS; back when ARC was still operational, it had experimented with its own local copy of the NLS software on a minicomputer called OFFICE-1, as part of a joint project with ARC.<ref name=OBrien1999/>

At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to do further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at [[McDonnell Douglas]], which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html|title=About An Open Hyperdocument System (OHS)|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref> Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.<ref name="ACMTuring1997"/><ref name=OBrien1999/>

===Bootstrap and the Doug Engelbart Institute===
Teaming with his daughter, Christina Engelbart, in 1988 he founded the Bootstrap Institute to coalesce his ideas into a series of three-day and half-day management seminars offered at Stanford University 1989–2000.<ref name=OBrien1999/> By the early 1990s there was sufficient interest among his seminar graduates to launch a collaborative implementation of his work, and the [[Bootstrapping|Bootstrap Alliance]] was formed as a non-profit home base for this effort. Although the invasion of Iraq and subsequent recession spawned a rash of belt-tightening reorganizations which drastically redirected the efforts of their alliance partners, they continued with the management seminars, consulting, and small-scale collaborations. In the mid-1990s they were awarded some DARPA funding to develop a modern user interface to Augment, called Visual AugTerm (VAT),<ref>{{cite web |title= About NLS/Augment |publisher=Doug Engelbart Institute |url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/augment.html |accessdate=2013-07-04}}</ref> while participating in a larger program addressing the IT requirements of the Joint Task Force.

Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, which he founded in 1988 with his daughter Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic ''bootstrapping'' approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Doug Engelbart Institute | url= http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/vision-highlights.html|title=Doug's Vision Highlights | contribution = Augmenting Society's Collective IQ}}</ref> In 2005 Engelbart received a [[National Science Foundation]] grant to fund the open source HyperScope project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/hyperscope.html|title=HyperScope Basics|publisher=[[The Doug Engelbart Institute]]|accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> The Hyperscope team built a browser component using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[Dynamic HTML]] designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/euos2006/view/e_sess/9626|title=Douglas Engelbart's HyperScope: Taking Web Collaboration to the Next Level Using Ajax and Dojo |publisher=O'Reilly Media|accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref><!-- The Doug Engelbart Institute is now based at [[SRI International]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/about-us.html#3|title=Contact Info|publisher=The Doug Engelbart Institute|accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref> I don't think this is accurate - based on the ref I think they are simply leasing space there. -->

===Death and legacy===
Engelbart attended the Program for the Future 2010 Conference where hundreds of people convened at The Tech Museum in San Jose and online to engage in dialog about how to pursue his vision to augment [[collective intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.corporationtocommunity.com/douglas-engelbart/|title= Douglas Engelbart | publisher = Corporation to Community|date=2011-02-16|accessdate= 2012-07-29}}</ref>

The most complete coverage of Engelbart's bootstrapping ideas can be found in ''Boosting Our Collective IQ'', by Douglas C. Engelbart, 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougengelbart.org/library/books.html|title= Engelbart Books | publisher = Doug Engelbart institute}}</ref> This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by [[Yuri Rubinsky]] and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart Institute.

Two comprehensive histories of Engelbart's laboratory and work are in ''What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry'' by [[John Markoff]] and ''A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century'' by Donald Neilson.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Heritage of Innovation: SRI's First Half Century|author=Donald Neilson|publisher=[[SRI International]]|year=2005|isbn=0974520802}}</ref> Other books on Engelbart and his laboratory include ''Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing'' by [[Thierry Bardini]] and ''The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart'', by [[Valerie Landau]] and [[Eileen Clegg]] in conversation with Douglas Engelbart.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Engelbart Hypothesis: Dialogs with Douglas Engelbart | first = Valerie | last = Landau | authorlink = Valerie Landau | date=2009-11-17 | isbn=0615308902}}.</ref> All four of these books are based on interviews with Engelbart as well as other contributors in his laboratory.

Engelbart served on the Advisory Boards of the [[University of Santa Clara Center for Science, Technology, and Society]], [[Foresight Institute]],<ref name="fore"/> [[Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility]], The Technology Center of Silicon Valley, and The Liquid Information Company.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.liquid.info/company.html | work =About Us | title = Advisory Board|publisher= The Liquid Information Co |accessdate= 2012-07-29}}</ref> Engelbart had four children, Gerda, Diana, Christina and Norman with his first wife Ballard, who died in 1997 after 47 years of marriage.

===Anecdotal notes===
Historian of science [[Thierry Bardini]] argues that Engelbart's complex personal philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern application of the concept of [[coevolution]] to the philosophy and use of technology.<ref name = "bard">{{cite journal | author1-link = Thierry Bardini | first1 = Thierry | last1 = Bardini | first2 = Michael | last2 = Friedewald | format = [[PDF]] | title = Chronicle of the Death of a Laboratory: Douglas Engelbart and the Failure of the Knowledge Workshop|journal=[[History of Technology (magazine)|History of Technology]] |year=2002|volume=23|pages=192–212|url=http://www.friedewald-family.de/Publikationen/hot2002.pdf}}</ref> Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|principle of linguistic relativity]] developed by [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]]. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.<ref name="bard" />
