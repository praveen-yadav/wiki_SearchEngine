At {{convert|183568|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, Cameroon is the world's 53rd largest country.<ref>''Demographic Yearbook'' 1.</ref> It is comparable in size to [[Papua New Guinea]], and somewhat larger than the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. Cameroon's landmass is {{convert|181252|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|2317|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of water.

The country is located in Central and West Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.

Cameroon is sometimes described as "Africa in miniature" because it exhibits all the major climates and vegetation of the continent: mountains, desert, rain forest, savanna grassland, and ocean coastland. Cameroon can be divided into five geographic zones. These are distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features.

==Natural regions==
[[Image:Cameroon Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Cameroon]]
{{MapLibrary|Cameroon_sat.png|Cameroon}}
Cameroon's coastal plain extends {{convert|10|to|50|mi|km|0}} inland from the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (part of the Atlantic Ocean) to the edge of a plateau. In the former western state, however, the mass of [[Mount Cameroon]] reaches almost to the sea.  The plain is densely forested including areas of [[Central African mangroves]] especially around [[Douala]] and in the estuary of the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] on the border with [[Nigeria]].

The low [[South Cameroon Plateau]], rising from the coastal plain and dominated by tropical rain forest, has an average elevation of {{convert|1500|to|2000|ft|m|0|lk=in}}. It is less humid than the coast.

In western Cameroon is an irregular chain of trees, white waters, and six flags that extend from Mount Cameroon almost to [[Lake Chad]] at the southern tip of the country. This region includes the [[Bamenda highlands|Bamenda]], [[Bamiléké highlands|Bamiléké]], and [[Mambilla highlands]]. It also contains some of the country's most fertile soils, notably around volcanic Mt. Cameroon. This area of tropical forest has been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] [[ecoregion]] with [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests|Mount Cameroon]] considered separately because as an active volcano it has a distinct environment from the other mountains.

From the forested southern plateau the land rises northward to the grassy, rugged [[Adamaoua highlands|Adamaoua]] (Adamawa) highlands. Stretching across Cameroon from the western mountain area, the Adamaoua forms a barrier between the north and south. Its average elevation is {{convert|3400|ft|m|0}}.

The northern [[savanna|savanna plain]] extends from the edge of the Adamaoua to Lake Chad. Its characteristic vegetation is scrub and grass. This is region of sparse rainfall and high median temperatures has been included as part of the [[East Sudanian savanna]] ecoregion.

== Climate ==
 
The climate varies with terrain, from tropical along the coast to semiarid and hot in the north.
Exceedingly hot and humid, the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth. For example, [[Debundscha]], at the base of Mt. Cameroon, has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|405|in|mm|0}}.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html#highpre Highest Average Annual Precipitation Extremes]. Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation, [[National Climatic Data Center]]. August 9, 2004. Last accessed November 7, 2006.</ref>

==Rivers==
The country has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers flow southwestward or westward directly to the [[Gulf of Guinea]] — the [[Wouri River|Wouri]], and lesser [[Dibamba River|Dibamba]], [[Bimbia River|Bimbia]] and [[Mungo River, Cameroon|Mungo]] to the Cameroon [[estuary]] near [[Douala]]; [[Sanaga River|Sanaga]], [[Nyong River|Nyong]], and [[Ntem River|Ntem]] further south along the coast; [[Akwayafe River|Akwayafe]] and [[Manyu River|Manyu]] (which joins Nigerian [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross]]), and the lesser [[Ndian River|Ndian]] and [[Meme River|Meme]] in the north of coast.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://nest.su.se/mnode/Africa/Cameroon/cameroonintro.htm | accessdate = 2012-10-25 | last= Gabche | first = C E | coauthors = Smith, S V | title = Cameroon Estuarine Systems}}</ref> The [[Dja River|Dja]] and [[Kadei River|Kadeï]], however, drain southeastward into the [[Congo River]]. In northern Cameroon, the [[Benue River|Benoué River]] (Benue) runs north and west, eventually into the Niger, while the [[Logone River]] flows northward into [[Lake Chad]].

Only part of Lake Chad lies within Cameroon. The rest belongs to [[Chad]], Nigeria, and Niger. The lake varies in size according to seasonal rainfall.

Some of the borders of Cameroon follow rivers, including the [[Aïna River|Aïna]], [[Akwayafe River|Akwayafe]], and [[Ntem River|Ntem]] or [[Campo River|Campo]].
