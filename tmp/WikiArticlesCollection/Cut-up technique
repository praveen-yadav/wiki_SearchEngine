The '''cut-up technique''' is an [[aleatory]] [[literary technique]] in which a [[Writing|text]] is cut up and rearranged to create a new text.

The concept can be traced to at least the [[Dadaists]] of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer [[William S. Burroughs]], and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.

==Technique==
The cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:

*''Cut-up'' is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text. {{examples| date = July 2013}}
*''Fold-in'' is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page. {{examples| date = July 2013}}

==History in literature==
A precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which [[Tristan Tzara]] offered to create a [[poem]] on the spot by pulling words at [[random]] from a hat. [[Collage]], which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, ''dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love'' under the sub-title, ''[http://www.in-vacua.com/tzara.shtml TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM]'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.391.org/manifestos/19201212tristantzara_dmonflabl.htm |title=manifestos: dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love by tristan tzara, 12th december 1920 |publisher=391 |date=1920-12-12 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}</ref>

Burroughs cited [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem, ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) and [[John Dos Passos]]' [[U.S.A. trilogy]], which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.

[[Gil J. Wolman]] developed cut-up techniques as part of his [[lettrism|lettrist]] practice in the early 1950s.

Also in the 1950s, painter and writer [[Brion Gysin]]  more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a [[razor blade]]. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]s of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book ''Minutes to Go'' resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet [[Sinclair Beiles]] also used this technique and co-authored ''Minutes To Go''.

Gysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the [[Beat Hotel]]. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and [[audio recording]]s in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, [[Hypothesis|hypothesizing]] that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text.  Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of [[divination]] saying, "When you cut into the present the future leaks out."<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r541727|pure_url=yes}} Break Through in Grey Room]</ref> Burroughs also further developed the "fold-in" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published ''[[The Third Mind]]'', a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication ''[[My Own Mag]]'' was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.

In an interview, [[Alan Burns (author)|Alan Burns]] noted that for ''Europe After The Rain'' (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: "I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/book/?fa=customcontent&GCOI=15647100621780&extrasfile=A09F77F7-B0D0-B086-B615C61B62D698F2.html |author=David W. Madden |title=A Conversation with Alan Burns |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref>

Argentine writer [[Julio Cortázar]] often used cut ups in his 1963 novel ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Hopscotch]]''.

==Musical influence==
From the early 1970s, [[David Bowie]] has used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. This technique influenced [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songwriting.<ref>See the notes for ''[[The "Priest" They Called Him]]'', a 1993 collaboration between Burroughs and Cobain, released by Tim/Kerr records.</ref> [[Thom Yorke]] applied a similar method in [[Radiohead]]'s ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs.

Burroughs taught the cut-up technique to musician [[Genesis P-Orridge]] in 1971 as a method for "altering reality". His explanation was that everything is recorded, and if it is recorded, then it can be edited (P-Orridge, 2003)<!-- This needs to be properly sourced. -->.

[[Stephen Mallinder]] of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] reported to ''[[Inpress]]'' magazine's [[Andrez Bergen]] that "I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days - the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating [[tape loop]]s and all that - has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin...."<ref>"Vintage Cab Sav," Andrez Bergen. ''[[Inpress]]'', 1996.</ref>
