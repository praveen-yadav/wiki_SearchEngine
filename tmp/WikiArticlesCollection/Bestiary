A '''bestiary''', or '''Bestiarum vocabulum''' is a [[compendium]] of beasts. Originating in the [[Ancient history|Ancient world]], bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals, birds and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.

==History==
The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.

Following the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era. 

A ''volucrary'' is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was Jean de Cuba's ''Jardin de Santé'' which describes 122 birds.

Mediaeval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today. 

Two illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the "marginal" decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work.  In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals.  Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating.<ref>The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing</ref>    

The Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo Da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct. - Dec., 1951 |pages=393–396 |jstor=537007 }}</ref>

==Modern bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the [[Book of Imaginary Beings]], which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called "The Bestiary" (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man's efforts to track down the world's most complete bestiary. [[John Henry Fleming]]'s ''Fearsome Creatures of Florida''<ref>[http://www.fearsomecreatures.com Fearsomecreatures.com]</ref> (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment.  [[Caspar Henderson]]'s The Book of Barely Imagined Beings <ref>[http://www.barelyimaginedbeings.com Barelyimaginedbeings.com]</ref> ([[Granta]] 2012, [[Chicago University Press]] 2013), subtitled "A 21st Century Bestiary," explores how humans imagine animals in a time of rapid environmental change.

Writers of [[Fantasy]] fiction draw heavily from the fanciful beasts described in [[mythology]], [[fairy tales]], and bestiaries. The "worlds" created in Fantasy fiction can be said to have their own bestiaries. Similarly, authors of fantasy [[role-playing game]]s sometimes compile bestiaries as references, such as the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' for ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. It is not uncommon for video games with a large variety of enemies (especially [[role-playing video game]]s) to include a bestiary of sorts. This usually takes the form of a list of enemies with short descriptions (e.g. the ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' games, as well as'' [[Dark Cloud]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'') and may even be central to the plot (''[[Pokemon]]'' series).
