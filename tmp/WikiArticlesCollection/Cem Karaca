'''Muhtar Cem Karaca''' (April 5, 1945 – February 8, 2004), also called '''Cem Baba''' (Daddy Cem or Father Cem), was a prominent [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[rock music|rock]] musician and one of the most important figures in the [[Anatolian rock]] movement.<ref>Barchard, David. ''Cem Karaca: A dissident Turkish singer, he spent much of the 1980s in exile''. The Guardian, March 8th, 2004</ref> He is a graduate of [[Robert College]].

Later he joined ''Jaguars'', an [[Elvis Presley]] cover band. In 1967, he started to write his own music, joining the band ''Apaşlar'' (The Rowdies), his first [[Turkish language|Turkish-language]] group. In the same year he participated in [[Golden Microphone]] ({{lang-tr|Altın Mikrofon}}) contest, a popular music contest in which he won the second place with his song ''Emrah''. In 1969, Karaca and bass-player Serhan Karabay left Apaşlar and started an original Anatolian group called ''Kardaşlar'' (The Brothers). 

In 1972, Karaca joined the group ''[[Moğollar]]'' (The Mongols) and wrote one of his best-known songs, "''Namus Belası''". However, [[Cahit Berkay]], the leader of Moğollar, wanted an international name for his band, and he left for [[France]] to take the group to another level. Karaca, who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound, left Moğollar and started his own band ''Dervişan'' (Dervishes) in 1974. Karaca and Dervişan sang poetic and [[progressive rock|progressive]] songs. 

In the 1970s, Turkey's image was damaged by political violence between supporters of the left and the right, separatist movements and the rise of [[Islamism]]. As the country fell into chaos, the government suspected Cem Karaca of involvement. At times he was accused of treason for being a separatist thinker and a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]. The Turkish government tried to portray Karaca as a man, who was unknowingly writing songs to start a revolution. One politician was quoted as saying, "Karaca is simply calling citizens to a bloody war against the state." Dervişan was ultimately dissolved at the end of 1977. He later founded in 1978 ''Edirdahan'', an acronym for "from Edirne to Ardahan"; the westernmost and the easternmost provinces of Turkey. He recorded one LP with ''Edirdahan''.

In early 1979, he left for [[West Germany]] for business reasons. Turkey continued to spin out of control with military curfews and eventually a military coup on September 12, 1980. General [[Kenan Evren]] took over the government and temporarily closed all the nation's political parties. After the coup, many intellectual people, including writers, artists and journalists, were arrested. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Karaca by the government of Turkey. 

The state invited Karaca back to the country several times, but Karaca, not knowing what would happen upon his return, decided not to come back.

While he was in [[Germany]], his father died, but he could not return to attend the funeral. After some time, the Turkish government decided to strip Cem Karaca of his Turkish citizenship, keeping the arrest warrant active.

Several years later, in 1987, the [[prime minister of Turkey|prime minister]] and leader of the Turkish [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]], [[Turgut Özal]], issued an amnesty for Karaca. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Turkey. His return also brought a new album by him, ''Merhaba Gençler ve Her zaman Genç Kalanlar'' ("''Hello, The Young and The Young at Heart''"), one of his most powerful works. His return home was greeted happily by his fans, but during his absence, Karaca had lost the youthful audience and acquired few new listeners. He died on February 8, 2004 and was interred at [[Karacaahmet Cemetery]] in [[Üsküdar]] district of Istanbul.
