'''Acupuncture''' is a collection of procedures involving penetration of the skin with needles to stimulate certain points on the body. In its classical form it is a characteristic component of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM). It has been categorized as a [[Complementary and alternative medicine|complementary health approach]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What is CAM?|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam#note1|publisher=NCCAM|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref> According to traditional Chinese medicine, stimulating specific [[acupuncture points]] corrects imbalances in the flow of ''[[qi]]'' through channels known as [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].<ref name="NIH-1997consensus">{{cite journal |title= Acupuncture |journal= NIH Consensus Statement |url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm |year=1997 |volume= 15 |issue= 5 |pages= 1–34 |pmid= 10228456 |accessdate=2007-07-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070714081037/http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997Acupuncture107html.htm| archivedate= 2007-07-14}}</ref> Scientific investigation has not found any [[histology|histological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] correlates for traditional Chinese concepts such as ''qi'', meridians, and acupuncture points,{{refn |group=n |name= "SinghErnst2008" |Singh & Ernst (2008) stated, "Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i",<ref>{{harvnb|Singh & Ernst|2008|page= 72}}</ref> "The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians"<ref>{{harvnb|Singh & Ernst|2008|page= 107}}</ref> and "Acupuncture points and meridians are not a reality, but merely the product of an ancient Chinese philosophy"<ref>{{harvnb|Singh & Ernst|2008|page= 387}}</ref>}}<ref name = Bauer>{{cite journal |first=M |last=Bauer |url=http://www.chinesemedicinetimes.com/section.php?xSec=122 |journal=Chinese Medicine Times |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=31 |year=2006 |title=The Final Days of Traditional Beliefs? – Part One}}</ref><ref name="Ahn2008">{{cite journal |last1=Ahn |first1=Andrew C. |last2=Colbert |first2=Agatha P. |last3=Anderson |first3=Belinda J. |last4=Martinsen |first4=ØRjan G. |last5=Hammerschlag |first5=Richard |last6=Cina |first6=Steve |last7=Wayne |first7=Peter M. |last8=Langevin |first8=Helene M. |title=Electrical properties of acupuncture points and meridians: A systematic review |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=245–56 |year=2008 |pmid=18240287 |doi=10.1002/bem.20403 |url=https://mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/research/projects/bioimpedance/publications/papers/meridian_rev.pdf}}</ref>

[[File:Acupuncture chart 300px.jpg|thumb|upright|Acupuncture chart from the [[Ming Dynasty]] (c. 1368–1644)]]

The precise start date of acupuncture's invention  in [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]] and how it evolved from early times are uncertain. Traditional Chinese religion attributes the introduction of acupuncture to the god [[Shennong]]. <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/chinesemedicine/emperors.html|title=Classics of Traditional Medicine}} </ref> One explanation is that [[Han Chinese]] doctors observed that some soldiers wounded in battle by [[arrow]]s were believed to have been cured of chronic afflictions that were otherwise untreated,<ref>{{cite book | last = Tiran | first = D | coauthors = Mack S | title =Complementary therapies for pregnancy and childbirth | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=IuQpoxRFRiIC&pg=PA79 79] | isbn = 0702023280 | publisher = [[Elsevier Health Sciences]] | year = 2000 }}</ref> and there are variations on this idea.<ref>e.g. {{cite book | last =  White | first = A | coauthors = [[Edzard Ernst|Ernst E]] | year = 1999 | title = Acupuncture: a scientific appraisal  | publisher = [[Elsevier Health Sciences]] | isbn = 0750641630 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=e2KkvlQI7sYC&pg=PA1 1]}}</ref> Sharpened stones known as ''[[Bian Stones|Bian shi]]'' have been found in China, suggesting the practice may date to the [[Neolithic]]<ref name = Chiu>{{cite book | last = Chiu | first = M | year = 1993 | title = Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion | publisher = [[Elsevier Health Sciences]] |url= http://books.google.ca/books?id=V5PAB4d5qmgC&pg=PA2 |page=2 | isbn = 0443042233 }}</ref> or possibly even earlier in the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ma |first1=K.-W. |title=The roots and development of Chinese acupuncture: from prehistory to early 20th century |journal=Acupuncture in Medicine |volume=10 |pages=92–9 |year=1992 |doi=10.1136/aim.10.Suppl.92|url=http://aim.bmj.com/content/10/supplement/92.full.pdf}}</ref> Hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] have been found dating from the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600–1100 BCE) which suggests that acupuncture was practiced along with [[moxibustion]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Robson | first = T | title = An Introduction to Complementary Medicine | isbn = 1741140544 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=E6oa37ZyTxEC&pg=PA90 90] }}</ref>  It has also been suggested that acupuncture has its origins in [[bloodletting]]<ref>{{cite pmid | 6998524}}</ref> or [[demonology]].<ref name = Prioreschi2004>{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&pg=PA147 147–8] | year = 2004 | isbn = 1888456019 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}</ref>

Despite improvements in [[metallurgy]] over centuries, it was not until the 2nd century BCE during the [[Han Dynasty]] that stone and bone needles were replaced with metal.<ref name = Chiu/> The earliest examples of metal needles were found in a tomb dated to c. 113 BCE, though their use might not necessarily have been acupuncture. The earliest example of the unseen [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]] (经络, {{zh|p=jīng-luò}}) used for diagnosis and treatment are dated to the second century BCE but these records do not mention needling, while the earliest reference to therapeutic needling occurs in the historical ''Shiji'' text (史記, English: ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') but does not mention the meridians and may be a reference to [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]] rather than acupuncture.<ref name = Ramey>{{cite journal | last = Ramey | first = D | coauthors = Buell D | year = 2004 | url = http://www.visibleholism.com/html/Acupuncture%20&%20Chinese%20Cultures/History%20of%20Acu/20090412/1516.html | title = A true history of acupuncture | doi = 10.1211/fact.2004.00244 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | journal = Focus on Complementary and Alternative Therapies | pages = 269–73 }}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

The earliest written record of acupuncture is found in the [[Huangdi Neijing]] (黄帝内经; translated as ''The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon''), dated approximately 200 BCE.<ref name = Prioreschi2004/> It does not distinguish between acupuncture and moxibustion and gives the same indication for both treatments.<ref name = Prioreschi2004/> The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which also date from the 2nd century BCE (though antedating both the ''Shiji'' and ''Huangdi Neijing''), mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion, but not acupuncture. However, by the 2nd century BCE, acupuncture replaced moxibustion as the primary treatment of systemic conditions.<ref name="Prioreschi2004"/>

The practice of acupuncture expanded out of [[China]] into the areas now part of [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Taiwan]], diverging from the narrower theory and practice of mainland [[Traditional Chinese medicine|TCM]] in the process.<ref name="fruehauf">{{cite web|url=http://chineseclassics.org/j/images/tcmcrisis.pdf|title=Chinese Medicine In Crisis: Science, Politics, And The Making Of "TCM"|author=Fruehauf H|year=2010|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>  A large number of contemporary practitioners outside of China follow these non-TCM practices, particularly in Europe.<ref name="Hicks,Hicks&Mole">{{cite book |author1=Hicks, Angela |author2=Hicks, John |author3=Mole, Peter |title=[[Five Element Constitutional Acupuncture]] |publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=London |year=2004 |edition=1st |pages=ix |isbn=0443071705 |oclc= }}</ref>

In Europe, examinations of the 5,000-year-old mummified body of [[Ötzi the Iceman]] have identified 15 groups of [[tattoo]]s on his body, some of which are located on what are now seen as contemporary acupuncture points. This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in [[Eurasia]] during the early [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dorfer |pages=1023–5 |first1=L |last2=Moser |first2=M |last3=Bahr |first3=F |last4=Spindler |first4=K |last5=Egarter-Vigl |first5=E |last6=Giullén |first6=S |last7=Dohr |first7=G |last8=Kenner |first8=T |volume=354 |title=A medical report from the stone age? |year=1999 |journal=The Lancet |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)12242-0 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/classicalarch/readings/Iceman_Tattoos.pdf |pmid=10501382 |issue=9183}}</ref>

=== Middle history ===
[[File:hua t08.jpg|thumb|Acupuncture chart from Hua Shou ([[floruit|fl.]] 1340s, [[Ming Dynasty]]). This image from ''Shi si jing fa hui (Expression of the Fourteen Meridians).'' (Tokyo: Suharaya Heisuke kanko, Kyoho gan 1716).]]

Korea is believed to be the second country that acupuncture spread to outside of China.  Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by the legendary emperor [[Dangun]] though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture.<ref>[[#Needham2002|Needham & Lu]], 2002, p. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=0-0tdqBr58cC&pg=PA262&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false 262].</ref>

Around 90 works on acupuncture were written in China between the Han Dynasty and the [[Song Dynasty]], and the [[Emperor Renzong of Song]], in 1023, ordered the production of a bronze statuette depicting the meridians and acupuncture points then in use. However, after the end of the Song Dynasty, acupuncture lost status, and started to be seen as a technical profession, in comparison to the more scholarly profession of herbalism. It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious practices like [[alchemy]], [[shamanism]], [[midwifery]] and moxibustion.<ref>[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&pg=PA25 25].</ref>

[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] missionaries in the 16th century were among the first to bring reports of acupuncture to the West.<ref>{{cite book | last = Unschuld | first = P | title = Chinese Medicine | page = 94 | year = 1998 | publisher = Paradigm Publications | isbn = 0912111550 }}</ref> [[Jacob de Bondt]], a Dutch [[surgeon]] traveling in Asia, described the practice in both Japan and [[Java]]. However, in China itself the practice was increasingly associated with the lower-classes and illiterate practitioners.<ref>[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&pg=PA58 58–9].</ref>

In 1674, Hermann Buschoff, a Dutch priest in Batavia, published the first book on moxibustion (from Japanese ''mogusa'') for the cure of arthritis. The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by  [[Willem ten Rhijne]], a Dutch physician who had worked at the Dutch trading post [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]] for two years.<ref>[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&pg=PA75 75].</ref> In 1757 the physician Xu Daqun described the further decline of acupuncture, saying it was a lost art, with few experts to instruct; its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.<ref>[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&pg=PA188 188].</ref>

In 1822, an edict from the Emperor Daoguang banned the practice and teaching of acupuncture within the Imperial Academy of Medicine outright, as unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars. At this point, acupuncture was still cited in Europe with both skepticism and praise, with little study and only a small amount of experimentation.<ref>[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&pg=PA308 308–9].</ref>

In the [[United States]], the earliest reports of acupuncture date back to 1826, when [[Benjamin Franklin Bache|Franklin Bache]], a surgeon of the [[United States Navy]], published a report in the ''North American Medical and Surgical Journal'' on his use of acupuncture to treat lower back pain.<ref name="nciacupuncture">{{cite web|title=Acupuncture (PDQ®)|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/healthprofessional/page3|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> Since the beginning of the 19th century, acupuncture was practiced by Asian immigrants living in [[Chinatown]]s.<ref name="nciacupuncture"/>

=== Modern era ===
In the early years after the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leaders ridiculed traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, as [[superstitious]], [[irrational]] and backward, claiming that it conflicted with the Party's dedication to science as the way of progress. Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] later reversed this position, saying that "Chinese medicine and pharmacology are a great treasure house and efforts should be made to explore them and raise them to a higher level."<ref>{{cite book |author=Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |isbn= |oclc= }}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}</ref>  Under Mao's leadership, in response to the lack of modern medical practitioners, acupuncture was revived and its theory rewritten to adhere to the political, economic and logistic necessities of providing for the medical needs of China's population.  Despite Mao proclaiming the practice of Chinese medicine to be "scientific", the practice was based more on the [[Materialism|materialist]] assumptions of [[Marxism]] in opposition to superstition rather than the [[Western culture|Western]] practice of empirical investigation of nature. Later the 1950s TCM's theory was again rewritten at Mao's insistence as a political response to the lack of unity between scientific and traditional Chinese medicine, and to correct the supposed "bourgeois thought of Western doctors of medicine" (p.&nbsp;109).<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = K | title = Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945–63: a Medicine of Revolution | year = 2005 | isbn = 041534512X | publisher = RoutledgeCurzon }}</ref>

Acupuncture gained attention in the [[United States]] when President [[Richard Nixon]] visited China in 1972. During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than [[anesthesia]]. Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high [[pain tolerance]] and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving [[morphine]] surreptitiously through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.<ref name="CSICOP">{{cite journal | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ | title = Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 1) | first = BL | last = Beyerstein | coauthors = Sampson W | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | year = 1996 | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | publisher = [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] }}</ref>

The greatest exposure in the West came after ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[James Reston]] received acupuncture in Beijing for post-operative pain in 1971 and wrote complaisantly about it in his newspaper.<ref>{{cite book |author=Davidson JP |title=The complete idiot's guide to managing stress |publisher=Alpha Books |location=Indianapolis, Ind |year=1999 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ldtNvjS7ypcC&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q&f=false 255]|isbn=0028629558 |oclc= }}</ref> Also in 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the U.S. was established in Washington DC; during 1973-1974, this center saw up to one thousand patients.<ref name="JCIM_Lee">{{cite journal | url = http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx/ | title = The first acupuncture center in the United States: an interview with Dr. Yao Wu Lee, Washington Acupuncture Center | first = AY | last = Fan  | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | year = 2012 | journal = [[Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine]] | publisher = [[Committee for Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine]] }}</ref> In 1973 the American [[Internal Revenue Service]] allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.<ref name="'70s 133">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= 133|url= }}</ref>

Acupuncture has been the subject of active [[scientific method|scientific research]] both in regard to its basis and therapeutic effectiveness since the late 20th century, but it remains controversial among medical researchers and clinicians.<ref name="pmid17265547"/>  In 2006, a [[BBC]] documentary ''Alternative Medicine'' filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture-induced anesthesia. It was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of weak anesthetics that in combination could have a much more powerful effect. The program was also criticized for its fanciful interpretation of the results of a brain scanning experiment.<ref name=SinghGuardian>{{cite news | title= A groundbreaking experiment ... or a sensationalized TV stunt?|author=Simon Singh|work=The Guardian |date=2006-03-26|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/25/science.broadcasting}}</ref><ref name=SinghTelegraph>{{cite news|title=Did we really witness the 'amazing power' of acupuncture?|work=Daily Telegraph  |date=14 February 2006|author=Simon Singh|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3344833/Did-we-really-witness-the-amazing-power-of-acupuncture.html}}</ref>

The use of acupuncture as anesthesia for surgery has fallen out of favor with scientifically trained surgeons in China. A delegation of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] reported in 1995:<ref name="CSICOP"/>

{{quote|We were not shown acupuncture anesthesia for surgery, this apparently having fallen out of favor with scientifically trained surgeons. Dr. Han, for instance, had been emphatic that he and his colleagues see acupuncture only as an analgesic (pain reducer), not an anesthetic (an agent that blocks all conscious sensations).}}

On November 16, 2010, acupuncture was recognized by [[UNESCO]] as part of the world's [[intangible cultural heritage]].<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web|title=Acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional Chinese medicine|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00425|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>

== Theory ==
The general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that bodily functions are regulated by an energy called [[qi]] (氣) which flows through the body; disruptions of this flow are believed to be responsible for disease.<ref name="NIH-1997consensus"/> Acupuncture describes a family of procedures aiming to correct imbalances in the flow of qi by stimulation of anatomical locations on or under the skin (usually called acupuncture points or acupoints), by a variety of techniques.<ref name="NIH-1997consensus"/> The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or by electrical stimulation.<ref name="NIH-1997consensus"/>

=== Qi, meridians and acupuncture points ===
{{Main|Qi|Traditional Chinese medicine#TCM model of the body|Meridian (Chinese medicine)|Acupuncture point}}

[[Traditional Chinese medicine]] distinguishes not only one but several different kinds of qi.<ref name = Aung11>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, pp [http://books.google.ca/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false 11–12].</ref>  In a general sense, qi is something that is defined by five "cardinal functions":<ref name = Aung11/><ref>"'''氣的生理功能'''...(一)推動作用...(二)溫煦作用...(三)防御作用...(四)固攝作用...(五)氣化作用 ['''Physiological functions of qi''' ... 1.)

[[File:ChineseMedecine.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Old Chinese medical chart on acupuncture meridians]]

# Actuation (推動, tuīdòng) – of all physical processes in the body, especially the circulation of all body fluids such as blood in their vessels. This includes actuation of the functions of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Zàng-fǔ (organs)|zang-fu organs]] and meridians.
# Warming (溫煦, {{zh|p=wēnxù}}) – the body, especially the limbs.
# Defense (防御, {{zh|p=fángyù}}) – against [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|Exogenous Pathogenic Factors]]
# Containment (固攝, {{zh|p=gùshè}}) – of body fluids, i.e. keeping blood, sweat, urine, semen etc. from leakage or excessive emission.
# Transformation (氣化, {{zh|p=qìhuà}}) – of food, drink, and breath into qi, [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Xue|xue]] (blood), and [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Bodily fluids (Jinye)|jinye]] ("fluids"), and/or transformation of all of the latter into each other.
	
To fulfill its functions, qi has to steadily flow from the inside of the body (where the [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Zàng-fǔ (organs)|zang-fu organs]] are located) to the "superficial" body tissues of the skin, muscles, tendons, bones, and joints. It is assisted in its flow by "channels" referred to as meridians. TCM identifies 12 "regular" and 8 "extraordinary" meridians; the Chinese terms being 十二经脉 ({{zh|p=shí-èr jīngmài}}, lit. "the Twelve Vessels") and 奇经八脉 ({{zh|p=qí jīng bā mài}}) respectively.<ref>"（三）十二经脉 ...（四）奇经八脉 ..." [(3.) The Twelve Vessels ... (4.)

They were also symbolically linked to the rivers found in ancient China, such as the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]], [[Wei River|Wei]] and [[Yellow River]]s.<ref>[[#Needham2002|Needham & Lu]], 2002, p.

Acupuncture points are mainly (but not always) found at specified locations along the meridians. There also is a number of acupuncture points with specified locations outside of the meridians; these are called "extraordinary" points and often credited with special therapeutic properties.  A third category of acupuncture points called "A-shi" points have no fixed location but represent tender or reflexive points appearing in the course of pain syndromes.<ref>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, p. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false 101].</ref>  The actual number of points have varied considerably over time, initially they were considered to number 365, symbolically aligning with the number of days in the year (and in Han times, the number of bones thought to be in the body).  The ''[[Huangdi Neijing]]'' mentioned only 160 and a further 135 could be deduced giving a total of 295.  The modern total was once considered 670 but subsequently expanded due to more recent interest in auricular (ear) acupuncture and the treatment of further conditions.  In addition, it is considered likely that some points used historically have since ceased being used.<ref>[[#Needham2002|Needham & Lu]], 2002, p.

<!---=== Blood ===
TCM asserts that blood is propelled by qi, that the 100 blood "vessels are the pathways of the blood’, that the vessels gather at a specific acupuncture point (Taiyuan LU-9) associated with the lung (or lungs), and that when qi flow is not in balance, blood pools and stagnates.<ref>Classic of Difficulties (45th Difficulty)</ref><ref>The Classic of Categories</ref><ref Name=APDB>{{cite web |title=Some Acupuncture Points Which Treat Disorders of Blood |author=Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji |url= http://www.acupuncture.com/education/theory/ptsforblood.htm |publisher=acupuncture.com}}</ref> Modern science-based medicine has shown that blood is propelled by pumping action of the heart, and that there are many more than 100 blood vessels, that the vessels do not gather at that or any specific point, and that blood doesn't fail to circulate except by failure of pumping by the heart, and does not pool or stagnate except when a vessel is physically blocked or the heart pumping is disrupted.--->

=== TCM concept of disease ===
{{Main|Traditional Chinese medicine#Concept of disease}}

In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin, yang]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#TCM model of the body|qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians]] etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiseman & Ellis|1996|page=77}}</ref> Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Ergil | first = MC | last2 = Ergil | first2 = KV | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&pg=PA19 19], [http://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&pg=PA148 148] | title = Pocket Atlas of Chinese Medicine | year = 2009 | publisher = Thieme | location = Stuttgart | isbn = 9783131416117}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Flaws | first = B | coauthors =Finney D | year = 2007 | title = A handbook of TCM patterns & their treatments | edition = 6th | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&pg=PA1 1] }}</ref> In the case of the meridians, typical disease patterns are invasions with [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|wind, cold and damp Excesses]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Flaws |first1=B |last2=Finney |first2= D | title = A handbook of TCM patterns & their treatments | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | year = 1996 | edition = 6 (2007) |isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&pg=PA169#v=onepage&q&f=false 169–173] }}</ref>

In order to determine which [[Traditional chinese medicine#Patterns|pattern]] is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref name = Tongue>{{cite book | title = Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine | last = Maciocia | first = G  | publisher = Eastland Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 093961619X }}</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book | first = G | last = Maciocia | title = The Foundations of Chinese Medicine | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | year = 2005 | isbn = 0443074895 }}</ref>

=== Traditional diagnosis ===
The acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition which he or she uses. In TCM, there are four diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation.<ref>[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.</ref>

*Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.
*Auscultation and olfaction refer, respectively, to listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing) and attending to body odor.
*Inquiring focuses on the "seven inquiries", which are chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].
*Palpation includes feeling the body for tender [[Acupuncture#Qi, meridians and acupuncture points|A-shi points]], and palpation of the left and right radial pulses.

==== Tongue and pulse ====
Examination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in TCM. Certain sectors of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the zàng-fŭ. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the liver.<ref name = Tongue/>

Pulse palpation involves measuring the pulse at a superficial and at a deep level at three locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for 12 pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain zàng-fŭ.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like "floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick". Each of these qualities indicate certain [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|disease patterns]]. Learning TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wright, Thomas; Eisenberg, David |title=Encounters with Qi: exploring Chinese medicine |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1995 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=DgFA-kVkuZEC&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=false 53–4]|isbn=0393312135 |oclc= }}</ref>

==Scientific view on TCM theory==

[[File:Archie McPhee acupuncture.jpg|thumb|Modern acupuncture model]]

According to the 1997 [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] consensus statement on acupuncture:<ref name="NIH-1997consensus"/>
{{quote|Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and physiology of the "acupuncture points", the definition and characterization of these points remains controversial. Even more elusive is the basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of qi, the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture.}}

Qi, yin, yang and meridians have no counterpart in modern studies of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physics]], or [[human physiology]] and to date scientists have been unable to find evidence that supports their existence.{{refn |group= n |name= "SinghErnst2008"}}<ref name="Ahn2008"/>

Similarly, no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians.{{refn |group= n |name= "SinghErnst2008"}}<ref name="Ahn2008"/> Especially the [[nervous system]] has been evaluated for a relationship to acupuncture points, but no structures have been clearly linked to them. The [[electrical resistance]] of acupuncture points and meridians have also been studied, with conflicting results.<ref name="Ahn2008" /> In general, research on the electrical activity of acupuncture points lacks a standardized methodology and reporting protocols, and is of poor quality.<ref name="pmid21440875">{{cite pmid | 21440875}}</ref>

Acupuncturist [[Felix Mann]], who is the author of the first comprehensive English language acupuncture textbook ''Acupuncture: The Ancient Chinese Art of Healing'',<ref name="Mann1972">{{cite book|author=Felix Mann|title=Acupuncture: the ancient Chinese art of healing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wq4UlSzY-7EC|accessdate=13 September 2012|year=1972|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=9780394717272}}</ref> has stated in lectures that "The traditional acupuncture points are no more real than the black spots a drunkard sees in front of his eyes"{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=14}} and "The meridians of acupuncture are no more real than the meridians of geography."{{sfn|Mann|2000|p=31}} In the same book, Mann also stated "Most of the ideas expressed in this book are based on clinical experience, careful observation and questions.

{{quote|A few Chinese scientists we met maintained that although Qi is merely a metaphor, it is still a useful physiological abstraction (''e.g.'', that the related concepts of [[yin and yang]] parallel modern scientific notions of endocrinologic {{sic}} and metabolic feedback mechanisms).

Their more hard-nosed colleagues quietly dismissed Qi as only a philosophy, bearing no tangible relationship to modern physiology and medicine.}}

== Clinical practice ==
[[File:Aiguille d acupuncture avec regle.dsc02265.untilted+cropped+WB.jpg|thumb|One type of acupuncture needle]]

In a modern acupuncture session, an initial consultation is followed by taking the pulse on both arms, and an inspection of the tongue. Classically, in clinical practice, acupuncture is highly individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on controlled scientific research.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Schwartz | first = L | url = http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html |journal = Medical Acupuncture | pages = 38–41 |year =2000 |volume=12 |issue=1 |title=Evidence-Based Medicine And Traditional Chinese Medicine: Not Mutually Exclusive}}</ref> In the United States, acupuncture typically lasts from 10 to 60 minutes, with [[diagnosis]] and treatment for a single session ranging from $25 to $80 in 2011.<ref name="acupuncture.com.au">{{cite web |title=What is involved in an Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Treatment? |publisher=acupuncture.com |url= http://www.acupuncture.com.au/education/theory/thefiveelements.html }}</ref> Sometimes needles are left in the ear for up to 3 days.<ref name="acupuncture.com.au"/>

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|upright|Acupuncture Needles]]
Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel wire. They are usually disposable, but reusable needles are sometimes used as well, though they must be sterilized between uses.<ref>{{cite book |author=Collinge, William J. |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0446672580 |oclc= }}</ref> Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|to|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in more fleshy areas; needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on}},<ref name = Aung116>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, p.

Apart from the usual filiform needle, there are also other needle types which can be utilized, such as three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.<ref name = Aung116/>  Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a technique adopted in China and the West).  [[Korea]]n acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.<ref name = Dummies>{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=b6_1FOwC_GYC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false 126–8] | title = Complementary Medicine For Dummies | last = Young | first = J | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0470519681 }}</ref>

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====
The skin is sterilized, e.g. with alcohol, and the needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, e.g. spun, flicked, or moved up and down relative to the skin.  Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.<ref name = Aung2007>[[#Aung2007|Aung & Chen]], 2007, p. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&pg=PA113#v=onepage&q&f=false 113-4].</ref>

Acupuncture can be painful.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11331060] The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.<ref name = Aung2007/>

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====
''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; "arrival of qi") refers to a sensation of [[paresthesia|numbness]], distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]]. If ''de-qi'' can not be generated, inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, or a very weak constitution of the patient have to be considered, all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment. If the ''de-qi'' sensation doesn't immediately occur upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it (such as "plucking", "shaking" or "trembling").<ref name="AungChen2007">{{cite book|author1=Steven Aung|author2=William Chen|title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|accessdate=20 September 2012|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9781588902214|page=116}}</ref>

Once ''de-qi'' is achieved, further techniques might be utilized which aim to "influence" the ''de-qi''; for example, by certain manipulation the ''de-qi'' sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body.<!---is this threading?---> Other techniques aim at "tonifying" ({{zh|s=补|p=bǔ}}) or "sedating" ({{zh|s=泄|p=xiè}}) qi.<ref name="AungChen2007"/> The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|deficiency]] patterns, the latter in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|excess]] patterns.<ref name="AungChen2007"/>

''De qi'' is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.<ref name = Dummies/>

It is difficult to design research trials for acupuncture.<ref name="pmid12184353"/> Due to acupuncture's invasive nature, one of the major challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate [[placebo]] [[control group]].<ref name="pmid12184353"/><ref name="pmid17265547"/><ref name="pmid16783282"/>
The most commonly proposed placebo control has been "sham acupuncture" to control for different aspects of traditional acupuncture. This includes needling sites not traditionally indicated for treatment of a specific condition to control for the effectiveness of traditional acupuncture for specific conditions and/or needling performed superficially or using retracting needles or non-needles (including toothpicks<ref>{{cite pmid | 19433697}}</ref>) to control for needle penetration and stimulation.

Available evidence covers the following conditions:

A 2012 meta-analysis found significant differences between true and sham acupuncture, which indicates that acupuncture is more than a placebo when treating chronic pain (even though the differences were modest).<ref name=Vickers2012/> However, [[Edzard Ernst]], emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, disagreed with the study's conclusions and commented that it demonstrated that the effects of acupuncture were principally due to placebo.{{refn|group=n|name="Alok2012"|In an article in The Guardian, Alok Jha stated:<ref>{{cite news| first = Alok | last = Jha | title = Acupuncture useful, but overall of little benefit, study shows | url = http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/10/acupuncture-useful-little-benefit-study| newspaper = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = September 10, 2012 | accessdate = October 31, 2013

{{quote|Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, said the study "impressively and clearly" showed that the effects of acupuncture were mostly due to placebo. "The differences between the results obtained with real and sham acupuncture are small and not clinically relevant. Crucially, they are probably due to residual bias in these studies. Several investigations have shown that the verbal or non-verbal communication between the patient and the therapist is more important than the actual needling. If such factors would be accounted for, the effect of acupuncture on chronic pain might disappear completely.}}}} A 2010 systematic review suggested that acupuncture is more than a placebo for commonly occurring chronic pain conditions, but the authors acknowledged that it is still unknown if the overall benefit is clinically meaningful or cost-effective.<ref name=Hopton>{{cite journal |author=Hopton A, MacPherson H |url=|title=Acupuncture for chronic pain: is acupuncture more than an effective placebo?

A 2009 review concluded that the specific points chosen to needle does not matter, and no difference was found between needling according to "true" points chosen by traditional acupuncture theory and "sham" acupuncture points unrelated to any theory.

Other authors have suggested randomized controlled trials may under-report the effectiveness of acupuncture as the "sham" treatment may still have active effects,<ref>{{cite pmid | 15905259 }}</ref> though this position undercuts the traditional theory of acupuncture which associates specific acupuncture points with specific and distinct results.<ref name="Langevin2011" />

A 2008 review examined [[randomized controlled trial]]s on the effects of the PC6 point, as well as points thought to rely on the same meridian, at preventing PONV within the first 24 hours of surgery. The reviewer concluded that "due to the lack of robust studies, [this review] found that neither acupressure nor acupuncture was effective in preventing or managing PONV in adults" and suggested further research to clarify issues such as the length and type of stimulation applied, training of those applying stimulation and gathering data, risk factors for PONV, inclusion of proper placebos, and the analysis of specific population.  The author also suggested disagreement with previous systemic reviews is due to their inclusion of older studies with poorer methodologies, while the more recent, better quality studies included in the review offered more negative results.<ref name = Abraham>{{cite pmid |19192550}}</ref>

=== Fertility and childbirth ===
A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found no benefit of adjuvant acupuncture for ''in vitro'' fertilization on clinical pregnancy success rates.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=23814102|year=2013|last1=Manheimer|first1=E|last2=Van Der Windt|first2=D|last3=Cheng|first3=K|last4=Stafford|first4=K|last5=Liu|first5=J|last6=Tierney|first6=J|last7=Lao|first7=L|last8=Berman|first8=BM|last9=Langenberg|first9=P|last10=Bouter|first10=LM|title=The effects of acupuncture on rates of clinical pregnancy among women undergoing in vitro fertilization: A systematic review and meta-analysis|volume=19|issue=6|pages=696–713|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmt026|pmc=3796945|journal=Human reproduction update}}</ref>

=== Lack of evidence for other conditions ===
The Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicines has a fully updated list of all the Cochrane Collaboration regarding acupuncture and the overall conclusion is:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vifab.dk/uk/cochrane+and+alternative+medicine/acupuncture? | title = Cochrane and Alternative Medicine – Acupuncture | publisher = Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicines | accessdate = 2011-10-19 | date = 2011-09-28 }}</ref>

{{quote|...the majority of the Cochrane reviews about acupuncture, acupressure, electroacupuncture and moxibustion [concluded] there exists no solid evidence to determine the effectiveness of the treatments. The reviews point out that many of the studies suffer from methodological defects and shortcomings. Furthermore, the number of trial subjects has been limited. Thus most of the overall conclusions are uncertain.}}

For the following conditions, the Cochrane Collaboration or other review articles have concluded there is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is beneficial, often because of the paucity and poor quality of the research, and that further research is needed:

A 2013 systematic review of English-language case reports found that serious [[adverse events]] associated with acupuncture are rare, but acupuncture is not without risk.<ref name="Xu S" /> Between 2000 and 2011, the incidence of English-language reported adverse events was 294 cases from 25 countries and regions.<ref name="Xu S" /> The most common adverse effect observed was infection, and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site.<ref name="Xu S" /> Other adverse complications include bilateral hand [[edema]], [[epithelioid granuloma]], [[pseudolymphoma]], [[argyria]], pustules, [[pancytopenia]], and scarring due to hot needle technique.<ref name="Xu S">{{cite journal |title=Adverse Events of Acupuncture: A Systematic Review of Case Reports |author=Xu, Shifen, et al. |journal=Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume= 2013|year=2013 |pmid=23573135 |doi=10.1155/2013/581203 |pmc=3616356 |pages=581203}}</ref> When acupuncture needles are contaminated, risk of bacterial or other blood-borne infection increases, as with re-use of any type of needle.<ref name="Doibmjc">{{cite journal |last1=Woo |first1=P.

A 2010 systematic review of the Chinese literature found numerous acupuncture related adverse events including pneumothorax, fainting, [[subarachnoid haemorrhage]], and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid haemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral haemorrhage as the most serious, most of which were due to improper technique.<ref name=Zhang-2010/> Between 1980 and 2009, the incidence of Chinese literature reported adverse events was 479 cases.<ref name=Zhang-2010>{{cite journal |author=Zhang J, Shang H, Gao X, Ernst E |title=Acupuncture-related adverse events: a systematic review of the Chinese literature |journal=Bull World Health Organ |volume=88 |issue=12|pages=915–921C |year=2010 |month=December |pmid=21124716 |doi=10.2471/BLT.10.076737 |pmc=2995190}}</ref> The same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners, but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks.<ref name=Zhang-2010 />

A 2008 review of the Japanese literature found that although it may have been underreported, serious adverse events are rare when preformed by trained acupuncturists.<ref name="Yamashita" /> Between the 1980s and 2002, the incidence of Japanese-language reported adverse events was 150.<ref name="Yamashita" /> The most common adverse event was pneumothorax.<ref name="Yamashita" /> Various kinds of infections including two deaths have been reported, but the causal relationship is not clear in the majority of cases.<ref name="Yamashita">{{cite pmid | 18955234}}</ref>

* According to several public health insurance organizations, women comprise over two-thirds of all acupuncture users in [[Germany]].<ref name="accupuncture-rponline"/> After the results of the [[German Acupuncture Trials]] were published in 2007, the number of regular users of acupuncture jumped by 20%, surpassing one million in 2011.<ref name="accupuncture-rponline">{{cite web|title=Frauen häufiger mit Akupunktur behandelt|url=http://www.rp-online.de/gesundheit/medizin-und-vorsorge/frauen-haeufiger-mit-akupunktur-behandelt-1.2973239|publisher=''[[Rheinische Post]]''|accessdate=25 May 2013|language=German}}</ref>

=== Government agencies ===
In 2006, the NIH's [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] stated that it continued to abide by the pro-acupuncture recommendations of the 1997 NIH consensus statement, even if research is still unable to explain its mechanism.<ref name="NCCAM2006-Acupuncture">{{cite web |title=Acupuncture |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/ |publisher=US [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-03-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060208042446/http://nccam.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/| archivedate= 8 February 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In its 1997 statement, the NIH had concluded that despite research on acupuncture being difficult to conduct, there was sufficient evidence to encourage further study and expand its use.<ref name="NIH-1997consensus"/> The consensus statement and conference that produced it were criticized by Wallace Sampson, founder of the ''[[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]]'', writing for an affiliated publication of [[Quackwatch]] who stated the meeting was chaired by a strong proponent of acupuncture and failed to include speakers who had obtained negative results on studies of acupuncture.  Sampson also stated he believed the report showed evidence of pseudoscientific reasoning.<ref name = QuackwatchSampson>{{cite web | url = http://www.acuwatch.org/general/nihcritique.shtml | last = Sampson | first = W | title = Critique of the NIH Consensus Conference on Acupuncture | publisher = [[Quackwatch]] | accessdate = 2009-06-05 | date = 2005-03-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090606155216/http://www.acuwatch.org/general/nihcritique.shtml| archivedate= 6 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The [[National Health Service]] of the United Kingdom states that at the present, no definite conclusions regarding acupuncture efficacy can be drawn, citing disagreement among scientists "over the way acupuncture trials should be carried out and over what their results mean".<ref name="NHS_ev">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Acupuncture/Pages/Evidence.aspx |title=Acupuncture: Evidence for its effectiveness |accessdate=2010-08-10 |date=2010-03-18 |publisher=[[National Health Service]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100814054900/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Acupuncture/Pages/Evidence.aspx| archivedate= 14 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== International organizations ===
In 2003, the [[World Health Organization]]'s Department of Essential Drugs and Medicine Policy produced a report on acupuncture.  The report was drafted, revised and updated by Zhu-Fan Xie, the Director for the Institute of Integrated Medicines of [[Peking University Health Science Center|Beijing Medical University]].  It contained, based on research results available in early 1999, a list of diseases, symptoms or conditions for which it was believed acupuncture had been demonstrated as an effective treatment, as well as a second list of conditions that were possibly able to be treated with acupuncture.  Noting the difficulties of conducting controlled research and the debate on how to best conduct research on acupuncture, the report described itself as "...intended to facilitate research on and the evaluation and application of acupuncture. It is hoped that it will provide a useful resource for researchers, health care providers, national health authorities and the general public."<ref name="WHO 2003.3">{{cite web |title=Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2003 |last=World Health Organization |editor=Zhang X | url = http://www.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4926e/#Js4926e.5 }}</ref>  The coordinator for the team that produced the report, Xiaorui Zhang, stated that the report was designed to facilitate research on acupuncture, not recommend treatment for specific diseases.<ref name=" Lancet_WHO_2005">{{cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |title=Critics slam draft WHO report on homoeopathy |journal=The Lancet |volume=366 |pages=705–6 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67159-0 |issue=9487}}</ref>  The report was controversial; critics assailed it as being problematic since, in spite of the disclaimer, supporters used it to claim that the WHO endorsed acupuncture and other alternative medicine practices that were either pseudoscientific or lacking sufficient evidence-basis.  Medical scientists expressed concern that the evidence supporting acupuncture outlined in the report was weak, and [[Wim Betz|Willem Betz]] of SKEPP (Studie Kring voor Kritische Evaluatie van Pseudowetenschap en het Paranormale, the Study Circle for the Critical Evaluation of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal) said that the report was evidence that the "WHO has been infiltrated by missionaries for [[alternative medicine]]".<ref name=" Lancet_WHO_2005"/> The WHO 2005 report was also criticized in the 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' for, in addition to being produced by a panel that included no critics of acupuncture at all, containing two major errors – including too many results from low-quality [[clinical trial]]s, and including a large number of trials originating in China where, probably due to publication bias, no negative trials have ever been produced. In contrast, studies originating in [[Western culture|the West]] include a mixture of positive, negative and neutral results. Ernst and Singh, the authors of the book, described the report as "highly misleading", a "shoddy piece of work that was never rigorously scrutinized" and stated that the results of high-quality clinical trials do not support the use of acupuncture to treat anything but pain and nausea.<ref name = "TorT277">[[#Singh2008|Singh & Ernst]], 2008, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&pg=PA277 277-8].</ref>  Ernst also described the statement in a 2006 peer reviewed article as "Perhaps the most obviously over-optimistic overview [of acupuncture]", noting that of the 35 conditions that the WHO stated acupuncture was effective for, 27 of the systematic reviews that the WHO report was based on found that acupuncture was not effective for treating the specified condition.<ref name = "Ernst2006"/>

On November 16, 2010, acupuncture and moxibustion were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as part of the world's [[intangible cultural heritage]].<ref name="UNESCO"/>

Brent Bauer comments on the Mayo Clinic website that it "it may be worth trying acupuncture" if other, more conventional treatments haven't helped in the treatment of low back pain, while noting that there was no difference in effectiveness between sham and real accupuncture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/acupuncture-for-back-pain/AN02055|publisher=Mayo Clinic|title=Acupuncture for back pain?|last=Bauer|first=Brent A.}}</ref>

In 1997, the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs stated:
{{quote|Critics contend that acupuncturists, including many traditionally trained physicians, merely stick needles in patients as a way to offer another form of treatment for which they can be reimbursed, since many insurance companies will do so. Critical reviews of acupuncture summarized by Hafner and others conclude that no evidence exists that acupuncture affects the course of any disease...Much of the information currently known about these therapies makes it clear that many have not been shown to be efficacious. Well-designed, stringently controlled research should be done to evaluate the efficacy of alternative therapies.<ref>{{cite web| title=Report 12 of the Council on Scientific Affairs (A-97) – Alternative Medicine |url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/no-index/about-ama/13638.shtml |publisher=American Medical Association |year=1997| accessdate=2009-10-07 }}</ref>}}

The [[National Council Against Health Fraud]] stated in 1990 that acupuncture’s "theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=National Council Against Health Fraud |title=Position Paper on Acupuncture |year=1990 |url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/acu.html |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref>

===Skeptics===
The 1993 book ''The Health Robbers'', neurologist Arthur Taub called acupuncture "nonsense with needles."<ref>{{cite book |title=Acupuncture: Nonsense with Needles |author=Arthur Taub |year=1993 |url=http://www.acuwatch.org/general/taub.shtml}}</ref> [[Quackwatch]] criticizes TCM as having unproven efficacy and an unsound scientific basis.<ref name="Quackwatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/acu.html |author=Stephen Barrett, M.D. |title=Be Wary of Acupuncture, Qigong, and "Chinese Medicine" |accessdate=2010-05-31| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100501054506/http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/acu.html| archivedate= 1 May 2010}}</ref> Psychologist John Jackson stated that, "Acupuncture, both as a field of study and in practise, contains many of the hallmarks of pseudoscience. It is based on untenable principles and the small amount of evidence there is to support its use in pain relief can also be called into question."<ref>{{cite web |title=What is acupuncture? |author=John Jackson |url=http://www.rationalinquiry.org.uk/acupuncture.php}}</ref> [[Steven Salzberg]], director of the [[Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology]] and professor at the [[University of Maryland]] stated that, "acupuncture is pseudoscience. It’s based on magical thinking about a non-existent "life force" that has never had one whit of evidence to support it. The only benefits are placebo effects, as the sham acupuncture experiments demonstrate. The notion of "meridians" that can be somehow fixed by sticking needles into the skin is laughable".<ref>{{cite web |title=Acupuncture infiltrates the University of Maryland and NEJM |author=Steven Salzberg |year=2008 |url=http://genome.fieldofscience.com/2010/08/acupuncture-infiltrates-university-of.html }}</ref> [[Steven Novella]], [[Yale University]] professor of neurology, and founder and executive editor of the blog ''Science Based Medicine'' commenting on acupuncture, said "there has been recent controversy over the role of the placebo effect in ethical and evidence-based practice. This is, in my opinion, largely a back door attempt to justify CAM treatments that do not work. The claim is that placebo effects are real and useful".<ref>{{cite web |title=Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine |author=Steven Novella |authorlink=Steven Novella |url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391 }}</ref>
