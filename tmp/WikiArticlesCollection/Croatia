'''Croatia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Croatia.ogg|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}} {{respell|kroh|AY|shə}}; {{lang-hr|Hrvatska}} {{IPA-sh|xř̩ʋaːtskaː|pron}}), officially the '''Republic of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Republika Hrvatska}} {{Audio|Republika_Hrvatska.ogg|listen}}), is a unitary democratic [[parliamentary republic]] at the crossroads of [[Central Europe]], [[Southern Europe]], and the [[Mediterranean]]. Its [[capital (political)|capital]] and [[List of cities in Croatia|largest city]] is [[Zagreb]]. The country is divided into [[Counties of Croatia|20 counties]] and the city of Zagreb. Croatia covers {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and has diverse, mostly [[Continental climate|continental]] and [[Mediterranean climate]]s. Croatia's [[Adriatic Sea]] coast contains [[List of islands of Croatia|more than a thousand islands]]. The country's population is 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Croats]], with the most common religious denomination being [[Roman Catholicism]].  Croatia became the 28th member state of the [[European Union]] 1 July 2013.

The Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century. They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925 AD, elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries, reaching its peak during the rule of [[Kings of Croatia|Kings]] [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Peter Krešimir IV]] and [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Dmitar Zvonimir]]. Croatia entered a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]] the [[Parliament on Cetin|Croatian Parliament]] elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg]] to the Croatian throne. In 1918, after [[World War I]], Croatia was included in the unrecognised [[State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]] which seceded from [[Austria–Hungary]] and merged into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. A [[Independent State of Croatia|fascist Croatian puppet state]] existed during [[World War II]]. After the war, Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Second Yugoslavia]], a [[socialist state]]. In June 1991, Croatia declared [[Independence of Croatia|independence]], which came into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration.

Croatia today has a very high [[Human Development Index]]. The [[International Monetary Fund]] classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the [[World Bank]] identified it as a [[high income economy]]. Croatia is a member of the [[European Union]], [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[International Security Assistance Force|NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] for the 2008–2009 term.

The [[service sector]] dominates Croatia's economy, followed by the [[industrial sector]] and [[agriculture]]. [[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a significant source of revenue during the summer, with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important [[international trade|trading partner]]. Since 2000, the Croatian government has invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]]. Internal sources produce a significant portion of [[energy in Croatia]]; the rest is imported. Croatia provides a [[universal health care]] system and free [[Education in Croatia|primary and secondary education]], while supporting [[Culture of Croatia|culture]] through numerous public institutions and through corporate investments in [[Media of Croatia|media]] and [[Croatian literature|publishing]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Greda i zabat s natpisom kneza Branimira 879.jpg|thumb|left|[[Branimir Inscription]]]]
The [[name of Croatia]] derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Croātia'', from ''Dux Croatorum'' ("Duke of Croatians") attested in the [[Branimir Inscription]], itself a derivation of [[North-West Slavic]] ''*Xrovat-'', by [[liquid metathesis]] from proposed [[Common Slavic]] period ''*Xorvat-'', from proposed [[Proto-Slavic]] ''*Xarwāt-'' (''*Xъrvatъ'') or ''*Xŭrvatŭ'' (''*xъrvatъ'').<ref name="Gluhak-1993">{{cite book|author=Alemko Gluhak|title=Hrvatski etimološki rječnik|trans_title=Croatian Etymological Dictionary|language=Croatian|publisher=August Cesarec|year=1993|isbn=953-162-000-8}}</ref>

The origin of the name is uncertain, but is thought to be a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] term assigned to a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic tribe]].<ref name="KU-Greenberg">{{cite web| publisher=[[University of Kansas]]| author= Marc L.

The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]] from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved—leading to doubts on the authenticity of the claim.<ref name="Mužić-27">Mužić (2007), p. 27</ref> The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription (found near [[Benkovac]]), where Duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]] is styled as ''Dux Cruatorvm''.

The [[ethnogenesis]] of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories, ''Slavic'' and ''Iranian'' being the most frequently put forward.

Conversely, the ''Iranian'' theory proposes [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin, based on [[Tanais Tablets]] containing [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription of given names ''Χορούαθ[ος]'', ''Χοροάθος'' and ''Χορόαθος'' (Khoroúathos, Khoroáthos, and Khoróathos) and their interpretation as [[anthroponym]]s of Croatian people.<ref name="Nikšić-Heršak">{{cite journal|journal=Migracijske i etničke teme|issn= 1333-2546|publisher=Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies|year=2007|month=September|volume=23|issue=3|pages=251–268|author1=Emil Heršak|author2=Boris Nikšić|language=Croatian|title=Hrvatska etnogeneza: pregled komponentnih etapa i interpretacija (s naglaskom na euroazijske/nomadske sadržaje)|trans_title=Croatian Ethnogenesis: A Review of Component Stages and Interpretations (with Emphasis on Eurasian/Nomadic Elements) | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=28729&lang=en}}</ref>

Following the decisive Ottoman victories, Croatia was split into civilian and military territories, with the partition formed in 1538. The military territories would become known as the [[Croatian Military Frontier]] and were under direct Imperial control. [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman advance]]s in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 [[Battle of Sisak]], the first decisive Ottoman defeat, and stabilisation of borders.<ref name="frucht422"/>

During the [[Great Turkish War]] (1667–1698), [[Slavonia]] was regained but western [[Bosnia]], which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest, remained outside Croatian control.<ref name="frucht422"/> The present-day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome. [[Dalmatia]], the southern part of the border, was similarly defined by the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Fifth]] and the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)|Seventh Ottoman–Venetian War]]s.<ref name=Lane409>Lane (1973), p. 409</ref>

The [[Croatian–Ottoman Wars|Ottoman wars]] instigated great demographic changes. Croats migrated towards [[Austria]] and the present-day [[Burgenland Croats]] are direct descendants of these settlers.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Cultural Association in Burgenland|url=http://www.hkd.at/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=61&Itemid=102&lang=hr|language=Croatian|title=Povijest Gradišćanskih Hrvatov|trans_title=History of Burgenland Croats|accessdate=17 October 2011|archivedate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69Qku2uNT}}</ref> To replace the fleeing population the Habsburgs encouraged the [[Christian]] populations of Bosnia and [[Serbia]] to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier.

Between 1797 and 1809 the [[First French Empire]] gradually occupied the entire eastern [[Adriatic]] coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland, ending the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]n republics, establishing the [[Illyrian Provinces]].<ref name="frucht422"/> In response the [[Royal Navy]] started the [[Adriatic campaign of 1807–1814|blockade of the Adriatic Sea]] leading to the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Vis]] in 1811.<ref name="Adkins359-362">Adkins, pp. 359–362</ref> The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the [[Austrian Empire]] following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.

The 1830s and 1840s saw [[romantic nationalism]] inspire the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]], a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of all [[South Slavs]] in the empire.

By the 1860s, failure of the policy became apparent, leading to the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and creation of a [[personal union]] between the crowns of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatia topo.jpg|thumb|450px|A topographic map of Croatia]]
Croatia is located in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe]], bordering [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to the southeast,  [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the southwest and [[Slovenia]] to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]] and longitudes [[13th meridian east|13°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]]. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding [[Dubrovnik]] is a [[practical exclave]] connected to the rest of the mainland by [[territorial waters]], but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around [[Neum]].<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/>

The territory covers {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}, consisting of {{convert|56414|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} of land and {{convert|128|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} of water. It is the 127th largest country in the world.<ref name="CIA"/> Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Dinaric Alps]] with the highest point of the [[Dinara]] peak at {{convert|1831|m|ft|abbr=off}} near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south<ref name="CIA"/> to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border. Insular Croatia consists of over [[List of islands of Croatia|a thousand islands and islets]] varying in size, 48 of which are [[List of inhabited islands of Croatia|permanently inhabited]]. The largest islands are [[Cres]] and [[Krk]],<ref name="CIA"/> each of them having an area of around {{convert|405|km2|abbr=off}}.

The hilly northern parts of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and the flat plains of [[Slavonia]] in the east (which is part of the [[Pannonian Basin]]) are traversed by major rivers such as [[Sava]], [[Drava]], [[Kupa]] and [[Danube]]. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of [[Vukovar]] in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt and hydropower.<ref name="CIA"/>

[[Karst topography]] makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geografija.hr/clanci/1011/rasirenost-krsa-u-hrvatskoj|title=Raširenost krša u Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Presence of Karst in Croatia|language=Croatian|publisher=Croatian Geographic Society|date=18 December 2006|author=Mate Matas|accessdate=18 October 2011|work=geografija.hr|archivedate=8 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69lbXToZS}}</ref> There are [[List of caves in Croatia|a number of deep caves in Croatia]], 49 of which are deeper than {{convert|250|m|2|abbr=on}}, 14 of them deeper than {{convert|500|m|2|abbr=on}} and three deeper than {{convert|1000|m|2|abbr=on}}. Croatia's most famous lakes are the [[Plitvice Lakes National Park|Plitvice lakes]], a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over [[dolomite]] and [[limestone]] cascades. The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours, ranging from turquoise to mint green, grey or blue.<ref name="BBC-Plitvice">{{cite web|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110617-the-best-national-parks-of-europe|title=The best national parks of Europe|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=11 October 2011|archivedate=4 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69fOQEt30}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:2005 1031Image0011.jpg|thumb|[[Plitvice Lakes National Park]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].]]
Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy [[continental climate]] as defined by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|-3|°C|°F|lk=on}} (in January) and {{convert|18|°C|°F|lk=off}} (in July). The coldest parts of the country are [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by the [[Mediterranean climate]], as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas—the lowest temperature of {{convert|-35.5|°C|°F|lk=off}} was recorded on 3 February 1919 in [[Čakovec]], and the highest temperature of {{convert|42.4|°C|°F|lk=off}} was recorded on 5 July 1950 in [[Karlovac]].<ref name="DZS-Stat2010">{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]]|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2010/SLJH2010.pdf|format= PDF|title=2010 – Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia|month=December|year=2010|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>

Mean annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off}} and {{convert|3500|mm|in|abbr=off}} depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Vis, [[Lastovo]], [[Biševo]], [[Svetac]]) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia, however in the latter case, it is mostly occurring during the [[growing season]]. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar.<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/>

Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as [[Bora (wind)|bura]] or less frequently as [[sirocco]]. The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and [[Korčula]], where more than 2700&nbsp;hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2000&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.<ref name="DZS-Stat2010"/>

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Protected areas of Croatia}}
[[File:Kopacki rit2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kopački Rit]] nature park, one of the largest [[wetlands]] in Europe]]
Croatia can be subdivided between a number of [[ecoregion]]s because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are [[karst]] habitats which include submerged karst, such as [[Zrmanja]] and [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats. The karst geology harbours approximately [[List of caves in Croatia|7,000 caves and pits]], some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave [[vertebrate]]—the [[olm]]. Forests are also significantly present in the country, as they cover {{convert|2490000|ha|abbr=off}} representing 44% of Croatian land surface. The other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity">{{cite book|publisher=State Institute for Nature Protection, [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)]]|format=PDF|url=http://www.dzzp.hr/dokumenti_upload/20120515/dzzp201205151608230.pdf|title=Biodiversity of Croatia|year= 2006|editor=Jasminka Radović|editor2=Kristijan Čivić|editor3= Ramona Topić|isbn=953-7169-20-0|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>

In terms of [[phytogeography]], Croatia is a part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and the Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]]. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Illyrian deciduous forests]].<ref name="DU-Sustdev">{{cite web|publisher=6th Dubrovnik Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems|url=http://www.dubrovnik2011.sdewes.org/venue.php|title=Venue|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Karstformationen Nationalpark-Nord-Velebit.JPG|thumb|[[Karst]] in [[National Park Sjeverni Velebit]].]]
There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of [[invertebrate]]s discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s (decade) alone.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>

The most serious threat to species is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by appearance of invasive alien species, especially ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]'' algae. The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the [[Benthic zone|benthic habitat]]. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>

There are 444 [[protected areas of Croatia]], encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks]], two strict reserves, and ten [[nature park]]s. The most famous protected area and the oldest [[national park]] in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a [[World Heritage Sites in Croatia|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]]. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the [[Natura 2000]] network.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>

Traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced [[oblast]]s and [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] respectively.<ref name="frucht429-429">Frucht 2005, pp. 429–429</ref>

Communist ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-WWII Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions: In 1918, the [[Transleithania]]n part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in [[Bjelovar]], [[Gospić]], [[Ogulin]], [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]], [[Vukovar]], [[Varaždin]], [[Osijek]] and Zagreb, and the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory.<ref name="biondich11">Biondich 2000, p. 11</ref><ref name="CountiesAct1992">{{cite news |newspaper=[[Narodne novine]] |date=30 December 1992 |accessdate=9 September 2011 |language=Croatian |title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj |trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act |url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html}}</ref>

Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of the counties changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 [[List of cities in Croatia|cities]] and 429 [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]].<ref name="CountiesAct2006">{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne novine|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=9 September 2011|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans_title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_07_86_2045.html}}</ref> [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) [[NUTS of Croatia|division of Croatia]] is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb, Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci and Međimurje counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS [[Local administrative unit]] divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/heritage/cemat/confminist1-15/15eCEMAT_National_Report_Croatia_2010_HR.pdf|title=Nacionalno izviješće Hrvatska|trans_title=Croatia National Report|month=January|year=2010|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>

===Military===
{{Main|Military of Croatia}}

Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) consist of the [[Croatian Army|Army]], [[Croatian Navy|Navy]] and [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Air Force]] branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia|General Staff]], which reports to the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Defence Minister]], who in turn reports to the President of Croatia. According to the constitution, the President is [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff.<ref name="CAFstructure">{{cite web|url=http://www.osrh.hr/prikaz_en.asp?idi=100&kati=2|title=Chain of Command in the CAF|publisher=Croatian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>

Following the 1991–95 war defence spending and CAF size have been in constant decline. As of 2005 military spending was an estimated 2.39% of the country's [[GDP]], which placed Croatia 64th in a ranking of all countries.<ref name="CIA">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hr.html|title=World Factbook|accessdate=9 September 2011|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}</ref> Since 2005 the budget was kept below 2% of GDP, down from the record high of 11.1% in 1994.<ref name="sipri">{{cite web|url=http://milexdata.sipri.org/|title=SIPRI Military Expenditure Database|publisher=[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]|accessdate=9 September 2011}}</ref> Traditionally relying on a large number of conscripts, CAF also went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing, restructuring and [[professionalisation]] in the years prior to [[Accession of Croatia to NATO|Croatia's accession to NATO]] in April 2009. According to a presidential decree issued in 2006 the CAF is set to employ 18,100 active duty military personnel, 3,000 civilians and 2,000 voluntary conscripts between the ages of 18 and 30 in peacetime.<ref name="CAFstructure"/>

Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008.<ref name="CIA"/> Until 2008 military service was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine-month conscription tours. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight-month civilian service.<ref name="vojnirokkraci">{{cite news|url=http://www.monitor.hr/clanci/vojni-rok-u-hrvatskoj-kraci-nego-drugdje-u-europi-i-nato-u/11191/|title=Vojni rok u Hrvatskoj kraći, nego drugdje u Europi i NATO-u|author=Milan Jelovac|date=23 January 2001|newspaper=Vjesnik|language=Croatian|accessdate=9 September 2011}}</ref>

[[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual tourist industry income for 2011 was estimated at €6.61&nbsp;billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment.
