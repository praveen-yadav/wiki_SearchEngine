'''Southeast Alaska''', sometimes referred to as the '''Alaska Panhandle''', is the southeastern portion of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alaska]], which lies west from the northern half of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]], [[British Columbia]]. The majority of Southeast Alaska's area is part of the [[Tongass National Forest]], the United States' largest [[United States National Forest|national forest]]. In many places, the [[international border]] runs along the crest of the [[Boundary Ranges]] of the [[Coast Mountains]] (see [[Alaska boundary dispute]]). The region is noted for its scenery and mild rainy climate.

==Geography==
Southeast Alaska is the northern terminus of the [[Inside Passage]], a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in [[Puget Sound]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. This was an important travel corridor for [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] and [[Haida people|Haida]] Native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. In modern times it is an important route for [[Alaska Marine Highway]] ferries as well as [[cruise ship]]s.  
Southeast Alaska has a land area of {{convert|35138|sqmi|sqkm}}{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} comprising six entire [[county-equivalent|borough]]s and three [[census area]]s, in addition to the portion of the [[Yakutat City and Borough, Alaska|Yakutat Borough]] lying east of [[141st meridian west|141° West]] longitude. Although it has only 6.14 percent of Alaska's land area, it is larger than the state of [[Maine]], and almost as large as the state of [[Indiana]]. The Southeast Alaskan coast is roughly as long as the [[British Columbia Coast|west coast]] of Canada. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] population of Southeast was 72,954 inhabitants, about 42 percent of whom were concentrated in the city of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]].

It includes the [[Tongass National Forest]], [[Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Admiralty Island National Monument]], [[Misty Fjords National Monument]], [[Alaska's Inside Passage]], and myriad large and small islands. The largest islands are, from North to South, [[Chichagof Island]], [[Admiralty Island]], [[Baranof Island]], [[Kupreanof Island]], [[Revillagigedo Island]] and [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]. Major bodies of water of Southeast Alaska include [[Glacier Bay]], [[Lynn Canal]], [[Icy Strait]], [[Chatham Strait]], [[Stephens Passage]], [[Frederick Sound]], [[Sumner Strait]], and [[Clarence Strait]].

On August 20, 1902, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] established the [[Alexander Archipelago Forest Reserve]], which formed the heart of the [[Tongass National Forest|Tongass]] [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] that covers most of the region.

==Ecology==
Southeast Alaska is a [[temperate rain forest]] within the [[Pacific temperate rain forest]] zone, as classified by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[ecoregion]] system, which extends from northern [[California]] to [[Prince William Sound]]. The most common tree species are [[sitka spruce]] and [[western hemlock]].
Wildlife includes [[brown bear]]s, [[American Black Bear|black bears]], the endemic [[Alexander Archipelago Wolf|Alexander Archipelago wolf]], [[black-tailed deer|Sitka black-tailed deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[orca]]s, five species of [[salmon]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[harlequin duck]]s, [[scoter]]s, and [[Marbled Murrelet|marbled murrelet]]s.

==Cities and towns==
Major cities are [[Juneau City and Borough, Alaska|Juneau]], [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], and [[Sitka City and Borough, Alaska|Sitka]]. Other towns are [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Wrangell, Alaska|Wrangell]], [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]], [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hoonah, Alaska|Hoonah]], [[Angoon, Alaska|Angoon]], [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]], [[Craig, Alaska|Craig]], [[Klawock, Alaska|Klawock]], [[Thorne Bay, Alaska|Thorne Bay]], [[Yakutat, Alaska|Yakutat]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], and [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]]. There are also many towns and villages with +/- 100 people, such as [[Baranof Warm Springs, Alaska|Baranof Warm Springs]], [[Edna Bay, Alaska|Edna Bay]], [[Elfin Cove, Alaska|Elfin Cove]], [[Excursion Inlet, Alaska|Excursion Inlet]], [[Funter Bay, Alaska|Funter Bay]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]], [[Meyers Chuck, Alaska|Meyers Chuck]], [[Pelican, Alaska|Pelican]], [[Port Alexander, Alaska|Port Alexander]], [[Port Frederick, Alaska|Port Frederick]], [[Port Protection, Alaska|Port Protection]], and [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]].

==Culture==
[[File:Raventotemsitka.jpg|thumb|right|Totem pole at [[Sitka National Historical Park]]]]
This area is the traditional homeland of the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] people, and home of a historic settling of [[Haida people|Haida]] as well as a modern settlement of [[Tsimshian]]. The region is closely connected to [[Seattle]] and the American [[Pacific Northwest]] economically and culturally.

In modern times, southeastern Alaskans can often be identified by their fashion choices, notably
[[Xtratuf]] boots, and "shirtjacs" (a garment having aspects of both [[shirt]] and [[jacket]]).

==Industry==
Major industries in Southeast Alaska include [[commercial fishing]] and [[tourism]] (primarily the cruise ship industry).  [[Logging]] has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the region's major pulp mills.

==History==
The border between the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] and Alaska is known as the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], where the United States, Canada and the [[United Kingdom]] and British Columbia claimed different borderlines at the Alaskan Panhandle. While the British foreign affairs were in favour of support of the Canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to [[Alaska_boundary_dispute#Canadian_controversy|alienation of the British]] from the new nation of Canada.

==Transportation==
Due to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities (with the exception of Hyder, Skagway, and Haines) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] passes through this region.

===Air transportation===
[[Alaska Airlines]] is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneau's [[Juneau International Airport]] serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikan's [[Ketchikan International Airport]] serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. Alaska's [[Alaska Bush|bush]] airlines and [[air taxi]]s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions.

===Marine transportation===
Southeast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run Alaska Marine Highway and secondarily by the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]]-based [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]]. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the [[Lynn Canal]] occasionally also offer marine passenger service. Ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with [[cruise ship]]s.
