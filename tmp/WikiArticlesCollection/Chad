'''Chad''' ({{lang-ar|{{big|تشاد}}}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Tšād}}''; {{lang-fr|Tchad}} {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Chad.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|æ|d}}), officially the '''Republic of Chad''', is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Libya]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the east, the [[Central African Republic]] to the south, [[Cameroon]] and [[Nigeria]] to the southwest, and [[Niger]] to the west.

Chad is divided into multiple regions: a [[desert]] zone in the north, an arid [[Sahel]]ian belt in the centre and a more fertile [[Sudan (region)|Sudanese]] [[savanna]] zone in the south. [[Lake Chad]], after which the country is named, is the largest [[wetland]] in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. Chad's highest peak is the [[Emi Koussi]] in the [[Sahara]], and [[N'Djamena]], (formerly ''Fort-Lamy''), the capital, is the largest city. Chad is home to over 200 different [[List of ethnic groups in Chad|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Chad|linguistic groups]]. [[Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] are the official languages. [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are the most widely practiced religions.

Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium BC, a series of states and empires rose and fell in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region. France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]]. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of [[François Tombalbaye]]. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting [[The Tombalbaye Regime#Rebellion in Chad|civil war]] in 1965. In 1978, [[Transitional Government of National Unity|the rebels]] conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until [[Hissène Habré]] defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general [[Idriss Déby]]. Since 2003, the [[Darfur conflict|Darfur crisis]] in Sudan has spilt over the border and [[War in Chad (2005–present)|destabilised the nation]], with hundreds of thousands of [[Sudanese refugees]] living in and around camps in eastern Chad.

Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] (see [[Battle of N'Djamena (2006)]] and [[Battle of N'Djamena (2008)]]). Chad is one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|poorest]] and [[Corruption Perceptions Index|most corrupt]] countries in the world; most inhabitants live in poverty as [[Agriculture in Chad|subsistence herders and farmers]]. Since 2003, [[petroleum|crude oil]] has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional [[cotton]] industry. Chad is considered a [[failed state]] by the [[Fund for Peace]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Chad}}

In the 7th millennium BC, ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and the region experienced a strong population increase. Some of the most important [[African archaeology|African archaeological]] sites are found in Chad, mainly in the [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]]; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 44–45</ref><ref name="Collelo">S. Collelo, ''Chad''</ref>

For more than 2000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and [[sedentism|sedentary]] people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest of these were the legendary [[Sao civilisation|Sao]], known from artifacts and oral histories. The Sao fell to the [[Kanem Empire]],<ref name=Lange/><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 6</ref> the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's [[Sahel]]ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes that passed through the region.<ref name="Collelo"/> These states, at least tacitly [[Islam in Africa|Muslim]], never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to [[Arab slave trade|raid for slaves]].<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 7–8</ref> In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Slavery]. Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History.</ref>

[[Image:Group of Kanem-Bu warriors.jpg|thumb|left|Group of Kanem-Bu warriors. The [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] controlled almost all of what is today Chad.]]
[[File:Chadian soldier of WWII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Chadian soldier fighting for [[Free French Forces|Free France]] during [[World War II]]. The Free French Forces included 15,000 soldiers from Chad, among them [[François Tombalbaye]], later the 1st President of Chad.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 53</ref>]]

[[French colonial empires|French colonial expansion]] led to the creation of the {{lang|fr|''Territoire Militaire des Pays et Protectorats du Tchad''}} in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of [[French Equatorial Africa]].<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8, 309</ref> [[Colonial Chad|French rule in Chad]] was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation. The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the south was governed effectively; French presence in the north and east was nominal. The educational system suffered from this neglect.<ref name="Collelo"/><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 8–9</ref>

After [[World War II]], France granted Chad the status of [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territory]] and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]] and a [[National Assembly (Chad)|Chadian assembly]]. The largest political party was the [[Chadian Progressive Party]] (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, [[François Tombalbaye]], as its first [[Heads of state of Chad|president]].<ref name="Collelo"/><ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 248–249</ref><ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 17</ref>

Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated interethnic tensions. In 1965 Muslims began a [[Transitional Government of National Unity|civil war]]. Tombalbaye was [[Chadian coup of 1975|overthrown and killed]] in 1975,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917376,00.html "Death of a Dictator"], ''Time'', (28 April 1975). Accessed on 3 September 2007.</ref> but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions conquered the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], pp. 12–16</ref><ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 268</ref>

The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. [[Libya]] moved to fill the power vacuum and became [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|involved in Chad's civil war]].<ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 150</ref> Libya's adventure [[Toyota War|ended in disaster]] in 1987; the French-supported president, [[Hissène Habré]], evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before<ref>[[#Nolutshungu|Nolutshungu]], p. 230</ref> and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.<ref>[[Kenneth Pollack|Pollack, Kenneth M.]] (2002); ''Arabs at War: Military Effectiveness, 1948–1991''. Lincoln: [[University of Nebraska Press]]. ISBN 0-8032-3733-2, pp. 391–397</ref>

Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence; an estimated 40,000 people were killed under his rule.<ref>Macedo, Stephen (2006); ''Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes Under International Law''. University of Pennsylvania Press. ISBN 0-8122-1950-3, pp. 133–134</ref><ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR20/004/2001/en "Chad: the Habré Legacy"].

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a [[Constitution of Chad|new constitution]] by [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 1996|referendum]], and in 1996, Déby easily won a [[Chadian presidential election, 1996|competitive presidential election]]. He won a [[Chadian presidential election, 2001|second term]] five years later.<ref>East, Roger & Richard J. Thomas (2003); ''Profiles of People in Power: The World's Government Leaders''. Routledge. ISBN 1-85743-126-X, p. 100</ref> [[Petroleum|Oil]] exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a [[War in Chad (2005–present)|new civil war]] broke out. Déby [[Chadian constitutional referendum, 2005|unilaterally modified the constitution]] to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.<ref>IPS, "{{lang|fr|Le pétrole au cœur des nouveaux soubresauts au Tchad}}"</ref> In 2006 Déby won [[Chadian presidential election, 2006|a third mandate]] in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] has warned that a [[genocide]] like that in [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] may yet occur in Chad.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6367545.stm Chad may face genocide, UN warns].

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of Chad}}
Each year a tropical weather system known as the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|intertropical front]] crosses Chad from south to north, bringing a [[wet season]] that lasts from May to October in the south, and from June to September in the Sahel.<ref>[[#Decalo|Decalo]], p. 3</ref> Variations in local rainfall create three major geographical zones. The Sahara lies in the country's northern third. Yearly precipitations throughout this belt are under {{convert|50|mm|in}}; only the occasional spontaneous palm grove survives, and the only ones to do so are south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. The Sahara gives way to a [[Sahel]]ian belt in Chad's centre; precipitation there varies from {{convert|300|to|600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. In the Sahel, a steppe of thorny bushes (mostly [[acacia]]s) gradually gives way to the south to [[East Sudanian savanna]] in Chad's [[Sudan (region)|Sudanese]] zone. Yearly rainfall in this belt is over {{convert|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="UNHCHR"/>
{{clear}}

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Chad|Languages of Chad}}
2005 estimates place Chad's population at 10,146,000; 25.8% live in urban areas and 74.8% in rural ones.<ref name=PopulationProspects/> The country's population is young: an estimated 47.3% is under 15. The birth rate is estimated at 42.35 births per 1,000 people, the mortality rate at 16.69. The life expectancy is 47.2 years.<ref name=cia/>

[[File:Ouaddaian girl from Chad.jpg|thumb|A [[Ouaddaï Region|Ouaddaian]] girl]]
Chad's population is unevenly distributed. Density is {{convert|0.1|/km2|abbr=on}} in the Saharan [[Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region]] but {{convert|52.4|/km2|abbr=on}} in the [[Logone Occidental Region]]. In the capital, it is even higher.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> About half of the nation's population lives in the southern fifth of its territory, making this the most densely populated region.<ref>"[http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADE389.pdf Chad Livelihood Profiles]" (PDF).

[[Female genital cutting|Female genital mutilation]] is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among [[Arab]]s, [[Hadjarai]], and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the [[Sara people|Sara]] (38%) and the [[Toubou]] (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, making it difficult for them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.<ref name="HRP"/>

[[File:Chadian delegation.jpg|thumb|left|A tribal delegation]]
Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups,<ref name="BGN"/> which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's peoples may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live. In the south live sedentary people such as the Sara, the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential [[social unit]] is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.<ref name="Collelo"/><ref name="EB"/> The nation's official business languages are [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, [[Chadian Arabic]] has become a [[lingua franca]].<ref name="Collelo"/>

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Chad}}

Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census found that 54% of Chadians were [[Islam in Chad|Muslim]], 20% [[Roman Catholicism in Chad|Roman Catholic]], 14% [[Protestantism|Protestant]], 10% [[Animism|animist]], and 3% atheist.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> None of these religious traditions are monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways. [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]] arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it [[syncretism|syncretises]] aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs.<ref name="Collelo"/> Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and [[Guéra Region|Guéra]].<ref name="EB"/> The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.<ref>"[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71293.htm Chad]".

}}The vast majority of Muslims in the country are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam ([[Sufism]]) known locally as [[Tijaniyah]], which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented Salafi-movement.

Roman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country. Most Protestants, including the Nigeria-based "Winners Chapel," are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups. Members of the [[Bahá'í]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religious communities also are present in the country. Both faiths were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered to be "new" religions in the country.

Chad is home to foreign missionaries representing both Christian and Islamic groups. Itinerant Muslim preachers primarily from Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, also visit. Saudi Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71293.htm |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

== Government and Politics ==

{{main|Politics of Chad}}
{{see also|Foreign relations of Chad}}

Chad's constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system. The president has the power to appoint the [[Prime Minister of Chad|prime minister]] and the cabinet, and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad's para-statal firms. In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the [[National Assembly (Chad)|National Assembly]], may declare a [[state of emergency]]. The president is [[Elections in Chad|directly elected]] by popular vote for a five-year term; in 2005 constitutional term limits were removed.<ref name="Term2">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4118482.stm|title=Chad votes to end two-term limit|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=20 September 2007|date=22 June 2005}}</ref>

This removal allows a president to remain in power beyond the previous two-term limit.<ref name="Term2"/> Most of Déby's key advisers are members of the Zaghawa ethnic group, although southern and opposition personalities are represented in [[Government of Chad|government]].<ref name="BGN">"[http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/chad/74122.htm Background Note: Chad]".

Chad is listed as a failed state by the [[Fund for Peace]] (FFP). In 2007 Chad had the seventh highest score on the failed state index. Since then the trend has been upwards each year.

Chad's legal system is based on [[law of France|French civil law]] and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the [[Supreme Court of Chad|Supreme Court]] and the [[Constitutional Council of Chad|Constitutional Council]], have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.<ref name="BGN"/><ref name="UNPACP"/>

[[File:Embassy of Chad (Washington, D.C.).JPG|thumb|[[Embassy of Chad in Washington, D.C.]]]]

The National Assembly makes legislation. The body consists of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet three times per year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the [[Patriotic Salvation Movement]] (MPS), which holds a large majority.<ref name="BGN"/>

Until the legalisation of opposition parties in 1992, Déby's MPS was the sole legal party in Chad.<ref name="BGN"/> Since, [[list of political parties in Chad|78 registered political parties]] have become active.<ref name="HRP">"[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78726.htm Chad]".

=== Military ===
{{main|Military of Chad}}
As of 2011, Chad currently spends 1.6% of GDP on its army, a drastic drop from the level of 2009 (4.2% of GDP), when the country was engaged in a [[Chadian Civil War (2005–2010)|civil war]], with rebels supported by neighboring [[Sudan]].<ref>Country Comparison: Military expenditures: [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2034rank.html 2011] vs. [http://web.archive.org/web/20100325110215/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2034rank.html 2006]. CIA.gov</ref> This then increased to 2.0% of GDP in 2013, when Chad began its [[FATIM|military intervention]] in Northern Mali, to help France and other African nations in bringing back Mali's sovereignty over the North. The army has over 30,350 active personnel and 3,000,000 fit for military service, making it the most efficient force in the region besides the armies of [[Libya]] and [[Sudan]].

Because of its great variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a rich cultural heritage. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the [[Chad National Museum]] and the [[Chad Cultural Centre]].<ref name="EB"/> Six [[public holidays in Chad|national holidays]] are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of [[Easter Monday]] and the Muslim holidays of [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], and [[Mawlid|Eid Milad Nnabi]].<ref name="CCG"/>

===Music===

The [[music of Chad]] includes a number of unusual instruments such as the ''kinde'', a type of bow harp; the ''[[kakaki]]'', a long tin horn; and the ''hu hu'', a stringed instrument that uses [[calabash]]es as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, [[balafon]]es, harps and ''kodjo'' drums; and the [[Kanembu people|Kanembu]] combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.<ref name="culture"/>

The music group [[Chari Jazz]] formed in 1964 and initiated Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on ''sai'', a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.<ref name="culture"/><ref>* {{fr icon}} Gondjé, Laoro (2003); "[http://www.cefod.org/archives/spip.php?article231 {{lang|fr|La musique recherche son identité}}]", {{lang|fr|''Tchad et Culture''}} '''214'''.</ref>

===Cuisine===

[[Millet]] is the staple food throughout Chad. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as ''alysh''; in the south, as ''biya''. Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as ''salanga'' (sun-dried and lightly smoked ''[[Alestes]]'' and ''[[Hydrocynus]]'') or as ''banda'' (smoked larger fish).<ref>"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/D7238E/D7238E03.htm Symposium on the evaluation of fishery resources in the development and management of inland fisheries]". CIFA Technical Paper No. 2. [[FAO]]. 29 November – 1 December 1972.</ref> ''Carcaje'' is a popular sweet drink extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink [[millet beer]], known as ''billi-billi'' when brewed from red millet and as ''coshate'' when from [[Proso millet|white millet]].<ref name="culture"/>

===Media===

As in other Sahelian countries, literature in Chad has suffered from an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers. Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are [[Joseph Brahim Seïd]], [[Baba Moustapha]], [[Antoine Bangui]] and [[Koulsy Lamko]]. In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, [[Ahmat Taboye]], published his {{lang|fr|''Anthologie de la littérature tchadienne''}} to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure.<ref name="culture"/><ref>{{fr icon}} Malo, Nestor H.

Lawrenceville: Africa World Press. ISBN 0-86543-757-2, pp. 12, 132, 135</ref>

The development of a Chadian film industry has suffered from the devastations of civil war and from the lack of [[movie theater|cinemas]], of which there is only one in the whole country. The first Chadian [[feature film]], the [[docudrama]] ''[[Bye Bye Africa]]'', was made in 1999 by [[Mahamat Saleh Haroun]]. His later film ''[[Abouna]]'' was critically acclaimed, and his ''[[Daratt]]'' won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the [[63rd Venice International Film Festival]]. [[Issa Serge Coelo]] directed Chad's two other films, ''[[Daresalam]]'' and ''[[DP75: Tartina City]]''.<ref>{{fr icon}} Bambé, Naygotimti (April 2007); "[http://www.cefod.org/spip.php?article915 Issa Serge Coelo, cinéaste tchadien: ''On a encore du travail à faire'']", ''Tchad et Culture'' '''256'''.</ref><ref>Young, Neil (23 March 2004) [http://www.jigsawlounge.co.uk/film/harouninterview.html An interview with Mahamet-Saleh Haroun, writer and director of Abouna ("Our Father")]. jigsawlounge.co.uk</ref><ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5328462.stm Mirren crowned 'queen' at Venice]", BBC News, 9 September 2006.
