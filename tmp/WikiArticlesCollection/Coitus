#REDIRECT [[Sexual intercourse]]{{R from alternative name}}<!--NOTE: The word "coitus" is an alternative term for the more commonly used term "sexual intercourse," and almost always refers to penile-vaginal penetration; reliable sources, such as ones in the Sexual intercourse article, display this; therefore, the Sexual intercourse article is the WP:PRIMARYTOPIC for the topic coitus. Optionally, click on the "What links here" option to the left of the screen for further evidence.-->
