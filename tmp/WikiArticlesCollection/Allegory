'''Allegory''' is a [[literary device]] in which characters or events in a literary, visual, or musical art form represent or symbolize ideas and concepts. Allegory has been used widely throughout the histories of all forms of art; a major reason for this is its immense power to illustrate complex ideas and concepts in ways that are easily digestible and tangible to its viewers, readers, or listeners. An allegory conveys its hidden message through [[symbol]]ic figures, actions, imagery, and/or events. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of [[rhetoric]]; a rhetorical allegory is a demonstrative form of representation conveying meaning other than the words that are spoken.

As a [[literary device]], an allegory in its most general sense is an extended [[metaphor]]. One of the best known examples is Plato's "[[Allegory of the Cave]]." In this allegory, there are a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows. According to the allegory, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality.

==[[Etymology]]==
First attested in English in 1382, the word ''allegory'' comes from [[Latin]] ''allegoria'', the [[latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀλληγορία (''allegoria''), "veiled language, figurative",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29llhgori%2Fa ἀλληγορία],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> from ἄλλος (''allos''), "another, different"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fllos1 ἄλλος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> + ἀγορεύω (''agoreuo''), "to harangue, to speak in the assembly"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29goreu%2Fw ἀγορεύω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and that from ἀγορά (''agora''), "assembly."<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29gora%2F ἀγορά], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>

==Types==
[[Northrop Frye]] discussed what he termed a "continuum of allegory", a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the "naive allegory" of ''[[The Faerie Queene]],'' to the more private allegories of modern [[paradox (literature)|paradox literature]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In this perspective, the characters in a "naive" allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the allegory has been selected first, and the details merely flesh it out.

Many ancient religions are based on [[astrological allegory|astrological allegories]], that is, allegories of the movement of the Sun and the Moon as seen from the Earth. Examples include the cult of [[Horus]]/[[Isis]].

==Classical allegory==

In classical literature two of the best-known allegories are [[Allegory of the Cave|the Cave]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa ([[Livy]] ii. 32). In Late Antiquity [[Martianus Capella]] organized all the information a fifth-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and ''Philologia,'' with the seven [[liberal arts]] as guests; Capella's allegory was widely read through the Middle Ages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Other early allegories are found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], for instance in the extended metaphor in [[Psalm 80]] of the [[Grapevine|Vine]], which is Israel<ref>{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = George A. | year = 1999 | title = Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times | edition = Second | publisher = UNC Press | page = 142 | isbn = 0-8078-4769-0 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LHHYx4idyPEC&pg=PA142 | accessdate = 2009-08-07}}</ref> and [[Ezekiel]] 16 and 17.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Jones, Alexander | year = 1968 | title = The Jerusalem Bible | edition = Reader's | publisher = Doubleday & Company | pages =1186, 1189 | isbn = 0-385-01156-3}}</ref>

==Medieval allegory==

{{Main|Allegory in the Middle Ages}}
Medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the bull ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of [[Christendom]] with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: "''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ" [[s:Unam sanctam|(complete text)]].

In the late 15th century, the enigmatic ''[[Hypnerotomachia]]'', with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and [[masque]]s on contemporary allegorical representation, as [[Renaissance humanism|humanist dialectic]] conveyed them.

The denial of medieval allegory as found in the 11th-century works of [[Hugh of St Victor]] and [[Edward Topsell]]'s ''Historie of Foure-footed Beastes'' (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorization and mathematics by such figures as naturalist [[John Ray]] and the astronomer [[Galileo]] is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.<ref>[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the rise of natural science'', [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0-521-59196-1, pages 1 to 10 ("Introduction")</ref>

Modern allegory

Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories, sometimes misinterpreting their author's intent. For instance, many people have suggested that ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is an allegory for the [[world war|World Wars]]. 
If the requirement of realism is set aside, allegory can often be easily seen. Some examples of this are:

*the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]]
*some works of science fiction and fantasy, such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]] and ''[[Mark Helprin#Works|A Kingdom Far and Clear: The Complete Swan Lake Trilogy]]'' by [[Mark Helprin]].

==Examples by genre==
[[File:Allegory of Arithmetic - detail.JPG|thumb|''Allegory of [[Arithmetic]]'', by [[Laurent de La Hyre]], c. 1650]]
Not every resonant work of modern fiction is an allegory. [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly-sketched characters.<!--by whom? It has been read after the fact as an allegory for the political problems of the time.--> [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings]] is another example of a work sometimes seen as allegorical, yet, as the author explained, it is not – rather it is an example of what he referred to as applicability.

==Poetry and fiction==

An allegorical story is a narrative having a second meaning beneath the surface one. An allegorical poem has two meanings – a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning. Some unique specimens of allegory in poetry can be found in the following works:
*[[Edmund Spenser]] &ndash; [[The Faerie Queene]]: The several knights in the poem actually stand for several virtues.
*[[John Bunyan]] &ndash; [[The Pilgrim's Progress]]: The journey of the protagonists Christian and Evangelist symbolises the ascension of the soul from earth to Heaven.
*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] &ndash; [[Young Goodman Brown]]: The Devil's Staff symbolises defiance of God. The characters' names, such as ''Goodman'' and ''Faith'', ironically serve as paradox in the conclusion of the story.
*[[George Orwell]] &ndash; [[Animal Farm]]: The pigs stand for political figures of the [[Russian Revolution]].
*[[Edgar Allan Poe]] &ndash; [[The Masque of the Red Death]]: The story can be read as an allegory how no one can evade death.<ref>SparkNotes: Poe's Short Stories</ref>
