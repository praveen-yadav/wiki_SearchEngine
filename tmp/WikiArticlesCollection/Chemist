A '''chemist''' is a [[scientist]] trained in the study of [[chemistry]]. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of [[molecule]]s and their component [[atom]]s. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, [[Chemical reaction|reaction]] rates, and other [[chemical properties]].

Chemists use this knowledge to learn the composition, and properties of unfamiliar substances, as well as to reproduce and synthesize large quantities of useful naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances and useful processes. Chemists may specialize in any number of [[Chemistry#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines of chemistry]]. [[Materials science|Materials scientists]] and metallurgists share much of the same education and skills with chemists. The work of chemists is often related to the work of [[chemical engineer]]s, which are primarily concerned with the proper design, construction and evaluation of the most cost-effective large-scale [[chemical plant]]s and work closely with industrial chemists on the development of new processes and methods for the commercial-scale manufacture of chemicals and related products.

==History==
{{main|History of chemistry}}
[[File:Medeleeff by repin.jpg|thumb|Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] - author of the first modern [[periodic table of elements]]]]
[[File:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94) is considered the "[[People known as the father or mother of something|Father of Modern Chemistry]]".]]
The roots of chemistry can be traced to the phenomenon of [[combustion|burning]]. [[Fire]] was a mystical force that transformed one substance into another and thus was of primary interest to mankind. It was fire that led to the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] of [[iron]] and [[glass]]. After [[gold]] was discovered and became a precious metal, many people were interested to find a method that could convert other substances into gold. This led to the [[protoscience]] called [[alchemy]]. The word ''chemist'' is derived from the [[New Latin]] noun ''chimista'', an abbreviation of ''alchimista'' ([[Alchemy|alchemist]]).  Alchemists discovered many [[chemical process]]es that led to the development of modern chemistry. Chemistry as we know it today, was invented by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] with his law of [[conservation of mass]] in 1783. The [[discoveries of the chemical elements]] has a long history culminating in the creation of the [[periodic table]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]. The [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] created in 1901 gives an excellent overview of chemical discovery since the start of the 20th century.

==Education==
Jobs for chemists usually require at least a [[bachelor's degree]], but many positions, especially those in research, require a [[Ph.D]]. Most undergraduate programs emphasize [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] as well as chemistry, partly because chemistry is also known as "[[the central science]]", thus chemists ought to have a well-rounded knowledge about science. At the [[Master's degree|Master's]] level and higher, students tend to specialize in a particular field.  Fields of specialization include [[biochemistry]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[theoretical chemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[environmental chemistry]], and [[physical chemistry]].  [[Postdoctoral]] experience may be required for certain positions.  

Workers whose work involves chemistry, but not at a complexity requiring an education with a chemistry degree, are commonly referred to as ''[[chemical technician]]s''.  Such technicians commonly do such work as simpler, repetitive analyses for [[quality control]] or in [[Clinical laboratory|clinical laboratories]].

==Employment==
The three major employers of chemists are academic institutions, industry, especially the [[chemical industry]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and government laboratories.

Chemistry typically is divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.  There is a great deal of overlap between different branches of chemistry, as well as with other scientific fields such as biology, medicine, physics, [[radiology]], and several engineering disciplines.

*[[Analytical chemistry]] is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[structure]]. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.

*[[Biochemistry]] is the study of the [[chemical compound|chemicals]], [[chemical reaction]]s and [[chemical interaction]]s that take place in living [[organism]]s. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, for example, in [[medicinal chemistry]].

*[[Inorganic chemistry]] is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of [[organometallic chemistry]].  [[Inorganic chemistry]] is also the study of atomic and molecular structure and bonding.

*[[Medicinal chemistry]] is the science involved with designing, synthesizing and developing pharmaceutical drugs. Medicinal chemistry involves the identification, synthesis and development of new chemical entities suitable for therapeutic use. It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships.

*[[Organic chemistry]] is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and chemical reaction of organic compounds.

*[[Physical chemistry]] is the study of the physical fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes.  In particular, the energetics and dynamics  of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists.  Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy.  Physical chemistry has large overlap with theoretical chemistry and molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of calculus in deriving equations.

*[[Theoretical chemistry]] is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within [[mathematics]] or [[physics]]).  In particular the application of [[quantum mechanics]] to chemistry is called [[quantum chemistry]].  Since the end of the Second World War, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of [[computational chemistry]], which is the art of developing and applying [[computer program]]s for solving chemical problems.  Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with [[condensed matter physics]] and [[molecular physics]].  See [[reductionism]].

All the above major areas of chemistry employ chemists. Other fields where chemical degrees are useful include [[astrochemistry]] (and [[cosmochemistry]]), [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[chemical engineering]], [[chemo-informatics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[environmental science]], [[forensic science]], [[geochemistry]], [[green chemistry]], [[history of chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[medical science]], [[molecular biology]], [[molecular genetics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[oenology]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[petrochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[photochemistry]], [[phytochemistry]], [[polymer chemistry]], [[supramolecular chemistry]] and [[surface chemistry]].

==Professional societies==
Chemists may belong to [[Professional society|professional societies]] that specialize in chemist members, such as the  [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] in the [[United Kingdom]], or the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) in the [[United States]].

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to chemists is the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], awarded since 1901, by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].
