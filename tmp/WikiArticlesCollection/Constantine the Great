'''Constantine the Great''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Valerius Aurelius Constantinus Augustus}};<ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Constantine's official imperial title was IMPERATOR CAESAR FLAVIVS CONSTANTINVS PIVS FELIX INVICTVS AVGVSTVS, ''Imperator Caesar Flavius Constantine Augustus, the pious, the fortunate, the undefeated''. After 312, he added MAXIMVS ("the greatest"), and after 325 replaced ("undefeated") with VICTOR, as ''invictus'' reminded many of [[Sol Invictus]], the Sun God.</ref> 27 February c. 272<ref name=birthdate>Birth dates vary but most modern historians use c. 272".

Although he is not included in the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church's]] list of saints, which does recognise several other Constantines as saints, he is revered under the title "The Great" for his contributions to [[Christianity]].</ref> was [[Roman Emperor]] from 306 to 337. Constantine was the son of [[Flavius Valerius Constantius]], a Roman army officer, and his consort [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]]. His father became ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', the deputy emperor in the west in 293. Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a military tribune under the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]]. In 305, Constantius was raised to the rank of ''[[Augustus]]'', senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britannia]]. Acclaimed as emperor by the army after his father's death in 306, Constantine emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against the emperors [[Maxentius]] and [[Licinius]] to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324.

As emperor, Constantine enacted many administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire. The [[Praetorian prefecture|government was restructured]] and [[Praetorian prefect|civil]] and [[Magister militum|military]] authority separated. A new gold coin, the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]], was introduced to combat inflation. It would become the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years.

Pohlsander, "Philip the Arab and Christianity", ''Historia'' 29:4 (1980): 463–73.</ref>|group=notes}} Constantine played an influential role in the proclamation of the [[Edict of Milan]], which decreed religious tolerance throughout the empire. He called the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, at which the [[Nicene Creed]] was professed by Christians. In military matters, the Roman army was reorganised to consist of [[comitatenses|mobile field units]] and [[limitanei|garrison soldiers]] capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—the [[Franks]], the [[Alamanni]], the [[Goths]], and the [[Sarmatians]]—even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the [[Crisis of the Third Century|turmoil of the previous century]].

The age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Gregory, ''A History of Byzantium'', 49.</ref> He built a new imperial residence at [[Byzantium]] and named it [[New Rome]]. However, in Constantine's honor, the Romans called it [[Constantinople]], which would later be the capital of what is now known as the [[Byzantine Empire]] for over one thousand years. Because of this, he is thought of as the founder of the Byzantine Empire. His more immediate political legacy was that, in leaving the empire to his sons, he replaced Diocletian's [[tetrarchy]] with the principle of dynastic succession. His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and centuries after his reign. The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity.<ref>Van Dam, ''Remembering Constantine at the Milvian Bridge'', 30.</ref> Beginning with the renaissance, there were more critical appraisals of his reign due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources. Critics portrayed him as a despotic tyrant. Trends in modern and recent scholarship attempted to balance the extremes of previous scholarship.

Constantine—as the first Christian emperor—is a significant figure in the [[history of Christianity]]. The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], built on his orders at the purported site of [[Jesus]]' tomb in [[Jerusalem]], became the holiest place in [[Christendom]]. The [[Papacy]] [[Donation of Constantine|claimed]] [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] through Constantine. He is venerated as a [[saint]] by [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholics]], and [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]]. The [[Eastern churches]] hold his memory in particular esteem, regarding Constantine as ''isapostolos'' or ''[[equal-to-apostles]]''.

==Early life==
[[File:Medijana.jpg|thumb|Remains of the luxurious residence palace of [[Mediana]], erected by Constantine I near his birth town of [[Naissus]]]]
Flavius Valerius Constantinus, as he was originally named, was born in the city of Naissus, [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] province of [[Moesia]], on 27 February of an uncertain year,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3, 39–42; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Odahl, 15; Pohlsander, "Constantine I"; Southern, 169, 341.</ref> probably near 272.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39–42; Elliott, "Constantine's Conversion," 425–6; Elliott, "Eusebian Frauds," 163; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Jones, 13–14; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 59; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14; Rodgers, 238; Wright, 495, 507.</ref> His father was [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]], a native of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]] province of Moesia (later [[Dacia ripensis|Dacia Ripensis]]).<ref name="CTCR">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 16–17.</ref> Constantius was a tolerant and politically skilled man.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 8(5), 9(4); Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 8.7; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.13.3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13, 290.</ref> Constantine probably spent little time with his father.<ref>MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 21.</ref> Constantius was an officer in the Roman army, part of the Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s imperial bodyguard. Constantius advanced through the ranks, earning the [[Roman governor|governorship]] of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] from Emperor [[Diocletian]], another of Aurelian's companions from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], in 284 or 285.<ref name="CTCR"/> Constantine's mother was [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]], a [[Bithynia]]n woman of low social standing.<ref>Drijvers, J.W. ''Helena Augusta: The Mother of Constantine the Great and the Legend of Her finding the True Cross'' (Leiden, 1991) 9, 15–17.</ref> It is uncertain whether she was legally married to Constantius or merely his concubine.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Barnes, ''New Empire'', 39–40; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 17; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 59, 83; Odahl, 16; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14.</ref>

[[File:Constantian Dynasty, the children of Constantius.png|thumb|left|Constantine's parents and siblings, the dates in square brackets indicate the possession of minor titles]]
In July 285, Diocletian declared [[Maximian]], another colleague from [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], his co-emperor. Each emperor would have his own court, his own military and administrative faculties, and each would rule with a separate [[praetorian prefect]] as chief lieutenant.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–14; Corcoran, "Before Constantine" (CC), 41–54; Odahl, 46–50; Treadgold, 14–15.</ref> Maximian ruled in the West, from his capitals at [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]], [[Italy]]) or Augusta Treverorum ([[Trier]], [[Germany]]), while Diocletian ruled in the East, from [[Nicomedia]] ([[İzmit]], [[Turkey]]). The division was merely pragmatic: the Empire was called "indivisible" in official panegyric,<ref>Bowman, 70; Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.</ref> and both emperors could move freely throughout the Empire.<ref>Potter, 283; Williams, 49, 65.</ref> In 288, Maximian appointed Constantius to serve as his praetorian prefect in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Constantius left Helena to marry Maximian's stepdaughter [[Flavia Maximiana Theodora|Theodora]] in 288 or 289.<ref name="marriage">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 20; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 47, 299; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 14.</ref>

Diocletian divided the Empire again in 293, appointing two [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]s (junior emperors) to rule over further subdivisions of East and West. Each would be subordinate to their respective [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] (senior emperor) but would act with supreme authority in his assigned lands. This system would later be called the [[Tetrarchy]]. Diocletian's first appointee for the office of Caesar was Constantius; his second was [[Galerius]], a native of Felix Romuliana. According to Lactantius, Galerius was a brutal, animalistic man. Although he shared the paganism of Rome's aristocracy, he seemed to them an alien figure, a semi-barbarian.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 13, 290.</ref> On 1 March, Constantius was promoted to the office of Caesar, and dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels [[Carausius]] and [[Allectus]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3, 8; Corcoran, "Before Constantine" (CC), 40–41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 20; Odahl, 46–47; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 8–9, 14; Treadgold, 17.</ref> In spite of meritocratic overtones, the Tetrarchy retained vestiges of hereditary privilege,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 8–9; Corcoran, "Before Constantine" (CC), 42–43, 54.</ref> and Constantine became the prime candidate for future appointment as Caesar as soon as his father took the position. Constantine went to the court of Diocletian, where he lived as his father's heir presumptive.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 3; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 59–60; Odahl, 56–7.</ref>

===In the East===
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Diocleziano (284-305 d.C.) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Head from a statue of [[Diocletian]], Augustus of the East]] 
Constantine received a formal education at Diocletian's court, where he learned Latin literature, Greek, and philosophy.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 73–74; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 60; Odahl, 72, 301.</ref> The cultural environment in Nicomedia was open, fluid and socially mobile, and Constantine could mix with intellectuals both pagan and Christian. He may have attended the lectures of Lactantius, a Christian scholar of Latin in the city.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47, 73–74; Fowden, "Between Pagans and Christians," 175–76.</ref> Because Diocletian did not completely trust Constantius—none of the Tetrarchs fully trusted their colleagues—Constantine was held as something of a hostage, a tool to ensure Constantius' best behavior. Constantine was nonetheless a prominent member of the court: he fought for Diocletian and Galerius in Asia, and served in a variety of [[tribune|tribunates]]; he campaigned against barbarians on the Danube in 296, and fought the Persians under Diocletian in Syria (297) and under Galerius in Mesopotamia (298–99).<ref>Constantine, ''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'', 16.2; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine''., 29–30; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 60; Odahl, 72–73.</ref> By late 305, he had become a tribune of the first order, a ''tribunus ordinis primi''.<ref>Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 29; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 61; Odahl, 72–74, 306; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15. Contra: J. Moreau, ''Lactance: "De la mort des persécuteurs"'', ''Sources Chrétiennes'' 39 (1954): 313; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 297.</ref>

Constantine had returned to Nicomedia from the eastern front by the spring of 303, in time to witness the beginnings of Diocletian's "[[Diocletianic Persecution|Great Persecution]]", the most severe [[Persecution of early Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in Roman history.<ref>Constantine, ''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'' 25; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 30; Odahl, 73.</ref> In late 302, Diocletian and Galerius sent a messenger to the [[oracle]] of [[Apollo]] at [[Didyma]] with an inquiry about Christians.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 10.6–11; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 35–36; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24; Odahl, 67; Potter, 338.</ref> Constantine could recall his presence at the palace when the messenger returned, when Diocletian accepted his court's demands for universal persecution.<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 2.49–52; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 21; Odahl, 67, 73, 304; Potter, 338.</ref> On 23 February 303, Diocletian ordered the destruction of Nicomedia's new church, condemned its scriptures to the flames, and had its treasures seized. In the months that followed, churches and scriptures were destroyed, Christians were deprived of official ranks, and priests were imprisoned.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 22–25; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24–30; Odahl, 67–69; Potter, 337.</ref>

It is unlikely that Constantine played any role in the persecution.<ref>MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 24–25.</ref> In his later writings he would attempt to present himself as an opponent of Diocletian's "sanguinary edicts" against the "worshippers of God",<ref>''Oratio ad Sanctorum Coetum'' 25; Odahl, 73.</ref> but nothing indicates that he opposed it effectively at the time.<ref>Drake, "The Impact of Constantine on Christianity" (CC), 126; Elliott, "Constantine's Conversion," 425–26.</ref> Although no contemporary Christian challenged Constantine for his inaction during the persecutions, it remained a political liability throughout his life.<ref>Drake, "The Impact of Constantine on Christianity" (CC), 126.</ref>

On 1 May 305, Diocletian, as a result of a debilitating sickness taken in the winter of 304–5, announced his resignation. In a parallel ceremony in Milan, Maximian did the same.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25–27; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 60; Odahl, 69–72; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15; Potter, 341–42.</ref> Lactantius states that Galerius manipulated the weakened Diocletian into resigning, and forced him to accept Galerius' allies in the imperial succession. According to Lactantius, the crowd listening to Diocletian's resignation speech believed, until the very last moment, that Diocletian would choose Constantine and [[Maxentius]] (Maximian's son) as his successors.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2–6; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: Constantius and Galerius were promoted to Augusti, while [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus|Maximin]] were appointed their Caesars respectively. Constantine and Maxentius were ignored.<ref>Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 60–61; Odahl, 72–74; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15.</ref>

Some of the ancient sources detail plots that Galerius made on Constantine's life in the months following Diocletian's abdication. They assert that Galerius assigned Constantine to lead an advance unit in a cavalry charge through a swamp on the middle [[Danube]], made him enter into single combat with a lion, and attempted to kill him in hunts and wars. Constantine always emerged victorious: the lion emerged from the contest in a poorer condition than Constantine; Constantine returned to Nicomedia from the Danube with a Sarmatian captive to drop at Galerius' feet.<ref>''Origo'' 4; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 24.3–9; Praxagoras fr. 1.2; Aurelius Victor 40.2–3; ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 41.2; Zosimus 2.8.3; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.21; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 61; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32; Odahl, 73.</ref> It is uncertain how much these tales can be trusted.<ref>Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 61.</ref>

===In the West===
Constantine recognized the implicit danger in remaining at Galerius' court, where he was held as a virtual hostage. His career depended on being rescued by his father in the west. Constantius was quick to intervene.<ref>Odahl, 75–76.</ref> In the late spring or early summer of 305, Constantius requested leave for his son to help him campaign in Britain. After a long evening of drinking, Galerius granted the request. Constantine's later propaganda describes how he fled the court in the night, before Galerius could change his mind. He rode from  [[Cursus publicus|post-house]] to post-house at high speed, [[hamstringing]] every horse in his wake.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39–40; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 61; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32; Odahl, 77; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16; Potter, 344–5; Southern, 169–70, 341.</ref> By the time Galerius awoke the following morning, Constantine had fled too far to be caught.<ref>MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 32.</ref> Constantine joined his father in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], at Bononia ([[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]) before the summer of 305.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39–40; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 61; Odahl, 77; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16; Potter, 344–45; Southern, 169–70, 341.</ref>

[[File:2009-04-13 ConstantineTheGreat York.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze statue of Constantine I in [[York]], [[England]], near the spot where he was proclaimed Augustus in 306]]
From Bononia they crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] to Britain and made their way to [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), capital of the province of [[Britannia Secunda]] and home to a large military base. Constantine was able to spend a year in northern Britain at his father's side, campaigning against the [[Picts]] beyond [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the summer and autumn.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27, 298; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 77–78, 309; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.</ref> Constantius's campaign, like that of [[Septimius Severus]] before it, probably advanced far into the north without achieving great success.<ref>Mattingly, 233–34; Southern, 170, 341.</ref> Constantius had become severely sick over the course of his reign, and died on 25 July 306 in [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]). Before dying, he declared his support for raising Constantine to the rank of full Augustus. The [[Alamanni]]c king [[Chrocus]], a barbarian taken into service under Constantius, then proclaimed Constantine as Augustus. The troops loyal to Constantius' memory followed him in acclamation. Gaul and Britain quickly accepted his rule;<ref name="N35">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27–28; Jones, 59; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 61–62; Odahl, 78–79.</ref> Iberia, which had been in his father's domain for less than a year, rejected it.<ref>Jones, 59.</ref>

Constantine sent Galerius an official notice of Constantius's death and his own acclamation. Along with the notice, he included a portrait of himself in the robes of an Augustus.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28–29; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 62; Odahl, 79–80.</ref> The portrait was wreathed in [[Bay Laurel|bay]].<ref>Jones, 59; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39.</ref> He requested recognition as heir to his father's throne, and passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army, claiming they had "forced it upon him".<ref>Treadgold, 28.</ref> Galerius was put into a fury by the message; he almost set the portrait on fire.

Constantine's share of the Empire consisted of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded one of the largest Roman armies, stationed along the important [[Rhine]] frontier.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 16–17.</ref> After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, and secured his control in the northwestern [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways.<ref>Odahl, 80–81.</ref> He soon left for [[History of Trier#Roman Empire|Augusta Treverorum]] ([[Trier]]) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire.<ref>Odahl, 81.</ref> The [[Franks]], after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–7.<ref>MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39; Odahl, 81–82.</ref> Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and their soldiers were fed to the beasts of Trier's amphitheater in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' (arrival) celebrations that followed.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 63; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39–40; Odahl, 81–83.</ref>

More than {{convert|100|m|0}} wide by {{convert|200|m|0}} long, and capable of serving several thousands at a time, the baths were built to rival those of Rome.<ref>Odahl, 82–83.</ref>]]
Constantine began a major expansion of Trier. He strengthened the circuit wall around the city with military towers and fortified gates, and began building a palace complex in the northeastern part of the city. To the south of his palace, he ordered the construction of a large formal audience hall, and a massive imperial bathhouse. Constantine sponsored many building projects across Gaul during his tenure as emperor of the West, especially in Augustodunum ([[Autun]]) and Arelate ([[Arles]]).<ref>Odahl, 82–83. See also: William E. Gwatkin, Jr. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/CJ/29/1/Roman_Trier*.html Roman Trier]." ''The Classical Journal'' 29 (1933): 3–12.</ref> According to Lactantius, Constantine followed his father in following a tolerant policy towards Christianity. Although not yet a Christian, he probably judged it a more sensible policy than open persecution,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 24.9; Barnes, "Lactantius and Constantine", 43–46; Odahl, 85, 310–11.</ref> and a way to distinguish himself from the "great persecutor", Galerius.<ref>Odahl, 86.</ref> Constantine decreed a formal end to persecution, and returned to Christians all they had lost during the persecutions.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 28.</ref>

Because Constantine was still largely untried and had a hint of illegitimacy about him, he relied on his father's reputation in his early propaganda: the earliest panegyrics to Constantine give as much coverage to his father's deeds as to those of Constantine himself.<ref>Rodgers, 236.</ref> Constantine's military skill and building projects soon gave the panegyrist the opportunity to comment favorably on the similarities between father and son, and Eusebius remarked that Constantine was a "renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father's life and reign".<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)3.4; Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 1.22, qtd. and tr. Odahl, 83; Rodgers, 238.</ref> Constantinian coinage, sculpture and oratory also shows a new tendency for disdain towards the "barbarians" beyond the frontiers. After Constantine's victory over the Alemanni, he minted a coin issue depicting weeping and begging Alemannic tribesmen—"The Alemanni conquered"—beneath the phrase "Romans' rejoicing".<ref>MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 40.</ref> There was little sympathy for these enemies. As his panegyrist declared: "It is a stupid clemency that spares the conquered foe."<ref>Qtd. in MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 40.</ref>

===Maxentius' rebellion===
[[File:Maxentius02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|Dresden bust of Maxentius]]
Following Galerius' recognition of Constantine as caesar, Constantine's portrait was brought to Rome, as was customary. [[Maxentius]] mocked the portrait's subject as the son of a harlot, and lamented his own powerlessness.<ref>Zosimus, 2.9.2; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 62; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 39.</ref> Maxentius, jealous of Constantine's authority,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 29; Odahl, 86; Potter, 346.</ref> seized the title of emperor on 28 October 306. Galerius refused to recognize him, but failed to unseat him. Galerius sent [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30–31; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41–42; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 62–63; Odahl, 86–87; Potter, 348–49.</ref> Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307. He offered to marry his daughter [[Fausta]] to Constantine, and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted, and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius political recognition.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 64; Odahl, 87–88; Pohlsander,, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.</ref>

Constantine remained aloof from the Italian conflict, however. Over the spring and summer of 307, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil;<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 62–63; Odahl, 86–87.</ref> now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308, he raided the territory of the [[Bructeri]], and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium ([[Cologne]]). In 310, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 63–65; Odahl, 89; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15–16.</ref> Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–8, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 64; Odahl, 89, 93.</ref>

On 11 November 308, Galerius called a general council at the military city of [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]) to resolve the instability in the western provinces. In attendance were Diocletian, briefly returned from retirement, Galerius, and Maximian. Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar. [[Licinius]], one of Galerius' old military companions, was appointed Augustus of the west. The new system did not last long: Constantine refused to accept the demotion, and continued to style himself as Augustus on his coinage, even as other members of the Tetrarchy referred to him as a Caesar on theirs. [[Maximinus Daia]] was frustrated that he had been passed over for promotion while the newcomer Licinius had been raised to the office of Augustus, and demanded that Galerius promote him. Galerius offered to call both Maximinus and Constantine "sons of the Augusti",<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32–34; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 42–43; Jones, 61; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 65; Odahl, 90–91; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 349–50; Treadgold, 29.</ref> but neither accepted the new title. By the spring of 310, Galerius was referring to both men as Augusti.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 33; Jones, 61.</ref>{{clear}}

===Maximian's rebellion===
[[File:Constantine multiple CdM Beistegui 233.jpg|right|thumb|A gold multiple of "Unconquered Constantine" with [[Sol Invictus]], struck in 313. The use of Sol's image appealed to both the educated citizens of Gaul, who would recognize in it Apollo's patronage of [[Augustus]] and the arts; and to Christians, who found solar monotheism less objectionable than the traditional pagan pantheon.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37.</ref>]]
In 310, a dispossessed  Maximian rebelled against Constantine while Constantine was away campaigning against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with a contingent of Constantine's army, in preparation for any attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. He announced that Constantine was dead, and took up the imperial purple. In spite of a large donative pledge to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal to their emperor, and Maximian was soon compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and marched his army up the Rhine.<ref name = "yuhknp">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34–35; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 65–66; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 352.</ref> At Cabillunum ([[Chalon-sur-Saône]]), he moved his troops onto waiting boats to row down the slow waters of the [[Saône]] to the quicker waters of the [[Rhone]]. He disembarked at [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]).<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34.</ref> Maximian fled to Massilia ([[Marseille]]), a town better able to withstand a long siege than Arles. It made little difference, however, as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured and reproved for his crimes. Constantine granted some clemency, but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.<ref name = "yuhknp"/>

In spite of the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death.<ref>Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 68; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 20.</ref> He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death.<ref>Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 68.</ref> Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 30.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40–41, 305.</ref> Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 68.</ref>

The death of Maximian required a shift in Constantine's public image. He could no longer rely on his connection to the elder emperor Maximian, and needed a new source of legitimacy.<ref>Potter, 352.</ref> In a speech delivered in Gaul on 25 July 310, the anonymous orator reveals a previously unknown dynastic connection to [[Claudius II]], a third-century emperor famed for defeating the Goths and restoring order to the empire. Breaking away from tetrarchic models, the speech emphasizes Constantine's ancestral prerogative to rule, rather than principles of imperial equality. The new ideology expressed in the speech made Galerius and Maximian irrelevant to Constantine's right to rule.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7); Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 35–37, 301; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 66; Odahl, 94–95, 314–15; Potter, 352–53.</ref> Indeed, the orator emphasizes ancestry to the exclusion of all other factors: "No chance agreement of men, nor some unexpected consequence of favor, made you emperor," the orator declares to Constantine.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7)1. Qtd. in Potter, 353.</ref>

The oration also moves away from the religious ideology of the Tetrarchy, with its focus on twin dynasties of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Hercules]]. Instead, the orator proclaims that Constantine experienced a divine vision of [[Apollo]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] granting him [[laurel wreath]]s of health and a long reign. In the likeness of Apollo Constantine recognized himself as the saving figure to whom would be granted "rule of the whole world",<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7).21.5.</ref> as the poet Virgil had once foretold.<ref>Virgil, ''[[Bucolics|Ecologues]]'' 4.10.</ref> The oration's religious shift is paralleled by a similar shift in Constantine's coinage. In his early reign, the coinage of Constantine advertised [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] as his patron. From 310 on, Mars was replaced by [[Sol Invictus]], a god conventionally identified with Apollo.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 67; Odahl, 95.</ref> There is little reason to believe that either the dynastic connection or the divine vision are anything other than fiction, but their proclamation strengthened Constantine's claims to legitimacy and increased his popularity among the citizens of Gaul.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36–37; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 50–53; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 66–67; Odahl, 94–95.</ref>

By the middle of 310, Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 31–35; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.16; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96, 316.</ref> His final act survives: a letter to the provincials posted in Nicomedia on 30 April 311, proclaiming an end to the persecutions, and the resumption of religious toleration.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.17; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 304; Jones, 66.</ref> He died soon after the edict's proclamation,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43–44; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95–96.</ref> destroying what little remained of the tetrarchy.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.</ref> Maximin mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor.

Maxentius' rule was nevertheless insecure. His early support dissolved in the wake of heightened tax rates and depressed trade; riots broke out in Rome and [[Carthage]];<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37; Curran, 66; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 68; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 62.</ref> and [[Domitius Alexander]] was able to briefly usurp his authority in Africa.<ref name = "leohak">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37.</ref> By 312, he was a man barely tolerated, not one actively supported,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 37–39.</ref> even among Christian Italians.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 38–39; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 62.</ref> In the summer of 311, Maxentius mobilized against Constantine while Licinius was occupied with affairs in the East.

Maximin considered Constantine's arrangement with Licinius an affront to his authority. In response, he sent ambassadors to Rome, offering political recognition to Maxentius in exchange for a military support. Maxentius accepted.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 44–45; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.</ref> According to Eusebius, inter-regional travel became impossible, and there was military buildup everywhere. There was "not a place where people were not expecting the onset of hostilities every day".<ref>Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.15.1–2, qtd. and tr. in MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 65.</ref>

Constantine's advisers and generals cautioned against preemptive attack on Maxentius;<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71.</ref> even his soothsayers recommended against it, stating that the sacrifices had produced unfavorable omens.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)2.5; Curran, 67.</ref> Constantine, with a spirit that left a deep impression on his followers, inspiring some to believe that he had some form of supernatural guidance,<ref>Curran, 67.</ref> ignored all these cautions.<ref>MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 70–71.</ref> Early in the spring of 312,<ref name = "esyyqc">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Odahl, 101.</ref> Constantine crossed the [[Cottian Alps]] with a quarter of his army, a force numbering about 40,000.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)5.1–3; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 101.</ref> The first town his army encountered was Segusium ([[Susa (TO)|Susa]], [[Italy]]), a heavily fortified town that shut its gates to him. Constantine ordered his men to set fire to its gates and scale its walls. He took the town quickly.

At the approach to the west of the important city of Augusta Taurinorum ([[Turin]], Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Jones, 70; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 101–2.</ref> In the ensuing [[Battle of Turin (312)|battle]] Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 12(9)5–6; 4(10)21–24; Jones, 70–71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 102, 317–18.</ref> Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Jones, 71; Odahl, 102.</ref> Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312, when he moved on to [[Brixia]] ([[Brescia]]).<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41–42; Odahl, 103.</ref>

Brescia's army was easily dispersed,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 42; Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 103.</ref> and Constantine quickly advanced to [[Verona]], where a large Maxentian force was camped.<ref>Jones, 71; MacMullen, ''Constantine'', 71; Odahl, 103.</ref> Ruricius Pompeianus, general of the Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect,<ref>Jones, 71; Odahl, 103.</ref> was in a strong defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the [[Adige]].

Constantine deployed his own forces along the whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry.

===In Rome===

An extensive propaganda campaign followed, during which Maxentius' image was systematically purged from all public places. Maxentius was written up as a "[[tyrant]]", and set against an idealized image of the "liberator", Constantine. Eusebius, in his later works, is the best representative of this strand of Constantinian propaganda.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45–47; Cameron, 93; Curran, 76–77; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 70.</ref> Maxentius' rescripts were declared invalid, and the honors Maxentius had granted to leaders of the Senate were invalidated.<ref name="Barnes, CE, 45">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45.</ref> Constantine also attempted to remove Maxentius' influence on Rome's urban landscape.

Its inscription bore the message the statue had already made clear: By this sign Constantine had freed Rome from the yoke of the tyrant.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 47.</ref>

Where he did not overwrite Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the [[Circus Maximus]] was redeveloped so that its total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the [[Via Appia]].<ref>Curran, 83–85.</ref> Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the [[Praetorian Guard]] and Imperial Horse Guard (''equites singulares'') were disbanded.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 45; Curran, 76; Odahl, 109.</ref> Their{{clarify|Whose tombstones?

===Wars against Licinius===
In the following years, Constantine gradually consolidated his military superiority over his rivals in the crumbling Tetrarchy. In 313, he met [[Licinius]] in [[Milan]] to secure their alliance by the marriage of Licinius and Constantine's half-sister [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]]. During this meeting, the emperors agreed on the so-called [[Edict of Milan]],<ref>The term is a misnomer as the act of Milan was not an edict, while the subsequent edicts by Licinius—of which the edicts to the provinces of Bythinia and Palestine are recorded by Lactantius and Eusebius, respectively—were not issued in Milan.</ref>
officially granting full tolerance to Christianity and all religions in the Empire.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 25.</ref>
The document had special benefits for Christians, legalizing their religion and granting them restoration for all property seized during Diocletian's persecution. It repudiates past methods of religious coercion and used only general terms to refer to the divine sphere—"Divinity" and "Supreme Divinity", ''summa divinitas''.<ref>Drake, "Impact," 121–123.</ref>
The conference was cut short, however, when news reached Licinius that his rival Maximin had crossed the [[Bosporus]] and invaded European territory. Licinius departed and eventually defeated Maximin, gaining control over the entire eastern half of the Roman Empire. Relations between the two remaining emperors deteriorated, as Constantine suffered an assassination attempt at the hands of a character that Licinius wanted elevated to the rank of Caesar;<ref name="ReferenceA">Carrié & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 229</ref> Licinius, for his part had Constantine's statues in Emona and Pannonia destroyed.<ref>Byfield, Ted, ed. The Christians: Their First Two Thousand Years, vol. III By This Sign. pg 148. [http://www.christianhistoryproject.org/to-the-constantine-era/constantine]</ref>
In either 314 or 316 the two Augusti fought against one another at the [[Battle of Cibalae]], with Constantine being victorious. They clashed again at the [[Battle of Mardia]] in 317, and agreed to a settlement in which Constantine's sons [[Crispus]] and [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], and Licinius' son Licinianus were made ''[[Caesar (title)|caesars]]''.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 38–39.</ref>
After this arrangement, Constantine ruled the dioceses of Pannonia and Macedonia and took residence at [[Sirmium]], from whence he could wage war on the Goths and Sarmatians in 322, and on the Goths in 323.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In the year 320, [[Licinius]] allegedly reneged on the religious freedom promised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and began to oppress Christians anew,<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 41–42.</ref>
generally without bloodshed, but resorting to confiscations and sacking of Christian office-holders.<ref>Carrié & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 229/230</ref> Although this characterization of Licinius as anti-Christian is somewhat doubtful, the fact is that he seems to have been far less open in his support of Christianity than Constantine. Therefore Licinius was prone to see the Church as a force more loyal to Constantine than to the Imperial system in general <ref>Timothy E. Gregory, ''A History of Byzantium''. Chichester: John Wiley & Sons, 2010, ISBN 978-1-4051-8471-7 , page 54</ref> - the explanation offered by the Church historian [[Sozomen]].<ref>Philip Schaff, ed., ''Nicene and Post-nicene Fathers: Second Series''. New York: Cosimo, 2007,  ISBN 978-1-60206-508-6 , page 418, footnote 6</ref>

This dubious arrangement eventually became a challenge to Constantine in the West, climaxing in the great civil war of 324. Licinius, aided by [[Goths|Goth]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], represented the past and the ancient [[Paganism|Pagan]] faiths. Constantine and his [[Franks]] marched under the standard of the ''[[labarum]]'', and both sides saw the battle in religious terms. Outnumbered, but fired by their zeal, Constantine's army emerged victorious in the [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|Battle of Adrianople]]. Licinius fled across the Bosphorus and appointed [[Martinianus|Martius Martinianus]], the commander of his bodyguard, as Caesar, but Constantine next won the [[Battle of the Hellespont]], and finally the [[Battle of Chrysopolis]] on 18 September 324.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 42–43.</ref>
Licinius and Martinianus surrendered to Constantine at Nicomedia on the promise their lives would be spared: they were sent to live as private citizens in Thessalonica and Cappadocia respectively, but in 325 Constantine accused Licinius of plotting against him and had them both arrested and hanged; Licinius's son (the son of Constantine's half-sister) was also killed.<ref>Scarre, ''Chronicle of the Roman Emperors'', 215.</ref>
Thus Constantine became the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.<ref name="macmullen">MacMullen, ''Constantine''.</ref>

===Foundation of Constantinople===
[[File:Constantinopolis coin.jpg|right|thumb|Coin struck by Constantine I to commemorate the founding of Constantinople]]
Licinius' defeat came to represent the defeat of a rival center of Pagan and Greek-speaking political activity in the East, as opposed to the Christian and Latin-speaking Rome, and it was proposed that a new Eastern capital should represent the integration of the East into the Roman Empire as a whole, as a center of learning, prosperity, and cultural preservation for the whole of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] .<ref>Gilbert Dagron, ''Naissance d'une Capitale'',  24</ref> Among the various locations proposed for this alternative capital, Constantine appears to have toyed earlier with [[History of Sofia|Serdica]] (present-day [[Sofia]]), as he was reported saying that "''Serdica is my Rome''".<ref>[[Petrus Patricius]] ''excerpta Vaticana'', 190: Κωνσταντίνος εβουλεύσατο πρώτον εν Σαρδική μεταγαγείν τά δημόσια· φιλών τε τήν πόλιν εκείνην συνεχώς έλεγεν "η εμή Ρώμη Σαρδική εστι."</ref> [[Sirmium]] and [[Thessalonica]] were also considered.<ref>Ramsey MacMullen, ''Constantine'', [[Routledge]] ed., 1987, 149</ref> Eventually, however, Constantine decided to work on the Greek city of [[Byzantium]], which offered the advantage of having already been extensively rebuilt on Roman patterns of urbanism, during the preceding century, by [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]], who had already acknowledged its strategic importance.<ref>Dagron, ''Naissance d'une Capitale'', 15/19</ref> The city was thus founded in 324,<ref name=Oxf>"Constantinople" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, 1991, p. 508.

Special commemorative coins were issued in 330 to honor the event. The new city was protected by the relics of the [[True Cross]], the [[Nehushtan|Rod of Moses]] and other holy [[relic]]s, though a cameo now at the [[Hermitage Museum]] also represented Constantine crowned by the [[tyche]] of the new city.<ref>[http://www.hermitagerooms.com/exhibitions/Byzantium/sardonyx.asp Sardonyx cameo depicting constantine the great crowned by Constantinople, 4th century AD] at "The Road to Byzantium: Luxury Arts of Antiquity". ''The Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House'' (30 March 2006&nbsp;– 3 September 2006)</ref> The figures of old gods were either replaced or assimilated into a framework of [[Christian symbolism]]. Constantine built the new [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] on the site of a temple to [[Aphrodite]]. Generations later there was the story that a [[Vision (religion)|divine vision]] led Constantine to this spot, and an [[angel]] no one else could see, led him on a circuit of the new walls. The capital would often be compared to the 'old' Rome as ''Nova Roma Constantinopolitana'', the "New Rome of Constantinople".<ref name="macmullen"/><ref>According to the ''Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city "New Rome" (''Nova Roma'' or ''Nea Rhome''). Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (Michael Grant, ''The Climax of Rome'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1968), 133). It is possible that the emperor called the city "Second Rome" (''Deutera Rhome'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian Socrates of Constantinople.</ref>

===Religious policy===

[[File:Constantine I Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|right|''Constantine the Great'', mosaic in [[Hagia Sophia]], c. 1000]]

Constantine is perhaps best known for being the first Christian Roman emperor.

In February 313, Constantine met with Licinius in Milan, where they developed the [[Edict of Milan]]. The edict stated that Christians should be allowed to follow the faith without oppression.<ref>Bowder, Diana. ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1978</ref> This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which many had been martyred in [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions of Christians]], and returned confiscated [[Church (building)|Church]] property. The edict protected from religious persecution not only Christians but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever [[deity]] they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by [[Galerius]], then senior emperor of the [[Tetrarchy]]; Galerius' edict granted Christians the right to practice their religion but did not restore any property to them.<ref>See Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34–35.</ref> The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians.

Scholars debate whether Constantine adopted his mother [[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]]'s Christianity in his youth, or whether he adopted it gradually over the course of his life.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 55. Also, Percival J. [http://cliojournal.wikispaces.com/On+the+Question+of+Constantine%27s+Conversion+to+Christianity On the Question of Constantine's Conversion to Christianity], Clio History Journal, 2008.</ref> Constantine would retain the title of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' until his death, a title emperors bore as heads of the pagan priesthood, as would his Christian successors on to [[Gratian]] (''r''. 375–83). According to Christian writers, Constantine was over 40 when he finally declared himself a Christian, writing to Christians to make clear that he believed he owed his successes to the protection of the Christian High God alone.<ref>[[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], ''The Rise of Christendom'' 2nd edition (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 2003) p. 60</ref> Throughout his rule, Constantine supported the Church financially, built basilicas, granted privileges to clergy (e.g. exemption from certain taxes), promoted Christians to high office, and returned property confiscated during the Diocletianic persecution.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) pp. 55–56.</ref> His most famous building projects include the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]].

However, Constantine certainly did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining victory in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the [[Arch of Constantine]]—was built (315) to celebrate his triumph.  The arch is decorated with images of the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]. At the time of its dedication, sacrifices to gods like [[Apollo]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], and [[Hercules]] were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''apud'' Jonathan Bardill, '' Constantine, Divine Emperor of the Christian Golden Age''. Cambridge University Press, 2011, ISBN 978-0-521-76423-0 , page 307, note 27</ref>

Later in 321, Constantine instructed that Christians and non-Christians should be united in observing the '''venerable day of the sun''', referencing the [[Sol Invictus|sun-worship]] that [[Aurelian]] had established as an official cult. Furthermore, and long after his oft alleged conversion to Christianity, Constantine's coinage continued to carry the symbols of the sun. Even after the pagan gods had disappeared from the coinage, Christian symbols appeared only as Constantine's ''personal'' attributes: the [[chi rho]] between his hands or on his [[labarum]], but never on the coin itself.<ref>Cf. Paul Veyne, ''Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien'', 163.</ref> Even when Constantine dedicated the new capital of Constantinople, which became the seat of Byzantine Christianity for a millennium, he did so wearing the [[Apollo]]nian sun-rayed [[Diadem]]; no Christian symbols were present at this dedication.

[[File:Constantine burning Arian books.jpg|thumb|left|Constantine burning [[Arianism|Arian]] books]]
The reign of Constantine established a precedent for the position of the emperor as having great influence and ultimate regulatory authority within the religious discussions involving the early Christian councils of that time, e.g., most notably the dispute over [[Arianism]], and the nature of God. Constantine himself disliked the risks to societal stability that religious disputes and controversies brought with them, preferring where possible to establish an orthodoxy.<ref>Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) 14–15; ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979) 15.</ref>  One way in which Constantine used his influence over the early Church councils was to seek to establish a consensus over the oft debated and argued issue over the nature of God.

Most notably, from 313–316 bishops in North Africa struggled with other Christian bishops who had been ordained by Donatus in opposition to Caecilian. The African bishops could not come to terms and the Donatists asked Constantine to act as a judge in the dispute. Three regional Church councils and another trial before Constantine all ruled against Donatus and the [[Donatism]] movement in North Africa. In 317 Constantine issued an edict to confiscate Donatist church property and to send Donatist clergy into exile.<ref>Frend, W.H.C., "The Donatist Church; A Movement of Protest in Roman North Africa," (1952 Oxford), pp.156–162</ref> More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], effectively the first [[Ecumenical Council]] (unless the [[Council of Jerusalem]] is so classified).  The Council of Nicaea is most known for its dealing with [[Arianism]] and for instituting the [[Nicene Creed]].

Constantine enforced the prohibition of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] against celebrating the Lord's Supper on the day before the Jewish [[Passover]] (14 ''[[Nisan]]'') (see [[Quartodecimanism]] and [[Easter controversy]]). This marked a definite break of Christianity from the Judaic tradition. From then on the Roman [[Julian Calendar]], a solar calendar, was given precedence over the lunar [[Hebrew Calendar]] among the Christian churches of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm ''Life of Constantine'' Vol. III Ch. XVIII] by Eusebius; [http://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.iv.viii.i.x.html The Epistle of the Emperor Constantine, concerning the matters transacted at the council, addressed to those Bishops who were not present]</ref>

Constantine made new laws regarding the [[Jews]]. They were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to [[brit milah|circumcise]] their slaves.

===Administrative reforms===
[[File:0 Constantinus I - Palazzo dei Conservatori (2).JPG|thumb|upright
|Head of Constantine's colossal statue at the [[Capitoline Museums]]. The original statue of marble was [[acrolith]]ic with the torso consisting of a [[cuirass]] in bronze.<ref>Jás Elsner, ''Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph'', 64, fig.32</ref>]]
Beginning in the mid-3rd century the emperors began to favor members of the [[equestrian order]] over senators, who had had a monopoly on the most important offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs<ref>Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 241</ref>), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.

In 326, Constantine reversed this pro-equestrian trend, raising many administrative positions to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices to the old aristocracy, and at the same time elevating the rank of already existing equestrians office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank <ref>As equestrian ''order'' refers to people of equestrian ''census''—thousands of which had no state function—that had an actual position in the state bureaucracy: cf. Claude Lepelley, "Fine delle' ordine equestre: le tappe delle'unificazione dela classe dirigente romana nel IV secolo", IN Giardina, ed., ''Società romana e impero tardoantico'', Bari: Laterza, 1986, V.1, quoted by Carrié & Rouselle, p.660</ref>—in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of ''perfectissimus'' was granted only to mid-low officials  .

By the new Constantinian arrangement, one could become a senator, either by being elected [[praetor]] or (in most cases) by fulfilling a function of senatorial rank:<ref>Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 247; Carrié & Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 658.</ref> from then on, holding of actual power and social status were melded together into a joint imperial hierarchy. At the same time, Constantine gained with this the support of the old nobility,<ref>Carrié & Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 658–59.</ref> as the Senate was allowed itself to elect praetors and [[quaestors]], in place of the usual practice of the emperors directly creating new magistrates (''adlectio''). In one inscription in honor of [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] (336–37) Ceionius Rufus Albinus, it was written that Constantine had restored the Senate "the ''[[auctoritas]]'' it had lost at Caesar's time".<ref>''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' [http://oracle-vm.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/epigr/epieinzel_de?p_belegstelle=CIL+06%2C+01708&r_sortierung=Belegstelle]; Carrié & Rousselle ''L'Empire Romain'', 659.</ref>

The Senate as a body remained devoid of any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats.<ref>Carrié & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 660.</ref> Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule;<ref>Cf. Arnhein, ''The Senatorial Aristocracy in the Later Roman Empire'', quoted by Perry Anderson, ''Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism'', 101.</ref> however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, given the fact that we do not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.<ref>T.D. Barnes, "Statistics and the Conversion of the Roman Aristocracy", ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 85,1995, quoted by Carrié & Rousselle, p.657</ref>

Constantine's reforms had to do only with the civilian administration: the military chiefs, who since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] had risen from the ranks,<ref>Cf. Paul Veyne, ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', 49.</ref> remained outside the senate, in which they were included only by Constantine's children.<ref>Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 247.</ref>

===Monetary reforms===
After the [[Crisis of the Third Century#Economic impact|runaway inflation of the third century]], associated with the production of [[fiat money]] to pay for public expenses, Diocletian had tried unsuccessfully to reestablish trustworthy minting of silver and [[Billon (alloy)|billon]] coins. The failure of the various Diocletianic attempts at the restoration of a functioning silver coin resided in the fact that the silver currency was overvalued in terms of its actual metal content, and therefore could only circulate at much discounted rates. Minting of the Diocletianic "pure" silver ''[[argenteus]]'' ceased, therefore, soon after 305, while the billon currency continued to be used until the 360s. From the early 300s on, Constantine forsook any attempts at restoring the silver currency, preferring instead to concentrate on minting large quantities of good standard gold pieces—the [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], 72 of which made a pound of gold. New (and highly debased) silver pieces would continue to be issued during Constantine's later reign and after his death, in a continuous process of retariffing, until this billon minting eventually ceased, ''de jure'', in 367, with the silver piece being ''de facto'' continued by various denominations of bronze coins, the most important being the ''[[centenionalis]]''.<ref>Walter Scheidel, "The Monetary Systems of the Han and Roman Empires", 174/175</ref> These bronze pieces continued to be devalued, assuring the possibility of keeping fiduciary minting alongside a gold standard. The anonymous author of the possibly contemporary treatise on military affairs ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' held that, as a consequence of this monetary policy, the rift between classes widened: the rich benefited from the stability in purchasing power of the gold piece, while the poor had to cope with ever-degrading bronze pieces.<ref>''De Rebus Bellicis'', 2.</ref> Later emperors like [[Julian the Apostate]] tried to present themselves as advocates of the ''humiles'' by insisting on trustworthy mintings of the bronze currency.<ref>Sandro Mazzarino, according to Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 246</ref>

Constantine's monetary policy were closely associated with his religious ones, in that increased minting was associated with measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the statues and having them melded for immediate minting—with the exception of a number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.<ref>Carrié & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 245–246</ref>

===Executions of Crispus and Fausta===
On some date between 15 May and 17 June 326, Constantine had his eldest son [[Crispus]], by Minervina, seized and put to death by "cold poison" at Pola ([[Pula]], [[Croatia]]).<ref>Guthrie, 325–6.</ref> In July, Constantine had his wife, the Empress [[Fausta]], killed at the behest of his mother, Helena. Fausta was left to die in an over-heated bath.<ref>Guthrie, 326; Woods, "Death of the Empress," 70–72.</ref> Their names were wiped from the face of many inscriptions, references to their lives in the literary record were erased, and the memory of both was condemned. [[Eusebius]], for example, edited praise of Crispus out of later copies of his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', and his ''Vita Constantini'' contains no mention of Fausta or Crispus at all.<ref>Guthrie, 326; Woods, "Death of the Empress," 72.</ref> Few ancient sources are willing to discuss possible motives for the events; those few that do, offer unconvincing rationales, are of later provenance, and are generally unreliable.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=62Qf64DdGu0C&pg=PT3048&lpg=PT3048&dq=rationales&source=bl&ots=jBa2L88Mm7&sig=UTMTcLEmkMrfuPlgOx7BOhzLYmg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LHLuUYbNNozJrQe1joHABg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=rationales&f=false</ref> At the time of the executions, it was commonly believed that the Empress Fausta was either in an illicit relationship with Crispus, or was spreading rumors to that effect. A popular myth arose, modified to allude to [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]]–[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] legend, with the suggestion that Constantine killed Crispus and Fausta for their immoralities.<ref name="GUTH326.7">Guthrie, 326–27.</ref> One source, the largely fictional ''Passion of Artemius'', probably penned in the eighth century by [[John of Damascus]], makes the legendary connection explicit.<ref>''Art. Pass'' 45; Woods, "Death of the Empress," 71–72.</ref> As an interpretation of the executions, the myth rests on only "the slimmest of evidence": sources that allude to the relationship between Crispus and Fausta are late and unreliable, and the modern suggestion that Constantine's "godly" edicts of 326 and the irregularities of Crispus are somehow connected rests on no evidence at all.<ref name="GUTH326.7"/>

Although Constantine created his apparent heirs "Caesars", following a pattern established by Diocletian, he gave his creations a hereditary character, alien to the tetrarchic system: Constantine's Caesars were to be kept in the hope of ascending to Empire, and entirely subordinated to their Augustus, as long as he was alive.<ref>Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 237/238</ref> Therefore, an alternative explanation for the execution of Crispus was, perhaps, Constantine's desire to keep a firm grip on his prospective heirs, this — and Fausta's desire for having her sons inheriting instead of their half-brother — being reason enough for killing Crispus; the subsequent execution of Fausta, however, was probably meant as a reminder to her children that Constantine would not hesitate in "killing his own relatives when he felt this was necessary".<ref>Cf. Adrian Goldsworthy, ''How Rome Fell'', 189 & 191</ref>

===Later campaigns===
[[File:ConstantineEmpire.png|thumb|The Roman Empire in 337, showing Constantine's conquests in Dacia across the lower Danube (shaded purple) and other Roman dependencies (light purple).]]
Constantine considered Constantinople as his capital and permanent residence. He lived there for a good portion of his later life. He rebuilt Trajan's bridge across the Danube, in hopes of reconquering [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], a province that had been abandoned under Aurelian. In the late winter of 332, Constantine campaigned with the [[Sarmatian]]s against the [[Goth]]s. The weather and lack of food cost the Goths dearly: reportedly, nearly one hundred thousand died before they submitted to Rome. In 334, after Sarmatian commoners had overthrown their leaders, Constantine led a campaign against the tribe. He won a victory in the war and extended his control over the region, as remains of camps and fortifications in the region indicate.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 250.</ref> Constantine resettled some Sarmatian exiles as farmers in Illyrian and Roman districts, and conscripted the rest into the army. Constantine took the title ''Dacicus maximus'' in 336.<ref>Odahl, 261.</ref>

[[File:Roman - Imperial Medallion of Constantine I - Walters 59690.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gold medallion struck at [[Nicomedia]] in 336-37 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his rule]]
In the last years of his life Constantine made plans for a campaign against [[Persia]]. In a letter written to the king of Persia, [[Shapur II|Shapur]], Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well.<ref>Eusebius, ''VC'' 4.9ff, cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.</ref> The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent in the shape of a church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the [[Jordan River]] before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–7, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off however, when Constantine fell sick in the spring of 337.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 258–59. See also: Fowden, "Last Days", 146–48, and Wiemer, 515.</ref>

===Sickness and death===
[[File:Raphael Baptism Constantine.jpg|thumb|''[[The Baptism of Constantine]]'', as imagined by students of [[Raphael]]]]
Constantine had known death would soon come. Within the Church of the Holy Apostles, Constantine had secretly prepared a final resting-place for himself.<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.58–60; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.</ref> It came sooner than he had expected. Soon after the Feast of Easter 337, Constantine fell seriously ill.<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.61; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 259.</ref> He left Constantinople for the hot baths near his mother's city of Helenopolis (Altinova), on the southern shores of the Gulf of İzmit. There, in a church his mother built in honor of Lucian the Apostle, he prayed, and there he realized that he was dying. Seeking purification, he became a [[catechumen]], and attempted a return to Constantinople, making it only as far as a suburb of Nicomedia.<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.62.</ref> He summoned the bishops, and told them of his hope to be baptized in the [[River Jordan]], where Christ was written to have been baptized. He requested the baptism right away, promising to live a more Christian life should he live through his illness. The bishops, Eusebius records, "performed the sacred ceremonies according to custom".<ref>Eusebius, ''Vita Constantini'' 4.62.4.</ref> He chose the Arianizing bishop [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], bishop of the [[Nicomedia|city]] where he lay dying, as his baptizer.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 75–76; Lenski, "Reign of Constantine" (CC), 82.</ref> In postponing his baptism, he followed one custom at the time which postponed baptism until after infancy.<ref>Because he was so old, he could not be submerged in water to be baptised, and therefore, the rules of baptism were changed to what they are today, having water placed on the forehead alone. In this period infant baptism, though practiced (usually in circumstances of emergency) had not yet become a matter of routine in the west. Thomas M.

Although Constantine's death follows the conclusion of the Persian campaign in Eusebius's account, most other sources report his death as occurring in its middle. Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (a nephew of Constantine), writing in the mid-350s, observes that the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]]s escaped punishment for their ill-deeds, because Constantine died "in the middle of his preparations for war".<ref>Julian, ''Orations'' 1.18.b.</ref> Similar accounts are given in the ''Origo Constantini'', an anonymous document composed while Constantine was still living, and which has Constantine dying in Nicomedia;<ref>''Origo Constantini'' 35.</ref> the ''Historiae abbreviatae'' of Sextus Aurelius Victor, written in 361, which has Constantine dying at an estate near Nicomedia called Achyrona while marching against the Persians;<ref>Sextus Aurelius Victor, ''Historiae abbreviatae'' XLI.16.</ref> and the ''Breviarium'' of Eutropius, a handbook compiled in 369 for the Emperor [[Valens]], which has Constantine dying in a nameless state villa in Nicomedia.<ref>Eutropius, ''Breviarium'' X.8.2.</ref> From these and other accounts, some have concluded that Eusebius's ''Vita'' was edited to defend Constantine's reputation against what Eusebius saw as a less congenial version of the campaign.<ref>Fowden, "Last Days of Constantine," 148–9.</ref>

Following his death, his body was transferred to Constantinople and buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] there.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 75–76.</ref> He was succeeded by his three sons born of Fausta, [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]]. A number of relatives were killed by followers of Constantius, notably Constantine's nephews [[Dalmatius]] (who held the rank of Caesar) and [[Hannibalianus]], presumably to eliminate possible contenders to an already complicated succession. He also had two daughters, [[Constantina]] and [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], wife of [[Julian the Apostate|Emperor Julian]].<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 71, figure 9.</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:0 Gaius Flavius Valerius Constantinus - Palatino.JPG|thumb|upright|Bronze head of Constantine, from a colossal statue (4th century).]]
Although he earned his honorific of "The Great" ("Μέγας") from Christian historians long after he had died, he could have claimed the title on his military achievements and victories alone. Besides reuniting the Empire under one emperor, Constantine won major victories over the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]] in 306–8, the Franks again in 313–14, the [[Goths]] in 332 and the [[Sarmatians]] in 334. By 336, Constantine had reoccupied most of the long-lost province of [[Dacia]], which [[Aurelian]] had been forced to abandon in 271. At the time of his death, he was planning a great expedition to end raids on the eastern provinces from the Persian Empire.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 72.</ref> Serving for a total of almost 31 years (combining his years as co-ruler and sole ruler), he was also the longest serving emperor since [[Augustus]] and the second longest serving emperor in Roman history.

In the cultural sphere Constantine contributed to the revival of the clean shaven face fashion of the Roman emperors from [[Augustus]] to [[Trajan]], which was originally introduced among the Romans by [[Scipio Africanus]]. This new Roman imperial fashion lasted until the reign of [[Phocas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byzantium.xronikon.com/statfirst.html |title=Byzantine first & last times |publisher=Byzantium.xronikon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=Barba |title=Barba – NumisWiki, The Collaborative Numismatics Project |publisher=Forumancientcoins.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>

The Byzantine Empire considered Constantine its founder and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reckoned him among the venerable figures of its tradition. In the later Byzantine state, it had become a great honor for an emperor to be hailed as a "new Constantine". Ten emperors, including the last emperor of Byzantium, carried the name.<ref>Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 91.</ref> Monumental Constantinian forms were used at the court of [[Charlemagne]] to suggest that he was Constantine's successor and equal. Constantine acquired a mythic role as a warrior against "heathens". The motif of the Romanesque equestrian, the mounted figure in the posture of a triumphant Roman emperor, became a visual metaphor in statuary in praise of local benefactors. The name "Constantine" itself enjoyed renewed popularity in western France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.<ref>Seidel, 237–39.</ref> Most Eastern Christian churches consider Constantine a saint (Άγιος Κωνσταντίνος, Saint Constantine).<ref name="POHL83-87">Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 83–87.</ref> In the Byzantine Church he was called ''isapostolos'' (Ισαπόστολος Κωνσταντίνος)—an [[equal-to-apostles|equal of the Apostles]].<ref>Lieu, "Constantine in Legendary Literature" (CC), 305.</ref> [[Niš Constantine the Great Airport|Niš airport]] is named Constantine the Great in honor of his birth in Naissus.

===Historiography===
During his life and those of his sons, Constantine was presented as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as [[Praxagoras of Athens]] and [[Libanius]] showered him with praise. When the last of his sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) [[Julian the Apostate]] wrote the satire ''Symposium, or the Saturnalia'', which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 272–23.</ref> Following Julian, [[Eunapius]] began—and [[Zosimus]] continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273.</ref>

[[File:Sir Peter Paul Rubens - Constantius appoints Constantine as his successor - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Constantius I|Constantius]] appoints Constantine as his successor'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], 1622]]
In medieval times, when the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was dominant, Catholic historians presented Constantine as an ideal ruler, the standard against which any king or emperor could be measured.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273; Odahl, 281.</ref> The [[Renaissance]] rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources prompted a re-evaluation of Constantine's career. The German humanist Johann Löwenklau, discoverer of Zosimus' writings, published a Latin translation thereof in 1576. In its preface, he argued that Zosimus' picture of Constantine was superior to that offered by Eusebius and the Church historians, and damned Constantine as a tyrant.<ref>[[Johannes Leunclavius]], ''Apologia pro Zosimo adversus Evagrii, Nicephori Callisti et aliorum acerbas criminationes'' (''Defence of Zosimus against the Unjustified Charges of Evagrius, Nicephorus Callistus, and Others'') (Basel, 1576), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 273, and Odahl, 282.</ref> Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]], a man of the [[Counter-Reformation]], criticized Zosimus, favoring Eusebius' account of the Constantinian era. Baronius' ''Life of Constantine'' (1588) presents Constantine as the model of a Christian prince.<ref>Caesar Baronius, ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' 3 (Antwerp, 1623), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274, and Odahl, 282.</ref> For his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–89), [[Edward Gibbon]], aiming to unite the two extremes of Constantinian scholarship, offered a portrait of Constantine built on the contrasted narratives of Eusebius and Zosimus.<ref>Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' Chapter 18, cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274, and Odahl, 282. See also Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 6–7.</ref> In a form that parallels his account of the empire's decline, Gibbon presents a noble war hero corrupted by Christian influences, who transforms into an Oriental despot in his old age: "a hero&nbsp;... degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', 1.256; David P. Jordan, "Gibbon's 'Age of Constantine' and the Fall of Rome", ''History and Theory'' 8:1 (1969): 71–96.</ref>

Modern interpretations of Constantine's rule begin with [[Jacob Burckhardt]]'s ''The Age of Constantine the Great'' (1853, rev. 1880). Burckhardt's Constantine is a scheming secularist, a politician who manipulates all parties in a quest to secure his own power.<ref>Jacob Burckhardt, ''Die Zeit Constantins des Grossen'' (Basel, 1853; revised edition, Leipzig, 1880), cited in Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274; Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 7.</ref> [[Henri Grégoire (historian)|Henri Grégoire]], writing in the 1930s, followed Burckhardt's evaluation of Constantine. For Grégoire, Constantine developed an interest in Christianity only after witnessing its political usefulness. Grégoire was skeptical of the authenticity of Eusebius' ''Vita'', and postulated a pseudo-Eusebius to assume responsibility for the vision and conversion narratives of that work.<ref>Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 7.</ref> [[Otto Seeck]], in ''Geschichte des Untergangs der antiken Welt'' (1920–23), and André Piganiol, in ''L'empereur Constantin'' (1932), wrote against this historiographic tradition. Seeck presented Constantine as a sincere war hero, whose ambiguities were the product of his own naïve inconsistency.<ref>Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 7–8.</ref> Piganiol's Constantine is a philosophical monotheist, a child of his era's religious syncretism.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 274.</ref> Related histories by [[Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|A.H.M. Jones]] (''Constantine and the Conversion of Europe'' (1949)) and [[Ramsay MacMullen]] (''Constantine'' (1969)) gave portraits of a less visionary, and more impulsive, Constantine.<ref>Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 8.</ref>

These later accounts were more willing to present Constantine as a genuine convert to Christianity. Beginning with [[Norman H. Baynes]]' ''Constantine the Great and the Christian Church'' (1929) and reinforced by [[Andreas Alföldi]]'s ''The Conversion of Constantine and Pagan Rome'' (1948), a historiographic tradition developed which presented Constantine as a committed Christian. [[Timothy Barnes|T. D. Barnes]]'s seminal ''Constantine and Eusebius'' (1981) represents the culmination of this trend. Barnes' Constantine experienced a radical conversion, which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire.<ref>Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 8–9; Odahl, 283.</ref> Charles Matson Odahl's recent ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004) takes much the same tack.<ref>Odahl, 283; Mark Humphries, "Constantine," review of ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', by Charles Odahl, ''Classical Quarterly'' 56:2 (2006), 449.</ref> In spite of Barnes' work, arguments over the strength and depth of Constantine's religious conversion continue.<ref>Averil Cameron, "Introduction," in ''Constantine: History, Historiography, and Legend'', ed. Samuel N.C. Lieu and [[Dominic Montserrat]] (New York: Routledge, 1998), 3.</ref> Certain themes in this school reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott's ''The Christianity of Constantine the Great'' (1996), which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood.<ref>Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 10.</ref> A similar view of Constantine is held in [[Paul Veyne]]'s recent (2007) work, ''Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien'', which does not speculate on the origins of Constantine's Christian motivation, but presents him, in his role as Emperor, as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed himself meant "to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity".<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6404/is_2_69/ai_n29437350/?tag=content;col1 Quand notre monde est devenu chretien], Fabian E. Udoh, review, ''Theological Studies'', June 2008</ref>

===Donation of Constantine===
{{main|Donation of Constantine}}
[[Latin Rite]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] considered it inappropriate that Constantine was baptized only on his death-bed and by an unorthodox bishop, as it undermined the authority of the Papacy. Hence, by the early fourth century, a legend had emerged that [[Pope Sylvester I]] (314–35) had cured the pagan emperor from [[leprosy]]. According to this legend, Constantine was soon baptized, and began the construction of a church in the [[Lateran Palace]].<ref>Lieu, "Constantine in Legendary Literature" (CC), 298–301.</ref> In the eighth century, most likely during the pontificate of [[Pope Stephen II|Stephen II]] (752–7), a document called the [[Donation of Constantine]] first appeared, in which the freshly converted Constantine hands the temporal rule over "the city of [[Rome]] and all the provinces, districts, and cities of [[Italy]] and the Western regions" to Sylvester and his successors.<ref>''Constitutum Constantini'' 17, qtd. in Lieu, "Constantine in Legendary Literature" (CC), 301–3.</ref> In the [[High Middle Ages]], this document was used and accepted as the basis for the Pope's [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], though it was denounced as a forgery by Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]<ref>Henry Charles Lea, "The 'Donation of Constantine'". ''The English Historical Review'' 10: 37 (1895), 86–7.</ref> and lamented as the root of papal worldliness by the poet [[Dante Alighieri]].<ref>''Inferno'' 19.115; ''Paradisio'' 20.55; cf. ''De Monarchia'' 3.10.</ref> The 15th century philologist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved the document was indeed a forgery.<ref>Fubini, 79–86; Lenski, "Introduction" (CC), 6.</ref>

===Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia''===
Because of his fame and his being proclaimed Emperor in the territory of [[Roman Britain]], later [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] regarded Constantine as a king of their own people. In the 12th century [[Henry of Huntingdon]] included a passage in his ''Historia Anglorum'' that Constantine's mother Helena was a Briton, the daughter of [[King Cole]] of [[Colchester]].<ref>Henry of Huntingdon, ''Historia Anglorum'', Book I, ch. 37.</ref> [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] expanded this story in his highly fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', an account of the supposed [[list of legendary kings of Britain|Kings of Britain]] from their [[Troy|Trojan]] origins to the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]].<ref name="Greenway">{{cite book |last= Greenway|first1= Diana (Ed.) |coauthors= Henry of Huntingdon|title= Historia Anglorum: The History of the English People|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1996|month= |isbn= 0-19-822224-6|page=civ}}</ref> According to Geoffrey, Cole was King of the Britons when Constantius, here a senator, came to Britain. Afraid of the Romans, Cole submitted to Roman law so long as he retained his kingship. However, he died only a month later, and Constantius took the throne himself, marrying Cole's daughter Helena. They had their son Constantine, who succeeded his father as King of Britain before becoming Roman Emperor.

Historically, this series of events is extremely improbable. Constantius had already left Helena by the time he left for Britain.<ref name="marriage"/> Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though it may have been a lost hagiography of Helena.<ref name="Greenway"/>

==Constantine in popular culture==
Constantine was played by [[Cornel Wilde]] in the 1962 film ''[[Constantine and the Cross]]'' (U.S. title) / ''Constantine the Great'' (U.K. title).

''Constantine: The Miracle of the Flaming Cross'' is a romanticised, novelised account of Constantine's life written by American author [[Frank G. Slaughter]] and published in 1965. It largely drew on [[Edward Gibbon]]'s history of the Roman Empire as well as [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s contemporary account, as indicated in the afterword of the original edition.<ref>Frank G. Slaughter, ''Constantine: The Miracle of the Flaming Cross'', Doubleday & Company, 1965.</ref>
