'''Carbamazepine''' ('''CBZ''') (Tegretol, Equetro) is an [[anticonvulsant]] and [[mood stabilizer|mood-stabilizing]] drug used primarily in the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and [[bipolar disorder]], as well as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. It is also used [[off-label use|off-label]] for a variety of indications, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[schizophrenia]], [[phantom limb]] syndrome, [[complex regional pain syndrome]], [[paroxysmal extreme pain disorder]], [[neuromyotonia]], [[intermittent explosive disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], [[Myotonia congenita]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Like other [[anticonvulsant]]s, intrauterine exposure is associated with [[spina bifida]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jentink |first=J |coauthors=Dolk, H, Loane, MA, Morris, JK, Wellesley, D, Garne, E, de Jong-van den Berg, L, EUROCAT Antiepileptic Study Working, Group |title=Intrauterine exposure to carbamazepine and specific congenital malformations: systematic review and case-control study |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |date=2010-12-02 |volume=341 |pages=c6581 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c6581 |pmid=21127116 |pmc=2996546}}</ref> and [[neurodevelopmental]] problems.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cummings |first=C |coauthors=Stewart, M, Stevenson, M, Morrow, J, Nelson, J |title=Neurodevelopment of children exposed in utero to lamotrigine, sodium valproate and carbamazepine |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |date=2011-03-17 |pmid=21415043 |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=643–7 |doi=10.1136/adc.2009.176990}}</ref>

==Medical uses==
Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of [[seizure]] disorders and [[neuropathic pain]].<ref name=AHFS>{{cite web |title=Carbamazepine |url=http://www.drugs.com/monograph/carbamazepine.html |work=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |accessdate=3 April 2011}}</ref> It may be used as a second line treatment for [[bipolar disorder]] and along with [[antipsychotic agents]] in [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=AHFS/>

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved indications are [[epilepsy]] (including [[partial seizure]]s and [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s), [[trigeminal neuralgia]], and [[mania|manic]] and [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episodes]] of [[bipolar I disorder]].<ref name=Lexi-Comp/> Although data are still lacking, carbamazepine appears to be as effective and safe as [[lithium pharmacology|lithium]] for the treatment of bipolar disorder, both in the acute and maintenance phase.<ref name="Ceron-Litvoc">{{cite journal |author=Ceron-Litvoc D, Soares BG, Geddes J, Litvoc J, de Lima MS |title=Comparison of carbamazepine and lithium in treatment of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials |journal=Hum Psychopharmacol |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=19–28 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19053079 |doi=10.1002/hup.990}}</ref>

==Adverse effects==
Common [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]] may include drowsiness, headaches and migraines, [[motor coordination]] impairment, and/or upset stomach. Carbamazepine preparations typically greatly decrease a person's alcohol tolerance.

Less common side-effects may include cardiac arrhythmias, blurry or double [[Visual perception|vision]] and/or the temporary loss of [[blood cell]]s or [[platelet]]s and in rare cases can cause [[aplastic anemia]] or [[agranulocytosis]]. With normal use, small reductions in white cell count and serum sodium are common; however, in rare cases, the loss of platelets may become life-threatening. In this case a doctor may recommend frequent blood tests during the first few months of use, followed by three to four tests per year for established patients. Additionally, carbamazepine may possibly exacerbate preexisting cases of [[hypothyroidism]], so yearly thyroid function tests are advisable for persons taking the drug.

There are also rare reports of an auditory side-effect for carbamazepine use, whereby patients perceive sounds about a [[semitone]] lower than previously.<ref name="pmid12581810">{{cite journal |author=Yoshikawa H, Abe T |title=Carbamazepine-induced abnormal pitch perception |journal=Brain Dev. |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=127–9 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12581810 |doi= 10.1016/S0387-7604(02)00155-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0387760402001559}}</ref><ref name="pmid14518681">{{cite journal |author=Konno S, Yamazaki E, Kudoh M, Abe T, Tohgi H |title=Half pitch lower sound perception caused by carbamazepine |journal=Intern.

[[Oxcarbazepine]], a derivative of carbamazepine, reportedly has fewer and less serious side-effects.

Carbamazepine may cause [[syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone]] (SIADH), since it both increases the release and potentiates the action of ADH ([[vasopressin]]).

Carbamazepine may aggravate [[juvenile myoclonic epilepsy]], so it is important to uncover any history of jerking, especially in the morning, before starting the drug. It may also aggravate other types of generalized seizure disorder, particularly [[absence seizures]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1124/jpet.106.10496 |title=The Mechanism of Carbamazepine Aggravation of Absence Seizures |year=2006 |author=Lige Liu, Thomas Zheng, Margaret J.

The FDA informed health care professionals that dangerous or even fatal skin reactions ([[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]]), that can be caused by carbamazepine therapy, are significantly more common in patients with a particular [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) allele, [[HLA-B75|HLA-B*1502]].

===Environmental impact===
Carbamazepine can enter the environment through discharge of [[wastewater]], and has also been shown to persist and accumulate in the organic components of soil and sludge.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stamatelatou K, Frouda C, Fountoulakis MS, Drillia P, Kornaros M, Lyberatos G |title=Pharmaceuticals and health care products in wastewater effluents: the example of carbamazepine |journal=Water Science Technology Water Supply |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=131–137 |date=January 2003 |doi= |url=http://www.iwaponline.com/ws/00304/0131/003040131.pdf |deadurl=no}}</ref> As carbamazepine is an emerging contaminant,<ref>i.e. one that is relatively new, and still unregulated in terms of its discharge to the environment</ref> the effects of its [[bioaccumulation]] on other living creatures and plants are not well-understood.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but well absorbed after oral administration. Its plasma half life is about 30 hours when it is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes and the plasma half-life shortens to about 15 hours when it is given repeatedly. Some of its metabolites have antiepileptic properties. A slow-release preparation is used for patients who experience transit side effects coinciding with plasma concentration peaks following oral dosing.

==Mechanism of action==
The mechanism of action of carbamazepine and its derivatives is relatively well-understood. Carbamazepine stabilizes the inactivated state of [[Voltage-gated sodium channel]]s, making fewer of these channels available to subsequently open. This leaves the affected cells less excitable until the drug dissociates. Carbamazepine has also been shown to potentiate [[GABA receptor]]s made up of alpha1, beta2, gamma2 subunits.<ref>Granger, P. et al. Modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor by the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and phenytoin. Mol. Pharmacol. 47, 1189–1196 (1995).</ref>This may be relevant to its efficacy in neuropathic pain and manic-depressive illness.

==History==
Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of [[Novartis]]) in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], in 1953.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schindler W, Häfliger F |title=Über Derivate des Iminodibenzyls |journal=[[Helvetica Chimica Acta]] |year=1954 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=472–83. |doi=10.1002/hlca.19540370211}}</ref> Schindler then synthesized the drug in 1960, before its anti-epileptic properties had been discovered.

Carbamazepine was first marketed as a drug to treat [[trigeminal neuralgia]] (formerly known as tic douloureux) in 1962. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] since 1965, and has been approved in the [[United States|US]] since 1974.

In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka first used carbamazepine to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics ([[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] was not available in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same thing with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the anti-aggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine would be studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.<ref name="pmid9682927">{{cite journal |author=Okuma T, Kishimoto A |title=A history of investigation on the mood stabilizing effect of carbamazepine in Japan |journal=Psychiatry Clin.
