'''Ahmed II Khan Ghazi''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: احمد ثانى ''Aḥmed-i <u>s</u>ānī'') <span dir="ltr">(February 25, 1643 – February 6, 1695)</span> was the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1691 to 1695. Ahmed II was born at [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Constantinople]], the son of Sultan [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim]] (1640&ndash;48) by [[Valide Sultan]] [[Hatice Muazzez]], and succeeded his brother [[Suleiman II]] (1687&ndash;91) in 1691.

==Reign==
Ahmed II's best known act was to confirm [[Mustafa Köprülü]] as [[grand vizier]]. Only a few weeks after his accession the Ottoman Empire sustained a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] from the [[Austria]]ns under Margrave [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis William]] of [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and was driven from [[Hungary]]. During the four years of his reign disaster followed on disaster, and in 1695 Ahmed II died at [[Edirne]] Palace, worn out by disease and sorrow.
