In [[classical logic]] '''disjunctive syllogism'''<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |page=362 |isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=320–1 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> (historically known as '''modus tollendo ponens''') is a [[validity|valid]] [[argument form]]  which is a [[syllogism]] having a [[Logical disjunction|disjunctive statement]] for one of its [[premise]]s.<ref>Hurley</ref><ref>Copi and Cohen</ref> 

:Either the breach is a safety violation, or it is not subject to fines.
:The breach is not a safety violation.
:Therefore, it is not subject to fines.

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], '''disjunctive syllogism''' (also known as '''disjunction elimination''' and '''or elimination''', or abbreviated '''∨E'''),<ref>Sanford, David Hawley. 2003. ''If P, Then Q: Conditionals and the Foundations of Reasoning''. London, UK: Routledge: 39</ref><ref>Hurley</ref><ref>Copi and Cohen</ref><ref>Moore and Parker</ref> is a valid [[rule of inference]]. If we are told that at least one of two statements is true; and also told that it is not the former that is true; we can [[inference|infer]] that it has to be the latter that is true. If either ''P'' or ''Q'' is true and ''P'' is false, then ''Q'' is true. The reason this is called "disjunctive syllogism" is that, first, it is a syllogism, a three-step [[argument]], and second, it contains a logical disjunction, which simply means an  "or" statement.  "Either P or Q" is a disjunction; P and Q are called the statement's ''disjuncts''.  The rule makes it possible to eliminate a [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] from a [[formal proof|logical proof]]. It is the rule that:

:<math>\frac{P \or Q, \neg P}{\therefore Q}</math>

where the rule is that whenever instances of "<math>P \or Q</math>", and "<math>\neg P</math>" appear on lines of a proof, "<math>Q</math>" can be placed on a subsequent line.

Disjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to [[hypothetical syllogism]], in that it is also type of syllogism, and also the name of a rule of inference.

== Formal notation ==
The ''disjunctive syllogism'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: <math> P \lor Q, \lnot P \vdash Q </math>

where <math>\vdash</math> is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that <math>Q</math> is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of <math>P \lor Q</math>, and <math>\lnot P</math> in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:<math> ((P \or Q) \and \neg P) \to Q</math>

where <math>P</math>, and <math>Q</math> are propositions expressed in some formal system.

== Natural language examples ==
Here is an example:
:Either I will choose soup or I will choose salad.
:I will not choose soup.
:Therefore, I will choose salad.

Here is another example:
:It is either red or blue.
:It is not blue.
:Therefore, it is red.

== Inclusive and exclusive disjunction ==
Please observe that the disjunctive syllogism works whether 'or' is considered 'exclusive' or 'inclusive' disjunction. See below for the definitions of these terms.

There are two kinds of logical disjunction:

* ''[[logical disjunction|inclusive]]'' means "and/or"  - at least one of them is true, or maybe both.
* ''[[xor|exclusive]]'' ("xor") means exactly one must be true, but they cannot both be.

The widely used English language concept of ''or'' is often ambiguous between these two meanings, but the difference is pivotal in evaluating disjunctive arguments. 

This argument:
:Either P or Q.
:Not P.
:Therefore, Q.

is valid and indifferent between both meanings. However, only in the ''exclusive'' meaning is the following form valid:

:Either P or Q (exclusive).
:P.
:Therefore, not Q.

With the ''inclusive'' meaning you could draw no conclusion from the first two premises of that argument. See [[affirming a disjunct]].

==Related argument forms==

Unlike [[modus ponendo ponens]] and [[modus ponendo tollens]], with which it should not be confused, disjunctive syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of [[logical system]]s, as the above arguments can be proven with a (slightly devious) combination of [[reductio ad absurdum]] and [[disjunction elimination]].

''Other forms of syllogism:'' 
*[[hypothetical syllogism]]
*[[categorical syllogism]]

Disjunctive syllogism holds in classical propositional logic and [[intuitionistic logic]], but not in some [[paraconsistent logic]]s.<ref>Chris Mortensen, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/ Inconsistent Mathematics], ''Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy'', First published Tue Jul 2, 1996; substantive revision Thu Jul 31, 2008</ref>
