The '''cello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|CHEL|oh}}; plural '''cellos''' or '''celli''') is a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] with four strings [[intonation (music)|tuned]] in [[perfect fifth]]s. It is a member of the [[violin family]] of musical instruments, which also includes the [[violin]], [[viola]] and double bass.

The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in [[chamber music]] ensembles, [[string orchestra]]s, and as a member of the [[string section]] of [[symphony orchestra]]s. It is the second-largest [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern symphony orchestra, the [[double bass]] being the largest.

Cellos were derived from other mid- to large-sized bowed instruments in the 16th century, such as the [[viola da gamba]], and the generally smaller and squarer [[viola da braccio]], and such instruments made by members of the [[Amati]] family of [[luthier]]s. The invention of wire-wrapped strings in Bologna gave the cello greater versatility. By the 18th century, the cello had largely replaced other mid-sized bowed instruments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

A person who plays the cello is called a '''cellist'''.

==Etymology==
The name ''cello'' is an abbreviation of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'',<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violoncello|title=Violencello|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-26}}</ref> which means "little [[violone]]", referring to the [[violone]] ("big viol"), the lowest-pitched instrument of the [[viol]] family, the group of string instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century or so before the louder [[violin]] family came into greater favour in that country too.  In modern symphonies, it is the second largest stringed instrument after the bass. Thus, the name cello carries both an [[augmentative]] ''"-one"'' ("big") and a [[diminutive]] ''"-cello"'' ("little"). By the turn of the 20th century, it had grown customary to abbreviate the name violoncello to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the six missing prefix letters.<ref name="countess">Delbanco, Nicholas. (January 1, 2001) [[Harper's Bazaar]]. ''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html The Countess of Stanlein Restored]. (Violoncello owned by [[Bernard Greenhouse]] is restored).'' Volume 302; Issue 1808; Page 39.</ref> It is now customary to use the name "cello" without the apostrophe and as a full designation.<ref name="countess"/> The word derives ultimately from ''vitula'', meaning a stringed instrument.

==Description==
[[Image:Cello study.jpg|thumb|Cello close-up]]
[[Image:Violoncello open strings.png|thumb|Cello open strings. {{audio|Violoncello open strings actual.mid|Play}}]]
Cellos are tuned in [[perfect fifth|fifths]], starting with [[Scientific pitch notation|A3]], followed by D3, G2, and then C2 (two [[octave]]s below [[middle C]]) as the lowest string. It is tuned in the same intervals as the [[viola]], but an octave lower. Unlike the [[violin]] or [[viola]] but similar to the [[double bass]], the cello has an [[endpin]] that rests on the floor to support the instrument's weight.

The cello is most closely associated with European classical music, and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the male human voice.<ref>[http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&jid=ajcb&theme=2&issueno=4&articleno=17# Welcome::. to Academic Journals Inc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The instrument is a part of the standard [[orchestra]] and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]], as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups. A large number of [[cello concerto|concertos]] and [[cello sonata|sonatas]] have been written for the cello.

Among the most well-known [[Baroque]] works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s six unaccompanied [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites]]. The ''Prelude'' from the ''First Suite'' is particularly famous. From the [[Classical music era|Classical era]], the two concertos by [[Joseph Haydn]] in [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|C major]] and [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Haydn)|D major]] stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] repertoire includes the [[Robert Schumann]] [[Cello Concerto (Schumann)|Concerto]], the [[Antonín Dvořák]] [[Cello Concerto (Dvořák)|Concerto]] as well as the two sonatas and the [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] by [[Johannes Brahms]]. Compositions from the early 20th century include [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto in E minor]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Debussy)|Sonata for Cello and Piano]], and unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Paul Hindemith]]. The cello's versatility made it popular with composers in the mid- to late-20th century such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]] and [[Henri Dutilleux]], encouraged by soloists who specialized in contemporary music (such as [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]) commissioning from and collaborating with composers.

The cello is increasingly common in traditional fiddle music, especially Scottish fiddle music. Well known players include [[Natalie Haas]] and [[Mike Block]].

Today the instrument is less common in [[popular music]], but was commonly used in 1970s pop and [[disco]] music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Today it is still sometimes featured in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major [[hip-hop]] and [[R & B]] performances, such as singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]'s performance at the [[American Music Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The instrument has also been modified for [[Indian classical music]] by [[Nancy Lesh]] and [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]].<ref>{{cite web

==History==
The history of [[Bow (music)|bowed]] string [[musical instrument]]s in Europe dates back to the 9th century with the ''[[Byzantine lyra|lira]]'' (''Greek: λύρα, Latin: lūrā''), the bowed instrument of the [[Byzantine Empire]], equivalent to the [[rabāb]] of the Islamic Empires. The [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d. 911) of the 9th century, in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, cited the [[Byzantine lyra|Byzantine lira]] as a typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the ''urghun'' (organ), ''shilyani'' (probably a type of harp or lyre) and the ''salandj''.<ref>Margaret J. Kartomi: On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments. Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology, University of Chicago Press, 1990</ref> The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Byzantine lyra|lira]] spread through Europe westward and in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms ''[[fiddle]]'' and ''[[Byzantine lira|lira]]'' interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments (Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009). In the meantime the Arab [[rabāb]] was introduced to Western Europe possibly through the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and both bowed instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments.
[[Image:LBoccherini.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Luigi Boccherini]] playing the cello circa 1764-67]]
Over the centuries that followed, Europe continued to have two distinct types of bowed instruments: the first type was held with the left arm like a modern [[violin]] and was known by the Italian term '''lira da braccio''' (or ''[[viola da braccio]]'', meaning ''viol for the arm''); the other type, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees like a modern cello, was known by the Italian term '''[[lira da gamba]]''' (or ''viola da gamba'', meaning ''viol for the leg''), and included the [[Byzantine lyra]].<ref>stringed instrument. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved March 14, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569200/stringed-instrument (Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009)</ref> During the [[Renaissance]], the gambas were important and elegant instruments; they eventually lost ground to the louder (and originally less aristocratic){{citation needed|date=July 2012}} ''[[lira da braccio]]''.

{{anchor|Violoncello da spalla}}The violoncello da spalla (sometimes "violoncello piccolo da spalla" or "violoncello da span") was the first cello referred to in print (by [[Philibert Jambe de Fer|Jambe de Fer]] in 1556).<ref name="countess"/> "[[Violone]]" means a [[Augmentative|larger]] "viola" ([[viol]]), while "-cello" in Italian is a diminutive and spalla means "shoulder" in Italian so that violoncello da spalla suggest a "little big violin" that may be held on the shoulder so that the player could perform while walking or that the early, short-necked instrument was hung across the shoulder by a strap.<ref name="countess"/>

Monteverdi referred to the instrument as "basso de viola da braccio" in ''Orfeo'' (1607). Although the first [[bass violin]], possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consorts with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a ''"violone,"'' or "large viola," as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the ''viola da gamba'' appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.

The invention of wire-wound [[strings (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[double bass|basses]] or [[violone]]s.

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}<!--I believe you, I would just like to know where you got the info--> Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by [[Stradivarius]], who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').<ref name = "vrzuok">Cyr 1982</ref>  The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.<ref name = "vrzuok"/> The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite similarities to the [[viol|viola da gamba]], the cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning "viol of the arm," which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]].  Though paintings like [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s "The Rustic Wedding" and de Fer in his ''Epitome Musical'' suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic ''a gamba'' position eventually replaced them entirely.

[[Image:Cello strung gut.JPG|thumb|right|A baroque cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.]]
[[Baroque]] era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways.  The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

No educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. The earliest cello manual is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).

===Orchestral===
[[File:FHM-Orchestra-mk2006-03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cello section of the Orchestra of the Munich University of Applied Sciences is shown here.]]
Cellos are part of the standard [[symphony orchestra]], which usually includes eight to twelve players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'' cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, and playing solos. Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.

There are numerous [[cello concerto]]s - where a solo cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]] -  notably 25 by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], 12 by [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]], at least 3 by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], 3 by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]], 2 by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], 2 by [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], and one each by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]], and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar "concertos" are [[Richard Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'', [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]]'s ''[[Schelomo]]'' and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]'s ''[[Kol Nidrei (Bruch)|Kol Nidrei]]''.

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] who inspired, commissioned and/or premiered dozens of new works. Among these, [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''Symphonia Concertante'', [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''Cello Symphony'', the concertos of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]] and [[Witold Lutosławski|Lutosławski]] as well as [[Henri Dutilleux|Dutilleux]]'s ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'' have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]. In addition, [[Malcolm Arnold|Arnold]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], [[György Ligeti|Ligeti]], [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]], [[Joaquín Rodrigo|Rodrigo]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] and [[William Walton|Walton]] also wrote major [[List of compositions for cello and orchestra|concertos]] for other cellists, notably for [[Gaspar Cassadó]], [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]].

There are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Elliott Carter|Carter]], and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are the most famous. Other important pieces for cello and piano include [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s five ''Stücke im Volkston'' and transcriptions like [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Arpeggione Sonata]] (originally for [[arpeggione]] and piano), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)#Suite italienne|Suite italienne]]'' (transcribed by the composer from his ballet ''Pulcinella'') and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano)

There are pieces for [[List of solo cello pieces|cello solo]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s  six [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites for Cello]] (arguably the most important cello pieces), [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Kodály)|Sonata for Solo Cello]] and Britten's three [[Cello Suites (Britten)|Cello Suites]]. Other notable examples include [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s and [[Eugène Ysaÿe|Ysaÿe]]'s Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's ''Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'', Berio's ''Les Mots Sont Allés'' (both part of a series of twelve compositions for solo cello commissioned by Rostropovich for Swiss conductor [[Paul Sacher]]'s 70th birthday), [[Gaspar Cassadó|Cassadó]]'s Suite for Solo Cello, [[György Ligeti|Ligeti]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|Solo Sonata]], Carter's two ''Figment''s and [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]' ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' and ''Kottos''.

===Quartets and other ensembles===
The cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]] as well as [[string quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]] and other mixed ensembles.
There are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a "cello choir" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to [[Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture]] as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in [[Verdi]]'s [[Nabucco]]. As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is [[Villa-Lobos]]' first of his [[Bachianas Brasileiras]] for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s cello duets, quartet, and sextet, [[Pärt]]'s [[Fratres]] for 8 cellos and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]' ''Messagesquisse'' for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played ''Fantasia Concertante'' (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or "the Twelve" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.

===Popular music, jazz, world music and neoclassical===
Though the cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in classical music, it is sometimes featured in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] recordings. The cello is rarely part of a group's standard lineup but like its cousin the [[violin]] it is becoming more common in mainstream pop (e.g., the [[baroque rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]] uses the cello in their songs).
[[File:Apocalyptica - Ilosaarirock 2009.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Apocalyptica]] at the 2009 [[Ilosaarirock]] festival.]]
In the 1960s, artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Cher]] used the cello in popular music, in songs such as "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]", "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]". "[[Good Vibrations]]" by [[the Beach Boys]] includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music.  Bass guitarist [[Jack Bruce]], who had  originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in "As You Said" on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' studio album (1968). 
In the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called "Beatlesque" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, [[Colosseum II]], collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental "[[Atom Heart Mother]]".  Bass guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' album.

Established non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]] who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, [[Cello Fury]], a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave ([http://www.jelloslave.com]) a Minneapolis based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are [[Russia]]n (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in [[Siberia]]. [[Cold Fairyland]] from [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is using a cello along a [[Pipa]] as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.

More recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[The Auteurs]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Murder by Death (band)|Murder by Death]], [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]], [[A Genuine Freakshow]], [[Ra Ra Riot]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[James (band)|James]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Phillip Phillips]], and [[OneRepublic]]. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called "chamber pop" artists like [[Kronos Quartet]], The Vitamin String Quartet and [[Margot and the Nuclear So and So's]] have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band [[Canada (music group)|Canada]] employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, [[The Polyphonic Spree]], which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their "[[psychedelia|psychedelic]]-esque" melodies. The first wave [[screamo]] band ''I Would Set Myself On Fire For You'' featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented sound. The band, [[Panic! At the Disco]] uses a cello in their song, "Build God, Then We'll Talk." The lead vocalist of the band, [[Brendon Urie]], also did the recording of the cello solo.

In [[jazz]], bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass.  [[Fred Katz (cellist)|Fred Katz]] (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique.  Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud (musician)|Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]], [[Lucio Amanti]], Akua Dixon, [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Tom Cora]], Vincent Courtois, John O'Keefe, Stephan Braun,  Jean-Charles Capon, [[Erik Friedlander]], [[Enrico Guerzoni]] and James Hinkley of jazz combo ''Billet-Deux''.

Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's [[The Last Five Years]], Duncan Sheik's [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]], Adam Guettel's [[Floyd Collins (musical)|Floyd Collins]], and Ricky Ian Gordon's [[My Life with Albertine]] use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.

In Indian Classical music [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]] is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. [[Shubhendra Rao]]. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh ( Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.

The cello can also be used in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]], with notable players including [[Ben Sollee]] of the [[Sparrow Quartet]] and the "Cajun cellist" Sean Grissom as well as [[Damien Rice]]. [[Lindsay Mac]] is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Blackbird (song)|Blackbird]]" a big hit on ''[[The Bob & Tom Show]]''.

==Construction==
[[File:Cello Parts.jpg|thumb|Cello Main Parts|230px]]
The cello is typically made from wood, although other materials such as [[carbon fiber]] or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of [[Plywood|laminated wood]].

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[F holes]] just below the middle.

The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]]. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Alternative materials===
Cello manufacturer [[Luis and Clark|Luis & Clark]] constructs cellos from [[carbon fibre]].  Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & Clark has produced over 1000 such cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]]<ref>stringed instrument. (2009). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved May 23, 2009, from The New York Times Online: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/arts/music/19carb.html (NY Times. Jan. 18, 2009 "The Sound of Carbon for Yo-Yo Ma?" by Chris Museler)</ref> and [[Josephine van Lier]].<ref>LUIS AND CLARK Carbon Fibre Cello: http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf</ref> In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).

===Neck, fingerboard, pegbox, and scroll===
Above the main body is the carved neck, which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually [[maple]]. The [[fingerboard]] is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The scroll is a traditional part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as [[Buxus|boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inferior wood that has been blackened or "ebonized" to look like [[ebony]] which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.

[[String (music)|Strings]] on a cello have cores made out of [[Catgut|gut]] (sheep or goat), metal, or synthetic materials, such as [[nylon|Perlon]]. Most modern strings used today are also wound with metallic materials like aluminum, titanium and chromium. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning ([[scordatura]]) is specified by the composer.

===Tailpiece and endpin===
The [[tailpiece]] and [[endpin]] are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]]. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves. The endpin was "introduced by Adrien Servais c. 1845 to give the instrument greater stability".<ref name="hist">{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to the Cello|last= Dilworth |first= John |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York, New York|ISBN=0521621011 |page= 14|pages= }}</ref> Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word "endpin" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called "tailpin".<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569200/stringed-instrument</ref>) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor.

===Bridge and f-holes===
[[Image:Cello bridge2.JPG|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute (the mute is not in use)]]
The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The [[sound-hole|f-holes]], named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a [[Dampit]], is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier.

===Internal features===
Internally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to produce the instrument's 
sound

===Glue===
Cellos are constructed and repaired using [[hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate doesn't crack.

===Bow===
[[Image:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A cello French bow<ref group="nb">as opposed to the German bow popular in baroque era, held underhand [[:File:Lute-viol ABosse Fr 1635.jpg]] [[:File:Viol Abel TGainsborough1765.jpg]](''see'' [[Viol]]) used with the [[double bass]]</ref> ''[[Cello#Sul ponticello and sul tasto|sul ponticello]]'']]
Traditionally, [[bow (music)|bows]] are made from pernambuco or [[brazilwood]]. Both come from the same species of tree (''Caesalpina echinata''), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, <!--and high sound velocity-->which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows.

Bows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, low-quality student bows). An average cello bow is 73&nbsp;cm long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) 3&nbsp;cm high (from the frog to the stick) and 1.5&nbsp;cm wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly 10&nbsp;grams heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly 10&nbsp;grams heavier than a violin bow. <!-- for example, see http://www.codabow.com/info_buyfirstbow.html -->

Bow hair is traditionally [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. [[Rosin]] is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically.

[[Baroque]] style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.

The cello bow has also been used to play [[guitar]]s. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as "[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]." The [[post-rock]] [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] band [[Sigur Rós]]' lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.

In 1989, the German cellist [[Michael Bach (musician)|Michael Bach]] began developing a [[curved bow]], encouraged by [[John Cage]], [[Dieter Schnebel]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] and [[Luigi Colani]]: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (''BACH.Bow'') is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument.  The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.

==Physics==

===Physical aspects===
When a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved, and consequently the sound is weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.<ref>Cowling, Elizabeth. The Cello. New Edition. Charles Scribner’s Sons. 1975. ISBN 0-684-17870-2. pp 1 – 50</ref>

A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion.<ref name="Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244">Bloomfield, Louis A. How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life. Second Edition. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2001. ISBN 0-471-38151-9. pp 241-244</ref> A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.

A string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass. Since a stiffer string with a smaller mass vibrates faster, shortening a string increases the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it.<ref name="Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244"/>

A loud beating sound results between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “wolf tone” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator, or moving the sound post.<ref name="Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329">Berg, Richard E. Stork, David G. The Physics of Sound. Third edition. Pearson Education, Inc. 2005. ISBN 0-13-145789-6. pp 314, 329-330.</ref>

When a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the fundamental note is accompanied by higher frequency overtones. Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.<ref>Chattopadhyay, D. Elements of Physics, Volume 1. New Age International Publishers, 2004.

==Playing technique==
{{main|Cello technique}}

==Sizes==
[[Image:Full size and fractional cello.jpg|thumb|1/8 size cello with full size cello]]
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as "full-size" or "4/4" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. 7/8, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, 1/16). The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.

Cellos in sizes larger than 4/4 do exist and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly-played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of [[Stradivari]], for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari, began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers.  The [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of 4/4 cello is about {{convert|27.5|in|cm}}. The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offrered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.<ref name="size">{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|last= Stowell |first= Robin |authorlink= |year= 2003|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York, New York|ISBN=0521000424|page= |pages=23–24}}</ref>

==Accessories==
There are many accessories for the cello.
*Cases are used to protect the cello and bow (or multiple bows) .
[[File:Rosins.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rosin is applied to bow hairs to increase the "bite" of the bow on the strings.]]
*[[Rosin]], made from [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[resin]], is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production.  Rosin may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin.  Commonly, rosins are classified as either Dark or Light. 
*[[Endpin]] stops or straps (tradenames include Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the end pin does not have a rubber piece on the end .
*[[Wolf tone eliminator]]s are placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as [[wolf tone]]s or "wolfs".
*[[Mute (music)#String|Mutes]] are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing [[overtones]]. 
[[Image:Wolf tone eliminator.jpg|thumb|150px|A brass wolf tone eliminator typically placed on the G string (second string from the left) of a cello, between the bridge and the tailpiece. (The black rubber piece on the D string (third from the left) is a [[mute (music)|mute]].)]]
*[[Metronome]]s provide a steady [[tempo]] by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute.

==Instrument makers==

[[File:Servais Stradivarius.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The Servais Stradivarius is preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]]]
Specific instruments are, or become, famous, for a variety of reasons.   An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers.  The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things.  The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians.  These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which loans the instrument to a performer.  (For example, the [[Davidov Stradivarius]], which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, [[Yo-Yo Ma]], is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Beare | first=Charles | coauthors=Carlson, Bruce | chapter=Foreword by Yo-Yo Ma  | title=Antonio Stradivari: The Cremona Exhibition of 1987| location=London | publisher=J. & A.
