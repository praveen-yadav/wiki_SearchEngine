'''David Hume''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|juː|m}}; {{OldStyleDate|7 May|1711|26 April}}{{spaced ndash}}25 August 1776) was a Scottish [[philosopher]], historian, economist, and essayist known especially for his philosophical [[empiricism]] and [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. He was one of the most important figures in the history of [[Western philosophy]] and the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/enlightenment/features_enlightenment_enlightenment.shtml}}</ref> Hume is often grouped with [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and a handful of others as a [[British Empiricism|British Empiricist]].<ref>Margaret Atherton, ed. ''The Empiricists: Critical Essays on Locke, Berkeley, and Hume''. [[Lanham, MD]]: [[Rowman & Littlefield]], 1999.</ref>

Beginning with his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739), Hume strove to create a total [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] "[[science of man]]" that examined the [[psychological]] basis of [[human nature]]. In stark opposition to the [[rationalists]] who preceded him, most notably [[René Descartes|Descartes]], he concluded that [[desire (emotion)|desire]] rather than [[reason]] governed human behavior, saying: "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~jjeffrey/Hume%20Files--start%20with%20B3/B2.3.3.html|title=A Treatise of Human Nature, by David Hume (B2.3.3)|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref> A prominent figure in the sceptical philosophical tradition and a strong empiricist, he argued against the existence of [[innate ideas]], concluding instead that humans have knowledge only of things they directly experience. Thus he divides perceptions between strong and lively "impressions" or direct sensations and fainter "ideas", which are copied from impressions. He developed the position that mental behaviour is governed by "custom", that is acquired ability; [[problem of induction|our use of induction]], for example, is justified only by our idea of the "constant conjunction" of causes and effects. Without direct impressions of a metaphysical "self", he concluded that humans have no actual conception of the self, only of a [[bundle theory|bundle of sensations]] associated with the self.

Hume advocated a [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] theory of [[free will]] that proved extremely influential on subsequent [[moral philosophy]]. He was also a [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalist]] who held that ethics are based on feelings rather than abstract moral principles. Hume also examined the normative [[is–ought problem]]. He held notoriously ambiguous views of [[Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/hume-religion |title=Hume on Religion |author=Paul Russel |date=17 May 2010 |work=First published October 4, 2005 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2008 Edition) |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> but famously challenged the [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1777).

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] credited Hume with waking him up from his "dogmatic slumbers" and Hume has proved extremely influential on subsequent philosophy, especially on [[utilitarianism]], [[logical positivism]], [[William James]], [[philosophy of science]], early [[analytic philosophy]], cognitive philosophy, and other movements and thinkers. The philosopher [[Jerry Fodor]] proclaimed Hume's ''Treatise'' "the founding document of [[cognitive science]]".<ref>Fodor, Jerry. ''Hume Variations''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2003, p. 134.</ref> Also famous as a prose stylist,<ref>Saintsbury, George, ed. ''Specimens of English Prose Style: From Malory to Macaulay''. London: Macmillan & Co., 1907, p. 196.</ref> Hume pioneered the [[essay]] as a literary genre and engaged with contemporary intellectual luminaries such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]] (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his [[economics]] and [[political philosophy]]), [[James Boswell]], [[Joseph Butler]], and [[Thomas Reid]].

==Biography==
David Home, anglicized to David Hume, son of Joseph Home of [[Chirnside]], advocate, and Katherine Falconer, was born on 26 April 1711 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) in a tenement on the north side of the [[Lawnmarket]] in [[Edinburgh]]. He changed the spelling of his name in 1734, because the fact that his surname 'Home' was pronounced 'Hume' in Scotland was not known in England. Throughout his life Hume, who never married, spent time occasionally at his family home at Ninewells by Chirnside, [[Berwickshire]], which had belonged to his family since the sixteenth century.

===Education===
Hume attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] at the unusually early age of twelve (possibly as young as ten) at a time when fourteen was normal. At first he considered a career in [[Scots law|law]], but came to have, in his words, "an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over [[Johannes Voet|Voet]] and [[Arnold Vinnius|Vinnius]], [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]] were the Authors which I was secretly devouring."<ref>{{Cite book | first = David | last = Hume | contribution = My Own Life | editor-last = Norton | editor-first = DF | year = 1993 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Hume | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 351 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref> He had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735, "there is nothing to be learnt from a [[Professor]], which is not to be met with in Books."<ref>In a letter to 'Jemmy' Birch, quoted in Mossner, E. C. (2001). ''The life of David Hume''. Oxford University Press. p. 626</ref>

Hume made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him "...a new Scene of Thought," which inspired him "...to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it."<ref>{{Cite book | first = David | last = Hume | contribution = A Kind of History of My Life | editor-last = Norton | editor-first = DF | year = 1993 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Hume | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 346 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref> He did not recount what this "Scene" was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations.<ref>See {{Cite journal | first = Oliver A | last = Johnson | title = The Mind of David Hume | publisher = University of Illinois Press | year = 1995 | pages = 8–9 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}, for a useful presentation of varying interpretations of Hume's "scene of thought" remark</ref> Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of ten years reading and writing. He came to the verge of [[nervous breakdown]], after which he decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning.<ref name = "ogcpkr">Mossner, 193</ref>

===Career===
As Hume's options lay between a travelling tutorship and a stool in a merchant's office, he chose the latter. In 1734, after a few months occupied with commerce in [[Bristol]], he went to [[La Flèche]] in [[Anjou]], France. There he had frequent discourse with the [[Jesuits]] of the [[College of La Flèche]]. As he had spent most of his savings during his four years there while writing ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'',<ref name = "ogcpkr"/> he resolved "to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of my talents in literature".<ref name="HumeHistoryp352" /> He completed the ''Treatise'' at the age of 26.

Although many scholars today consider the ''Treatise'' to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, the critics in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the time did not agree, describing it as "abstract and unintelligible".<ref>Mossner, 195</ref>
Despite the disappointment, Hume later wrote, "Being naturally of a cheerful and [[Humorism|sanguine]] temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country".<ref name="HumeHistoryp352" /> There, he wrote the ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature (Abstract)|Abstract]]''.<ref>''An Abstract of a Book lately Published; Entitled, A Treatise of Human Nature, &c. Wherein the Chief Argument of that Book is farther Illustrated and Explained'', (London, 1740)</ref> Without revealing his authorship, he aimed to make his larger work more intelligible.

After the publication of ''Essays Moral and Political'' in 1744, Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. However, the position was given to [[William Cleghorn]], after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an [[atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{Cite journal | first = Douglas | last = Nobbs | title = The Political Ideas of William Cleghorn, Hume's Academic Rival | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | year = 1965 | volume = 26 | pages = 575–86 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.2307/2708501 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[File:David Hume 1754.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|An engraving of Hume from his {{Cite journal | title = [[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]] | volume = I | year = 1754 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}]]
During the 1745 [[Jacobite Rebellion]], Hume tutored the [[George Vanden-Bempde, 3rd Marquess of Annandale|Marquis of Annandale]] (1720–92), who was officially described as a "lunatic".<ref>Grant, ''Old and New Edinburgh in the 18th Century'' (Glasgow, 1883), p. 7</ref> This engagement ended in disarray after about a year. But it was then that Hume started his great historical work ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'', which took fifteen years and ran over a million words, to be published in six volumes in the period between 1754 and 1762, while also involved with the Canongate Theatre. In this context, he associated with [[Lord Monboddo]] and other [[Scottish Enlightenment]] luminaries in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to [[James St Clair|Lieutenant-General St Clair]], and wrote ''Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding'', later published as ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. The ''Enquiry'' proved little more successful than the ''Treatise''.

Hume was charged with [[Christian heresy|heresy]], but he was defended by his young clerical friends, who argued that—as an [[atheist]]—he was outside the [[Church of Scotland|Church's]] jurisdiction. Despite his acquittal, Hume failed to gain the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|chair of philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]].

It was after returning to Edinburgh in 1752, as he wrote in ''My Own Life'', that "the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library".<ref>{{Cite journal | first = David | last = Hume | title = The History of Great Britain | place = London | year = 1754–56 | pages = 353 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref> This resource enabled him to continue historical research for ''The History of England''.

Hume achieved great literary fame as a historian. His enormous ''The History of England'', tracing events from the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Invasion of Julius Caesar]] to the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], was a best-seller in its day. In it, Hume presented political person as a creature of habit, with a disposition to submit quietly to established government unless confronted by uncertain circumstances. In his view, only religious difference could deflect people from their everyday lives to think about political matters.

Hume's volume of ''Political Discourses'' (published by Kincaid & [[Alexander Donaldson (bookseller)|Donaldson]], 1752)<ref name="Sher">{{Cite book| last =Sher|first=Richard B. |title=The Enlightenment & the book: Scottish authors & their publishers in eighteenth-century Britain, Ireland, & America | publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006 |series=Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology Series|page=313|isbn=0-226-75252-6|url= http://books.google.com/?id=gB9liJb5o7UC&pg=PA312&dq=%22alexander+donaldson%22+bookstore&q}}</ref> was the only work he considered successful on first publication.<ref>{{Cite journal | first = David | last = Hume | year = 1776 | title = My Own Life | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Religion===
[[File:Humetomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of David Hume in [[Edinburgh]]]]

Hume wrote a great deal on religion. The question of what were Hume's personal views on religion is a difficult one.<ref>Russell, 2008, O'Connor, 2001, and Norton, 1993</ref> The [[Church of Scotland]] seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him.<ref>Mossner, E. C. (2001). The life of David Hume. Oxford University Press. p. 206</ref>

In works such as ''On Superstition and Enthusiasm'', Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the [[Catholic Church]], referring to it with the standard Protestant epithets and descriptions of it as superstition and idolatry<ref>Hume. D. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' "... the gradual progress of the Catholic superstition ..."; and ''On Superstition and Enthusiasm'': "Modern Judaism and popery especially the latter being the most unphilosophical and absurd superstitions which have yet been known in the world ..."</ref> as well as dismissing what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs.<ref>Hume, D, ''The Natural History of Religion'' "... our present experience concerning the principles and opinions of barbarous nations. The savage tribes of America Africa and Asia are all idolaters."</ref> He also considered extreme Protestant sects, which he called ''enthusiasts'', to be corrupters of religion.<ref>Hume, D, ''Of Superstition and Enthusiasm'': "the corruption of the best things produces the worsts is grown into a max im and is commonly proved among other instances by the pernicious effects of superstition and enthusiasm the corruptions of true religion." and "... all enthusiasts have been free from the yoke of ecclesiastics and have exprest great independence in their devotion with a contempt of forms ceremonies and traditions. The ''quakers'' are the most egregious tho at the same time the most innocent enthusiasts ... The ''independents'' of all the English sectaries approach nearest to the quakers in fanaticism and in their freedom from priestly bondage The ''presbyterians'' follow after at an equal distance in both these particulars ...</ref> Yet he also put forward arguments that suggested that polytheism had much to commend it in preference to monotheism.<ref>Hume, D, ''The Natural History of Religion'' "... Where the deity is represented as infinitely superior to mankind this belief tho altogether just is apt ... to represent the monkish virtues of mortification penance humility and passive suffering as the only qualities which are acceptable to him. But where the gods are conceived to be only a little superior to mankind and to have been many of them advanced that inferior rank we are more at our ease in our addresses to them and may even without profaneness aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emulation of them."</ref>

It is likely that Hume was sceptical both about religious belief (at least as demanded by the religious organisations of his time) and of the complete atheism promoted by such contemporaries as [[Baron d'Holbach]]. [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] suggests that perhaps Hume's position is best characterised by the term "irreligion".<ref>Russell, Paul (2008). The Riddle of Hume's Treatise: Scepticism, Naturalism and Irreligion New York & Oxford, Oxford University Press</ref> David O'Connor writes that Hume "did not believe in the God of standard theism. ... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity". Also, "ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion".<ref>O'Connor (2009), p. 19.</ref>

Marc Hanvelt identifies Hume as an Aristotelian in his view that rhetoric is a form of ethical studies, which ultimately makes it political.<ref>Hanvelt, Marc. "Polite Passionate Persuasion: Hume's Conception of Rhetoric." ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' 43.3 (2010): 565–581.</ref>

===Later years===
[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776. Historian and philosopher - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|David Hume by [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], 1766]]
From 1763 to 1765, Hume was secretary to Lord Hertford in Paris. He met and later fell out with [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. He wrote of his Paris life, "I really wish often for the plain roughness of [[The Poker Club]] of Edinburgh ... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness."<ref>Mossner, p. 265</ref> For a year from 1767, Hume held the appointment of Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. In 1768 he settled in [[Edinburgh]] where he lived from 1771 until his death in 1776 at the south-west corner of St. Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], at what is now 21 Saint David Street. (A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence,<ref>Mossner, Appendix H</ref> suggests the street was named after Hume.)

[[James Boswell]] saw Hume a few weeks before his death (which was from some form of abdominal [[cancer]]). Hume told him he sincerely believed it a "most unreasonable fancy" that there might be life after death.<ref>Boswell, J. ''Boswell in Extremes'', 1776–1778</ref> This meeting was dramatized in semi-fictional form for the [[BBC]] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] as ''Dialogue in the Dark''. Hume asked that he be interred in a "simple roman tomb." In his will he requests that it be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, "leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest."<ref>Mossner, p. 591</ref> It stands, as he wished it, on the south-western slope of [[Calton Hill]], in the [[Old Calton Cemetery]]. [[Adam Smith]] later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] to allow him a few more years of life in order to see "the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition," to which the ferryman replied "You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years... Get into the boat this instant..."<ref>Smith, Adam [http://archive.org/stream/historyenglandf00humegoog#page/n25/mode/2up Letter to William Strahan] at p. xx of Hume's ''The History of England'', New Edition, London, 1789.</ref>

==As historian of England==
In 1754 to 1762  Hume published the ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|History of England]]'', a 6-volume work of immense sweep, which extends, says its subtitle, "From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688". Inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of history, away from merely Kings, Parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well.  He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved "the most entire system of liberty, that was ever known amongst mankind."<ref>Hume vol 6. p 531 cited in {{cite book|author=John Philipps Kenyon|title=The history men: the historical profession in England since the Renaissance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1LkbAAAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=U. of Pittsburgh Press|page=42|isbn=9780822959007}}</ref>

Hume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]]'s ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1646–69). Generally Hume took a moderate Royalist position and thought revolution was unnecessary. Hume's was considered a Tory history, and emphasized religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie writes: "Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but ... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-Royalist coloring." For "Hume shared the ... Tory belief that the Stuarts were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors". Also, "Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the History as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy"
.<ref>Okie, L., Ideology and Partiality in David Hume's History of England, ''Hume Studies'', Volume 11, Issue 1 (April, 1985), 1–32.[http://www.humesociety.org/hs/issues/v11n1/okie/okie-v11n1.pdf]</ref>
Historians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.<ref>S. K. Wertz, "Hume, History, and Human Nature," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1975) 36#3 pp. 481-496 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2708658 in JSTOR]</ref>

Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against Presbyterians and Puritans. Roth says his anti-Whig promonarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.<ref>Robert J. Roth, "David Hume on Religion in England," ''Thought'' (1991) 66#260 pp. 51–64</ref>

However Hume was an early cultural historian of science. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Hume awarded the palm of greatness to [[William Harvey]].<ref>S. K. Wertz, "Hume and the Historiography of Science," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1993) 54#3 pp. 411–436 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2710021 in JSTOR]</ref>

The ''History'' sold well and was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]] (1757), [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] (1771) and others. By 1894, there were at least 50 editions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillipson|first=Nicholas|title=David Hume: The Philosopher As Historian|year=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-18166-1|pages=131|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1BmA-cONPngC&printsec=frontcover&dq=David+Hume:+The+Philosopher+As+Historian#v=onepage&q=David%20Hume%3A%20The%20Philosopher%20As%20Historian&f=false}}</ref>  There was also an often-reprinted abridgement, ''[[The Student's Hume]]'' (1859).

==Thought==
[[File:DavidHume.jpg|thumb|Statue of Hume by [[Alexander Stoddart]] on the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Edinburgh]]]]
In the introduction to ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', Hume writes "'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature ... Even ''Mathematics'', ''Natural Philosophy'', and ''Natural Religion'', are in some measure dependent on the science of Man". Also, "the science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences", and the method for this science assumes "experience and observation" as the foundations of a logical argument.<ref>David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', (New York: Dover, 2003 edition), p. 7</ref> Because "Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of [[Newtonian physics]]",<ref>Copplestone, F., ''A history of Philosophy'', v. 6, 2003</ref> Hume is characterised as an [[empiricism|empiricist]].

Until recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] movement; a form of anti-metaphysical empiricism. According to the logical positivists, unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e. either [[tautology (logic)|tautological]] or [[contradiction|contradictory]]), then it was meaningless (this is a summary statement of their [[verificationism|verification principle]]). Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate how ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are [[logical equivalence|semantically equivalent]] to propositions about one's experiences.<ref>A. J. Ayer, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (Penguin, 2001 edition), pp. 40ff</ref>

Many commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an [[epistemology|epistemological]], rather than a [[semantics|semantic]] reading of his project.<ref name="CraigStrawsonWright">See, e.g.,
* Edward Craig, The Mind of God and the Works of Man, Ch.2
* Galen Strawson, ''The Secret Connexion'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989)
* John Wright, ''The Sceptical Realism of David Hume'', (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1983)</ref> According to this view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. To be sure, Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to ''knowledge'' on this basis.

===Induction===
The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the [[problem of induction]]. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced.<ref>John D. Kenyon, 'Doubts about the Concept of Reason', in ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume'', Vol. 59, (1985), 249–267</ref> Understanding the problem of induction is central to grasping Hume's philosophical system.

The problem concerns the explanation of how we are able to make [[inductive reasoning|inductive inferences]]. Inductive inference is reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved; as Hume says, it is a question of how things behave when they go "beyond the present testimony of the senses, and the records of our memory".<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 108</ref> Hume notices that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner; i.e., that patterns in the behaviour of objects will persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. This persistence of regularities is sometimes called [[Uniformitarianism]] or the Principle of the Uniformity of Nature.

Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties, and both of these are inadequate. The two sorts are: demonstrative reasoning, and probable reasoning.<ref>These are Hume's terms. In modern parlance, demonstration may be termed deductive reasoning, while probability may be termed inductive reasoning: see {{cite web|url=http://www.davidhume.org/documents/1996PhD.pdf |title=Hume, Induction and Probability |author=Dr. Peter J. R. Millican's |date= |work=D.Phil thesis |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref> With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is "consistent and conceivable" that nature might stop being regular.<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 111</ref> Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past, as this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question: it would be [[circular reasoning]].<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 115</ref> Thus no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.

Hume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human ability to make inductive inferences. He asserts that "Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable {{sic}} necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel". Although many modern commentators have demurred from Hume's solution,<ref name="harris2004">{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Errol E. |authorlink=Errol Harris |year=2004 |title=Hypothesis and Perception: The Roots of Scientific Method |series=Muirhead Library of Philosophy |volume=10 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-29615-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uBbfizzKTDoC&lpg=PA42&pg=PA42 |page=42}}</ref> some have notably concurred with it, seeing his analysis of our epistemic predicament as a major contribution to the theory of knowledge. For example, philosopher [[John D. Kenyon]] writes: <blockquote>Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment in the study, but the forces of nature will soon overcome that artificial scepticism, and the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief.<ref>John D. Kenyon, 'Doubts about the Concept of Reason', in ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume'', Vol. 59, (1985), p. 254</ref>
</blockquote>

===Causation===
The notion of [[Causality|causation]] is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events, and it is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. There are three main interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.

The logical positivist interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as "A caused B", in terms of regularities in perception: "A causes B" is equivalent to "Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow", where "whenever" refers to all possible perceptions.<ref>For this account of Hume's views on causation,
* A. J. Ayer, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (Penguin, 2001 edition), pp. 40–42</ref>

<blockquote>
power and necessity... are... qualities of perceptions, not of objects... felt by the soul and not perceived externally in bodies<ref>David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', (New York: Dover, 2003 edition), p. 168</ref>
</blockquote>

This view is rejected by [[skepticism|sceptical]] [[Philosophical realism|realists]], who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events.<ref name="CraigStrawsonWright" /> When two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:
<blockquote>
Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means ... there is a ''necessary connexion'' to be taken into consideration.<ref>David Hume, ''A Treatise of Human Nature'', (New York: Dover, 2003 edition), p. 56</ref>
</blockquote>

Hume held that we have no perceptual access to the necessary connection, hence ''scepticism'', but we are naturally compelled to believe in its objective existence, ergo ''realism''. He thus concluded that there are no necessary connections, only constant conjunctions.<ref>''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' by David Hume.</ref>

Referring to the Law of Causality, Hume wrote, "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause."<ref name="DavidHume">David Hume, in J.Y.T. Greig, ed., The Letters of David Hume, 2 vols. (New York: Garland, 1983), 1:187.</ref>

It has been argued that, while Hume did not think causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully fledged realist either: Simon Blackburn calls this a [[quasi-realism|quasi-realist]] reading.<ref>See S. Blackburn, ‘Hume and Thick Connexions', in ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', Vol. 50, Supplement. (Autumn, 1990), pp. 237–250</ref> On this view, talk about causal necessity is an expression of a functional change in the human mind, whereby certain events are predicted or anticipated on the basis of prior experience. The expression of causal necessity is a [[projectivism|"projection"]] of the functional change onto the objects involved in the causal connection: in Hume's words, "nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation which they occasion."<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 147, fn.17</ref>

===The self===
According to the standard interpretation of Hume on [[personal identity]], he was a [[bundle theory|bundle theorist]], who held that the self is nothing but a bundle of experiences ("perceptions") linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", "person", or "mind" referred to collections of "sense-contents".<ref>For this account of Hume on the self,
* A. J. Ayer, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (Penguin, 2001 edition), pp. 135–6</ref> A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by [[Derek Parfit]] in his ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1986).

However, some philosophers have criticised the bundle-theory interpretation of Hume on personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relations of similarity and causality with one another. Thus perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct "bundles" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality: in other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an ontological question, philosophers who see Hume as not very concerned with such questions have queried whether the view is really Hume's,<ref>Galen Strawson, The Evident Connexion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011)[http://DOI:%2010.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608508.001.0001 ] {{doi|10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608508.001.0001}}</ref> or "only a decoy".<ref>Edward Craig, The Mind of God and the Works of Man, Ch.2</ref> Instead, it is suggested, Hume might have been answering an epistemological question, about the causal origin of our concept of the self. In the Appendix to the Treatise, Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his account of the self in Book 1 of the Treatise, and the question of why he is dissatisfied has received a number of different answers.
Another interpretation of Hume's view of the self has been argued for by James Giles.<ref>James Giles, ''No Self to be Found: the Search for Personal Identity'' University Press of America, 1997.</ref> According to this view, Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. That is, rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume is rejecting the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation Hume is proposing a 'No-Self Theory' and thus has much in common with Buddhist thought.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Giles | first1 = James | year = 1993 | title = The No-Self Theory: Hume, Buddhism, and Personal Identity | url = | journal = Philosophy East and West | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 175–200 | doi = 10.2307/1399612 }}</ref> Alison Gopnik has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.<ref>"Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism?

===Practical reason===
Hume's anti-rationalism informed much of his theory of belief and knowledge, in his treatment of the notions of induction, causation, and the external world. But it was not confined to this sphere, and permeated just as strongly his theories of motivation, action, and morality. In a famous sentence in the ''Treatise'', Hume circumscribes reason's role in the production of action:

<blockquote>
Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.<ref>''Treatise'', p. 295</ref>
</blockquote>

It has been suggested that this position can be lucidly brought out through the metaphor of "[[direction of fit]]": beliefs—the paradigmatic products of reason—are propositional attitudes that aim to have their content fit the world; conversely, desires—or what Hume calls passions, or sentiments—are states that aim to fit the world to their contents.<ref>The metaphor of direction of fit in this sense has been traced back to Elizabeth Anscombe's work on intention: ''Intention'' (2nd Edition), (1963, Oxford: Basil Blackwell)</ref> Though a metaphor, it has been argued that this intuitive way of understanding Hume's theory that desires are necessary for motivation "captures something quite deep in our thought about their nature".<ref name="SmithV96N381">M. Smith, 'The Humean Theory of Motivation', ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 96, No. 381 (Jan., 1987), pp. 36–61</ref>

Hume's anti-rationalism has been very influential, and defended in contemporary philosophy of action by neo-Humeans such as [[Michael A. Smith|Michael Smith]]<ref name="SmithV96N381" /> and [[Simon Blackburn]].<ref>S. Blackburn, 'Practical Tortoise Raising', ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 104, No. 416 (Oct., 1995), pp. 695–711</ref> The major opponents of the Humean view are cognitivists about what it is to act for a reason, such as [[John McDowell]],<ref>J. McDowell, 'Non-Cognitivism and Rule-Following', in S. Holtzman and C. Leich, ''Wittgenstein: To Follow A Rule'', (1981, London: Routledge & Kegan Paul)</ref> and Kantians, such as [[Christine Korsgaard]].<ref>C. Korsgaard, 'Scepticism about Practical Reason', ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 83, No. 1 (Jan., 1986), pp. 5–25</ref>

===Ethics===
{{See also|Is–ought problem}}
Hume's views on human motivation and action formed the cornerstone of his ethical theory: he conceived moral or ethical sentiments to be intrinsically motivating, or the providers of reasons for action. Given that one cannot be motivated by reason alone, requiring the input of the passions, Hume argued that reason cannot be behind morality.
<blockquote>
Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.<ref>''Treatise'', [[op. cit.]], p. 325</ref>
</blockquote>

Hume's [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]] about morality was shared by his close friend [[Adam Smith]],<ref>Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), ed. K. Haakonssen, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002)</ref> and Hume and Smith were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]].<ref>For Hutcheson's influence on Hume, see footnote 7. For his influence on Smith, see William L. Taylor, ''Francis Hutcheson and David Hume as Predecessors of Adam Smith'', (Durham: Duke University Press, 1965)</ref>

Hume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern day metaethical theory, helping to inspire various forms of [[emotivism]],<ref>A. J. Ayer. ''Language, Truth and Logic'', ch.6</ref><ref>C. L. Stevenson. ''Ethics and Language'' (1944), (Yale: Yale UP, 1960)</ref> [[error theory]]<ref>[[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]].

===Free will, determinism, and responsibility===
Hume, along with [[Thomas Hobbes]], is cited as a classical [[Compatibilism|compatibilist]] about the notions of [[free will|freedom]] and [[determinism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/#3 | contribution =Compatibilism | title =Stanford Encyclopedia}}</ref> The thesis of compatibilism seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist belief that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, whose happenings are governed by the [[laws of physics]]. Hume, to this end, was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution and by in particular Sir Isaac Newton.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Richard  |year=2009 |title=Understanding religious ethics}}</ref>

Hume argued that the dispute about the compatibility of freedom and determinism has been kept afloat by ambiguous terminology:
{{Quote |From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot... we may presume, that there is some ambiguity in the expression.<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 148</ref>}}

Hume defines the concepts of "necessity" and "liberty" as follows:

Necessity: "the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together..."<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 149</ref>

Liberty: "''a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will''..."<ref name="HumeEnquiryp159" />

Hume then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but Liberty ''requires'' Necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would "...have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other." But if our actions are not thus hooked up to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of "chance; which is universally allowed not to exist".<ref name="HumeEnquiryp159">Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 159</ref>

Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held morally responsible, it is required that our behaviour be caused, i.e. necessitated, for
{{Quote |Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some ''cause'' in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil<ref>Hume, D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', p. 161</ref>}}

Hume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity. Hume further illustrates his position by rejecting a famous moral puzzle by french philosopher Jean Buridan. Buridan starts his puzzle by describing a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has on both sides of him separate bales of hay which are of equal distance away from him. Which bale does the donkey choose? Buridan believes that the donkey would die as he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. For Buridan, human beings are different as a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. Humans thus for Buridan have the capacity of autonomy. Buridan recognizes the choice that's ultimately made will be based on randomity as both loaves of bread are indifferent from one another. However, Hume completely rejects this notion he argues that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation as he's faced with impending death if he fails to. Such a decision is not done on the basis of randomity but rather on necessity and spontaneity given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

This argument has inspired modern day commentators.<ref>See, e.g., {{Cite journal | first = RE | last = Hobart | title = Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It | journal = Mind | volume = 43 | year = 1934 | pages = 1–27 | doi = 10.1093/mind/XLIII.169.1 | issue = 169 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Problem of miracles===
In his discussion of [[miracle]]s in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (Section 10) Hume defines a miracle as "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent". Given that Hume argues that it is impossible to deduce the existence of a Deity from the existence of the world (for he says that causes cannot be determined from effects), miracles (including prophecy) are the only possible support he would conceivably allow for theistic religions.

Hume discusses everyday belief as often resulted from probability, where we believe an event that has occurred most often as being most likely, but that we also subtract the weighting of the less common event from that of the more common event. In the context of miracles, this means that a miraculous event should be labelled a miracle only where it would be even more unbelievable (by principles of probability) for it not to be. Hume mostly discusses miracles as testimony, of which he writes that when a person reports a miraculous event we [need to] balance our belief in their veracity against our belief that such events do not occur. Following this rule, only where it is considered, as a result of experience, less likely that the testimony is false than that a miracle occur should we believe in miracles.

Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history:<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hume | first = D | origyear = 1748 | title = An Enquiry concerning human understanding | editor-first = LA | editor-last = Selby-Bigge | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1902 | chapter = Section X – Of Miracles | pages = 116–122 }}</ref>
* People often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results.
* People by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false.
* Hume notes that miracles seem to ''occur'' mostly in "ignorant" and "barbarous" nations and times, and the reason they don't occur in the "civilized" societies is such societies aren't awed by what they know to be natural events.
* The miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.

Indeed, Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' he stated: “I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures.”  Thus Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny not just primarily of miracles but of all forms of belief systems. A common sense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence. Founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability greatly analogous to the evidence used in a Civil Court. The criteria for assessing a belief system for Hume is on the balance of probabilities whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahluwalia |first=Libby |authorlink=Libby Ahluwalia |year=2008 |title=Understanding Philosophy of Religion}}</ref>

Despite all this Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that "The gazing populace receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition and promotes wonder".<ref>Hume, D (1748) "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding." in Modern Philosophy: An Anthology of Primary Sources (R. Ariew, E. Watkins), Hackett 1998</ref>

Critics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, and thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature or examined every possible miracle claim (e.g., those yet future to the observer), which in Hume's philosophy was especially problematic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Hume's main argument concerning miracles is the following. Miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established Laws of Nature. The Laws of Nature are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either my senses have deceived me or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken, all of which I have past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness – he offers the example of an Indian Prince, who having grown up in a hot country refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights this refusal is not wrong and the Prince is thinking correctly; it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur. So for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left inexplicit throughout, save for the close of his discussion wherein Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences and makes an ironic<ref>[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]] ''The Miracle of Theism'' (Oxford: Oxford: University Press, 1982), 29</ref><ref>Buckle, Stephen, ''Hume's Enlightenment Tract: The Unity and Purpose of An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2001), 269–74</ref> remark that anyone who "is moved by faith to assent" to revealed testimony "is aware of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience."

===Design argument===
{{See also|Anthropic principle|Problem of evil}}

One of the oldest and most popular [[existence of God|arguments for the existence of God]] is [[teleological argument|the design argument]]: that order and "purpose" in the world bespeaks a divine origin. Hume gave a criticism of the design argument in ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' and ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding''.

Firstly, Hume argued that for the design argument to be feasible, it must be true that order and purpose are observed only when they result from design. But order is often observed to result from presumably mindless processes like the generation of snowflakes and crystals. Design can account for only a tiny part of our experience of order.

Second, that the design argument is based on an incomplete analogy: because of our experience with objects, we can recognize human-designed ones, comparing for example a pile of stones and a brick wall. But in order to point to a designed universe, we would need to have an experience of a range of different universes. As we only experience one, the analogy cannot be applied.

Next, even if the design argument is completely successful, it could not in and of itself establish a robust theism; one could easily reach the conclusion that the universe's configuration is the result of some morally ambiguous, possibly unintelligent agent or agents whose method bears only a remote similarity to human design.

Furthermore, if a well-ordered natural world requires a special designer, then God's mind (being so well-ordered) also requires a special designer. And then this designer would likewise need a designer, and so on ad infinitum. We could respond by resting content with an inexplicably self-ordered divine mind; but then why not rest content with an inexplicably self-ordered natural world?

Finally, Hume advanced a version of the [[Anthropic Principle]]. Often, when it appears that an object has a particular feature in order to secure some goal, it is in fact the result of a filtering process. That is, the object wouldn't be around did it not possess that feature, and the perceived purpose is only interesting to us as a human projection of goals onto nature. This mechanical explanation of teleology anticipated the notion of [[natural selection]].

===Political theory===
{{Utilitarianism}}

It is difficult to categorize Hume's political affiliations. His thought contains elements that are, in modern terms, both [[conservative]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]], as well as ones that are both [[contractarian]] and [[utilitarian]], though these terms are all anachronistic. [[Thomas Jefferson]] banned Hume's ''History'' from the [[University of Virginia]], fearing that it "has spread universal toryism over the land".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=673&chapter=159422&layout=html&Itemid=27 |title=David Hume: Prophet of the Counter-revolution (1965) |author= Laurence L. Bongie |date= |work= |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> Yet, [[Samuel Johnson]] thought Hume "a Tory by chance... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbist]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=652&chapter=62199&layout=html&Itemid=27#lf1223_footnote_nt841 |title=LETTER LXXXIV.: The Bath Waters injurious: Complaints of Injustice: Hume's Autobiography: Dialogues on Natural Religion. – David Hume, Letters of David Hume to William Strahan (1756) |author=David Hume|date= |work=Note 13 |publisher=The Online Library of Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> His central concern is to show the importance of the rule of law, and stresses throughout his political ''Essays'' the importance of moderation in politics. This outlook needs to be seen within the historical context of eighteenth century Scotland, where the legacy of religious civil war, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, fostered in a historian such as Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism that appeared to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided. He thinks that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws, based principally on the "artifice" of contract; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly (though he thought that republics were more likely to do so than monarchies).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious [[tyranny]].<ref>Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' (1817 edition, p. 286)</ref> However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and the [[Tories]]. Hume writes <blockquote>My views of ''things'' are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of persons to Tory prejudices.<ref>Quoted in Mossner, EC., ''The life of David Hume'', 1954, reprinted 2001, OUP, p. 311.</ref></blockquote>McArthur says that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterizes Hume as a 'precautionary conservative', whose actions would have been "determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate".<ref>Neil McArthur, ''David Hume's political theory''. University of Toronto, 2007, pp.70 & 124.</ref> He supported [[liberty of the press]], and was sympathetic to [[democracy]], when suitably constrained. [[Douglass Adair]] has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for [[James Madison]]'s writings, and the ''[[Federalist No. 10]]'' in particular.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3816276 Adair, Douglass (1957) "'That Politics Can be Reduced to a Science': David Hume, James Madison, and the Tenth Federalist." Huntington Library Quarterly 20: 343–360]</ref> Hume was also, in general, an optimist about social progress, believing that, thanks to the economic development that comes with the expansion of trade, societies progress from a state of "barbarism" to one of "civilisation". Civilised societies are open, peaceful and sociable, and their [[citizen]]s are as a result much happier. It is therefore not fair to characterise him, as [[Leslie Stephen]] did, as favouring "...that stagnation which is the natural ideal of a [[sceptic]]."<ref>Leslie Stephen, ''History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century'', 2 vols. (London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1876), vol. 2, 185</ref>

Though it has been suggested Hume had no positive vision of the best society, he in fact produced an essay titled ''[[Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/LIBRARY/LFBooks/Hume/hmMPL39.html |title=Ida of a perfect Commonwealth |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. His pragmatism shone through, however, in his caveat that we should only seek to implement such a system should an opportunity present itself, which would not upset established structures. He defended a strict [[separation of powers]], [[decentralisation]], extending the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the [[clergy]]. The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[militia]] system was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid. It is also important to note that the ideal commonwealth laid out by Hume was held to be ideal only for the British Isles in the 18th century.
According to Hume "<!--where should this quote end?-->good constitutions... will ensure that the private interest of men, even of bad men, will<!--will be?--> controlled and directed as to serve and produce the public good.  Such is the aim of free government, which Hume calls the "happiest" society... Liberty in the sense of free government is, Hume says, "the perfection of civil society"...  The wise statemen<!--statesman?-->... in attempting to improve a constitution will adapt his innovations to the "ancient fabric", so as not to disturb society.  His caution may be reinforced by reflections on the limits of human foresight".{{clarify|date=August 2012|reason=Parts of this quote seem incorrect}}<ref>History of Political Philosophy, edited by Leo Strauss and Joseph Grospey, The University of Chicago Press, 1987, pp. 552–553, 556</ref>

===Contributions to economic thought===
[[File:David Hume and Adam Smith statues.jpg|thumb|right|Statues of David Hume and Adam Smith by David Watson Stevenson on the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in [[Edinburgh]]]]
Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of [[economics]]. This includes ideas on private property, inflation, and foreign trade.<ref>Robbins, Lionel ''A History of Economic Thought: The LSE Lectures'' edited by Medema and Samuels. Ch 11 and 12</ref> Referring to his essay "Of the Balance of Trade," [[Paul Krugman]] has remarked "... David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model." <ref>{{cite web|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=How We Know The Earth Is Old|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/how-we-know-the-earth-is-old/|work=The Conscience of  a Liberal|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>

In contrast to Locke, Hume believes that [[private property]] isn't a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, "idle ceremonial", if all goods were unlimited and available freely. Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.<ref>Hume, David ''An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals'' (1751)</ref>
<!--Hume was among the first to develop automatic [[Price specie flow mechanism|price-specie flow]],{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} an idea that contrasts with the [[mercantile system]]. When a country increases its in-flow of gold, this in-flow will result in price inflation, and price inflation will prevent countries from trading that would have traded before the inflation. This results in a decrease of the in-flow of gold in the long run.

Hume also proposed a theory of beneficial inflation.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} He believed that increasing the money supply would raise production in the short run. This phenomenon would be caused by a gap between the increase in the money supply and that of the price level. The result is that prices will not rise at first and may not rise at all. This theory was later developed by [[John Maynard Keynes]].  -->

==Influence==
Attention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] credited Hume with awakening him from "dogmatic slumbers" (''circa'' 1770).<ref>''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'', Kant, 'Preface'</ref>

According to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], "there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbart]] and [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] taken together".<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Ch. 46</ref>

[[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] (1936), introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism, claimed: "The views which are put forward in this treatise derive from the logical outcome of the [[empiricism]] of Berkeley and Hume."<ref>A. J. Ayer (1936). ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]''. London</ref> [[Albert Einstein]] (1915) wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating his [[Special Theory of Relativity]].<ref>in a letter of 14 December 1915, to Moritz Schlick (Papers, A, Vol. 8A, Doc.165)</ref>
Hume was called "the prophet of the [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] revolution" by N. Phillipson, referring to his view that mathematics and logic are closed systems, disguised tautologies, and have no relation to the world of experience.<ref>Phillipson, N. (1989). Hume, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London</ref> David Fate Norton (1993) asserted that Hume was "the first post-sceptical philosopher of the early modern period".<ref>Norton, D. F. (ed.) (1993). ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 90–116</ref>

Hume's [[Problem of Induction]] was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of [[Karl Popper]]. In his autobiography, ''Unended Quest'',<ref>Karl Popper: ''Unended Quest; An Intellectual Autobiography'', 1976, ISBN 0-415-28590-9</ref> he wrote: "'Knowledge' ... is ''objective''; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's ''problem of induction''". This insight resulted in Popper's major work ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''.<ref>Karl Popper: ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'', 1934 (as ''Logik der Forschung'', English translation 1959), ISBN 0-415-27844-9</ref> In his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p. 55, he writes:
<blockquote>"I approached the problem of induction through Hume. Hume, I felt, was perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified".</blockquote>

==Works==
* ''A Kind of History of My Life'' (1734) Mss 23159 [[National Library of Scotland]]. A letter to an unnamed physician, asking for advice about "the Disease of the Learned" that then afflicted him. Here he reports that at the age of eighteen "there seem'd to be open'd up to me a new Scene of Thought..." that made him "throw up every other Pleasure or Business" and turned him to scholarship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects''. (1739–40) Hume intended to see whether the [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92t/ ''Treatise of Human Nature''] met with success, and if so to complete it with books devoted to Politics and Criticism. However, it did not meet with success. As Hume himself said, "It fell ''dead-born from the press'', without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots"<ref name="HumeHistoryp352">David Hume, ''A Kind of History of My Life''. In Norton, D. F. (ed.) (1993). ''The Cambridge Companion to Hume'', Cambridge University Press, p. 352</ref> and so was not completed.
* ''An Abstract of a Book lately Published: Entitled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. (1740) Anonymously published, but almost certainly written by Hume<ref>For this see the introduction by J. M. Keynes and P. Sraffa in: Hume, David (1965). ''An abstract of A treatise of Human Nature 1740. Connecticut: Archon Books</ref> in an attempt to popularise his ''Treatise''. Of considerable philosophical interest, because it spells out what he considered "The Chief Argument" of the ''Treatise'', in a way that seems to anticipate the structure of the ''Enquiry concerning Human Understanding''.
* ''Essays Moral and Political'' (first ed. 1741–2) A collection of pieces written and published over many years, though most were collected together in 1753–4. Many of the essays are focused on topics in politics and economics, though they also range over questions of aesthetic judgement, love, marriage and polygamy, and the demographics of ancient Greece and Rome, to name just a few of the topics considered. The Essays show some influence from [[Joseph Addison|Addison]]'s ''Tatler'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', which Hume read avidly in his youth.
* ''A Letter from a Gentleman to His Friend in Edinburgh: Containing Some Observations on a Specimen of the Principles concerning Religion and Morality, said to be maintain'd in a Book lately publish'd, intituled A Treatise of Human Nature etc''. Edinburgh (1745). Contains a letter written by Hume to defend himself against charges of atheism and scepticism, while applying for a chair at Edinburgh University.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748) Contains reworking of the main points of the ''Treatise'', Book 1, with the addition of material on free will (adapted from Book 2), miracles, the Design Argument, and mitigated scepticism. ''[[Of Miracles]]'', section X of the ''Enquiry'', was often published separately.
* ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751) A reworking of material from Book 3 of the ''Treatise'', on morality, but with a significantly different emphasis. Hume regarded this as the best of all his philosophical works,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} both in its philosophical ideas and in its literary style.
* ''Political Discourses'', (part II of ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary]]'' within vol. 1 of the larger ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'') Edinburgh (1752). Included in ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (1753–6) reprinted 1758–77.
* ''Political Discourses''/''Discours politiques'' (1752–1758), ''My Own life'' (1776), ''Of Essay writing'', 1742. Bilingual English-French (translated by Fabien Grandjean). Mauvezin, France: Trans-Europ-Repress, 1993, 22&nbsp;cm, V-260 p. Bibliographic notes, index.
* ''[[Four Dissertations]]'' London (1757). Included in reprints of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects'' (above).
* ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|The History of England]]'' (Sometimes referred to as ''[[The History of Great Britain]]'') (1754–62) More a category of books than a single work, Hume's history spanned "from the invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688" and went through over 100 editions. Many considered it ''the'' standard history of England in its day.
* ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]'' (1757)
* "My Own Life" (1776) Penned in April, shortly before his death, this autobiography was intended for inclusion in a new edition of ''Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects''. It was first published by [[Adam Smith]] who claimed that by doing so he had incurred "ten times more abuse than the very violent attack I had made upon the whole commercial system of Great Britain."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} ([[Ernest Campbell Mossner]], The Life of David Hume)
* ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) Published posthumously by his nephew, David Hume the Younger. Being a discussion among three fictional characters concerning the nature of God, and is an important portrayal of the argument from design. Despite some controversy, most scholars agree that the view of Philo, the most sceptical of the three, comes closest to Hume's own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onphilosophy.co.uk/natural_religion.html |title=Which character is Hume in the ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''? |author=William Crouch |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>
