An '''amyl alcohol''' is any of 8 [[alcohols]] with the formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>OH.<ref>[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]] 11th Ed. 2004</ref> A mixture of amyl alcohols (also called amyl alcohol) can be obtained from [[fusel alcohol]]. Amyl alcohol is used as a solvent and in [[esterfication]], for example in the production of [[amyl acetate]]. Amyl alcohol as a distinct chemical compound refers to [[1-Pentanol|1-pentanol]].

Eight [[structural isomer]]s with [[molecular formula]] C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O and all alcohols are known:

Three of these alcohols, active amyl alcohol (2-methylbutan-1-ol), methyl (n) propyl carbinol (pentan-2-ol), and methyl isopropyl carbinol (3-methylbutan-2-ol), are [[optical isomerism|optically active]], as they contain an asymmetric carbon atom.

The most important is isobutyl carbinol, this being the chief constituent of fermentation amyl alcohol, and consequently a constituent of [[fusel oil]]. It can be separated from fusel oil by shaking with strong [[brine]] solution, separating the oily layer from the brine layer and [[distillation|distilling]] it, the portion boiling between 125 and 140 °C. being collected. For further purification it may be shaken with hot [[limewater]], the oily layer separated, dried with [[calcium chloride]] and fractionated, the fraction boiling between 128 and 132 °C only being collected. It may be synthesized from [[isobutanol]] by conversion into isovaleraldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of [[sodium amalgam]].

It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm³ (0 °C), boiling at 131.6 °C, slightly soluble in water, easily soluble in organic solvents. It possesses a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste. Amyl alcohol has an oral LD50 of 200&nbsp;mg/kg (mouse),<ref>http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/</ref> suggesting that the chemical is significantly more toxic than ethanol. On passing its vapour through a red-hot tube, it decomposes with production of [[acetylene]], [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], and other compounds. It is [[oxidation|oxidized]] by [[chromic acid]] to isovaleraldehyde, and it forms crystalline addition compounds with [[calcium chloride]] and [[tin(IV) chloride]].

The other amyl alcohols may be obtained synthetically. Of these, tertiary butyl carbinol has been the most difficult to obtain, its synthesis having first been reported in 1891, by L. Tissier <ref>Comptes Rendus'', 1891, 112, p. 1065</ref> by the reduction of a mixture of trimethyl acetic acid and trimethylacetyl chloride with sodium amalgam. It is a solid that melts at 48 to 50 °C and boils at 112.3 °C.
