'''Aristide Joseph Bonaventure Maillol''' ({{IPA-fr|mɑjɔl|lang}}; December 8, 1861&nbsp;– September 27, 1944) was a French [[Sculpture|sculptor]], [[Painting|painter]], and [[printmaking|printmaker]].<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3697 ''Aristide Maillol (French, 1861–1944)'', Antoinette Le Normand-Romain, MoMA, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]</ref>

Maillol was born in [[Banyuls-sur-Mer]], [[Roussillon]]. He decided at an early age to become a painter, and moved to [[Paris]] in 1881 to study art. After several applications and several years of living with poverty, his enrollment in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] was accepted in 1885, and he studied there under [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].<ref>Cowling, Elizabeth; Mundy, Jennifer (1990). ''On Classic Ground: Picasso, Léger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910-1930''. London: Tate Gallery. p. 148. ISBN 1-854-37043-X</ref> His early paintings show the influence of his contemporaries [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Paul Gauguin]].

Gauguin encouraged his growing interest in decorative art, an interest that led Maillol to take up [[tapestry]] design. In 1893 Maillol opened a tapestry workshop in Banyuls, producing works whose high technical and aesthetic quality gained him recognition for renewing this art form in France. He began making small [[terracotta]] sculptures in 1895, and within a few years his concentration on sculpture led to the abandonment of his work in tapestry.

In July of 1896, Maillol married Clotilde Narcisse, one of his employees at his tapestry workshop. Their only son, Lucian, was born that October. <ref>{{Cite book|title = Maillol|last = Himino|first = Ryozo|publisher = Graph, Inc.|year = 2001|isbn = 4-7662-0645-2|location = Japan|pages = }}</ref>

Maillol’s first major sculpture, A Seated Woman, was modeled after his wife. The first version was completed in 1902. That same year, dealer Ambroise Vollard provided Maillol with his first exhibition. <ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3697|title = MoMA, The Collections, Aristide Maillol (French, 1861–1944)}}</ref>

The subject of nearly all of Maillol's mature work is the female body, treated with a [[Classicism|classical]] emphasis on stable forms. The figurative style of his large bronzes is perceived as an important precursor to the greater simplifications of [[Henry Moore]], and his serene classicism set a standard for European (and [[United States|American]]) figure sculpture until the end of [[World War II]].

[[Josep Pla]] said of Maillol, "These archaic ideas, Greek, were the great novelty Maillol brought into the tendency of modern sculpture. What you need to love from the ancients is not the antiquity, it is the sense of permanent, renewed novelty, that is due to the nature and reason."<ref> "Arístides Maillol, escultor", ''Homenots, 3a sèrie''. OC XXI, 19. [http://fundaciojoseppla.cat/content/view/37/66/1/17/#.Uak6Nr9W3Hh  "Dues mirades a Maillol. Josep Pla i Torres Monsó"], Fundació Josep Pla, retrieved May 31, 2013.</ref>

His important public commissions include a 1912 commission for a monument to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], as well as numerous war memorials commissioned after [[World War I]]. 

Maillol served as a juror with [[Prix Blumenthal#Florence Meyer Blumenthal|Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]] (1919–1954) a grant awarded to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.<ref name="FMBlumenthal">{{cite web

He made a series of [[woodcut]] illustrations for an edition of [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' published by [[Harry Graf Kessler]] in 1926–27. He also illustrated ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]] (1937) and ''Chansons pour elle'' by [[Paul Verlaine]] (1939).<ref>"Aristide Maillol", ''Oxford Art Online''</ref>

He died in Banyuls at the age of eighty-three, in an automobile accident. While driving home during a thunderstorm, the car in which he was a passenger skidded off the road and rolled over. A large collection of Maillol's work is maintained at the [[Musée Maillol]] in [[Paris]], which was established by [[Dina Vierny]], Maillol's model and platonic companion during the last 10 years of his life. His home a few kilometers outside Banyuls, also the site of his final resting place, has been turned into a museum where a number of his works and sketches are displayed.

Three of his bronzes grace the grand staircase of the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City: ''Summer'' (1910–11), ''Venus Without Arms'' (1920), and'' Kneeling Woman: Monument to Debussy'' (1950–55). The third is the artist's only reference to music, created for a monument at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s birthplace.
