'''Amber''' is [[fossil]]ized tree [[resin]] (not [[sap]]), which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since [[Neolithic]] times.<ref name=Grimaldi2009/> Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects.<ref name=Jersey>"Amber" (2004). In Maxine N. Lurie and Marc Mappen (eds.) ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey'', Rutgers University Press, ISBN 0813533252.</ref> Amber is used as an ingredient in perfumes, as a healing agent in folk medicine, and as [[jewelry]]. There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called '''resinite''', and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within New Zealand coal seams.<ref>Poinar GO, Poinar R.

==History and names==
The English word ''amber'' derives from
<!-- this source establishes that the Middle Persian word exists, but not that the source of the Arabic word is the Persian one
the [[Middle Persian]]<ref>http://www.rabbinics.org/pahlavi/MacKenzie-PahlDict.pdf {{huh|date=September 2013}}</ref> word ''ambar'', via -->
[[Arabic]]  {{lang|ar| ''ʿanbar''  عنبر}}, [[Middle Latin]] ''ambar'' and [[Middle French]] ''ambre''. The word was adopted in [[Middle English]] in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as ''[[ambergris]]'' (''ambre gris'' or "grey amber"),   solid waxy substance derived from the [[sperm whale]]. 
In the [[Romance languages]], the sense of the word had  come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century,  at first called white or yellow amber (''ambre jaune'') for disambiguation, and this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main sense of the word.<ref>{{OEtymD|amber}}</ref> 

The two substances ("yellow amber" and "grey amber") conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats, whereas amber is less dense than stone, but too dense to float.<ref>see: Abu Zaid al Hassan from Siraf & Sulaiman the Merchant (851), ''Silsilat-al-Tawarikh (travels in Asia)''.{{huh|date=September 2013}}<!--"see" this for what? what is this substantiating?--></ref> 
 
The classical  name for amber was ''electrum'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἤλεκτρον#Ancient_Greek|ἤλεκτρον]]}}  ''ēlektron''), connected to a term for the "beaming [[Sun]]",  ἠλέκτωρ (''ēlektōr'').<ref name=King1>

The word  "[[electron]]"  (for the fundamental particle) was coined in 1891 by the Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney|George Stoney]] whilst analyzing elementary charges for the first time. {{cite web| url = http://www.emporia.edu/earthsci/amber/amber.htm|author = Aber, Susie Ward |publisher = Emporia State University|title = Welcome to the World of Amber|accessdate = 11 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070428124042/http://www.emporia.edu/earthsci/amber/amber.htm| archivedate= 28 April 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}. {{cite web|url=http://www.patent-invent.com/electricity/inventions/electron.html |title=Origin of word Electron |publisher=Patent-invent.com |accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref> According to the myth, when [[Phaethon|Phaëton]] son of [[Helios]] (the Sun)  was killed, his mourning sisters became [[poplar]]s, and their tears became the origin of ''elektron'', amber.<ref>Michael R.

Amber is discussed by [[Theophrastus]] in the 4th century BC, and again by [[Pytheas]] (c. 330 BC) whose work "On the Ocean" is lost, but was referenced by [[Pliny the Elder]], according to whose ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|The Natural History]]''   (in what is also the earliest known mention of the name ''[[Germania]]''):<ref name=pliny37-11>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D11  37.11].</ref>
<blockquote>Pytheas says that the [[Gutones]], a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbors, the [[Teutones]].</blockquote>
Earlier<ref>''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23172;layout=;loc=4.26 IV.27.13] or IV.13.95 in the Loeb edition.</ref> Pliny says that a large island of three days' sail from the [[Scythia]]n coast called [[Baltia|Balcia]] by [[Xenophon of Lampsacus]], author of a fanciful travel book in Greek, is called Basilia by Pytheas. It is generally understood to be the same as Abalus. Based on the amber, the island could have been [[Heligoland]], [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], the shores of [[Bay of Gdansk]], the [[Sambia Peninsula]] or the [[Curonian Lagoon]], which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe.
It is assumed that there were  well-established trade routes for amber connecting the Baltic with the Mediterranean (known as the "[[Amber Road]]"). Pliny states explicitly that the Germans export amber to [[Pannonia]], from where it was traded further abroad by the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]].

Pliny also cites the opinion of [[Nicias]], according to whom amber "is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany."
Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, 
citing the native Latin name  of ''succinum'' (''sūcinum'', from ''sucus'' "juice").<ref>[[succinic acid]] as well as ''succinite'', a term given to a particular type of amber by [[James Dwight Dana]]</ref>
"Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of 'succinum'  and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood."

He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber, by saying that "in Syria the women make the [[spindle whorl|whorl]]s of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of ''harpax'' [from ἁρπάζω, "to drag"] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues."

Pliny says that the German name of amber was ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/glasą#Proto-Germanic|glæsum]]'', "for which reason the Romans, when Germanicus Cæsar commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these islands the name of Glæsaria, which by the barbarians was known as Austeravia". This is confirmed by the recorded [[Old High German]] ''glas''  and [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:glær#Old_English|glær]]'' for "amber" (c.f. ''[[wikt:glass|glass]]'').
In  [[Middle Low German]]),  amber was known as ''berne-, barn-, börnstēn''. The Low German term became dominant also in [[High German]] by the 18th century, thus modern German ''Bernstein'' besides Dutch [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''barnsteen''.

Heated above 200&nbsp;°C, amber suffers decomposition, yielding an "oil of amber", and leaving a black residue which is known as "amber colophony", or "amber pitch"; when dissolved in oil of [[turpentine]] or in [[linseed oil]] this forms "amber varnish" or "amber lac". {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] term for amber is ''gintaras'' and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''dzintars''. They, and the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''jantar'' or Hungarian ''gyanta'' ('resin'), are thought to originate from [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''jainitar'' ("sea-resin").{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}   

Early in the nineteenth century, the first reports of amber from North America came from discoveries in New Jersey along Crosswicks Creek near Trenton, at Camden, and near Woodbury.<ref name=Jersey/>

==Legends==

The origins of Baltic Amber are associated with the Lithuanian legend about Jurata, the queen of the sea, who fell in love with Kastytis, a fisherman.  According to one of the versions, her jealous father punished his daughter by destroying her amber palace and changing her into sea foam. The pieces of the Jurata’s palace can still be found on the Baltic shore. See also [[Jūratė and Kastytis]].

==Composition and formation==
{{too technical|section|date=July 2012}}
Amber is [[heterogeneous]] in composition, but consists of several [[resin]]ous bodies more or less soluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]], associated with an insoluble [[Bitumen|bituminous]] substance. Amber is a [[macromolecule]] by free [[radical polymerization]] of several precursors in the [[labdane]] family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene.<ref>Manuel Villanueva-García, Antonio Martínez-Richa, and Juvencio Robles [http://www.arkat-usa.org/ark/journal/2005/I06_Juaristi/1567/EJ-1567C.asp Assignment of vibrational spectra of labdatriene derivatives and ambers: A combined experimental and density functional theoretical study] [[Arkivoc]] (EJ-1567C) pp. 449–458</ref> These labdanes are [[diterpene]]s (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub>) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three [[alkene]] groups for [[polymerization]]. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as [[isomerization]] reactions, [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] and [[cyclization]].

===Formation===
Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into [[copal]]. Sustained heat and pressure drives off [[terpene]]s and results in the formation of amber.<ref>{{Cite book| first=Patty C.|last=Rice|title=Amber: Golden Gem of the Ages. 4th Ed.|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2006|isbn=1-4259-3849-3}}</ref>

First, the starting resin must be resistant to decay. Many trees produce resin, but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological process. Exposure to sunlight, rain, and temperate extremes tends to disintegrate resin, and the process is assisted by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. For resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them.<ref>Poinar, George O. (1992) ''Life in amber''. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, p. 12, ISBN 0804720010</ref>

===Botanical origin===
Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the ''[[Agathis]]'' group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus ''[[Hymenaea]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12186567|year=2002|last1=Lambert|first1=JB|last2=Poinar Jr|first2=GO|title=Amber: the organic gemstone|volume=35|issue=8|pages=628–36|journal=Accounts of chemical research|doi=10.1021/ar0001970}}</ref>
while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from [[Sciadopitys|Sciadopityaceae]] family plants that used to live in north Europe.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=A. P.|coauthors=Tappert, R., Muehlenbachs, K., Boudreau, M., McKellar, R. C., Basinger, J. F., Garrett, A.|title=A new proposal concerning the botanical origin of Baltic amber|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=30 June 2009|volume=276|issue=1672|pages=3403–3412|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0806|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1672/3403.full|pmid=19570786|pmc=2817186}}</ref>

===Inclusions===
The abnormal development of resin has been called ''succinosis''. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped onto the ground, so that the material may be useless except for varnish-making, whence the impure amber is called ''firniss''. Enclosures of [[pyrites]] may give a bluish color to amber. The so-called ''black amber'' is only a kind of [[Jet (lignite)|jet]]. ''Bony amber'' owes its cloudy opacity to minute bubbles in the interior of the resin.

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution [[X-ray]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm |title=BBC News, " Secret 'dino bugs' revealed", 1 April 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=30 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100828135744/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7324564.stm| archivedate= 28 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Extraction and processing==

=== Distribution and mining ===
Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.
Historically, the [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] coast west of [[Königsberg]] in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] was the world's leading source of amber. About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in that area, which became the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of Russia in 1946.<ref>[http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast]. Gurukul.ucc.american.edu. Retrieved on 19 September 2012.</ref>

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of ''blue earth'' have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.

[[File:Ambre bleu dominicain 21207.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue amber]] from Dominican Republic]]
Dominican amber, especially [[Blue amber|Dominican blue amber]], is mined through [[bell pit]]ting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.<ref>Wichard, Wilfred and Weitschat, Wolfgang (2004) Im Bernsteinwald. – Gerstenberg Verlag, Hildesheim, ISBN 3-8067-2551-9</ref>

===Treatment===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]] and polish it with whitening and water or with [[rotten stone]] and oil. The final lustre is given by friction with flannel.

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with [[linseed oil]], heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of "amberoid" or "pressed amber". The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure; the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like [[copal]] and [[kauri gum]], as well as by [[celluloid]] and even [[glass]]. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called "true amber".

==Appearance==
Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color "amber", amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as "cherry amber"), green amber, and even [[blue amber]], which is rare and highly sought after.

Yellow amber is a hard, translucent, yellow, orange, or brown fossil resin from evergreen trees. Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah “straw” plus rubay “attract, snatch,” referring to its electrical properties), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba, it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation—easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry.
Much of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as "bony amber".<ref>"Amber". (1999). In G. W. Bowersock, Peter Brown, Oleg Grabar (eds.) ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'', Harvard University Press, ISBN 0674511735.</ref>

Although all [[Dominican amber]] is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is [[blue amber]]. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly [[ultraviolet]] light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about 100&nbsp;kg is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Manuel A. Iturralde-Vennet |year=2001|title= Geology of the Amber-Bearing Deposits of the Greater Antilles|journal= Caribbean Journal of Science|volume= 37|issue=3|pages= 141–167|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511133007/http://academic.uprm.edu/publications/cjs/Vol37b/37_141-167.pdf}}</ref>

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.

==Classification==
Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. [[Terpenoid]]s, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of [[isoprene]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) units.<ref name=Grimaldi2009/> [[Phenol]]ic resins are today only produced by [[angiosperms]], and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct [[Medullosales|medullosan]]s produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins.<ref name=Grimaldi2009/> The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry.<ref name=Grimaldi2009/> The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes.<ref name=Anderson1992ii>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0146-6380(92)90051-X|title=The nature and fate of natural resins in the geosphere—II.

===Class I===
This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids.<ref name=Anderson1992ii/> It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilise regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), while Ic uses ''enantio'' labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, ''enantio'' biformenes).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/bk-1995-0617.ch006|title=Amber, Resinite, and Fossil Resins|year=1996|last1=Anderson|first1=Ken B.|volume=617|pages=105–129|chapter=New Evidence Concerning the Structure, Composition, and Maturation of Class I (Polylabdanoid) Resinites|series=ACS Symposium Series|isbn=0-8412-3336-5}}</ref>

====Ia====
Includes ''Succinite'' (= 'normal' Baltic amber) and ''Glessite''.<ref name=Anderson1992iii/> Have a communic acid base. They also include much succinic acid.<ref name=Anderson1992ii/>

[[Baltic amber]] yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or ''bony'' varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name ''succinite''. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It can be distinguished from other ambers via [[IR spectroscopy]] due to a specific [[carbonyl]] absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample.{{Verify source|date=October 2009}} Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.<ref name=Rottlaender1970>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511212102/http://www.natmus.dk/cons/reports/2002/amber/amber.pdf |title=Degradation and inhibitive conservation of Baltic amber in museum collections  |year=2007|author=Shashoua, Yvonne |work=Department of Conservation, The National Museum of Denmark

====Ib====
Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack [[succinic acid]].<ref name=Anderson1992ii/>

====Ic====
This class is mainly based on ''enantio''-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and zanzibaric acids.<ref name=Anderson1992ii/> Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.<ref name=Grimaldi2009/>

Dominican amber differentiates itself from [[Baltic amber]] by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of [[fossil]] inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.<ref name=Poinar>George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999.

===Class II===
These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as [[cadinene]].<ref name=Anderson1992ii/>

===Class III===
These ambers are [[polystyrenes]].<ref name=Anderson1992ii/>

===Class IV===
Class IV is something of a wastebasket; its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of cedrene-based sesquiterpenoids.<ref name=Anderson1992ii/>

===Class V===
Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and ''n''-alkyl compounds.

==Classification of Baltic amber by the IAA==
[[File:HALAMB48.JPG|thumb|200px|Typical amber specimen with a number of indistinct inclusions]]
*''Natural Baltic amber'' – gemstone which has undergone mechanical treatment only (for instance: grinding, cutting, turning or polishing) without any change to its natural properties

*''Modified Baltic amber'' – gemstone subjected only to thermal or high-pressure treatment, which changed its physical properties, including the degree of transparency and color, or shaped under similar conditions out of one nugget, previously cut to the required size.

*''Reconstructed (pressed) Baltic amber'' – gemstone made of Baltic amber pieces pressed in high temperature and under high pressure without additional components.

*''Bonded Baltic amber'' – gemstone consisting of two or more parts of natural, modified or reconstructed Baltic amber bonded together with the use of the smallest possible amount of a colorless binding agent necessary to join the pieces.

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}) is found as irregular [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s in marine [[Glauconite|glauconitic]] sand, known as ''blue earth'', occurring in the Lower [[Oligocene]] strata of [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] in [[Prussia]] (in historical sources also referred to as ''Glaesaria''). After 1945 this territory around [[Königsberg]] was turned into [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], [[Russia]], where amber is now systematically mined.<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jean|last=Langenheim|title=Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany|publisher=Timber Press Inc.|year=2003|isbn=0-88192-574-8}}</ref> It appears, however, to have been partly derived from older [[Eocene]] deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as [[glacial drift]]. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern [[Asia]] and the southern part of [[North America]]. [[Heinrich Göppert]] named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests ''Pinites succiniter'', but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called ''Pinus succinifera''. It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.

===Scent of amber and amber perfumery===
In ancient China it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, [[oil of amber]] is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with [[nitric acid]] to create "artificial musk" – a resin with a peculiar [[musk]]y odor.<ref name="Amber">[http://www.aphrodisiacs-info.com/amber.html Amber as an aphrodisiac]. Aphrodisiacs-info.com. Retrieved on 19 September 2012.</ref> Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic "pinewood" fragrance, modern products, such as perfume, do not normally use actual amber. This is due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as “amber” are often created and patented<ref>Thermer, Ernst T.

The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of [[ambergris]] and/or [[labdanum]] but due to the endangered status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://teresacasimiro.com.sapo.pt/Bibliographic_References/21.pdf |title=Characterization of the Portuguese-Grown Cistus ladanifer Essential Oil |author=Gomes, Paula B, Mata, Vera G, Rodrigues, A E |journal=Journal of Essential Oil Research |year=2005|doi=10.1080/10412905.2005.9698864|volume=17|issue=2|pages=160}}</ref> The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. [[Benzoin]] is usually part of the recipe. [[Vanilla]] and [[clove]]s are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

"Amber" perfumes may be created using combinations of [[labdanum]], [[benzoin resin]], [[copal]] (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), [[vanilla]], [[Dammara resin]] and/or synthetic materials.<ref name="Amber"/>
