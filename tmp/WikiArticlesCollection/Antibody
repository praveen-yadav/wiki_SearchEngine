[[File:Antibody.svg|thumb|255px|Each antibody binds to a specific [[antigen]]; an interaction similar to a lock and key.]]

An '''antibody''' (Ab), also known as an '''immunoglobulin''' (Ig), is a large Y-shaped [[protein]] produced by [[B cell]]s that is used by the [[immune system]] to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es. The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an [[antigen]].<ref name=Janeway5>{{cite book | author =Charles Janeway | title = Immunobiology. | edition = 5th | publisher = Garland Publishing | year = 2001 | id = [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10 (electronic full text via NCBI Bookshelf)] | author-separator =, | author2 =  | display-authors = 2 | isbn = 0-8153-3642-X }}</ref><ref name="pmid8450761">{{cite journal | author = Litman GW, Rast JP, Shamblott MJ, Haire RN, Hulst M, Roess W, Litman RT, Hinds-Frey KR, Zilch A, Amemiya CT | title = Phylogenetic diversification of immunoglobulin genes and the antibody repertoire | journal = Mol.

Antibodies are secreted by a type of [[white blood cell]] called a [[plasma cell]].  Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form that is attached to the surface of a [[B cell]] and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR).  The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called [[plasma cell]]s, or [[memory B cell]]s that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.<ref name="pmid17337763">{{cite journal | author = Borghesi L, Milcarek C | title = From B cell to plasma cell: regulation of V(D)J recombination and antibody secretion | journal = Immunol.

The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a ''surface immunoglobulin'' (sIg) or a ''membrane immunoglobulin'' (mIg).

==Isotypes==
Antibodies can come in different varieties known as [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]] or classes.  In [[eutheria|placental]] mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. They are each named with an "Ig" prefix that stands for immunoglobulin, another name for antibody, and differ in their biological properties, functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted in the table.<ref name = woof>{{cite journal |author=Woof J, Burton D |title=Human antibody-Fc receptor interactions illuminated by crystal structures. |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=89–99 |year=2004 |pmid=15040582 |doi=10.1038/nri1266}}</ref>

The antibody isotype of a [[B cell]] changes during cell [[Pre-pre B cell|development]] and activation.  Immature B cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM+ isotype in a cell surface bound form.  The B lymphocyte, in its mature ready-to-respond form, is known as "naive B lymphocyte." The naive B lymphocyte express both surface IgM+ and IgD+. The co-expression of both these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell 'mature' and ready to respond to antigen.<ref name=Goding>{{cite journal |author=Goding J |title=Allotypes of IgM and IgD receptors in the mouse: a probe for lymphocyte differentiation |journal=Contemp Top Immunobiol |volume=8 |issue= |pages=203–43 |year= 1978|pmid=357078}}</ref>  B cell activation follows engagement of the cell bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into an antibody producing cell called a [[plasma cell]].  In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a [[secrete]]d form rather than a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form.  Some [[daughter cell]]s of the activated B cells undergo [[isotype switching]], a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.

==Structure==
Antibodies are heavy (~150&nbsp;k[[Dalton (unit)|Da]]) [[globular protein|globular]] [[plasma protein]]s.  They have sugar chains added to some of their [[amino acid]] residues.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mattu T, Pleass R, Willis A, Kilian M, Wormald M, Lellouch A, Rudd P, Woof J, Dwek R |title=The glycosylation and structure of human serum IgA1, Fab, and Fc regions and the role of N-glycosylation on Fc alpha receptor interactions |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=273 |issue=4 |pages=2260–2272 |year=1998 |pmid=9442070 |doi=10.1074/jbc.273.4.2260}}</ref> In other words, antibodies are ''[[glycoprotein]]s''.  The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) [[monomer]] (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be [[protein dimer|dimeric]] with two Ig units as with IgA, [[tetramer protein|tetrameric]] with four Ig units like [[teleost fish]] IgM, or [[pentamer]]ic with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.<ref name = roux>{{cite journal |author=Roux K |title=Immunoglobulin structure and function as revealed by electron microscopy |journal=Int Arch Allergy Immunol |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=85–99 |year=1999 |pmid=10545762 |doi=10.1159/000024226}}</ref>
[[File:Antibody IgG2.png|thumb|right|Several immunoglobulin domains make up the two heavy chains (red and blue) and the two light chains (green and yellow) of an antibody. The immunoglobulin domains are composed of between 7 (for constant domains) and 9 (for variable domains) [[β-strand]]s. ]] The variable parts of an antibody are its V regions, and the constant part is its C region.

===Immunoglobulin domains===
The Ig monomer is a "Y"-shaped molecule that consists of four [[polypeptide]] chains; two identical ''heavy chains'' and two identical ''light chains'' connected by [[disulfide bond]]s.<ref name = woof/>
Each chain is composed of [[structural domain]]s called [[immunoglobulin domain]]s.  These domains contain about 70-110 [[amino acid]]s and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barclay A |title=Membrane proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains - a master superfamily of interaction molecules |journal=Semin Immunol |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=215–223 |year=2003 |pmid=14690046 |doi=10.1016/S1044-5323(03)00047-2}}</ref>  They have a characteristic [[immunoglobulin fold]] in which two [[beta sheet]]s create a "sandwich" shape, held together by interactions between conserved [[cysteine]]s and other charged amino acids.

===Heavy chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin heavy chain}}
There are five types of mammalian Ig [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]] denoted by the [[Greek letters]]: [[α]], [[δ]], [[ε]], [[γ]], and [[μ]].<ref name=Janeway5/> The type of heavy chain present defines the ''class'' of antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively.<ref name=Rhoades/> Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, while μ and ε have approximately 550 [[amino acid]]s.<ref name=Janeway5/>

In [[bird]]s, the major serum antibody, also found in yolk, is called [[Immunoglobulin Y|IgY]]. It is quite different from mammalian IgG. However, in some older literature and even on some commercial life sciences product websites it is still called "IgG", which is incorrect and can be confusing.

Each heavy chain has two regions, the ''constant region'' and the ''variable region''.  The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of ''three'' tandem (in a line) Ig [[Structural domain|domains]], and a hinge region for added flexibility;<ref name = woof/> heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of ''four'' immunoglobulin domains.<ref name=Janeway5/>  The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or [[Clone (B-cell biology)|B cell clone]]. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.

===Light chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin light chain}}
In mammals there are two types of [[immunoglobulin light chain]], which are called [[lambda]] (λ) and [[kappa]] (κ).<ref name=Janeway5/> A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids.<ref name=Janeway5/> Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals.  Other types of light chains, such as the [[iota]] (ι) chain, are found in other [[vertebrate]]s like sharks ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Teleostei]]).

===CDRs, Fv, Fab and Fc Regions===
<!-- several redirects lead here -->

Some parts of an antibody have the same functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind two antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the ''[[Fab region|Fab (fragment, antigen binding) region]]''. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.<ref name= putnam79>{{cite journal |author=Putnam FW, Liu YS, Low TL |title=Primary structure of a human IgA1 immunoglobulin.

The [[paratope]] is shaped at the [[N-terminal end|amino terminal end]] of the antibody [[monomer]] by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the F<sub>V</sub> region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. More specifically, variable loops of β-strands, three each on the light (V<sub>L</sub>) and heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the [[complementarity determining region]]s (CDRs).
The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.<ref name= Chothia1997>

In the framework of the [[immune network theory]], CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.

The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity.  This region is called the ''[[Fc region|Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region]]'', and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody.<ref name=Janeway5/> Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of [[Fc receptor]]s, and other immune molecules, such as [[Complement system|complement]] proteins. By doing this, it mediates different [[physiological]] effects including recognition of [[opsonization|opsonized]] particles, [[lysis]] of cells, and [[degranulation]] of [[mast cells]], [[basophils]] and [[eosinophils]].<ref name = woof/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Heyman B |title=Complement and Fc-receptors in regulation of the antibody response |journal=Immunol Lett |volume=54 |issue=2–3 |pages=195–199 |year=1996 |pmid=9052877 |doi=10.1016/S0165-2478(96)02672-7}}</ref>

At the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: they prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].<ref name=Ravetch>{{cite journal |author=Ravetch J, Bolland S |title=IgG Fc receptors |journal=Annu Rev Immunol |volume=19 |issue= 1|pages=275–290 |year=2001 |pmid=11244038 |doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275}}</ref>

[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units. Each Ig unit (labeled 1) has two epitope binding [[Fab region]]s, so IgM is capable of binding up to 10 epitopes.]]

===Activation of complement===
Antibodies that bind to surface antigens on, for example, a bacterium attract the first component of the [[complement cascade]] with their [[Fv region|Fc region]] and initiate activation of the "classical" complement system.<ref name=Ravetch/>  This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways.<ref name=Pier/>  First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by [[phagocyte]]s in a process called [[opsonization]]; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade.  Secondly, some complement system components form a [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]] to assist antibodies to kill the  bacterium directly.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rus H, Cudrici C, Niculescu F |title=The role of the complement system in innate immunity |journal=Immunol Res |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=103–112 |year=2005 |pmid=16234578 |doi=10.1385/IR:33:2:103}}</ref> An antibody is a molecule that specificially inactivates an antigen.

===Activation of effector cells===
To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, causing them to [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]]. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.<ref name=Pier/>

Those cells which recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors which, as the name suggests, interacts with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies.  The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.<ref name=Janeway5/>

===Natural antibodies===
Humans and higher primates also produce "natural antibodies" which are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or [[passive immunization]]. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide [[galactose]] α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on [[glycosylated]] cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut.<ref>{{cite web |author= Racaniello, Vincent| url=http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |date=2009-10-06 |title=Natural antibody protects against viral infection |work=Virology Blog |accessdate=2010-01-22|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uJzysytc |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}</ref> Rejection of [[Organ xenotransplantation|xenotransplantated organs]] is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Milland J, Sandrin MS |title=ABO blood group and related antigens, natural antibodies and transplantation |journal=Tissue Antigens |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=459–466 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17176435 |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00721.x |url=}}</ref>

==Immunoglobulin diversity==
Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among  antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mian I, Bradwell A, Olson A |title=Structure, function and properties of antibody binding sites |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=217 |issue=1 |pages=133–151 |year=1991 |pmid=1988675 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(91)90617-F}}</ref>  It has been estimated  that humans generate about 10&nbsp;billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen.<ref name="pmid8612345">{{cite journal |author=Fanning LJ, Connor AM, Wu GE |title=Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire |journal=Clin.

===Domain variability===
[[File:Complementarity determining regions.PNG|thumb|250px|right|The complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are shown in red ({{PDB|1IGT}})]]
The region (locus) of a chromosome that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct genes for each domain of the antibody—the locus containing heavy chain genes ([[IGH@]]) is found on [[chromosome 14]], and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes ([[IGL@]] and [[IGK@]]) are found on chromosomes [[chromosome 22|22]] and [[chromosome 2|2]] in humans.  One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells.  Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops   known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or [[complementarity determining region]]s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3).  CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions.  The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs.  Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability.  This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.<ref>Peter Parham. "The Immune System. 2nd ed. Garland Science: New York, 2005. pg.47-62</ref>

===V(D)J recombination===
{{details|V%28D%29J recombination}}
[[File:VDJ recombination.png|thumb|250px|right|Simplified overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains]]
Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as ''V(D)J recombination'', involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.<ref name = namazee/>  V, D and J segments are found in [[immunoglobulin heavy chain|Ig heavy chains]], but only V and J segments are found in [[Immunoglobulin light chain|Ig light chains]]. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the [[genome]]s of [[mammal]]s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain).  As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different [[wikt:paratope|paratopes]], and thus different antigen specificities.<ref name=Market/> Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (e.i. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells .<ref>{{Cite pmid| 22234685}}</ref>

After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as [[allelic exclusion]]) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.<ref name=Janeway5/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Bergman Y, Cedar H |title=A stepwise epigenetic process controls immunoglobulin allelic exclusion |journal=Nat Rev Immunol |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=753–761 |year=2004 |pmid=15459667 |doi=10.1038/nri1458}}</ref>

===Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation===
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Somatic hypermutation]] and [[Affinity maturation]]''

Following activation with antigen, B cells begin to [[Cell division|proliferate]] rapidly.  In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of [[point mutation]], by a process called ''somatic hypermutation'' (SHM). SHM results in approximately one [[nucleotide]] change per variable gene, per cell division.<ref name=diaz/>  As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight [[amino acid]] differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.

This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding [[Chemical affinity|affinity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Honjo T, Habu S |title=Origin of immune diversity: genetic variation and selection |journal=Annu Rev Biochem |volume=54 |issue= 1|pages=803–830 |year=1985 |pmid=3927822 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.004103}}</ref>  Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity).<ref name=orguil>{{cite journal |author=Or-Guil M, Wittenbrink N, Weiser AA, Schuchhardt J |title=Recirculation of germinal center B cells: a multilevel selection strategy for antibody maturation |journal=Immunol.

The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called ''affinity maturation''. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from [[helper T cell]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Neuberger M, Ehrenstein M, Rada C, Sale J, Batista F, Williams G, Milstein C |title=Memory in the B-cell compartment: antibody affinity maturation |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=355 |issue=1395 |pages=357–360 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10794054 |pmc=1692737 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0573}}</ref>
[[File:Class switch recombination.png|thumb|250px|right|Mechanism of class switch recombination that allows isotype switching in activated B cells]]

===Class switching===
[[Immunoglobulin class switching|Isotype or class switching]] is a [[biological process]] occurring after activation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG).<ref name=Market/> The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naïve B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function, therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT |title=Evolution of isotype switching |journal=Semin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=257–275 |year=2004 |pmid=15522624 |doi=10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005}}</ref>

Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved [[nucleotide]] motifs, called ''switch (S) regions'', found in [[DNA]] upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of [[enzyme]]s at two selected S-regions.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Durandy A |title=Activation-induced cytidine deaminase: a dual role in class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation |journal=Eur.

===Disease diagnosis and therapy===
Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], and applications such as [[serology]] depend on these methods.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immunospot.eu/elisa-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in ELISA assays |accessdate=2007-05-08 |work=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK00Qems |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}</ref> For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immunospot.eu/elispot-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in ELISPOT assays |accessdate=2007-05-08 |work=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK00pHh5 |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}</ref> a [[titer]] of antibodies directed against [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Lyme disease]] is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected, or the infection occurred a ''very'' long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed. In [[clinical immunology]], levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by [[nephelometry]] (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stern P |title=Current possibilities of turbidimetry and nephelometry |journal=Klin Biochem Metab |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=146–151 |year=2006| url= http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/kbm0603-146.pdf|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK01zkxp |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}</ref> Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of [[liver]] damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear.<ref name=Rhoades/> For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic [[cirrhosis]], elevated IgM indicates [[viral hepatitis]] and [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, [[autoimmune hepatitis]] and cirrhosis.

===Prenatal therapy===
[[Rhesus factor]], also known as Rhesus D (RhD) antigen, is an antigen found on [[red blood cell]]s; individuals that are Rhesus-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rhesus-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal [[childbirth]], delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a [[fetus]] can enter the mother's system.  In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the [[pregnancy]], and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Urbaniak S, Greiss M |title=RhD haemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn |journal=Blood Rev |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=44–61 |year=2000 |pmid=10805260 |doi=10.1054/blre.1999.0123}}</ref>

==Structure prediction==
The importance of antibodies in health care and the [[biotechnology]] industry demands knowledge of their structures at [[Image resolution|high resolution]].  This information is used for [[protein engineering]], modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. [[X-ray crystallography]] is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time consuming.

==History==
{{see also|History of immunology}}

The first use of the term "antibody" occurred in a text by [[Paul Ehrlich]]. The term ''Antikörper'' (the German word for ''antibody'') appears in the conclusion of his article "Experimental Studies on Immunity", published in October 1891, which states that "if two substances give rise to two different antikörper, then they themselves must be different".<ref name=Lindenmann>{{cite journal |author=Lindenmann, Jean  |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119531625/PDFSTART |title=Origin of the Terms 'Antibody' and 'Antigen' |journal=Scand.

The study of antibodies began in 1890 when [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] described antibody activity against [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus toxin]]s. Kitasato put forward the theory of [[humoral immunity]], proposing that a mediator in serum could react with a foreign antigen.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1901/behring-bio.html | title = Emil von Behring&nbsp;— Biography | accessdate = 2007-06-05 |  work = |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uK0BRd1D |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = AGN | title = The Late Baron Shibasaburo Kitasato | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | year = 1931 | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | page = 206 | pmc=382621 | pmid=20318414}}</ref>  His idea prompted Paul Ehrlich to propose the [[side chain theory]] for antibody and antigen interaction in 1897, when he hypothesized that receptors (described as "side chains") on the surface of cells could bind specifically to [[toxin]]s&nbsp;– in a "lock-and-key" interaction&nbsp;– and that this binding reaction was the trigger for the production of antibodies.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winau F, Westphal O, Winau R |title=Paul Ehrlich--in search of the magic bullet |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=786–789 |year=2004 |pmid=15207826 |doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2004.04.003}}</ref> Other researchers believed that antibodies existed freely in the blood and, in 1904, [[Almroth Wright]] suggested that soluble antibodies coated [[bacteria]] to label them for [[phagocytosis]] and killing; a process that he named [[opsonin]]ization.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Silverstein AM |title=Cellular versus humoral immunology: a century-long dispute |journal=Nat.

In the 1920s, [[Michael Heidelberger]] and [[Oswald Avery]] observed that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies and went on to show that antibodies were made of protein.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Van Epps HL |title=Michael Heidelberger and the demystification of antibodies |journal=J.

Further work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by [[Gerald Edelman]] and Joseph Gally of the antibody [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Edelman GM, Gally JA |title=The nature of Bence-Jones proteins.
