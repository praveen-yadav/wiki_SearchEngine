The '''Baltic languages''' are part of the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family spoken by the [[Balts]]. Baltic languages are spoken mainly in areas extending east and southeast of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Northern Europe]]. The family is usually divided into two groups: '''Western Baltic''', containing only extinct languages, and '''Eastern Baltic''', containing both extinct and the two living Baltic languages: [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. The range of the Eastern Balts once reached to the Ural mountains.<ref>Marija Gimbutas 1963. The Balts. London : Thames and Hudson, Ancient peoples and places 33.</ref><ref>J. P.

==Branches==
The Baltic languages are generally thought to form a single family with two branches, Eastern and Western.

''(''†''—Extinct language)''

[[Nadruvian language|Nadruvian]] was spoken near the isogloss of Eastern and Western Baltic, but is too poorly attested to classify.

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Baltic languages.png|thumb|left|Distribution of the Baltic languages in the Baltic (simplified).]]
Speakers of modern Baltic languages<ref>Though included among the [[Baltic states]], the language of [[Estonia]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], is a [[Uralic language]] and is not related to the Baltic languages, which are [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].</ref> are generally concentrated within the borders of [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], and in emigrant communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and states of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Historically the languages were spoken over a larger area: West to the mouth of the [[Vistula]] river in present-day [[Poland]], at least as far East as the [[Dniepr]] river in present-day [[Belarus]], perhaps even to [[Moscow]], perhaps as far south as [[Kiev]]. Key evidence of Baltic language presence in these regions is found in [[hydronym]]s (names of bodies of water) in the regions that are characteristically Baltic. Use of hydronyms is generally accepted to determine the extent of these cultures' influence, but ''not'' the date of such influence. Historical expansion of the usage of [[Slavic languages]] in the South and East, and [[Germanic languages]] in the West reduced the geographic distribution of Baltic languages to a fraction of the area that they formerly covered.

==Prehistory and history==
{{Indo-European topics}}
Although the various Baltic tribes were mentioned by ancient historians as early as 98 B.C.,{{cn|date=October 2013}} the first attestation of a Baltic language was in about 1350, with the creation of the ''Elbing Prussian Vocabulary'', a German to Prussian translation dictionary. It is also believed that Baltic languages are among the most archaic of the remaining Indo-European languages, despite their late attestation. Lithuanian was first attested in a hymnal translation in 1545; the first printed book in Lithuanian, a [[Catechism]] by [[Martynas Mažvydas]] was published in 1547 in [[Königsberg]], Prussia (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia). Latvian appeared in a hymnal in 1530 and in a printed Catechism in 1585. One reason for the late attestation is that the Baltic peoples [[Northern Crusades|resisted Christianization]] longer than any other Europeans, which delayed the introduction of writing and isolated their languages from outside influence.

With the establishment of a [[Germany|German]] state in Prussia, and the eradication or flight of much of the Baltic Prussian population in the 13th century, the remaining Prussians began to be assimilated, and by the end of the 17th century, the Prussian language had become extinct.

During the years of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569–1795), official documents were written in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] and [[Latin]], with Lithuanian being mostly an oral language, with small quantities of written documents.

After the [[Partitions of Poland]], most of the Baltic lands were under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]], where the native languages were sometimes prohibited from being written down, or used publicly.

==Relationship with other Indo-European languages==
The Baltic languages are of particular interest to linguists because they retain many archaic features, which are believed to have been present in the early stages of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]].<ref name="Gimbutas1963">{{cite book|author=Marija Gimbutas|authorlink=Marija Gimbutas|title=The balts, by marija gimbutas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QdHNYgEACAAJ|accessdate=3 December 2011|year=1963|publisher=Thames and hudson}}</ref> However, linguists have had a hard time establishing the precise relationship of the Baltic languages to other languages in the Indo-European family.<ref name="Ancient Indo-European Dialects">{{cite book|title=Ancient Indo-European Dialects|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5pCBRsfJMv8C&pg=PA139|accessdate=3 December 2011|publisher=University of California Press|pages=139–151|id=GGKEY:JUG4225Y4H2}}</ref> Several of the extinct Baltic languages have a limited or nonexistent written record, their existence being known only from the records of ancient historians and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.

The Baltic languages show a close relationship with the Slavic languages, and are grouped with them in a [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] family by most scholars. This family would have developed from a common ancestor, [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]], within which several lexical, phonological, morphological and accentological isoglosses developed, separating the various Balto-Slavic languages from each other.<ref name="Mallory1991">{{cite book|author=J.

The traditional view is that the Slavic languages split off first, and that the remaining dialects developed as a common Proto-Baltic language for some time afterwards. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no Proto-Baltic stage distinct from Proto-Balto-Slavic, but that the Slavic, Eastern Baltic, and Western Baltic languages branched off from Balto-Slavic directly.<ref>{{citation |last=Kortlandt |first=Frederik |author-link=Frederik Kortlandt |year=2009 |title=Baltica & Balto-Slavica |page=5 |quote=Though Prussian is undoubtedly closer to the East Baltic languages than to Slavic, the characteristic features of the Baltic languages seem to be either retentions or results of parallel development and cultural interaction. Thus I assume that Balto-Slavic split into three identifiable branches, each of which followed its own course of development.}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon |first=Rick |last=Derksen |author-link=Rick Derksen |year=2008 |page=20 |quote="I am not convinced that it is justified to reconstruct a Proto-Baltic stage. The term Proto-Baltic is used for convenience’s sake.}}</ref> Under this view, the Baltic family is [[paraphyletic]], and consists of all Balto-Slavic languages that are not Slavic. Finally, there is a minority of scholars who argue that Baltic branched directly from Proto-Indo-European, without a common Balto-Slavic stage, and that the similarities are due to several millennia of contact.<ref name="HockJoseph1996">{{cite book|author1=Hans Henrich Hock|author2=Brian D.
