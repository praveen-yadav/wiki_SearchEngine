==European tradition==

Earth is one of the four [[classical element]]s in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science.  It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world.  Due to the [[hero cult]]s, and [[chthonic]] [[List of Greek mythological figures#Chthonic deities|underworld deities]], the element of ''earth'' is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later [[occultism]].

[[Empedocles]] of Acragas {{nowrap|(c. 495 –}} {{nowrap|c. 435 BCE)}} proposed four ''[[arche|archai]]'' by which to understand the [[cosmos]]: ''[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]'','' [[Air (classical element)|air]]'', ''[[Water (classical element)|water]]'', and ''earth''. [[Plato]] {{nowrap|(427 –}} {{nowrap|347 BCE)}} believed the elements were geometric forms (the [[platonic solid]]s) and he assigned the [[cube]] to the element of ''earth'' in his dialogue ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus'', chap. 22–23; [[Gregory Vlastos]], ''Plato's Universe'', pp. 66–82.</ref> [[Aristotle]], (384–322 BCE), believed ''earth'' was the heaviest element, and his theory of ''[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|natural place]]'' suggested that any ''earth–laden'' substances, would fall quickly, straight down, toward the center of the ''cosmos''.<ref>[[G. E. R. Lloyd]], ''Aristotle'', chapters 7–8.</ref> 

In Classical [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] myth, various goddesses represented the Earth, seasons, crops and fertility, including [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]; [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]; the [[Horae]] (goddesses of the seasons), and [[Proserpina]]; and [[Hades]] ([[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]) who ruled the souls of dead in the [[Underworld]].

In [[Medicine in ancient Greece|ancient Greek medicine]], each of the [[four humours]] became associated with an element. [[Melancholia|Black bile]] was the humor identified with earth, since both were cold and dry. Other things associated with earth and black bile in ancient and [[medieval medicine]] included the season of [[fall]], since it increased the qualities of cold and aridity; the melancholic temperament (of a person dominated by the black bile humour); the [[Femininity|feminine]]; and the southern point of the compass.

In [[alchemy]], earth was believed to be primarily cold, and secondarily dry, (as per Aristotle). Beyond those classical attributes, the chemical substance [[salt]], was associated with earth and its [[alchemical symbol]] was a downward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line.

==Indian tradition==
{{Main|Prithvi}}
'''Prithvi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''{{IAST|pṛthvī}}'', also ''{{IAST|pṛthivī}}'') is the  [[Hinduism|Hindu]] ''earth'' and [[mother goddess]]. According to one such tradition, she is the personification of the [[Earth]] itself; according to another, its actual [[mother]], being ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Tattwa]]'', the essence of the element earth. 

As ''[[Prithvi|Prithvi Mata]]'', or "[[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]", she contrasts with ''[[Dyaus Pita]]'', "[[Sky Father|father sky]]". In the [[Rigveda]], ''earth'' and sky are frequently addressed as a [[Dualism|duality]], often indicated by the idea of two complementary "half-shells." In addition, the element Earth is associated with [[Budha]] or Mercury who represents communication, business, mathematics and other practical matters.

==Astrological personalities==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
People born under the [[astrological sign]]s of [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] are thought to have dominant earth personalities. Earth personalities are characterized in this belief system as calm, practical, hard-working, brave, smart, wise, stable and patient; however, they can also be stubborn, possessive, nearsighted and very harsh.

==Ceremonial magic==
Earth and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the Golden Dawn system despite being considered obsolete by modern science. Zelator (1=10) is the elemental grade attributed to earth; this grade is also attributed to the Qabalistic sphere Malkuth.<ref>Israel Regardie, ''The Golden Dawn'', pp. 154-65.</ref> The [[magical weapon|elemental weapon]] of earth is the [[Pentacle]].<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p.322; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 149-53.</ref> Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of earth is [[Uriel (archangel)|Uriel]], the angel is Phorlakh, the ruler is Kerub, the king is Ghob, and the earth [[elemental]]s (following [[Paracelsus]]) are called [[gnome]]s.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', p. 80.</ref> Earth is considered to be passive; it is represented by the symbol for [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], and it is referred to the lower left point of the pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram.<ref>Regardie, ''Golden Dawn'', pp. 280-286; Kraig, ''Modern Magick'', pp. 206-209.</ref> Many of these associations have since spread throughout the occult community.

It is sometimes represented by its [[Tattva]] or by a downward pointing triangle with a horizontal line through it.

==Modern witchcraft==
Earth is one of the five elements that appear in most [[Wicca]]n and [[Pagan]] traditions. [[Wicca]] in particular was influenced by the Golden Dawn system of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Aleister Crowley]]'s mysticism which was in turn inspired by the Golden Dawn.<ref>Hutton, pp. 216-23; Valiente, witchcraft for tomorrow, p. 17.</ref> Common Wiccan attributions include:
* Cardinal direction: [[Cardinal directions|North]]
* Season: Autumn
* Time of life: Old Age
* Time of day: Twilight
* Regent Planet: [[Saturn]]
* Elemental being: [[Gnome]]
* Colors: Brown and green
* Magical tools: [[Pentacle]] and staff
* [[Tarot reading]]: Coins in the [[Minor Arcana]]
* Altar tool: Pentacle
* Feminine energy
* Other: [[As Above, So Below|Correspondences]] include strength, stability and abundance.

In rituals earth is represented by burying objects in the ground, carving images out of [[wood]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[herbalism]] or using [[animal fur]] and [[bone]]s.

The manifestations of the earth element are found in [[plant]]s, [[tree]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[forest]]s, [[cave]]s and [[garden]]s. The [[bear]], [[boar]], [[bull]], [[Pig|sow]] and [[stag]] are also thought to personify the element as are all [[burrow]]ing animals, such as the [[mole (animal)|mole]] or [[rabbit]].

==Other traditions==
In [[East Asia]], [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] is sometimes seen as the equivalent of ''earth'' and is represented by the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)]], known as 白虎 (''Bái Hǔ'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], ''Byakko'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Bạch Hổ'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and ''Baekho'' (백호, [[Hanja]]:白虎) in [[Korean language|Korean]].  ''Earth'' is represented in the [[Aztec]] religion by a house; to the [[Hindu]]s, a lotus; to the [[Scythians]], a plough; to the [[Culture of Greece|Greeks]], a wheel; and in [[Christian]] [[iconography]]; bulls and birds.
