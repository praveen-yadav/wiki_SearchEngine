{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Double jeopardy''' is a [[procedural defence]]<!-- please do not alter to "defense" - this article uses British spelling --> that forbids a [[defendant]] from being [[Trial|tried]] again on the same (or similar) charges following a legitimate acquittal or conviction. In [[common law]] countries, a defendant may enter a [[peremptory plea]] of '''''autrefois acquit''''' or '''''autrefois convict''''' (''[[wiktionary:autrefois|autrefois]]'' means "in the past" in French), meaning the defendant has been acquitted or convicted of the same offence.<ref name="Benét1864p97">{{cite book |title=A treatise on military law and the practice of courts-martial |author=Benét, Stephen Vincent |year=1864 |page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=Gq00AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA97 97] |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Gq00AAAAIAAJ |postscript=. }}</ref>

If this issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will normally rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated; if it is, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding. In some countries, including Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the guarantee against being "twice put in jeopardy" is a constitutional right. In other countries, the protection is afforded by [[Statutory law|statute law]].{{#Tag:Ref|E.g.

==International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights==
The 72 [[Signature|signatories]] and 166 parties to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] recognise, under Article 14 (7): <blockquote>No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally [[convicted]] or [[acquitted]] in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.</blockquote>

==European Convention on Human Rights==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[Image:09CFREU-Article50.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Article 50 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] protects against double jeopardy.]]
All members of the [[Council of Europe]] (which includes nearly all European countries, and every member of the [[European Union]]) have signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which protects against double jeopardy. The optional Seventh Protocol to the Convention, Article Four, says:
<blockquote>
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an [[Offence (law)|offence]] for which he or she has already been finally [[acquittal|acquitted]] or [[Conviction|convicted]] in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.
</blockquote>
Member states may, however, implement legislation which allows reopening of a case in the event that new evidence is found or if there was a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings:
<blockquote>
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.
</blockquote>
This optional protocol has been ratified by all EU states except five ([[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=117&CM=8&DF=4/11/2007&CL=ENG|title= Protocol No. 7 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|publisher=Council of Europe}}</ref> In those member states, national rules governing double jeopardy may or may not comply with the provision cited above.

In many European countries, the prosecution may appeal an acquittal to a higher court (similar to the provisions of Canadian law) – this is not counted as double jeopardy but as a continuation of the same trial. This is allowed by the European Convention on Human Rights (note the word ''finally'' in the above quotation).

==By country==
===Australia===
In contrast to other common law nations, Australian double jeopardy law has been held to further prevent the prosecution for [[perjury]] following a previous acquittal where a finding of perjury would controvert the acquittal. This was confirmed in the case of ''[[R v Carroll]]'', where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll's sworn [[alibi]] two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturn of his conviction (for perjury) by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the UK legislation.

During a [[COAG|Council of Australian Governments (COAG)]] meeting of 2007, model legislation to rework double jeopardy laws was drafted,<ref name="premier.vic.gov.au">{{cite web|title=Coalition Government to introduce double jeopardy reforms|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/2427-coalition-government-to-introduce-double-jeopardy-reforms.html|work=Victoria's double jeopardy laws to be reworked|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> but there was no formal agreement for each state to introduce it. All states have now chosen to introduce legislation that mirrors COAG's recommendations on "fresh and compelling" evidence.

In [[New South Wales]], retrials of serious cases with a minimum sentence of 20 years or more are now possible, whether or not the original trial preceded the 2006 reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1735450.htm|title=NSW seeks to scrap double jeopardy principle|newspaper=The World Today|author=Duffy, Conor|date=7 September 2006}}</ref> On 17 October 2006, the [[New South Wales Parliament]] passed legislation abolishing the rule against double jeopardy in cases where:
*an acquittal of a "life sentence offence" ([[murder]], violent [[gang rape]], large commercial supply or production of [[illegal drug trade|illegal drugs]]) is debunked by "fresh and compelling" evidence of guilt;
*an acquittal of a "15 years or more sentence offence" was tainted (by perjury, [[bribery]], or perversion of the course of justice).

On 30 July 2008, [[South Australia]] also introduced legislation to scrap parts of its double jeopardy law, legalising retrials for serious offences with "fresh and compelling" evidence, or if the acquittal was tainted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal Law Consolidation (Double Jeopardy) Amendment Act 2008|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/V/A/2008/CRIMINAL%20LAW%20CONSOLIDATION%20(DOUBLE%20JEOPARDY)%20AMENDMENT%20ACT%202008_28/2008.28.UN.RTF|work=Criminal Law Consolidation (Double Jeopardy) Amendment Act 2008|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>  

In [[Western Australia]], on 8 September 2011 amendments were introduced that would allow also retrial if "new and compelling" evidence was found. It would apply to serious offences where the penalty was life imprisonment or imprisonment for 14 years or more. Acquittal because of tainting ([[witness intimidation]], [[jury tampering]], or perjury) would also allow retrial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attorney General Christian Porter welcomes double jeopardy law reform|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/attorney-general-christian-porter-welcomes-double-jeopardy-law-reform/story-e6frg13u-1226132121880|work=Attorney General Christian Porter welcomes double jeopardy law reform|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=WA the next state to axe double jeopardy|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/wa-the-next-state-to-axe-double-jeopardy-20110908-1jyu3.html|work=WA the next state to axe double jeopardy|accessdate=16 October 2011|date=8 September 2011}}</ref> 

In [[Tasmania]], on 19 August 2008, amendments were introduced to allow retrial in serious cases, if there is "fresh and compelling" evidence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Double Jeopardy Law Reform|url=http://www.media.tas.gov.au/print.php?id=24539|work=Double Jeopardy Law Reform|publisher=Tasmanian Government Media Releases|accessdate=16 October 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> 

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] on 21 December 2011, legislation was passed allowing new trials where there is "fresh and compelling DNA evidence, where the person acquitted subsequently admits to the crime, or where it becomes clear that key witnesses have given false evidence". <ref name="premier.vic.gov.au"/> Retrial applications however could only be made for serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, arson causing death, serious drug offences and aggravated forms of rape and armed robbery. <ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal Procedure Amendment (Double Jeopardy and Other Matters) Bill 2011|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/publications/research-papers/bills-backgrounders/8100-criminal-procedure-amendment-double-jeopardy-and-other-matters-bill-2011}}</ref>

In [[Queensland]] on 18 October 2007, the double jeopardy laws were modified to allow a retrial where fresh and compelling evidence becomes available after an acquittal for murder or a "tainted acquittal" for a crime carrying a 25-year or more sentence. A "tainted acquittal" requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal. Unlike reforms in the United Kingdom, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, this law does not have a retrospective effect, which is unpopular with some advocates of the reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/double-jeopardy-changes-insufficient/2007/04/20/1176697080260.html|title=Double Jeopardy Changes Insufficient|newspaper=The Brisbane Times|date=20 April 2007}}</ref>

===Canada===
The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] includes provisions such as [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(h)]] prohibiting double jeopardy. However, this prohibition applies only after an accused person has been "finally" convicted or acquitted. [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]] allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal: if the acquittal is thrown out, the new trial is not considered to be double jeopardy, as the verdict of the first trial would have been annulled. In rare circumstances, a [[court of appeal]] might also substitute a conviction for an acquittal. This is not considered to be double jeopardy, either – in this case, the appeal and subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.

For an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] requires that the [[Crown of Canada|Crown]] show that an error in law was made during the trial and that the error contributed to the verdict. It has been suggested that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, lawyer [[Martin Friedland]], in his book ''My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures'', contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be ''responsible'' for the verdict, not just a factor.

A notable example of this is [[Guy Paul Morin]], who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court of Canada.

===France===
Once all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgement is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was [[forgery|forged]].<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite document|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006574827&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154|title=Code of penal procedure, article 6|publisher=Legifrance|accessdate=2 January 2012}}</ref> Prosecution for a crime already already judged is impossible even if incriminating evidence has been found. However, a person who has been convicted may request another trial on grounds of new [[exculpating]] evidence through a procedure known as ''révision''.<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite document|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006138099&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154|title=Code of penal procedure, articles 622–626||publisher=Legifrance|accessdate=2 January 2012}}</ref>

===Germany===
In Germany, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] does not provide comprehensive protection against double jeopardy.{{contradiction-inline|date=September 2013}}

{{quotation|Nobody shall be punished multiple times for the same crime on the base of general criminal law.|Art. 103 (3) GG<ref>{{de icon}} {{cite document|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bundesrecht/gg/gesamt.pdf|title=Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland|trans_title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany}}</ref>{{cite journal|url=http://germanlawjournal.com/pdfs/Vol09No12/PDF_Vol_09_No_12_2179-2222_Articles_Currie%202.pdf|author=Currie, David|title=Lochner Abroad: Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection in the Federal Republic of Germany|volume=9|number=12|journal=German Law Journal}}</ref>}}

Based on pre-constitutional case law, the clause is constructed to also protect against double jeopardy in the case of an acquittal. However, both the prosecution and defence may appeal against the verdict on questions of law and fact in less serious offences; in more serious offences, appeals are restricted to questions of law.<ref>{{cite web|issn=13933140|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/cpProsecutionAppeals.htm|work=CONSULTATION PAPER ON PROSECUTION APPEALS IN CASES BROUGHT ON INDICTMENT|title=CHAPTER ONE: PROSECUTION APPEALS IN IRELAND AND ABROAD, D. PROSECUTION AVENUES OF APPEAL IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, (g) Germany|publisher=http://www.lawreform.ie Law Reform Commission of Ireland}}</ref>

The rule applies to the whole "historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural". This is true even if new facts occur that indicate other and/or much serious crimes.

The Penal Procedural Code ({{lang-de|Strafprozessordnung|links=no}}) provides some exceptions to the double jeopardy rule:

{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is permissible after a final judgement,
#if a document that was considered authentic during the trial was actually not authentic or forged,
#if a witness or authorised expert wilfully or negligently made a wrong deposition or wilfully gave a wrong simple testimony,
#if a professional or lay judge, who made the decision, had committed a crime by violating his or her duties as a judge in the case
#if an acquitted defendant makes a credible confession in court or out of court.|§ 362 StPO}}

In the case of an order of [[summary punishment]], which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours, there is a further exception:
{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is also permissible if the defendant has been convicted in a final order of summary punishment and new facts or evidence have been brought forward, which establish grounds for a conviction of a felony by themselves or in combination with earlier evidence.|§ 373a StPO}}
In Germany, a felony is defined as a crime which (usually) has a minimum of one year of imprisonment.

===India===
A partial protection against double jeopardy is a [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Right]] guaranteed under Article 20 (2) of the [[Constitution of India]], which states, "No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once".<ref>{{cite document|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023|title=Article 20, Section 2|work=[http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/part.htm Constitution of India|quote=No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101124001157/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023|archivedate=24 November 2010}}</ref> This provision enshrines the concept of ''autrefois convict'', that no one convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time. However it does not extend to ''autrefois acquit'', and so if a person is acquitted of a crime, he can be retried. In India, protection against ''autrefois acquit'' is a [[Statutory right|statuatory right]], not a fundamental one. Such protection is provided by provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure rather than by the Constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sharma|author2=Sharma B.k.|title=Introduction to the Constitution of India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC|year=2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

===Japan===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[Constitution of Japan]] states in Article 39 that
:No person shall be held criminally liable for an act which was lawful at the time it was committed, or of which he has been acquitted, nor shall he be placed in double jeopardy.

In practice, however, if someone is acquitted in a lower District Court, then the prosecutor can appeal to the High Court, and then to the Supreme Court. Only the acquittal in the Supreme Court is the final acquittal which prevents any further retrial. This process sometimes takes decades.

The above is not considered a violation of the constitution.  Because of Supreme Court precedent, this process is all considered part of a single proceeding.<ref>[http://blog.livedoor.jp/plltakano/archives/54254570.html 刑事裁判を考える：高野隆＠ブログ:二重の危険].

===The Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the state prosecution can appeal a not-guilty verdict at the bench. New evidence can be brought to bear during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.

According to Dutch legal experts Crombag, Wagenaar, van Koppen, the Dutch system contravenes the provisions of the European Human Rights convention, in the imbalance between the power of the prosecution service and the defence.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

On 9 April 2013 the Dutch senate voted 36 "yes" versus 35 "no" in favor of a new law that allows the prosecutor to re-try a person who was found not guilty in court. This new law is limited to crimes where someone died and new evidence must have been gathered. The new law also works retroactively.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Double jeopardy has been permitted in [[England and Wales]] in certain (exceptional) circumstances since the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

===== Pre-2003 =====

The doctrines of ''[[Peremptory plea|autrefois acquit]]'' and ''autrefois convict'' persisted as part of the [[common law]] from the time of the [[Norman conquest of England]]; they were regarded as essential elements of protection of the liberty of the subject and respect for [[due process]] of law in that there should be finality of proceedings.<ref name="Benét1864p97" /> There were only three exceptions, all relatively recent, to the rules:
*The prosecution has a right of appeal against acquittal in summary cases if the decision appears to be wrong in law or in excess of jurisdiction.<ref>Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 ss.28, 111; Supreme Court Act 1981 s.28</ref>
*A retrial is permissible if the interests of justice so require, following appeal against conviction by a defendant.<ref>Criminal Appeal Act 1968 s.7</ref>
*A "tainted acquittal", where there has been an offence of interference with, or intimidation of, a juror or witness, can be challenged in the High Court.<ref name="CPIA96">Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 s.54</ref>

In [[Connelly v DPP]] ([1964] AC 1254), the [[Law Lords]] ruled that a defendant could not be tried for any offence arising out of substantially the same set of facts relied upon in a previous charge of which he had been acquitted, unless there are "special circumstances" proven by the prosecution. There is little case law on the meaning of "special circumstances", but it has been suggested that the emergence of new evidence would suffice.<ref>Attorney-General for Gibraltar v Leoni, Court of Appeal, 1999 (unreported) see Law Com CP No 156, para 2.24</ref>

A defendant who had been convicted of an offence could be given a second trial for an aggravated form of that offence if the facts constituting the aggravation were discovered after the first conviction.<ref>R v Thomas [1950] 1 KB 26</ref> By contrast, a person who had been acquitted of a lesser offence could not be tried for an aggravated form even if new evidence became available.<ref>R v Beedie [1998] QB 356, Dingwall, 2000</ref>

===== Post-2003 =====

Following the [[murder of Stephen Lawrence]], the [[Macpherson Report]] recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be [[Repeal|abrogated]] in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if "fresh and viable" new evidence later came to light. The [[Law Commission]] later added its support to this in its report "Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals" (2001). A parallel report into the [[criminal justice system]] by [[Robin Auld|Lord Justice Auld]], a past [[Senior Presiding Judge]] for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report six months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that "the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify."<ref>{{cite web|title=A Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales by The Right Honourable Lord Justice Auld|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.criminal-courts-review.org.uk/|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=September 2001}}</ref>

The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment.<ref>[[North Carolina v. Pearce]], 395 U.S. 711 (1969).</ref> Jeopardy "attaches" when the jury is empanelled, the first witness is sworn, or a plea is accepted.<ref>[[Crist v. Bretz]], 437 U.S. 28 (1978).</ref>

;Prosecution after acquittal
The government is not permitted to appeal or retry the defendant once jeopardy attaches to a trial unless the case does not conclude. Conditions which constitute "conclusion" of a case include
* After the entry of an acquittal,
** whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury,<ref>[[Fong Foo v. United States]], 369 U.S. 141 (1962); [[Sanabria v. United States]],  437 U.S. 54 (1978).</ref>
** a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury,<ref>[[United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.]], 430 U.S. 564 (1977).</ref>
** an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court),<ref>[[Burks v. United States]], 437 U.S. 1 (1978).</ref>
** or an "implied acquittal" via conviction of a [[lesser included offence]].<ref>[[Green v. United States]], 355 U.S. 184 (1957).</ref>
*  re-litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal,<ref>[[Ashe v. Swenson]],  397 U.S. 436 (1970).</ref> even if the jury hung on other counts.<ref>[[Yeager v. United States]], 557 U.S. 110 (2009).</ref> In such a situation,  the government is barred by [[collateral estoppel]].
In these cases the trial is concluded and the prosecution is precluded from appealing or retrying the defendant over the offense to which they were acquitted.

This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss<ref>[[Serfass v. United States]], 420 U.S. 377 (1973).</ref> or other non-merits dismissal,<ref>[[United States v. Scott]], 437 U.S. 82 (1978).</ref> or a directed verdict after a jury conviction,<ref>[[Wilson v. United States]], 420 U.S. 332 (1975).</ref>  nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute.<ref>[[Smith v. Massachusetts]], 543 U.S. 462 (2005).</ref> Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency,<ref>[[Ball v. United States]], 163 U.S. 662 (1896).</ref> including ''habeas corpus'',<ref>[[United States v. Tateo]], 377 U.S. 463 (1964).</ref> or "thirteenth juror" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency<ref>[[Tibbs v. Florida]], 457 U.S. 31 (1982).</ref> on the principle that jeopardy has not "terminated." There may also be an exception for judicial bribery,<ref>[[Aleman v. Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County]], 138 F.3d 302  (7th Cir. 1998).</ref> but not jury bribery.

The "dual sovereignty" doctrine allows a federal prosecution of an offense to proceed regardless of a previous state prosecution for that same offense<ref>''Abbate v. United States'', 359 U.S. 187 (1959).</ref> and vice versa<ref>''Bartkus v. Illinois'', 359 U.S. 121 (1959).</ref> because "an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each."<ref>''United States v. Lanza'', 260 U.S. 377 (1922).</ref>  The doctrine is solidly entrenched in the law, but there has been a traditional reluctance in the federal executive branch to gratuitously wield the power it grants.<ref>Wayne R. LaFave, et al., ''Criminal Procedure ''§ 25.5(a) (4th ed. 2004).</ref>  

Another exception is that the perpetrator can be retried by court martial in a military court, if they have been previously acquitted by a civilian court, and are members of the military.<ref>{{cite web|author=SBM Blog |url=http://sbmblog.typepad.com/sbm-blog/2012/02/double-jeopardy-and-the-military-a-lurid-case-in-point.html |title=Double Jeopardy and the Military: A Sensational Case In Point - SBM Blog |publisher=Sbmblog.typepad.com |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref>

;Multiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction
In ''[[Blockburger v. United States]]'' (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.<ref>[[Blockburger v. United States]], 284 U.S. 299 (1932). ''See, e.g.'', [[Brown v. Ohio]], 432 U.S. 161 (1977).</ref> An example of this is the successful prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 242 (deprivation of rights under color of law) of some of the Los Angeles police officers involved in the [[Rodney King]] beating after their acquittal in California state court on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer.<ref>''Koon v. United States, ''518 U.S. 81 (1996).</ref>  ''Blockburger'' is the default rule, unless the governing statute legislatively intends to depart; for example, [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]] (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates,<ref>[[Garrett v. United States]],  471 U.S. 773 (1985); [[Rutledge v. United States]], 517 U.S. 292 (1996).</ref> as can conspiracy.<ref>[[United States v. Felix]], 503 U.S. 378 (1992).</ref>

The ''Blockburger'' test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction.<ref>[[Missouri v. Hunter]], 459 U.S. 359 (1983).</ref> In ''[[Grady v. Corbin]]'' (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the ''Blockburger'' test was not satisfied,<ref>[[Grady v. Corbin]], 495 U.S. 508 (1990).</ref> but ''Grady'' was overruled in ''[[United States v. Dixon]]'' (1993).<ref>[[United States v. Dixon]], 509 U.S. 688 (1993).</ref>

;Prosecution after mistrial
The rule for [[mistrial]]s depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in "bad faith," i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial.<ref>[[Oregon v. Kennedy]], 456 U.S. 667 (1982).</ref> If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds "manifest necessity" for granting the mistrial.<ref>[[Arizona v. Washington]], 434 U.S. 497 (1978).</ref> The same standard governs mistrials granted [[sua sponte]].

Retrials are not common, due to the legal expenses to the government.  However, in the mid-1980s Georgia antiques dealer [[James Arthur Williams]] was tried a record ''four'' times for the murder of Danny Hansford and (after three mistrials) was finally acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.  The case is recounted in the book [[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]] which was adapted into a film directed by [[Clint Eastwood]] (the movie omits the first three murder trials).
