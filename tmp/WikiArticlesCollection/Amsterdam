Amsterdam's name derives from ''Amstelredamme'',<ref name="Britannica Eleven">[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], Vol 1, pp. 896-898.</ref> indicative of the city's origin as a dam of the river [[Amstel]]. Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important ports in the world during the [[Dutch Golden Age]], a result of its innovative developments in trade. During that time, the city was the leading center for finance and diamonds.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521845359&ss=exc Cambridge.org], Capitals of Capital -A History of International Financial Centres – 1780–2005, Youssef Cassis, ISBN 978-0-521-84535-9</ref> In the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Expansion of Amsterdam since the 19th century|the city expanded]], and many new neighborhoods and suburbs were planned and built. The 17th-century [[canals of Amsterdam]] and the 19–20th century [[Stelling van Amsterdam|Defence Line of Amsterdam]] are on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].

===Etymology===

[[File:Okerk2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|180px|The [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] was consecrated in 1306.]]
The earliest recorded use of the name "Amsterdam" is from a certificate dated 27 October 1275, when the inhabitants, who had built a bridge with a dam across the [[Amstel]], were exempted from paying a [[toll bridge|bridge toll]] by Count [[Floris V, Count of Holland|Floris V]].<ref name="language">{{cite book

The certificate describes the inhabitants as ''homines manentes apud Amestelledamme'' (people living near ''Amestelledamme'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/trade/toll_privilege/index.en.html |title=The toll privilege of 1275 in the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> By 1327, the name had developed into ''Aemsterdam''.<ref name="language"/>

===Founding and Middle Ages===

Amsterdam's founding is relatively recent compared with much older Dutch cities such as [[Nijmegen]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Utrecht]]. In October 2008, [[historical geography|historical geographer]] Chris de Bont suggested that the land around Amsterdam was being reclaimed as early as the late 10th century. This does not necessarily mean that there was already a settlement then since [[land reclamation|reclamation of land]] may not have been for farming—it may have been for [[peat]], used as fuel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/%27Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen%27.html|title=Amsterdam 200 jaar ouder dan aangenomen|accessdate=22 October 2008|date=22 October 2008|publisher=Nu.nl|language=Dutch| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081025045803/http://www.nu.nl/news/1801750/80/rss/'Amsterdam_200_jaar_ouder_dan_aangenomen'.html| archivedate= 25 October 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Amsterdam was granted [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] in either 1300 or 1306.<ref name="amnlgeschedenis">{{cite web

In 1345, an alleged [[Blessed Sacrament|Eucharistic miracle]] in the [[Kalverstraat]] rendered the city an important place of pilgrimage until the [[Protestant Reformation|adoption of the Protestant faith]]. The ''[[Stille Omgang]]''—a silent [[procession]] in civil attire—is today a remnant of the rich pilgrimage history.<ref name="stilleomgang">{{cite web

===Conflict with Spain===

In the 16th century, the Dutch rebelled against [[Philip II of Spain]] and his successors. The main reasons for the uprising were the imposition of new taxes, the tenth penny, and the [[religious persecution]] of Protestants by the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The revolt escalated into the [[Eighty Years' War]], which ultimately led to Dutch independence.<ref name="80yearswar">{{cite web

[[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Jews]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], [[Huguenot]]s from France, prosperous merchants and printers from [[Flanders]], and economic and religious refugees from the Spanish-controlled parts of the [[Low Countries]] found safety in Amsterdam. The influx of Flemish printers and the city's intellectual tolerance made Amsterdam a centre for the European [[freedom of the press|free press]].<ref>Case in point: After [[Galileo affair|his trial and sentencing]] in Rome in 1633, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] chose [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] in Amsterdam to publish one of his finest works, ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.

===Center of the Dutch Golden Age===

The 17th century is considered Amsterdam's ''[[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]]'', during which it became the wealthiest city in the world.<ref>E. Haverkamp-Bergmann, Rembrandt; The Night Watch (New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]], 1982), p. 57</ref> Ships sailed from Amsterdam to the [[Baltic Sea]], North America, and Africa, as well as present-day Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, forming the basis of a worldwide trading network. Amsterdam's merchants had the largest share in both the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. These companies acquired overseas possessions that later became [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonies]]. Amsterdam was Europe's most important point for the shipment of goods and was the leading [[Financial centre|Financial Centre]] of the world.<ref>[http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/Amsterdam_l.html Amsterdam in the 17th century], The University of [[North Carolina]] at Pembroke</ref> In 1602, the Amsterdam office of the Dutch East India Company became the world's first [[stock exchange]] by trading in its own shares.<ref name="The oldest share">{{cite web

[[File:Amsterdam-Bowyer-1814.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Amsterdam Royal Palace|Royal Palace]], [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], and now demolished weigh house on [[Dam Square]] in 1814.]]
Amsterdam lost over 10% of its population to [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. Nevertheless, the population of Amsterdam rose in the 17th century (largely through immigration) from 50,000 to 200,000.<ref>[http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/351/351-012.htm Geography, climate, population, economy, society]. J.P.Sommerville.</ref>

===Decline and modernization===

Amsterdam's prosperity declined during the 18th and early 19th centuries. The [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|wars]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] with [[Kingdom of England|England]] and France took their toll on Amsterdam. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Amsterdam's significance reached its lowest point, with Holland being absorbed into the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]. However, the later establishment of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 marked a turning point.

The [[Amsterdam–Rhine Canal|Amsterdam-Rhine Canal]] was dug to give Amsterdam a direct connection to the [[Rhine]], and the [[North Sea Canal]] was dug to give the port a shorter connection to the [[North Sea]]. Both projects dramatically improved commerce with the rest of Europe and the world. In 1906, [[Joseph Conrad]] gave a brief description of Amsterdam as seen from the seaside, in ''[[q:Joseph Conrad#The Mirror of the Sea (1906)|The Mirror of the Sea]]''.

===Twentieth century===

Shortly before the First World War, the city began expanding, and new suburbs were built. Even though the Netherlands remained neutral in this war, Amsterdam suffered a food shortage, and heating fuel became scarce. The shortages sparked riots in which several people were killed. These riots are known as the ''Aardappeloproer'' (Potato rebellion). People started looting stores and warehouses in order to get supplies, mainly food.<ref name="aardappeloproer">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf|title=Aardappeloproer – Legermuseum|format=PDF|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 May 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080528004443/http://www.collectie.legermuseum.nl/sites/strategion/contents/i004516/arma39%20het%20aardappeloproer%20in%201917.pdf| archivedate= 28 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940 and took control of the country. Some Amsterdam citizens sheltered Jews, thereby exposing themselves and their families to the high risk of being imprisoned or sent to concentration camps. More than 100,000 [[Dutch Jews]] were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]] of which some 60.000 lived in Amsterdam. Perhaps the most famous deportee was the young Jewish girl [[Anne Frank]], who died in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]].<ref name="deportation">{{cite web

These suburbs contained many public parks and wide, open spaces, and the new buildings provided improved housing conditions with larger and brighter rooms, gardens, and balconies. Because of the war and other incidents of the 20th century, almost the entire city centre had fallen into disrepair. As society was changing, politicians and other influential figures made plans to redesign large parts of it. There was an increasing demand for office buildings and new roads as the automobile became available to most common people.<ref name="stadsherstel">{{cite web

Further plans were to build a new highway above the metro to connect the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station|Central Station]] and city centre with other parts of the city.

The incorporated large-scale demolitions began in Amsterdam's formerly Jewish neighbourhood. Smaller streets, such as the ''Jodenbreestraat'', were widened and saw almost all of their houses demolished. During the destruction's peak, the ''[[Nieuwmarkt]]rellen'' (Nieuwmarkt riots) broke out,<ref name="metrostad">{{cite web

As a result, the demolition was stopped, and the highway was never built, with only the metro being finished. Only a few streets remained widened. The new city hall was built on the almost completely demolished ''Waterlooplein''. Meanwhile, large private organisations, such as ''Stadsherstel Amsterdam'', were founded with the aim of restoring the entire city centre. Although the success of this struggle is visible today, efforts for further restoration are still ongoing.<ref name="stadsherstel"/> The entire city centre has reattained its former splendor and, as a whole, is now a [[protected area]]. Many of its buildings have become monuments, and in July 2010 the ''Grachtengordel'' ([[Herengracht]], [[Keizersgracht]], and [[Prinsengracht]]) was added to the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]].<ref name="unesco">{{cite web

===Twenty first century===

At the beginning of the new millennium, social problems such as safety, ethnic discrimination and segregation between religious and social groups began to develop. Forty-five percent of the population of Amsterdam has non-Dutch parents. Large social groups come from Suriname, the Dutch Antilles, Morocco and Turkey. Amsterdam is characterized by its (perceived) social tolerance and diversity. The former mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, and his alderman for integration Ahmed Aboutaleb (Now mayor of Rotterdam)  formulated a policy of "keeping things together" which involves social dialogue, tolerance and harsh measures against those who break the law.

==Geography==

[[File:Amsterdam-topografie.jpg|thumb|180px|Topography]]
Amsterdam is located in the western Netherlands, in the province of [[North Holland]]. The river [[Amstel]] terminates in the city centre and connects to a large number of canals that eventually terminate in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]]. Amsterdam is situated 2 metres below [[above mean sea level|sea level]].<ref name="elevation">{{cite web

===Climate===
Amsterdam has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. Winters are cool. Amsterdam, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Amsterdam is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as having a significant [[Urban heat island|heat-island effect]], nights rarely fall below {{convert|-5|°C|0}}, while it could easily be {{convert|−12|°C|0}} in Hilversum, {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast. Summers are moderately warm but rarely hot. The average daily high in August is {{convert|22.1|°C|1}}, and {{convert|30|°C}} or higher is only measured on average on 2.5 days, placing Amsterdam in AHS Heat Zone 2. The record extremes range from {{convert|-24|°C}} to {{convert|36.8|°C}}.<ref name="Extreme temps">{{cite web|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm |title=Extreme temperatures around the world |publisher=Herrera, Maximiliano |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref>
Days with more than {{convert|1|mm|2}} of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are common, on average 133 days per year. Amsterdam's average annual precipitation is {{convert|915|mm|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.klimaatatlas.nl/tabel/stationsdata/klimtab_8110_240.pdf |title= Stationsdata station Schiphol 1981–2010 |accessdate= 10 September 2013 |publisher= Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute}}</ref> more than what is measured at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. A large part of this precipitation falls as light rain or brief showers. Cloudy and damp days are common during the cooler months of October through March.

Amsterdam has a population of 800,000 inhabitants within city limits. On 1 January 2012, the ethnic makeup of Amsterdam was 49.5% of Dutch ancestry and 50.5% of foreign origin.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
In the 16th and 17th century non-Dutch immigrants to
Amsterdam were mostly [[Huguenot]]s, [[Flemish people|Flemings]], [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Westphalia]]ns. Huguenots came after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau (1685)|Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685, while the Flemish Protestants came during the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The Westphalians came to Amsterdam mostly for economic reasons – their influx continued through the 18th and 19th centuries. Before the Second World War, 10% of the city population was [[Jewish community of Amsterdam|Jewish]].

The first mass immigration in the 20th century were by people from Indonesia, who came to Amsterdam after the independence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1960s [[Foreign worker|guest workers]] from Turkey, Morocco, Italy and Spain emigrated to Amsterdam. After the independence of Suriname in 1975, a large wave of [[Surinamese people|Surinamese]] settled in Amsterdam, mostly in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area. Other immigrants, including refugees [[Right of asylum|asylum seekers]] and [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], came from Europe, [[Americas|America]], Asia, and Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s, many 'old' Amsterdammers moved to 'new' cities like [[Almere]] and [[Purmerend]], prompted by the third [[Land use planning|planological]] bill of the Dutch government. This bill promoted suburbanisation and arranged for new developments in so called "groeikernen", literally "cores of growth". Young professionals and artists moved into neighbourhoods de Pijp and the [[Jordaan]] abandoned by these Amsterdammers. The non-Western immigrants settled mostly in the [[Public housing|social housing]] projects in Amsterdam-West and the Bijlmer. Today, people of non-Western origin make up approximately one-third of the population of Amsterdam, and more than 50% of children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/bevolking/publicaties/artikelen/archief/2006/2006-1995-wm.htm?RefererType=Favorite |title=Half of young big-city dwellers have non-western background |publisher=Cbs.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="OS 4351">{{cite web

The largest [[religious denomination|religious group]] are Christians (17% in 2000), who are divided between Roman Catholics and Protestants. The next largest religion is Islam (14% in 2000), most of whose followers are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]].<ref name="religion">{{cite web

In 1578 the previously Roman Catholic city of Amsterdam joined the revolt against Spanish rule, late in comparison to other major northern Dutch cities. In line with Protestant procedure of that time, all churches were converted to Protestant worship. [[Calvinism]] became the dominant religion, and although Catholicism was not forbidden and priests allowed to serve, the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic hierarchy]] was prohibited. This led to the establishment of ''schuilkerken'', covert churches, behind seemingly ordinary canal side house fronts. One example is the current debate centre [[de Rode Hoed]].
A large influx of foreigners of many religions came to 17th-century Amsterdam, in particular [[Sephardi Jews|Sefardic Jews]] from Spain and Portugal, [[Huguenot]]s from France, and Protestants from the [[Southern Netherlands]]. This led to the establishment of many non-Dutch-speaking religious churches. In 1603, the first notification was made of Jewish religious service. In 1639, the first synagogue was consecrated. The Jews came to call the town [[Jerusalem of the West]], a reference to their sense of belonging there.

As they became established in the city, other [[Christian denomination]]s used converted Catholic chapels to conduct their own services. The oldest English-language church congregation in the world outside the United Kingdom is found at the [[Begijnhof, Amsterdam|Begijnhof]]. Regular services there are still offered in English under the auspices of the Church of Scotland.<ref name="englishchurch">{{cite web

}}</ref> The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognizable today as they offer occasional services in French.

In the second half of the 17th century, Amsterdam experienced an influx of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]], Jews from [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]], which continued into the 19th century. Jews often fled the [[pogrom]]s in those areas. The first Ashkenazi who arrived in Amsterdam were [[refugee]]s from the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki Uprising]] in Poland and the [[Thirty Years' War]]. They not only founded their own synagogues, but had a strong influence on the 'Amsterdam dialect' adding a large [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] local vocabulary.

Despite an absence of an official Jewish [[ghetto]], most Jews preferred to live in the eastern part of the old medieval heart of the city. The main street of this Jewish neighborhood was the ''Jodenbreestraat''. The neighborhood comprised the ''Waterlooplein'' and the [[Nieuwmarkt]].<ref name="Jodenbuurt Amsterdam">{{cite web

This led to riots, and as a result the original plans for large-scale reconstruction were abandoned and the neighborhood was rebuilt with smaller-scale residence buildings on the basis of its original layout.

[[File:Vondelpark, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Vondelpark is the largest park in Amsterdam.]]
Catholic churches in Amsterdam have been constructed since the restoration of the episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, [[Pierre Cuypers|Cuypers]], was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the [[Rijksmuseum]], which led to a refusal of Protestant King [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] to open 'that monastery'.
In 1924, [[Catholic Church|the Roman Catholic Church]] of the Netherlands hosted the [[Eucharistic Congress|International Eucharistic Congress]] in Amsterdam, and numerous Catholic [[prelate]]s visited the city, where festivities were held in churches and stadiums. Catholic processions on the public streets, however, were still forbidden under law at the time. Only in the 20th century was Amsterdam's relation to Catholicism normalized, but despite its far larger [[population size]], the [[Holy Orders|Catholic clergy]] chose to place its episcopal see of the city in the nearby provincial town of [[Haarlem]].<ref name="Diocese of Haarlem">{{cite web

In recent times, religious demographics in Amsterdam have been changed by large-scale immigration from former colonies. Immigrants from Suriname have introduced [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Protestantism and [[Lutheranism]], from the Hernhutter variety; [[Hinduism]] has been introduced mainly from Suriname; and several distinct branches of Islam have been brought from various parts of the world. Islam is now the largest non-Christian religion in Amsterdam. The large community of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants have established African churches, often in parking garages in the [[Bijlmermeer|Bijlmer]] area, where many have settled. In addition, a broad array of other religious movements have established congregations, including [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Hinduism]].

[[File:De Gooyer Windmill.jpg|thumb|The [[De Gooyer]] Windmill was constructed in 1725 and moved to its current location in 1814; it is one of eight windmills in Amsterdam.]]
Although the saying "Leef en laat leven" or "Live and let live" summarizes the Dutch and especially the Amsterdam open and tolerant society, the increased influx of many races, religions, and cultures after the Second World War, has on a number of occasions strained [[social relation]]s. With 176 different nationalities, Amsterdam is home to one of the widest varieties of nationalities of any city in the world.<ref>Quest, issue of march 2009</ref> The share of the population of immigrant ancestry in the city proper now is about 50%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.os.amsterdam.nl/tabel/7003/ |title=Amsterdam in cijfers 2010 |publisher=Os.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref>

The city has been at times marked by ethnic tension. In 2004 film director Theo van Gogh was murdered by a Muslim extremist in Amsterdam. Among others, in line with attitude changes in Dutch politics towards certain (especially Islamic) minorities Turkish-language and Arabic-language TV channels have been dropped from the basic cable TV package.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kabelraden.nl/nieuws/programmaraadnieuws/ni/12814/rotterdammers-willen-trt-terug/ |title=Programmaraadnieuws |publisher=Kabelraden.nl |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In recent years, politicians are actively discouraged against campaigning in minority languages. In the previous local elections politicians were criticized by current Amsterdam mayor Mr van der Laan (then minister of Integration) for distributing election leaflets in minority languages and in some cases leaflets were collected. Due to this anti-Multicultural stand, van der Laan has been accused of hypocrisy by its own party's [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] main candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/258644/PvdAlijsttrekker-Van-der-Laan-ongekend-hypocriet.htm |title=Nederland - PvdA-lijsttrekker: Van der Laan ongekend hypocriet |publisher=Elsevier.nl |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>  Also during the same period, possibly due to his belief in integration via (possibly not always voluntary) assimilation, Amsterdam has been one of the municipalities in the Netherlands which provided immigrants with extensive and free [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] courses, which have benefited many immigrants.

Amsterdam fans out south from the [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station]]. The oldest area of the town is known as ''[[de Wallen]]'' (the quays). It lies to the east of Damrak and contains the city's famous red light district. To the south of de Wallen is the old Jewish quarter of Waterlooplein. The mideavel and colonial age [[canals of Amsterdam]], known as ''Grachten'', embraces the heart of the city where homes have interesting gables. Beyond the Grachtengordel are the former working class areas of [[Jordaan]] and de Pijp. The [[Museumplein]] with the city's major museums, the [[Vondelpark]], a 19th-century park named after the Dutch writer [[Joost van den Vondel]], and the [[Plantage (Amsterdam)|Plantage]] neighbourhood, with the [[Artis|zoo]], are also located outside the Grachtengordel.

Several parts of the city and the surrounding urban area are [[polder]]s. This can be recognised by the suffix ''-meer'' which means ''lake'', as in [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]].

Known as the ''Grachtengordel'', three of the canals were mostly for residential development: the ''[[Herengracht]]'' (where "Heren" refers to ''Heren Regeerders van de stad Amsterdam'' (ruling lords of Amsterdam), and ''gracht'' means canal, so the name can be roughly translated as "Canal of the lords"), ''[[Keizersgracht]]'' (Emperor's Canal), and ''[[Prinsengracht]]'' (Prince's Canal).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadsherstel.nl/content/ned/actualiteiten/Vriendenwandeling/documents/Vriendenwandelingroute2011.pdf|title=Vriendenwandelingroute2011.pdf|publisher=stadsherstel|accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref> The fourth and outermost canal is the ''Singelgracht'', which is often not mentioned on maps, because it is a collective name for all canals in the outer ring. The Singelgracht should not be confused with the oldest and most inner canal ''[[Singel (Amsterdam)|Singel]]''. The canals served for defence, [[water management]] and transport. The defences took the form of a moat and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthen dikes]], with gates at transit points, but otherwise no masonry [[superstructure]]s.<ref>{{cite book

Construction started in 1613 and proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic [[Windscreen wiper|windshield wiper]] as the historian [[Geert Mak]] calls it – and ''not'' from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mak|first=G.|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|publisher=Uitgeverij Atlas|year=1995|location=Amsterdam/Antwerp|isbn=90-450-1232-4}}</ref>

===Expansion===
{{Main|Expansion of Amsterdam since the 19th century}}

After the development of Amsterdam's canals in the 17th century, the city did not grow beyond its borders for two centuries. During the 19th century, [[Samuel Sarphati]] devised a plan based on the grandeur of Paris and London at that time. The plan envisaged the construction of new houses, public buildings and streets just outside the ''grachtengordel''. The main aim of the plan, however, was to improve [[public health]]. Although the plan did not expand the city, it did produce some of the largest [[Building|public buildings]] to date, like the ''Paleis voor Volksvlijt''.<ref name="joodsmuseum">{{cite web

Following Sarphati, ''Van Niftrik'' and ''Kalff'' designed an entire ring of 19th century neighbourhoods surrounding the city’s centre, with the city preserving the ownership of all land outside the 17th century limit, thus firmly controlling development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/maps/plan_van_niftrik/index.en.html |title=Van Niftrik's plan at the Amsterdam City Archives |publisher=Stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> Most of these neighbourhoods became home to the working class.<ref name="oudzuid">{{cite web

In response to overcrowding, two plans were designed at the beginning of the 20th century which were very different from anything Amsterdam had ever seen before: ''Plan Zuid'', designed by the architect [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]], and ''West''. These plans involved the development of new neighbourhoods consisting of ''housing blocks'' for all social classes.<ref name="archiefberlage">{{cite web

After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods were built in the western, southeastern, and northern parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and give people affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by [[Automobile|motor car]]. The western suburbs which were built in that period are collectively called the ''Westelijke Tuinsteden''. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the ''Bijlmer''.<ref name="bijlmer">{{cite web

It was constructed around 1425 and is one of only two existing wooden buildings. It is also one of the few examples of [[Gothic architecture]] in Amsterdam.
In the 16th century, wooden buildings were razed and replaced with brick ones. During this period, many buildings were constructed in the [[architectural style]] of the [[Renaissance]]. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their [[Crow-stepped gable|stepped gable]] façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style.

Philip Vingboons designed splendid merchants' houses throughout the city. A famous building in [[baroque|baroque style]] in Amsterdam is the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] on [[Dam Square]]. Throughout the 18th century, Amsterdam was heavily influenced by [[Culture of France|French culture]]. This is reflected in the architecture of that period. Around 1815, architects broke with the baroque style and started building in different neo-styles.<ref name="neostijl">{{cite web

At the end of the 19th century, the [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] or [[Art Nouveau]] style became popular and many new buildings were constructed in this architectural style. Since Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period, new buildings adjacent to the city centre were also built in this style. The houses in the vicinity of the [[Museumplein|Museum Square]] in Amsterdam Oud-Zuid are an example of Jugendstil. The last style that was popular in Amsterdam before the [[Modern history|modern era]] was [[Art Deco]]. Amsterdam had its own version of the style, which was called the [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdamse School]]. Whole districts were built this style, such as the ''Rivierenbuurt''.<ref name="aschool">{{cite web

The old city centre is the focal point of all the architectural styles before the end of the 19th century.
Jugendstil and Georgian are mostly found outside the city’s centre in the neighbourhoods built in the early
20th century, although there are also some striking examples of these styles in the city centre.
Most historic buildings in the city centre and nearby are houses, such as the famous merchants' houses lining the canals.

===Parks and recreational areas===

Amsterdam has many parks, open spaces, and squares throughout the city. [[Vondelpark]], the largest park in the city, is located in the [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]] borough and is named after the 17th century Amsterdam author, [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Yearly, the park has around 10 million visitors. In the park is an open air theatre, a playground and several [[horeca]] facilities. In the [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Zuid]] borough, is [[Beatrixpark (Amsterdam)|Beatrixpark]], named after [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]]. Between Amsterdam and [[Amstelveen]] is the [[Amsterdamse Bos]] (Amsterdam Forest), the largest recreational area in Amsterdam. Annually, almost 4.5 million people visit the park, which has a size of 1,000 [[hectare]]s and is approximately three times the size of [[Central Park]].<ref>[http://www.amsterdamsebos.amsterdam.nl/algemene_onderdelen/english_site Amsterdamse Bos - English site]. [[Government of Amsterdam|City of Amsterdam]]. Retrieved on 2008-11-27.</ref> [[Amstelpark]] in the [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Zuid]] borough houses the Rieker windmill, which dates to 1636. Other parks include [[Sarphatipark]] in the [[De Pijp]] neighborhood, [[Oosterpark (Amsterdam)|Oosterpark]] in the [[Amsterdam-Oost|Oost]] borough, and [[Westerpark]] in the [[Westerpark (neighborhood)|Westerpark]] neighborhood. The city has four beaches, the Nemo Beach, Citybeach "Het stenen hoofd" (Silodam), Blijburg, and one in [[Amsterdam-Noord]].

The city has many open squares (plein in Dutch). The namesake of the city as the site of the original dam, [[Dam Square]], is the main town square and has the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Royal Palace]] and [[National Monument (Amsterdam)|National Monument]]. [[Museumplein]] hosts various museums, including the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Van Gogh Museum]], and [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]]. Other squares include [[Rembrandtplein]], [[Muntplein, Amsterdam|Muntplein]], [[Nieuwmarkt]], [[Leidseplein]], [[Spui (Amsterdam)|Spui]], and [[Waterlooplein]].

[[File:RedLightDistrictAmsterdamTheNetherlands.jpg|thumb|left|The [[red-light district]] is a major [[tourist attraction]].]]
'''De Wallen''', also known as '''Walletjes''' or '''Rosse Buurt''', is a designated area for [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|legalised prostitution]] and is Amsterdam's largest and most well known [[red-light district]]. This neighborhood has become a famous attraction for tourists. It consists of a network of roads and alleys containing several hundred small, one-room apartments rented by [[sex worker]]s who offer their services from behind a window or glass door, typically illuminated with red lights.

===Retail===
Shops in Amsterdam range from large [[department store]]s such as [[De Bijenkorf]] founded in 1870 and [[Maison de Bonneterie]] a Parisian style store founded in 1889, to small [[specialty store|specialty shops]]. Amsterdam's [[Upmarket|high-end]] shops are found in the streets ''Pieter Cornelisz Hooftstraat'' and ''Cornelis Schuytstraat'', which are located in the vicinity of the [[Vondelpark]]. One of Amsterdam's busiest high streets is the narrow, medieval ''Kalverstraat'' in the heart of the city. Another shopping areas are the ''Negen Straatjes'' and Haarlemmerdijk and Haarlemmerstraat. ''Negen Straatjes'' are nine narrow streets within the ''Grachtengordel'', the concentric canal system of Amsterdam. The Negen Straatjes differ from other shopping districts with the presence of a large diversity of privately owned shops. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk were voted best shopping street in the Netherlands in 2011. These streets have as the ''Negen Straatjes'' a large diversity of privately owned shops. But as the ''Negen Straatjes'' are dominated by fashion stores the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk offer a very wide variety of all kinds of stores, just to name some specialties: candy and other food related stores, lingerie, sneakers, wedding clothing, interior shops, books, Italian deli's, racing and mountain bikes, skatewear, etc.

The city also features a large number of open-air markets such as the ''[[Albert Cuyp Market|Albert Cuypmarkt]]'', ''Westerstraat-markt'', ''Ten Katemarkt'', and ''[[Dappermarkt]]''. Some of these markets are held on a daily basis, like the Albert Cuypmarkt and the Dappermarkt. Others, like the Westerstraat-markt, are held on a weekly basis.

===Fashion===
Fashion brands like [[G-Star Raw|G-star]], Gsus, BlueBlood, Iris van Herpen, [[10 feet]] and [[Warmenhoven & Venderbos]], and fashion designers like [[Mart Visser]], [[Viktor & Rolf]], Sheila de Vries, [[Marlies Dekkers]] and [[Frans Molenaar]] are based in Amsterdam. [[Modeling agency|Modelling agencies]] [[Elite Model Management|Elite Models]], Touche models and Tony Jones have opened branches in Amsterdam. Supermodels [[Yfke Sturm]], [[Doutzen Kroes]] and [[Kim Noorda]] started their careers in Amsterdam. Amsterdam has its garment centre in the World Fashion Center. Buildings which formerly housed brothels in the red light district have been converted to ateliers for young fashion designers, AKA eagle fuel.

The most important museums of Amsterdam are located on the [[Museumplein]] (''Museum Square''), located at the southwestern side of the Rijksmuseum. It was created in the last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|World's fair]].

The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A [[Multi-storey car park|parking garage]] can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. ''Het Museumplein'' is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realized in 1999, when the square was remodeled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.<ref name="museumpleinfacelift">{{cite web

</ref> The artist most associated with Amsterdam is [[Rembrandt]], whose work, and the work of his pupils, is displayed in the Rijksmuseum. Rembrandt's masterpiece [[Night Watch (painting)|De Nachtwacht]] (''The Night Watch'') is one of top pieces of art of the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like [[Bartholomeus van der Helst|Van der Helst]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Ferdinand Bol]], [[Aelbert Cuyp|Albert Cuyp]], [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Jacob van Ruisdael]] and [[Paulus Potter]]. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of [[Decorative arts|decorative art]]. This ranges from [[Delftware]] to giant [[dollhouse]]s from the 17th century. The architect of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival]] building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10 year, 375 million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on April 13, 2013.

[[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] lived in Amsterdam for a short while and there is a [[Van Gogh Museum|museum dedicated to his work]]. The museum is housed in one of the few modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]]. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]]. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, like the [[The Potato Eaters|Aardappeleters]] (''The Potato Eaters'') and [[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|Zonnebloemen]] (''Sunflowers''), are present in the collection. The Van Gogh museum is the most visited museum in Amsterdam.<ref name="vangogh1">{{cite web

Next to the Van Gogh museum stands the [[Stedelijk Museum]]. This is Amsterdam's most important museum of [[modern art]] . The museum is as old as the square it borders and was opened in 1895. The permanent collection consists of works of art from artists like [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondriaan]], [[Karel Appel]], and [[Kazimir Malevich]]. After renovations lasting several years the museum opened in September 2012 with a new composite extension that has been called "The Bathtub" due to its resemblance to one.

Amsterdam contains many other museums throughout the city. They range from small museums such as the [[Verzetsmuseum]] (''Resistance Museum''), the [[Anne Frank House|Anne Frank Huis]] (''Anne Frank House''), and the [[Rembrandt House Museum|Rembrandthuis]] (''Rembrandt House''), to the very large, like the [[Tropenmuseum]] (''Museum of the Tropics''), [[Amsterdam Museum]] (formerly known as "Amsterdams Historisch Museum", ''Amsterdam Historical Museum''), [[Hermitage Amsterdam]] (a dependency of the [[Hermitage Museum]] of Saint Petersburg) and the [[Joods Historisch Museum]] (''Jewish Historical Museum''). The modern-styled [[NEMO (museum)]] is dedicated to child-friendly science exhibitions.

===Music===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
{{main|List of songs about Amsterdam}}
Amsterdam's musical culture includes a large collection of songs which treat nostalgically and lovingly of the city. The 1949 song "Aan de Amsterdamse grachten" ("On the canals of Amsterdam") was performed and recorded by many artists, including [[John Kraaijkamp sr.]]; the best-known version is probably that by [[Wim Sonneveld]] (1962). In the 1950s [[Johnny Jordaan]] rose to fame with "Geef mij maar Amsterdam" ("I prefer Amsterdam"), which praises the city above all others (explicitly Paris); Jordaan sang especially about his own neighborhood, the [[Jordaan]] ("Bij ons in de Jordaan"). Colleagues and contemporaries of Johnny include [[Tante Leen]], [[Zwarte Riek]], and [[Manke Nelis]]. Other notable Amsterdam songs are "[[Amsterdam (Jacques Brel song)|Amsterdam]]" by [[Jacques Brel]] (1964) and "Deze Stad" by [[De Dijk]] (1989).<ref name="lijflied finale">{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2948441/2011/10/05/Amsterdams-lijflied-de-finale.dhtml|title=Amsterdams lijflied: de finale|date=5 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> A 2011 poll by Amsterdam paper ''[[Het Parool]]'' found, somewhat surprisingly, that [[Trio Bier]]'s "Oude Wolf" was voted "Amsterdams lijflied".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/7024/AMSTERDAMS-LIJFLIED/article/detail/2965125/2011/10/12/Amsterdams-Lijflied-Stadsbewoners-leven-als-oude-wolven.dhtml|title=Amsterdams Lijflied: Stadsbewoners leven als oude wolven - AMSTERDAMS LIJFLIED - PAROOL|date=12 October 2011|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> Notable Amsterdam bands from the modern era include the [[Osdorp Posse]] and [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].

The [[Heineken Music Hall]] is a concert hall located near the [[Amsterdam Arena|Amsterdam ArenA]]. Its main purpose is to serve as a podium for pop concerts for big audiences. Many famous international artists have performed there. Two other notable venues, [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and the [[Melkweg]] are located near the [[Leidseplein]]. Both focus on broad programming, ranging from [[indie rock]] to [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and other popular genres. Other more [[subculture|subculturally]] focused [[music venue]]s are [[OCCII]], [[OT301]], De Nieuwe Anita, Winston Kingdom and [[Zaal 100]]. [[Jazz]] has a strong following in Amsterdam, with the [[Bimhuis]] being the premier venue. In 2012 [[Ziggo Dome]] was opened, also near Amsterdam ArenA, a state of the art indoor music arena.

The [[Heineken Music Hall]] is also host to many [[electronic dance music]] festivals, alongside many other venues. [[Armin van Buuren]] and [[Tiesto]], some of the worlds leading [[Trance music|Trance]] DJ's hail from the Netherlands and perform frequently in Amsterdam. Each year in October, the city hosts the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) which is one of the leading electronic music conferences and one of the biggest club festivals for electronic music in the world. Another popular dance festival is 5daysoff, which takes place in the venues [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] and [[Melkweg]]. In summer time there are several big outdoor dance parties in or nearby Amsterdam, such as Awakenings, [[Dance Valley]], [[Mysteryland|Mystery Land]], Loveland, A Day at the Park, Welcome to the Future, and Valtifest.

[[File:Concertgebouw Amsterdam Night View.jpg|thumb|The [[Concertgebouw]] concert hall has some of the finest acoustics in the world.]]
Amsterdam has a world-class symphony orchestra, the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]. Their home is the [[Concertgebouw]], which is across the Van Baerlestraat from the Museum Square. It is considered by critics to be a [[List of concert halls|concert hall]] with some of the best [[acoustics]] in the world. The building contains three [[hall]]s, Grote Zaal, Kleine Zaal, and Spiegelzaal. Eight hundred concerts per year are performed there for approximately 850,000 patrons.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Long |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/04/dayintech_0411 |title=11 April 1888: Concertgebouw, Home of Nearly Perfect Acoustics, Opens |work=Wired  |accessdate=10 October 2010 |date=11 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101020132126/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/04/dayintech_0411| archivedate= 20 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The opera house of Amsterdam is situated adjacent to the city hall. Therefore, the two buildings combined are often called the [[Stopera]]. This word is derived from the Dutch words ''stadhuis'' (city hall) and opera. This huge modern complex, opened in 1986, lies in the former Jewish neighbourhood at ''Waterlooplein'' next to the river [[Amstel]]. The ''Stopera'' is the homebase of [[De Nederlandse Opera]], [[Dutch National Ballet|Het Nationale Ballet]] and the [[Holland Symfonia]]. [[Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ]] is a [[List of concert halls|concert hall]], which is situated in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] near the central station. Its concerts perform mostly [[20th-century classical music|modern classical music]]. Located adjacent to it, is the ''[[Bimhuis]]'', a concert hall for improvised and [[Jazz]] music.

===Performing Arts===
Amsterdam has three main theatre buildings.

The [[Stadsschouwburg (Amsterdam)|Stadsschouwburg Amsterdam]] at the [[Leidseplein]] is the home base of [[Toneelgroep Amsterdam]]. The current building dates from 1894. Most plays are performed in the Grote Zaal (Great Hall). The normal program of events encompasses all sorts of theatrical forms. The Stadsschouwburg is currently being renovated and expanded. The third theater space, to be operated jointly with next door [[Melkweg]], will open in late 2009 or early 2010.

[[Stopera|Het Muziektheater]], dating from 1986, is the principal [[opera]] house and home to [[De Nederlandse Opera]] and [[Dutch National Ballet|Het Nationale Ballet]].

[[Carré Theatre|Royal Theatre Carré]] was built as a permanent [[circus]] theatre in 1887 and is currently mainly used for [[Musical theatre|musical]]s, [[cabaret]] performances and [[pop concert]]s.

The recently re-opened DeLaMar Theater houses the more commercial plays and musicals.

The Netherlands has a tradition of cabaret or ''kleinkunst'', which combines music, storytelling, commentary, theatre and comedy. Cabaret dates back to the 1930s and artists like [[Wim Kan]], [[Wim Sonneveld]] and [[Toon Hermans]] were pioneers of this form of art in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam is the Kleinkunstacademie (English: Cabaret Academy). Contemporary popular artists are [[Youp van 't Hek]], [[Freek de Jonge]], [[Herman Finkers]], [[Hans Teeuwen]], [[Theo Maassen]], [[Herman van Veen]], [[Najib Amhali]], [[Raoul Heertje]], [[Jörgen Raymann]], [[Brigitte Kaandorp]] and [[Comedytrain]]. The English spoken comedy scene was established with the founding of [[Boom Chicago]] in 1993. They have their own theatre at Leidseplein.

===Nightlife===
Amsterdam is famous for its vibrant and diverse nightlife. Amsterdam has many ''[[bar (establishment)|cafés]]'' (bars). They range from large and modern to small and cozy. The typical ''Bruine Kroeg'' (brown ''café'') breathe a more old fashioned atmosphere with dimmed lights, candles, and somewhat older clientele. Most ''cafés'' have terraces in summertime. A common sight on the Leidseplein during summer is a square full of terraces packed with people drinking beer or wine. Many restaurants can be found in Amsterdam as well. Since Amsterdam is a multicultural city, a lot of different ethnic restaurants can be found. Restaurants range from being rather luxurious and expensive to being ordinary and affordable. Amsterdam also possesses many [[discothèque]]s. The two main nightlife areas for tourists are the [[Leidseplein]] and the [[Rembrandtplein]]. The [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], [[Melkweg]] and Sugar Factory are cultural centres, which turn into discothèques on some nights. Examples of discothèques near the Rembrandtplein are the Escape and Club Home. Also noteworthy are Panama, Hotel Arena (East), The Sand and The Powerzone. [[Bimhuis]] located near the Central Station, with its rich programming hosting the best in the field is considered one of the best jazz clubs in the world. The Reguliersdwarsstraat is the main street for the [[LGBT]] community and nightlife.

===Festivals===
[[File:Koninginnedag2007.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Koninginnedag]] 2009 in Amsterdam]]
In 2008, there were 140 festivals and events in Amsterdam.<ref name="festivals">{{cite news |url = http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/8239/amsterdam-kans-op-evenementenstad |title = Amsterdam kans op 'evenementenstad' |trans_title = Amsterdam has a chance to be an 'event city' |language = [[Dutch language|Dutch]] |work = [[AT5|AT5 Nieuws]] |location = Amsterdam |date = 17 May 2008 |accessdate =10 May 2012 |quote = ''Naast de prijs van nationale evenementenstad is Koninginnedag voorgedragen als het publieksevenement van het jaar.''

==Government==
The administration of the municipality of Amsterdam used to be divided into 15 boroughs or ''[[stadsdeel|stadsdelen]]''; the central one, Centrum, being circled by Westerpark, Bos en Lommer, De Baarsjes, [[Amsterdam Oud-West|Oud-West]], [[Amsterdam Oud-Zuid|Oud-Zuid]], [[Oost-Watergraafsmeer|Oost/Watergraafsmeer]], [[Zeeburg]] and [[Amsterdam-Noord]], with the six outer boroughs ([[Westpoort]], [[Geuzenveld-Slotermeer]], [[Osdorp]], [[Slotervaart (former borough)|Slotervaart]], [[Zuideramstel]], and [[Amsterdam Zuidoost|Zuidoost]]) creating a further encirclement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noord.amsterdam.nl/smartsite.dws?id=16213 |title=Stadsdeel Amsterdam-Noord: Who governs Amsterdam-Noord? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=18 November 2007 |accessdate=10 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071118012332/http://www.noord.amsterdam.nl/smartsite.dws?id=16213 |archivedate=18 November 2007}}</ref> On 1 May 2010, the number of boroughs was reduced to eight (Centrum, Noord, [[Amsterdam-Oost|Oost]], Zuid, West, Nieuw-West, Zuidoost, and Westpoort).

===Definitions===
[[File:Amsterdamse stadsdelen 2010.png|thumb|250px|The 8 boroughs of Amsterdam]]
<!-- Needs area info! -->
"Amsterdam" is mostly understood to refer to the municipality of Amsterdam. Colloquially, some areas within the municipality, such as the village of [[Durgerdam]], may not be considered part of Amsterdam. [[Statistics Netherlands]] uses three other definitions of Amsterdam: metropolitan agglomeration Amsterdam (''Grootstedelijke Agglomeratie Amsterdam'', not to be confused with ''Grootstedelijk Gebied Amsterdam'', a synonym of ''Groot Amsterdam''), Greater Amsterdam (''Groot Amsterdam'', a [[COROP]] region) and the urban region Amsterdam (''Stadsgewest Amsterdam'').<ref name="cbs2013"/> These definitions are not synonymous with the terms urban area and [[metropolitan area]], which are commonly used in [[List of countries where English is an official language|English speaking countries]] for the purpose of defining large conurbations. The Amsterdam Department for Research and Statistics uses a fourth conurbation, namely the [[City region]] Amsterdam. This region is similar to Greater Amsterdam but includes the municipalities [[Zaanstad]] and [[Wormerland]]. It excludes [[Graft-De Rijp]].

The smallest of these areas is the municipality, with a population of 802,938 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> The metropolitan agglomeration had a population of 1,096,042 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> It includes the municipalities of Zaanstad, Wormerland, Oostzaan, Diemen and Amstelveen only, as well as the municipality of Amsterdam.<ref name="cbs2013"/> Greater Amsterdam includes 15 municipalities,<ref name="cbs2013"/> and had a population of 1,293,208 in 2013.<ref name="cbs2013"/> Though much larger in area, the population of this area is only slightly larger, because the definition excludes the relatively populous municipality of [[Zaanstad]]. The largest area by population, the [[Amsterdam Metropolitan Area]] (Dutch: Metropoolregio Amsterdam), has a population of 2,33&nbsp;million.<ref name="dosamsterdam"/> It includes for instance Zaanstad, Wormerveer, Muiden, Abcoude, Haarlem, Almere and Lelystad but excludes Graft-De Rijp. Amsterdam is part of the conglomerate metropolitan area [[Randstad]], with a total population of 6,659,300 inhabitants.<ref name="randstad">{{cite web

As with all Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is governed by a [[List of mayors of Amsterdam|mayor]], [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|aldermen]], and the [[City council|municipal council]]. However, unlike most other Dutch municipalities, Amsterdam is subdivided into seven "[[stadsdeel|stadsdelen]]" (boroughs), a system that was implemented in the 1980s to improve local governance. The stadsdelen are responsible for many activities that had previously been run by the central city. The city had initially been divided into 15 stadsdelen. 14 of those had their own council, chosen by a popular election. The 15th, [[Westpoort]], covers the harbour of Amsterdam, had very few residents, and was governed by the central municipal council. Local decisions are made at borough level, and only affairs pertaining to the whole city, such as major infrastructure projects, are handled by the central city council.

===National government===
Amsterdam is the [[capital of the Netherlands]] in a technical legal sense. The present version of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands|Dutch constitution]] mentions "Amsterdam" and "capital" only in one place, chapter 2, article 32: The king's confirmation by oath and his coronation take place in "the capital Amsterdam" ("''de hoofdstad Amsterdam''").<ref name="capital-constitution"/> Previous versions of the constitution spoke of "the city of Amsterdam" ("''de stad Amsterdam''"), without mention of capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.wikisource.org/wiki/Nederlandse_grondwet |title=Previous versions of the constitution |language={{nl icon}} |publisher=Nl.wikisource.org |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> In any case, the seat of the [[Politics of the Netherlands|government]], [[States-General of the Netherlands|parliament]] and [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|supreme court]] of the Netherlands is (and always has been, with the exception of a brief period between 1808 and 1810) located at [[The Hague]]. Foreign embassies are also in The Hague. The capital of North Holland is [[Haarlem]].

[[File:Amsterdam Magere Brug.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Magere Brug]] or "Skinny Bridge" at night]]

===Symbols===
{{Main|Coat of arms of Amsterdam|Flag of Amsterdam}}
The coat of arms of Amsterdam is composed of several historical elements. First and centre are three [[Saltire|St Andrew's crosses]], aligned in a vertical band on the city's shield (although Amsterdam's [[patron saint]] was [[Saint Nicholas]]). These St Andrew's crosses can also be found on the cityshields of neighbours [[Amstelveen]] and [[Ouder-Amstel]]. This part of the coat of arms is the basis of the [[flag of Amsterdam]], flown by the city government, but also as [[civil ensign]] for ships registered in Amsterdam. Second is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]]. In 1489, out of gratitude for services and loans, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] awarded Amsterdam the right to adorn its coat of arms with the [[King of the Romans|king's]] crown. Then, in 1508, this was replaced with Maximilian's [[imperial crown]] when he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the early years of the 17th century, Maximilian's crown in Amsterdam's coat of arms was again replaced, this time with the crown of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]], a crown that became the Imperial [[Austrian Crown Jewels|Crown of Austria]]. The lions date from the late 16th century, when city and province became part of the [[Dutch Republic|Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. Last came the city's official motto: ''Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig'' ("Heroic, Determined, Merciful"), bestowed on the city in 1947 by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], in recognition of the city's bravery during the Second World War.

Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by [[Connexxion]] and [[Arriva]]. Currently, there are sixteen [[Trams in Amsterdam|tram lines]], and four [[Amsterdam Metro|metro]] lines, with a fifth line, the [[Amsterdam Metro|North/South line]], under construction, all operated by [[Gemeentelijk Vervoerbedrijf|GVB]]. Three free ferries carry pedestrians and cyclists across the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] to [[Amsterdam-Noord]], and two fare-charging ferries run east and west along the harbour. There are also water taxis, a water bus, a [[boat sharing]] operation, electric rental boats (Boaty) and canal cruises, that transport people along Amsterdam's waterways.

The [[A10 motorway (Netherlands)|A10 ringroad]] surrounding the city connects Amsterdam with the Dutch [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|national network of freeways]]. [[Interchange (road)|Interchanges]] on the A10 allow cars to enter the city by transferring to one of the 18 ''city roads'', numbered S101 through to S118. These city roads are regional roads without [[grade separation]], and sometimes without a [[central reservation]]. Most are accessible by cyclists. The S100 ''Centrumring'' is a smaller ringroad circumnavigating the city's centre.

===Cycling===
{{main|Cycling in Amsterdam}}
Amsterdam is one of the most [[bicycle-friendly]] large cities in the world and is a centre of [[bicycle culture]] with good facilities for cyclists such as bike paths and [[Bicycle stand|bike racks]], and several guarded bike storage garages (''fietsenstalling'') which can be used for a nominal fee. In 2013, there were about 1,200,000 bicycles in Amsterdam outnumbering the amount of citizens in the city.<ref>{{cite web

==Education==
[[File:Anietenkapel Gate.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Agnietenkapel Gate at the [[University of Amsterdam]], founded in 1632 as the Athenaeum Illustre]]
Amsterdam has two universities: the [[University of Amsterdam]] (Universiteit van Amsterdam), and the VU University Amsterdam ([[Vrije Universiteit]] or "VU"). Other institutions for higher education include an [[art school]] – [[Gerrit Rietveld Academie]], a [[Hogeschool|university of applied sciences]] - the [[Hogeschool van Amsterdam]], and the [[Amsterdamse Hogeschool voor de Kunsten]]. Amsterdam's [[International Institute of Social History]] is one of the world's largest documentary and research institutions concerning [[social history]], and especially the [[labor history (discipline)|history of the labour movement]]. Amsterdam's [[Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)|Hortus Botanicus]], founded in the early 17th century, is one of the oldest [[botanical garden]]s in the world,<ref name="Hortus">{{cite web|url=http://www.dehortus.nl/Index.asp|title=Hortus Botanicus official website|publisher=2009 de Hortus|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> with many old and rare specimens, among them the [[coffee|coffee plant]] that served as the parent for the entire coffee culture in Central and South America.<ref name="he">{{cite web

Some of Amsterdam's primary schools base their teachings on particular pedagogic theories like the various [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]] schools. The biggest Montessori High School in Amsterdam is the [[Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam]]. Many schools, however, are based on religion. This used to be primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants there has been a rise in the number of Islamic schools. Jewish schools can be found in the southern suburbs of Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is noted for having five independent grammar schools (Dutch: gymnasia), the [[Vossius Gymnasium]], [[Barlaeus Gymnasium]], St. [[Ignatius Gymnasium]], [[Het 4e Gymnasium]] and the [[Cygnus Gymnasium]] where a classical curriculum including Latin and [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] is taught. Though believed until recently by many to be an anachronistic and elitist concept that would soon die out, the gymnasia have recently experienced a revival, leading to the formation of a fourth and fifth grammar school in which the three aforementioned schools participate. Most secondary schools in Amsterdam offer a variety of different levels of education in the same school. The city also has various colleges ranging from art and design to politics and economics which are mostly also available for students coming from other countries.

{{main|List of people from Amsterdam}}

==Media==
Amsterdam is a prominent center for national and international media. Some locally-based newspapers include [[Het Parool]], a national daily paper; [[De Telegraaf]], the largest Dutch daily newspaper; the daily newspapers [[Trouw]], [[De Volkskrant]] and [[NRC Handelsblad]]; [[De Groene Amsterdammer]], a weekly newspaper; the free newspapers [[Sp!ts]], [[Metro (Dutch newspaper)|Metro]], and The Holland Times (printed in English).

==Housing==
The housing market is heavily regulated. In Amsterdam, 55% of existing housing and 30% of new housing is owned by Housing Associations, which are Government sponsored entities.

[[Squatting|Squat]] properties are common throughout Amsterdam, due to property law strongly favouring tenants. A number of these squats have become well known, such as [[OT301]], [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]], Vrankrijk (closed down by city government), and the Binnenpret, and several are now businesses, such as health clubs and licensed restaurants.
