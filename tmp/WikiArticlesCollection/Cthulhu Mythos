The '''Cthulhu [[Mythos]]''' is a [[shared universe|shared fictional universe]], based on the work of [[United States|American]] [[horror fiction|horror]] writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

The term was first coined by [[August Derleth]], a contemporary correspondent of Lovecraft, who used the name of the creature ''[[Cthulhu]]''—a central figure in Lovecraft literature<ref>"Cthulhu Elsewhere in Lovecraft," ''Crypt of Cthulhu #9''</ref> and the focus of Lovecraft's short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]" (first published in [[pulp magazine]] ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1928)—to identify the system of lore employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors. The writer [[Richard L. Tierney]] later applied the term "Derleth Mythos" to distinguish between Lovecraft's works and Derleth's later stories.<ref>Cf. Richard L. Tierney, "The Derleth Mythos",  ''Discovering H. P. Lovecraft'', p. 52.</ref>

Authors writing in the [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian milieu]] use elements of the Mythos in an ongoing expansion of the fictional universe.<ref>Harms, "A Brief History of the Cthulhu Mythos", ''The Encyclopedia Cthulhiana'', pp. viii–ix.</ref>

==History==
[[Robert M. Price]] described, in his essay "H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos," two stages in the development of the Cthulhu Mythos. The first stage, termed the "Cthulhu Mythos proper" by Price, was formulated during Lovecraft's lifetime and was subject to his guidance. The second stage was guided by August Derleth who, in addition to publishing Lovecraft's stories after his death,<ref>Bloch, "Heritage of Horror", p. 8.</ref> attempted to categorize and expand the Mythos.<ref>Price, "H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', p. 5.</ref>

===First stage===
An ongoing theme in Lovecraft's work is the complete irrelevance of mankind in the face of the cosmic horrors that apparently exist in the universe. Lovecraft made frequent reference to the "[[Great Old Ones]]": a loose pantheon of ancient, powerful [[deity|deities]] from space who once ruled the Earth and who have since fallen into a deathlike sleep.<ref>Harms, "A Brief History of the Cthulhu Mythos", p. viii.</ref> This was first established in "The Call of Cthulhu", in which the minds of the human characters deteriorated when afforded a glimpse of what exists outside their perceived reality. Lovecraft emphasised the point by stating in the opening sentence of the story that "The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents."<ref name="The Call of Cthulhu">HP Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu" (1928).</ref>

Writer [[Dirk W. Mosig]] notes that Lovecraft was a "[[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] [[materialism|materialist]]" who embraced the philosophy of ''cosmic indifferentism''. Lovecraft believed in a purposeless, mechanical, and uncaring universe that human beings, with their limited faculties, could never fully understand, and the [[cognitive dissonance]] caused by this leads to insanity. Lovecraft's viewpoint made no allowance for religious belief which could not be supported scientifically, with the incomprehensible, cosmic forces of his tales having as little regard for humanity as humans have for insects.<ref>Mosig, Yozan Dirk W. "Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in Imaginative Literature" (1979).</ref><ref>Mariconda, "Lovecraft's Concept of 'Background'", pp. 22–3, ''On the Emergence of "Cthulhu" & Other Observations''.</ref>

There have been attempts at categorizing this fictional group of beings, and Phillip A. Schreffler argues that by carefully scrutinizing Lovecraft's writings a workable framework emerges that outlines the entire "pantheon" – from the unreachable "Outer Ones" (e.g. [[Azathoth]], who apparently occupies the centre of the universe) and "Great Old Ones" (e.g. Cthulhu, imprisoned on Earth in the sunken city of [[R'lyeh]]) to the lesser castes (the lowly slave [[shoggoth]]s and the [[Mi-go]]).<ref>Shreffler, Phillip A. (1977). ''The H. P. Lovecraft Companion'', pp. 156–157.</ref>

David E. Schultz, however, believes Lovecraft never meant to create a canonical Mythos but rather intended his imaginary pantheon to merely serve as a background element.<ref>Schultz, "Who Needs the Cthulhu Mythos?", ''A Century Less A Dream'', pp. 46, 54.</ref> Lovecraft himself humorously referred to his mythos as "Yog Sothothery" (Mosig coincidentally suggested the term ''Yog-Sothoth Cycle of Myth'' be substituted for ''Cthulhu Mythos''<ref>(Mosig, Yozan Dirk W. (1997). ''Mosig at Last: A Psychologist Looks at H. P. Lovecraft'', p. 28)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timpratt.org/611.html |title=Yog-Sothothery |publisher=Timpratt.org |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref>) and at times had to remind readers his mythos creations were entirely fictional.<ref>Price, "Lovecraft's 'Artificial Mythology'", pp. 251, 253; Mariconda, "Toward a Reader-Response Approach to the Lovecraft Mythos", ''On the Emergence of "Cthulhu" & Other Observations'', pp. 33–4.</ref>

The view that there was no rigid structure is reinforced by [[S. T. Joshi]], who stated "Lovecraft's imaginary [[wikt:cosmogony|cosmogony]] was never a static system but rather a sort of [[wikt:aesthetic|aesthetic]] construct that remained ever adaptable to its creator's developing personality and altering interests... [T]here was never a rigid system that might be posthumously appropriated... [T]he essence of the mythos lies not in a pantheon of imaginary deities nor in a cobwebby collection of forgotten tomes, but rather in a certain convincing cosmic attitude."<ref>Lovecraft, H.P. "In Defense of Dagon" reprinted in ''Miscellaneous Writings'' (S. T. Joshi, ed.) Sauk City: Arkham, 1995; pp. 165–66</ref>

Price, however, believed that Lovecraft's writings could at least be divided into categories and identified three distinct themes: the "Dunsanian" (written in the vein of [[Lord Dunsany]]), "Arkham" (occurring in Lovecraft's fictionalized [[New England]] setting), and "Cthulhu" (the cosmic tales) cycles.<ref>Price, "H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', p. 9.</ref> Writer Will Murray noted that while Lovecraft often used his fictional pantheon in the stories he ghostwrote for other authors, he reserved Arkham and its environs exclusively for those tales he wrote under his own name.<ref>(Murray, "In Search of Arkham Country I", pp. 105, 107.)</ref>

Although not formalised and acknowledged as a mythos per se, Lovecraft did correspond with contemporary writers ([[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], [[Henry Kuttner]], and [[Fritz Leiber]] – a group referred to as the "Lovecraft Circle") – and shared story elements:<ref>{{cite book|last=Joshi|first=ST|title=HP Lovecraft, four decades of criticism|year=1980|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-0577-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=D'Ammassa|first=Don|title=Discovering Classic Fantasy Fiction: Essays on the Antecedents of Fantastic Literature|year=1996|publisher=Wildside Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-58715-004-3|page=122|editor=Darrell Schweitzer|chapter=Henry Kuttner: Man of Many Voices}}</ref> Robert E. Howard's character [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Von Junzt, Friedrich Wilheim|Friedrich Von Junzt]] reads Lovecraft's ''[[Necronomicon]]'' in the short story "The Children of the Night" ([[1931 in literature|1931]]), and in turn Lovecraft mentions Howard's ''[[Unaussprechlichen Kulten]]'' in the stories "Out of the Aeons" ([[1935 in literature|1935]]) and "The Shadow Out of Time" ([[1936 in literature|1936]]).<ref>Price, "H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', pp. 6–7.</ref> Many of Howard's original unedited [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]] stories also form part of the Cthulhu Mythos.<ref>Patrice Louinet. ''Hyborian Genesis: Part 1'', page 436, ''The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian''; 2003, Del Rey.</ref>

=== Second stage ===

Price's dichotomy dictates the second stage commenced with August Derleth, the principal difference between Lovecraft and Derleth being the latter's use of hope and that the Cthulhu mythos essentially represented a struggle between good and evil.<ref>Bloch, "Heritage of Horror", p. 9.</ref> Derleth is credited with creating the ''Elder Gods'', and stated:

<blockquote>
As Lovecraft conceived the deities or forces of his mythos, there were, initially, the Elder Gods... [T]hese Elder Gods were benign deities, representing the forces of good, and existed peacefully...very rarely stirring forth to intervene in the unceasing struggle between the powers of evil and the [[race (fantasy)|races]] of Earth. These powers of evil were variously known as the Great Old Ones or the Ancient Ones...
<br />—August Derleth, "The Cthulhu Mythos"<ref>Derleth, "The Cthulhu Mythos", ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos'', p. vii.</ref>
</blockquote>

Price suggests that the basis of Derleth's systemization are found in Lovecraft, stating: "Was Derleth's use of the rubric 'Elder Gods' so alien to Lovecraft's in ''At the Mountains of Madness''? Perhaps not. In fact, this very story, along with some hints from "The Shadow over Innsmouth", provides the key to the origin of the 'Derleth Mythos'. For in ''At the Mountains of Madness'' we find the history of a conflict between two interstellar races (among others): the Elder Ones and the Cthulhu-spawn." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypt-of-cthulhu.com/lovecraftderleth.htm |title=Lovecraft-Derleth Connection |publisher=Crypt-of-cthulhu.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref> Derleth himself believed that Lovecraft wished for other authors to actively write about the myth-cycle as opposed to it being a discrete plot device.<ref>Schultz, "Who Needs the Cthulhu Mythos?", pp. 46–7.</ref> Derleth expanded the boundaries of the Mythos by including any passing reference to another author's story elements by Lovecraft as part of the genre: just as Lovecraft made passing reference to Clark Ashton Smith's ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Book of Eibon|Book of Eibon]]'', Derleth in turn added Smith's [[Outer God#Ubbo-Sathla|Ubbo-Sathla]] to the Mythos.<ref>Price, "H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #35'', pp. 6–10.</ref>

Derleth also attempted to connect the deities of the Mythos to the four elements (''air'', ''earth'', ''fire'', and ''water''), but was forced to adopt artistic license and create beings to represent certain elements (''air'' and ''fire'') to legitimise his system of classification.<ref>Derleth created "Cthugha" when fan Francis Towner Laney claim Derleth had neglected to include a fire elemental in his schema. Laney, the editor of ''[[The Acolyte]]'', had categorized the Mythos in an essay that first appeared in the Winter 1942 issue of the magazine. Impressed by the glossary, Derleth asked Laney to rewrite it for publication in the Arkham House collection ''Beyond the Wall of Sleep'' ([[1943 in literature|1943]]). (Robert M. Price, "Editorial Shards", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'', p. 2.) Laney's essay ("The Cthulhu Mythos") was later republished in ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'' (1985).</ref> In applying the elemental theory to beings that function on a cosmic scale (e.g. [[Yog-Sothoth]]) some authors created a separate category termed ''aethyr''. Derleth matched ''earth'' against ''fire'' and ''air'' against ''water'', which is inconsistent with the [[classical elements]] pairings.<ref>Harms, "Elemental Theory", p. 101.</ref>

=="Lovecraft" mythos==
A lesser known term employed by the scholar S. T. Joshi to describe the works of Lovecraft.<ref>"The Lovecraft Mythos", ''H. P. Lovecraft'', p. 31ff. Joshi acknowledges, however, that Donald R. Burleson independently coined the term in his eponymous article that appears in ''Magill's Survey of Science Fiction Literature'', volume III (see ''References'' section for a detailed citation), p. 1284ff. (''H. P. Lovecraft'', p. 68, footnote no. 52.)
</ref> Joshi identified four key elements in Lovecraft's mythos (that Price would later condense to three themes), being the fundamental principle of [[cosmicism]] (which once again highlighted the irrelevance of mankind), the imaginary New England setting, a pantheon of recurring "pseudomythological" entities and a collection of arcane books that supposedly yield insights into the mythology.
