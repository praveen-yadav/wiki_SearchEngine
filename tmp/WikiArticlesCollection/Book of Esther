{{Tanakh OT}}
The '''Book of Esther''' is a book in the [[Ketuvim]] ("writings"), the third section of the Jewish [[Tanakh]] (the [[Hebrew Bible]]) and is part of the Christian [[Old Testament]]. It tells the story of a [[Jewish]] girl named [[Hadassah]] and [[Esther]]. Esther became queen of [[Persia]] and thwarted a plan to commit genocide against her people. Also called the '''Megillah''', the book is the basis and an integral part of the Jewish celebration of [[Purim]]. Its full text is read aloud twice during the celebration, in the evening and again the following morning. Scrolls of Esther traditionally have only one roller on the left side, as opposed to most other Biblical [[scroll]]s such as the [[Sefer Torah]], which have two rollers, one on each side.<ref name="RosselTorah212">{{cite book |last=Rossel |first=Seymour |authorlink=Seymour Rossel |title=The Torah: Portion by Portion |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AzZlANCOIRgC&pg=PA212 |accessdate=13 October 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Torah Aura Productions |location=Los Angeles, CA, USA |isbn=978-1-891662-94-2 |page=212}}</ref>

==Setting==
The biblical Book of Esther is set in the third year of [[Ahasuerus]], a king of Persia. The name Ahasuerus is equivalent to Xerxes, both deriving from the Persian Khshayārsha, thus Ahasuerus is usually identified as [[Xerxes I]] (486–465&nbsp;BCE), though Ahasuerus is identified as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes]] in the later Greek version of Esther (as well as by [[Josephus]], the Jewish commentary  [[Esther Rabbah]], the Ethiopic translation and the Christian theologian [[Bar-Hebraeus]] who identified him more precisely as [[Artaxerxes II]] <ref>''E A W Budge, ''The Chronography of Bar Hebraeus'', Gorgias Press LLC, reprinted 2003</ref>).

==Plot summary==
[[File:Megillat Esther (1).jpg|thumb|250px|The opening chapter of a hand-written scroll of the Book of Esther, with reader's pointer]]

Ahasuerus, ruler of a massive Persian empire, holds a lavish party, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards for all inhabitants of the capital city [[Susa|Shushan]]. Ahasuerus orders the queen [[Vashti]] to display her beauty before the guests. She refuses. Worried all women will learn from this, Ahasuerus removes her as queen and has a royal decree sent across the empire that men should be the ruler of their households and should speak their own native tongue. Ahasuerus then orders all beautiful young girls to be presented to him, so he can choose a new queen to replace Vashti. One of these is the orphan [[Esther]], whose Jewish name is Hadassah. After the death of her parents, she is being fostered by her cousin [[Mordecai]]. She finds favor in the king's eyes, and is made his new queen. Esther does not reveal that she is Jewish. Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by courtiers [[Bigthan and Teresh]] to assassinate Ahasuerus. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the king is recorded.

Ahasuerus appoints [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] as his prime minister. Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavor as he refuses to bow down to him. Having found out that Mordecai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordecai but all the Jews in the empire. He obtains Ahasuerus' permission to execute this plan, against payment of ten thousand [[talent (measurement)|talent]]s of silver (which the King declines to accept and rather allows him to execute his plan on principle), and he casts lots to choose the date on which to do this—the thirteenth of the month of [[Adar]]. On that day, everyone in the empire is free to massacre the Jews and despoil their property.  When Mordecai finds out about the plans he and all Jews mourn and fast. Mordecai informs Esther what has happened and tells her to intercede with the King. She is afraid to break the law and go to the King unsummoned. This action would incur the death penalty. Mordecai tells her that she must. She orders Mordecai to have all Jews fast for three days together with her, and on the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who stretches out his sceptre to her which shows that she is not to be punished. She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai and consults with his friends.  At his wife's suggestion, he builds a [[gallows]] for Mordecai. 

That night, Ahasuerus suffers from insomnia, and when the court records are read to him to help him sleep, he learns of the services rendered by Mordecai in the previous plot against his life. Ahasuerus is told that Mordecai has not received any recognition for saving the king's life. Just then, Haman appears, to ask the King to hang Mordecai, but before he can make this request, King Ahasuerus asks Haman what should be done for the man that the king wishes to honor. Thinking that the man that the king is referring to is himself, Haman says that the man should be dressed in the king's royal robes and led around on the king's royal horse, while a [[herald]] calls:  "See how the king honours a man he wishes to reward!" To his horror and surprise, the king instructs Haman to do so to Mordecai. After leading Mordecai's parade, he returns in mourning to his wife and friends, who suggest his downfall has begun.

Immediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet, at which she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her. Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation. The king comes back in at this moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier than before and he orders Haman hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. The previous decree against the Jews cannot be annulled, but the king allows the Jews to defend themselves during attacks. As a result, on 13 Adar, five hundred attackers and Haman's ten sons are killed in Shushan, followed by a Jewish slaughter of seventy-five thousand Persians, although they took no plunder. Esther sends a letter instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people's redemption, in a holiday called Purim (lots). Ahasuerus remains very powerful and continues reigning, with Mordecai assuming a prominent position in his court.<ref>Esther chapters 9–10</ref>

==Authorship and date==
[[Image:Göttingen-Esther.Rolle.0.JPG|thumb|right|Scroll of Esther (Megillah)]]''Esther'' is usually dated to the 3rd or 4th century BCE. However scholars [[Shemaryahu Talmon]] and [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]] are of the opinion that "the traditional setting of the book in the days of Xerxes (485–465 BC[E]) cannot be wide of the mark."<ref>Gil Student.

The Greek additions to the Septuagint version Esther (which do not appear in original Jewish/Hebrew version; see  "Additions to Esther" below) are dated to around the late 2nd century or early 1st BCE.<ref>Freedman, David Noel; Allen C.

* The primary source relating to the origin of Purim is the ''Megillat Esther'' (Book of Esther), which became the last of the 24 books of the [[Tanakh]] to be canonized by the Sages of the [[Great Assembly]]. It is dated to the 4th century BCE<ref>NIV Study Bible, ''Introductions to the Books of the Bible, Esther'', Zondervan, 2002</ref> and according to the Talmud was a redaction by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordecai.<ref>''Babylonian Talmud: Tractate Baba Bathra'' 15a</ref>

* The Greek Book of Esther, included in the Septuagint, is a retelling of the events of the Hebrew Book of Esther rather than a translation and records additional traditions, in particular the identification of Ahasuerus with [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes]] and details of various letters. It is dated to the 2nd to 1st century BCE.<ref>George Lyons, ''Additions to Esther'', Wesley Center for Applied Theology, 2000</ref> The Coptic and Ethiopic versions of Esther are translations of it instead of the Hebrew Esther.

* A Latin version of Esther was produced by [[Jerome]] for the [[Vulgate]]. It translates the Hebrew Esther but interpolates translations of the Greek Esther where the latter provides additional material.

==Historicity==

The book of Esther falls under the category of [[Ketuvim]], one of three parts of the Jewish canon.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009">Coogan, Michael David Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 396.</ref> According to some sources, it is a [[Historical novel|historical novella]], written to [[Myth of origins|explain the origin]] of the Jewish holiday of Purim.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Sidnie White Crawford 2003">Sidnie White Crawford, “Esther,” in The New Interpreters Study Bible New Revised Standard Version with the Apocrypha, ed. Walter J. Harrison and Donald Senior (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2003), 689–690.</ref>

As noted by biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan, the book contains specific details regarding certain subject matter (for example, Persian rule) which are historically inaccurate. For example, Coogan discusses an apparent inaccuracy regarding the age of Esther's cousin (or, according to others, uncle) [[Mordecai]].<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Sidnie White Crawford 2003"/> In Esther 2:5–6, either Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar in 597&nbsp;BCE: "Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah." If this refers to Mordecai, he would have had to live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the Book of Esther.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/> However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish's exile.<ref>New King James Version, translation of [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=esther%202:6&version=NKJV Esther 2:6]</ref><ref name="ISBE">Bromiley, Geoffrey W.

In her article “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” biblical scholar [[Adele Berlin]] discusses the reasoning behind scholarly concern of the historicity of Esther. Much of this debate relates to the importance of distinguishing history and fiction within biblical texts, as Berlin argues, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the history of the Israelite people.<ref name="Adele Berlin 2001">[[Adele Berlin]], “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature]]'' 120. no. 1 (Spring 2001): 3–14.</ref> Berlin quotes a series of scholars who suggest that the author of Esther did not mean for the book to be considered as a historical writing, but intentionally wrote it to be a historical novella.<ref>Adele Berlin, “The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling,” Journal of Biblical Literature 120. no. 1 (Spring 2001): 6.</ref> The genre of novellas under which Esther falls was common during both the Persian and Hellenistic periods to which scholars have dated the book of Esther.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/><ref name="Adele Berlin 2001"/>

There are certain elements of the book of Esther that are historically accurate. The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus, who has been identified as the 5th-century Persian king Xerxes (486–465). The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces.<ref name="ISBE"/> However, according to Coogan, considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text, supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact.<ref name="Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009"/> [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]] has questioned the reliability of other historical sources, such as Herodotus, to which Esther has been compared. Yamauchi wrote, “[Herodotus] was, however, the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible.” <ref name="Yamauchi, Edwin M., 1980"> "The archaeological background of Esther : archaeological backgrounds of the exilic and postexilic era, pt 2." Bibliotheca sacra 137, no. 546 (1980), 102.</ref> The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period, and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther's account.

==Historical reading==
{{refimprove|date=March 2013}}
[[File:012 lrg.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''The Feast of Esther'' (Feest van Esther) by [[Jan Lievens]], 1625, [[North Carolina Museum of Art]].]]
Those arguing in favour of an historical reading of Esther, most commonly identify Ahasuerus with [[Artaxerxes II]] (ruled 405–[[359 BC|359&nbsp;BCE]]) although in the past it was often assumed that he was [[Xerxes I]] (ruled 486–[[465 BC|465&nbsp;BCE]]). The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahasuerus'' is most likely derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Khshayarsha'', the origin of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Xerxes''. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that Xerxes sought his [[Harem (household)|harem]] after being defeated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He makes no reference to individual members of the harem except for a domineering [[Queen consort]] named [[Amestris]], whose father, Otanes, was one of Xerxes's generals. (In contrast, the Greek historian [[Ctesias]] refers to a similar father-in-law/general figure named Onaphas.) Amestris has often been identified with [[Vashti]], but this identification is problematic, as Amestris remained a powerful figure well into the reign of her son, [[Artaxerxes I]], whereas Vashti is portrayed as dismissed in the early part of Xerxes's reign. Alternative attempts have been made to identify her with [[Esther]], although Esther is an orphan whose father was a Jew named Abihail. 

As for the identity of Mordecai, the similar names ''Marduka'' and ''Marduku'' have been found as the name of officials in the Persian court in over thirty texts from the period of Xerxes I and his father Darius, and may refer to up to four individuals, one of which might after all be Mordecai.

The Septuagint version of Esther translates the name Ahasuerus as ''Artaxerxes'', a Greek name derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Artakhshatra''. [[Josephus]] too relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks, and the [[Midrash]]ic text, ''Esther Rabba'' also makes the identification. [[Bar-Hebraeus]] identified Ahasuerus explicitly as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]; however, the names are not necessarily equivalent: Hebrew has a form of the name ''Artaxerxes'' distinct from ''Ahasuerus'', and a direct Greek rendering of ''Ahasuerus'' is used by both Josephus and the Septuagint for occurrences of the name outside the Book of Esther. Instead, the Hebrew name Ahasuerus accords with an inscription of the time that notes that Artaxerxes II was named also ''Arshu'', understood as a shortening of ''Achshiyarshu'' the Babylonian rendering of the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes), through which the Hebrew ''Achashverosh'' (Ahasuerus) is derived.<ref name="Hosch">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref> [[Ctesias]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' which is understood as a similar shortening with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' that is applied to shortened names. [[Deinon]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Oarses'' which is also understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha''.<ref name="Hosch"/>

Another view attempts to identify him instead with [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] (ruled 465–[[424 BC|424&nbsp;BCE]]), whose Babylonian concubine, [[Kosmartydene]], was the mother of his son [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] (ruled 424–[[405 BC|405&nbsp;BCE]]). Jewish tradition relates that Esther was the mother of a King Darius and so some try to identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I and Esther with Kosmartydene.

Based on the view that the Ahasuerus of the ''[[Book of Tobit]]'' is identical with that of the ''Book of Esther'', some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally [[Cyaxares]] (ruled 625–[[585 BC|585&nbsp;BCE]]). In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called ''Achiachar'', which, like the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Cyaxares'', is thought to be derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Akhuwakhshatra''. Depending on the interpretation of ''Esther'' 2:5–6, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from [[Jerusalem]] with [[Jeconiah]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]], in [[597 BC|597&nbsp;BCE]]. The view that it was Mordecai would be consistent with the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares. Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested.

Jacob Hoschander has argued that evidence of the historicity of Haman and his father Hamedatha is seen in ''Omanus'' and ''Anadatus'' mentioned by [[Strabo]] as being honoured with Anahita in the city of [[Zile|Zela]]. Hoschander argues that these were not deities as Strabo supposed but garbled forms of "Haman" and "Hamedatha" who were being worshipped as martyrs. The names are indeed unattested in Persian texts as gods, however the Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 61b) and [[Rashi]] both record a practice of deifying Haman and Josephus speaks of him being worshipped.<ref name="Hosch"/> Attempts have been made to connect both "Omanus" and "Haman" with the Zoroastrian term [[Vohu Mana]]; however this denotes the principle of "Good Thoughts" and is not the name of a deity.)

Whenever the book was written and whatever the historicity of the events recounted in it, clearly by the time it was written the term "Yehudim" (יהודים – Jews) already gained a meaning quite close to what it means up to the present—i.e. an ethnic-religious group, scattered in many countries, organised in autonomous communities and a target of hatred.

==Allegorical reading==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
There are many classical Jewish readings of allegories into the book of Esther, mostly from Hasidic sources.  They say that the literal meaning is true but that hidden behind this historical account are many allegories.

Though God is never explicitly mentioned in the Book of Esther, some Christians believe that his influence during the story is implied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverymagazine.com/digger/d01dd/d0112dd.html |publisher=Discoverymagazine.com |title=The Book of Esther Doesn't Mention God, Why is It in the Bible?}}</ref>

Some Christian readers consider this story to contain an allegory, representing the interaction between the church as 'bride' and [[God]].  This reading is related to the allegorical reading of the [[Song of Solomon]] and to the theme of the Bride of God, which in Jewish tradition manifests as the [[Shekinah]].

==Relation to the rest of the Bible==
Esther is the only book of the [[Tanakh]] that is not represented among the [[Dead Sea scrolls]].  It has often been compared to the first half of the [[Book of Daniel]] and to the [[Biblical apocrypha|deuterocanonical]] Books of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] and [[Book of Judith|Judith]] for its subject matter.{{Citation needed| date=March 2012}}

The story is also the first time that the word Jew (יְהוּדִי) was used, thus denoting a  distinction between the Hebrews, the Israelites, and their Jewish descendants in the diaspora.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Additions to Esther==
<!-- [[Additions to the Book of Esther]] redirects here -->
{{Wikisource|Bible (King James)/Rest_of_Esther|The King James Version of Rest of Esther}}
An additional six chapters appear interspersed in Esther in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the bible. This was noted by [[Jerome]] in compiling the Latin [[Vulgate]]. Additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text. Jerome recognized them as additions not present in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Text]] and placed them at the end of his Latin translation as chapters 10:4–16:24. However, some modern Catholic English Bibles restore the Septuagint order, such as Esther in the [[New American Bible|NAB]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourelement.org/blog/61-faq/141-esther-missing-sections-explanation |title=Esther: "Missing" Sections? Explanation. |date=July 7, 2010 |publisher=Element Christian Church}}</ref>

These additions include:<ref>see [http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/index.shtml#esther the NAB online] for the passages{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>
* an opening prologue that describes a dream had by Mordecai
* the contents of the decree against the Jews
* prayers for God's intervention offered by Mordecai and by Esther
* an expansion of the scene in which Esther appears before the king, with a mention of God's intervention
* a copy of the decree in favor of the Jews
* a passage in which Mordecai interprets his dream (from the prologue) in terms of the events that followed

By the time Esther was written, the foreign power visible on the horizon as a future threat to Judah was the [[Macedon]]ians of [[Alexander the Great]], who defeated the Persian empire about 150 years after the time of the story of Esther; the [[Septuagint]] version noticeably calls Haman a "bully" (βουγαῖον) where the Hebrew text describes him as an [[Agagite]].

The canonicity of these Greek additions has been a subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the [[Septuagint]]— [[Martin Luther]], being perhaps the most vocal [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Luther's complaints against the book carried past the point of scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.

The [[Council of Trent]], the summation of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]], accepted the entire book, both Hebrew text and Greek additions, as canonical. While modern Roman Catholic scholars openly recognize the Greek additions as clearly being additions to the text,{{Citation needed| date=March 2012}} the Book of Esther is used twice in commonly used sections of the Catholic [[Lectionary]]. In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of [[Mordecai]], and nothing of [[Esther]]'s own words is ever used. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] uses the Septuagint version of ''Esther'', as it does for all of the Old Testament. The additions are specifically listed in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], Article VI, of the [[Church of England]]:<ref>[http://www.episcopalian.org/pbs1928/articles/AnglicanTeaching/041.htm Article VI: Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> "The rest of the Book of Esther".

Esther Rabbah includes all of Additions to Esther save the "letter texts". It is these "letter texts" that contain the ahistorical assertions that Haman was a Greek.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Reinterpretations of the story==
The 1960 Hollywood film version of the story, ''[[Esther and the King]]'', was directed by [[Raoul Walsh]] and starred [[Joan Collins]] and [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]].

In 1992 a 30-minute, fully animated video, twelfth in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible|The Greatest Adventure]]'' series, titled ''Queen Esther'' features the voices of [[Helen Slater]] as Queen Esther, [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] as King Ahasuerus, [[Werner Klemperer]] as Haman, and [[Ron Rifkin]] as Mordecai.<ref>[http://www.booksofthebible.com/p1958.html Hanna-Barbera's Greatest Adventure Series Videos – Queen Esther]</ref><ref>[http://www.earthling.com/cgi-bin/google.fcgi/itemKey=1923000071 The Greatest Adventure Stories From The Bible]</ref>

The 1999 TV movie ''Esther'' starred Louise Lombard as Esther and F. Murray Abraham as Mordecai.

The 2006 film ''[[One Night with the King]]'' is a reenactment of the biblical story of Esther.

There are several paintings depicting Esther, including one by [[John Everett Millais|Millais]].

''[[VeggieTales]]'' also made an animated version entitled ''[[Esther… The Girl Who Became Queen]]''.

In 2012, a graphic adaptation of the Book of Esther was illustrated by J. T. Waldman and appeared in volume one of ''[[The Graphic Canon]]'', edited by [[Russ Kick]] and published by [[Seven Stories Press]].

A musical stage adaptation of the Book of Esther, written by [[Bruce Greer]] and Keith Ferguson, is currently in development with Dallas Summer Musicals.<ref name="Playscripts">{{Cite web |title=Playscripts Bio – Bruce Greer|url=http://www.playscripts.com/author.php3?authorid=1270|accessdate=17 August 2012 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.
