== Origin and use of the term ==
<!-- This section is linked from [[Oceanography]] --->

The term "biosphere" was coined by a geologist named [[Eduard Suess]] in 1875, which he defined as:<ref>Seuss, E. (1875) ''Die Entstehung Der Alpen'' [''The Origin of the Alps'']. Vienna: W. Braunmuller.</ref>
{{quote|"The place on Earth's surface where life dwells."}}

While this concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the impact of both [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Matthew F. Maury]] on the [[Earth sciences]]. The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (''see'' [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]]), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term "[[ecosystem]]" by Sir [[Arthur Tansley]] (see [[Ecology (history)|ecology history]]). Vernadsky defined [[ecology]] as the science of the biosphere. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] concept for integrating [[astronomy]], [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[biogeography]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]] and, generally speaking, all life and Earth sciences.

=== Narrow definition ===
[[Image:90 mile beach.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A familiar [[beach|scene]] on Earth which simultaneously shows the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.]]

Some life scientists and Earth scientists use ''biosphere'' in a more limited sense. For example, geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms (the "[[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]" or "[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]" as referred to by biologists and ecologists). In this sense, the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model, the other three being ''[[lithosphere]]'', ''[[hydrosphere]]'', and ''[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]''. The narrow meaning used by geochemists is one of the consequences of specialization in modern science. Some might prefer the word ''ecosphere'', coined in the 1960s, as all encompassing of both biological and physical components of the planet.

The Second International Conference on Closed Life Systems defined ''biospherics'' as the science and technology of analogs and [[model (abstract)|models]] of [[Earth]]'s biosphere; i.e., artificial Earth-like biospheres. Others may include the creation of artificial non-Earth biospheres&mdash;for example, human-centered biospheres or a native [[Mars|Martian]] biosphere&mdash;in the field of biospherics.

=== Gaia hypothesis ===
In the early 1970s, the British chemist [[James Lovelock]] and [[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist from the United States, added to the hypothesis, specifically noting the ties between the biosphere and other Earth systems. For example, when [[carbon dioxide]] levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Many scientists are now involved in new fields of study that examine interactions between biotic and abiotic factors in the biosphere, such as [[geobiology]] and [[geomicrobiology]].

Ecosystems occur when communities and their physical environment work together as a system. The difference between this and a biosphere is simple, the biosphere is everything in general terms.

== Extent of Earth's biosphere ==
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Water]] covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Image is the Earth photographed from [[Apollo&nbsp;17]].]]

Every part of the planet, from the [[polar region|polar]] ice caps to the [[Equator]], supports life of some kind. Recent advances in [[microbiology]] have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the Earth's terrestrial surface, and that the total mass of [[microbial]] life in so-called "uninhabitable zones" may, in [[biomass]], exceed all animal and plant life on the surface. The actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure. Birds typically fly at altitudes of 650 to 1,800 metres, and fish that live deep underwater can be found down to -8,372 metres in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].<ref name="Campbell 2006" />

There are more extreme examples for life on the planet: [[Rüppell's vulture]] has been found at [[altitude]]s of 11,300 metres; [[bar-headed Goose|bar-headed geese]] migrate at altitudes of at least 8,300 metres; [[yak]]s live at elevations between 3,200 to 5,400 metres above sea level; [[mountain goat]]s live up to 3,050 metres. Herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens, grasses, and herbs.

Microscopic organisms live at such extremes that, taking them into consideration, makes the thickness of the biosphere much greater. Culturable microbes have been found in the Earth's upper atmosphere as high as {{convert|41|km|0|abbr=on}} (Wainwright et al., 2003, in FEMS Microbiology Letters). It is unlikely, however, that microbes are active at such altitudes, where temperatures and air pressure are extremely low and [[ultraviolet radiation]] very high. More likely, these microbes were brought into the upper atmosphere by winds or possibly [[volcanic eruption]]s. [[Piezophile|Barophilic]] marine microbes have been found at more than {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} depth in the [[Mariana Trench]] (Takamia et al., 1997, in FEMS Microbiology Letters). In fact, single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, Challenger Deep, at depths of 36,201 feet (11,034 meters) [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html]. Microbes are not limited to the air, water or the Earth's surface. Culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} into the [[Earth's crust]] in Sweden (Gold, 1992, and Szewzyk, 1994, both in PNAS), from rocks between 65-75 °C. 

Temperature [[geothermal gradient|increases with increasing depth]] into the [[Earth's crust]]. The speed at which the temperature increases depends on many factors, including type of crust (continental vs. oceanic), rock type, geographic location, etc. The upper known limit of temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122 °C (''[[Methanopyrus kandleri]]'' Strain 116), and it is likely that the limit of life in the "deep biosphere" is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth.

Our biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]. On land, biomes are separated primarily by [[latitude]]. Terrestrial biomes lying within the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle]]s are relatively barren of [[plant]] and [[animal]] life, while most of the more populous biomes lie near the [[equator]]. Terrestrial organisms in temperate and Arctic biomes have relatively small amounts of total biomass, smaller energy budgets, and display prominent adaptations to cold, including world-spanning migrations, social adaptations, [[homeothermy]], [[estivation]] and multiple layers of insulation.

== Specific biospheres ==
When the word is followed by a number, it is usually referring to a specific system or number. Thus:

* Biosphere 1, the planet [[Earth]].
* [[Biosphere 2]], laboratory in [[Arizona]], [[United States]], which contains 3.15 acres (13,000 m²) of closed ecosystem.
* [[BIOS-3]], a closed ecosystem at the Institute of Biophysics in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], in what was then the [[Soviet Union]].
* Biosphere J (CEEF, Closed Ecology Experiment Facilities), an experiment in [[Japan]].<ref>Nakano ''et al.''(1998)"[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002396764/ Dynamic Simulation of Pressure Control System for the Closed Ecology Experiment Facility]", ''Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.'' '''64''':107-114.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.or.jp/index_e.html |title=Institute for Environmental Sciences |publisher=Ies.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>

==Extraterrestrial biospheres==
No biospheres have been detected beyond the Earth; therefore, the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical. The [[rare Earth hypothesis]] suggests they should be very rare, save ones composed of [[microbe|microbial]] life only.<ref>P. Ward, D.E. Brownlee. 2000. ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe''</ref> On the other hand, new research suggests that [[Earth analog]]s may be quite numerous, at least in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.<ref>http://www.space.com/11188-alien-earths-planets-sun-stars.html</ref> Given limited understanding of [[abiogenesis]], it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres.

It is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created in the future, for example on [[Terraforming of Mars|Mars]].<ref>R. Zubrin. 1996. ''The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must''</ref>
