'''Afghan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: افغان; see ''[[Afghan (ethnonym)|etymology]]'') refers to something from [[Afghanistan]], particularly a citizen of that country. Prior to this definition, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote ''mostly'' the [[Pashtun people]]. In modern times, "Afghan" is still used as an ethnic term as well as the national [[demonym]] for all citizens of Afghanistan.
