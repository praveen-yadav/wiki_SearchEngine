'''Thomas P. "Boston" Corbett''' (1832 – [[Declared death in absentia|presumed dead]] 1894) was an American [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]] soldier who shot and killed [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassin]], [[John Wilkes Booth]]. He disappeared after 1888, but circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] in 1894, although this remains impossible to substantiate.

==Early life==
Corbett was born in [[London]], [[England]]. His family emigrated to [[New York City]] in 1839. He became a [[hatter]] in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. It has been suggested that the fumes of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] used in the hatter's trade caused Corbett's later mental problems.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Dale L.|coauthors=Jakes, John|title=Legends and Lies: Great Mysteries of the American West|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|page=159|isbn=0-312-86848-0}}</ref>

===Family and "rebirth"===
Corbett married, but his wife died in childbirth. Following her death, he moved to [[Boston]], and continued working as a hatter. He was confronted by a street preacher one night and his message persuaded him to join the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] he did and he changed his name to Boston, the name of the city where he was converted.<ref name="Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865">Harper's Weekly, May&nbsp;13, 1865</ref> In an attempt to imitate [[Jesus]], he began to wear his hair very long.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kauffman|first=Michael W.|title=American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies|publisher=Random House|year=2004|page=310|isbn=0-375-50785-X}}</ref> On July&nbsp;16, 1858, in order to avoid the temptation of [[prostitution|prostitutes]], Corbett [[castration|castrated]] [[self-surgery|himself]] with a pair of scissors.

==Military career==
===Enlistment in the Union army===

In April 1861, early in the [[American Civil War]], Corbett enlisted as a private in Company I of the 12 Regiment [[New York Militia]]. He was discharged in August, at the end of the regiment's 3 month enlistment. Corbett re-enlisted in September 1863 as a private in Company L, [[16th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|16th New York Cavalry Regiment]]. Captured by [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] Colonel [[John S. Mosby]]'s men at [[Culpeper, Virginia|Culpeper]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] on June&nbsp;24, 1864, Corbett was held prisoner at [[Andersonville prison]] for five months, when he was [[Prisoner exchange|exchanged]].<ref name="Harper's Weekly, May 13, 1865"/> On his return to his company, he was promoted to sergeant. Corbett later testified for the prosecution in the trial of the commandant of Andersonville, Captain [[Henry Wirz]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Chamlee|first=Roy Z.|coauthors=Chamlee, Roy Z., Jr.|title=Lincoln's Assassins: A Complete Account of Their Capture, Trial, and Punishment|publisher=McFarland|year=1989|page=289|isbn=0-89950-420-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Chipman|first=Norton Parker|title=The Horrors of Andersonville Rebel Prison: Trial of Henry Wirz, the Andersonville Jailer; Jefferson Davis' Defense of Andersonville Prison Fully Refuted|publisher=Bancroft Co.|year=1891|page=40}}</ref>

===Pursuit of John Wilkes Booth===
Corbett was a member of the 16th New York Cavalry sent, on April 24, 1865, to apprehend [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, who was still at large. Two days later the regiment surrounded Booth and his accomplice, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett. The barn was set on fire in an attempt to force them out into the open. Herold surrendered, but Booth remained inside. Corbett was positioned near a large crack in the barn wall. Corbett claimed in an 1878 interview that he saw Booth aim his [[carbine]].<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://theamericanscholar.org/the-man-who-shot-the-man-who-shot-lincoln/ |title = The Man Who Shot the Man Who Shot Lincoln |author = Furgurson, Ernest B. |journal = The American Scholar |date = Spring 2009 |accessdate= 19 June 2012 }}</ref> At that point, Corbett shot Booth with his [[Colt revolver]] despite [[Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]]'s orders that Booth should be taken alive.  Eyewitness Lieutenant Edward Doherty, the officer in charge of the soldiers who captured Booth and Herold, stated that "the bullet struck Booth in the back of the head, about an inch below the spot where his shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln." His [[spinal cord]] was severed, and he died two hours later.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Death of John Wilkes Booth, 1865|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/booth.htm|publisher=Eyewitness to History/Ibis Communications|accessdate=August 16, 2012}} (Quoting Lieutenant Edward Doherty, officer in charge of the soldiers who captured Booth)</ref>
[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]
Corbett was immediately arrested for violation of his orders, but Stanton later had the charges dropped. Stanton remarked, "The rebel is dead. The patriot lives." Corbett received his share of the reward money, amounting to $1,653.84.<ref>Swanson, p. 358</ref>

In his official statement, Corbett claimed he shot Booth because he thought Lincoln's assassin was preparing to use his weapons. This was contradicted by the other witnesses. When asked later why he did it, Corbett answered that "Providence directed me".<ref name="Swanson340">Swanson, p. 340</ref>

==Corbett's later years==
===Immediate post-war life===
After his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter, first in Boston, later in [[Connecticut]], and by 1870 in [[New Jersey]]. His life was marked by increasingly erratic behavior. In 1875, he threatened several men with a pistol at a soldier's reunion in [[Caldwell, Ohio]]. In 1878, he moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]].

===Madness===
In 1887, because of his fame as Booth's killer, Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]]. One day he overheard a conversation in which the legislature's opening prayer was mocked. He jumped to his feet and brandished a revolver. No one was hurt, but Corbett was arrested and sent to the Topeka Asylum for the Insane. On May&nbsp;26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum. He went to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], and stayed briefly with Richard Thatcher, whom he had met when they were both prisoners of war. When he left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Byron Berkeley|title=Abraham Lincoln and Boston Corbett: With Personal Recollections of Each; John Wilkes Booth and Jefferson Davis, a True Story of Their Capture|publisher=B.B. Johnson|year=1914|pages=52–53}}</ref> His "madness" may have been the result of exposure to [[mercury (element)|mercury]], an element commonly used in hat manufacturing. It is so well known for this side effect that it has given rise to the expression "[[mad as a hatter]]".

===Presumed fate===
Rather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]], in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] in eastern [[Minnesota]]. He is believed to have died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] of September&nbsp;1, 1894. Although there is no proof, the name "Thomas Corbett" does appear on the list of dead and missing.<ref name=Herald>''Lincoln Herald, Volume 86'', Lincoln Memorial University Press., 1984, pp 152–155</ref><ref name=Kubicek>Kubicek, Earl C, "The Case of the Mad Hatter", ''Lincoln Herald, Volume 83'', Lincoln Memorial University Press, 1981, pp 708–719</ref>

===Memorials===
In 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31 of [[Concordia, Kansas|Concordia]], [[Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Boston Corbett. It is on Key Road in Concordia. A small sign also was placed to mark the dug hole where Corbett for a time had lived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/16178|title=He Killed Lincoln's Killer, Then Lived In A Hole|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>

In its next-to-the-last episode titled "The Unmasked" (June 17, 1962), the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Bros.]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', starring [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] and [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]], presents an entirely fictitious portrayal of Corbett. Played by [[character actor]] [[Dabbs Greer]], Corbett is living under the name "Joe Brockway" and is depicted as a hotel owner in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], [[Wyoming]]. In the story line, two former Confederate soldiers from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], played by [[Barry Atwater]] and [[Charles Maxwell]], arrive in Laramie in search of "Brockway"; they claim he is the key to the settlement of an estate to which they are all a party, but they have actually been sent to kill him for his role in the death of Lincoln's assassin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630068/|title="The Unmasked", ''Lawman'', June 17, 1962|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}</ref>
