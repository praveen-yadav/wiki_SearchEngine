Selig was previously the team owner and team president of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. As a Milwaukee native, he is credited for keeping baseball in Milwaukee. In 1970, he purchased the [[Seattle Pilots]] in bankruptcy court and renamed them the Milwaukee Brewers after [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|minor league team of the same name]] he had watched in his youth, which existed until the arrival of the [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] in Milwaukee in 1952. The Brewers went to the [[1982 World Series]] and won seven organization of the year awards during his tenure. Selig remains a resident of Milwaukee.

On January 17, 2008, Selig's contract was extended through 2012, after which he planned to retire,<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Barry M.

== Early life ==

Selig was born in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and grew up in a [[Jew]]ish family. His father, Ben Selig, had come to the [[United States]] from [[Romania]] with his family when he was four years old.<ref name="bookref1">{{cite book|last=[[Andrew Zimbalist]]|title=In the Best Interests of Baseball?

Selig's interest in baseball came from his mother. An immigrant from [[Ukraine]], Marie Selig attended college, a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early 20th century, and became a school teacher. When Selig was only three, Marie began taking him and his older brother, Jerry, to [[Borchert Field]], where the minor league [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]] played. When the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] relocated to Milwaukee in [[1953 in baseball|1953]], Selig switched allegiances, and eventually became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. In [[1965 in baseball|1965]], when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team.

== Milwaukee Brewers owner ==
{{see also|Milwaukee Brewers}}

As a minority owner of the [[Atlanta Braves|Milwaukee Braves]], Selig founded the organization '''''Teams, Inc''''', in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. This was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations (in the modern era) left a city without a team. Prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the [[1965 in baseball|1965]] season, he changed the group's name to '''''Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc.''''', after the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|minor league baseball team]] he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.

Selig arranged for major league games to be played at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The first, a pre-season match-up between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Minnesota Twins]], drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in [[1968 in baseball|1968]] and eleven in [[1969 in baseball|1969]]. One of the games played in Milwaukee that year was against the expansion [[Seattle Pilots]], the team that would become the Brewers. Those Milwaukee "home" games were phenomenally successful, with the handful of games accounting for about ''one-third'' of total White Sox home attendance.

To satisfy that fanbase, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in 1969. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the [[American League]] vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago to compete with the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]]. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.

In [[1970 in baseball|1970]], he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the ''Brewers''.

During Selig's tenure as club president, the Brewers participated in postseason play in 1981, when the team finished first in the American League East during the second half of the season, and in 1982, when the team made it to the [[1982 World Series|World Series]], under the leadership of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Robin Yount]] and [[Paul Molitor]]. Under Selig's watch, the Brewers also won seven Organization of the Year awards, although they posted one of the worst winning percentages in the history of Major League Baseball, over periods of ten years or more.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Selig was part of the owners' [[Baseball collusion#1985–1987|collusion]] in [[1985 in baseball|1985]]–[[1987 in baseball|1987]], resulting in the owners paying [[United States dollar|$]]280 million in damages to the players.

Upon his assumption of the commissioner's role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]] in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team has been sold to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] investor [[Mark Attanasio]], questions remain regarding Selig's past involvement. Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes. 

Selig was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

On August 24, 2010, a statue of Selig, commissioned by Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and designed by artist Brian Maughan, was unveiled outside Miller Park in Milwaukee.

== Acting Commissioner (1992–1998) ==

Selig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner [[Fay Vincent]], and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never stated that the owners [[Baseball collusion|colluded]], while Vincent has:
{{quote|The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Union]] basically doesn’t trust the ownership because [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] was a [[United States dollar|$]]280 million theft by Selig and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] of that money from the players. I mean, they rigged the signing of [[free agent]]s. They got caught. They paid $280 million to the players. And I think that’s polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened. I think it’s the reason [[MLBPA]] executive director [[Donald Fehr]] has no trust in Selig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1173&Itemid=81 |title=Interview with Fay Vincent |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=2005-11-09 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>|Fay Vincent}}
Following an 18-9 [[no-confidence vote]], Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the '''Executive Council of Major League Baseball''', and as such became [[de facto]] acting commissioner.

His first major act was to institute the [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]] and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card see it as diminishing the importance of the [[pennant race]] and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.

Selig suspended [[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Marge Schott]] for a year in [[1993 in baseball|1993]] for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year, [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig's predecessor [[Fay Vincent]]. [[Pete Rose]] has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. Rose, along with his close friend and former teammate [[Mike Schmidt]] (who is a strong supporter of Rose's reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about [[Dowd Report|betting on baseball]]. Bud Selig was a close friend of the late [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in [[1989 in baseball|1989]].

As acting commissioner, Selig represented MLB during the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players strike]] and cancelled the [[1994 World Series|World Series]], marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since [[1904 World Series|1904]].

== Commissioner (1998–present) ==

After a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the [[1998 in baseball|1998]] season.

During his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in [[2002 in baseball|2002]], and has seen the implementation of [[interleague play]].

Whereas in the past, the [[National League|National]] and [[American League|American]] leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the [[designated hitter]]), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the Commissioner's Office in [[2000 in baseball|2000]]. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were [[Leonard S. Coleman, Jr.]] and Dr. [[Gene Budig]] respectively.

=== Reaction after September 11, 2001 ===

On September 11, 2001, Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terror attacks on New York and Washington]]. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.

After a dramatic conclusion of the [[2001 World Series]], less than 48 hours later, Selig held a vote on contracting two teams, reportedly the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Montreal Expos]].<ref name="ESPN-ContractionTimeline">{{cite web

This action led to Selig (along with former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]]) being sued for racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners.{{Citation needed|date = |date = August 2013}} If found liable, the league could have been ordered to pay as much as $300 million in punitive damages.{{Citation needed|date = |date = August 2013}} Selig was eager to settle the case because the judge had previously ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over.{{Citation needed|date = |date = August 2013}} The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.{{Citation needed|date = |date = August 2013}}

=== Changes to the MLB All-Star Game ===

The [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 All-Star Game]], played in Selig's hometown of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee]], was tied 7-7 after 9 innings, and remained tied after the bottom of the 11th inning. Due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings, both managers had used their entire roster. Concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound, Selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie,<ref name="usaToday-2007-07-10">{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2007-07-10-AllStartiegamefeature_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Tie in '02 All-Star Game mattered | first=Bob | last=Nightengale | date=2007-07-11}}</ref> to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Selig later said that this call was "embarrassing" and that he was "tremendously saddened" by the outcome of the game.<ref name="usaToday-2007-07-10"/>

Since 2002, Selig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series. The [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 [[Share (ratings)|rating]]; 17 [[Ratings share|share]]) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/asgtv.shtml |title=All-Star Game Television Ratings on Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/specials/all_star/2006/07/12/bc.bbo.all.starratings.ap/index.html |title=SI.com&nbsp;— MLB - 2006 All Star Game&nbsp;— Ratings up for All-Star Game, HR Derby&nbsp;— Wednesday July 12, 2006 6:41PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

=== Disciplinary actions ===

On July 1, 2005, Selig suspended [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] pitcher [[Kenny Rogers (baseball player)|Kenny Rogers]] for 20 games and fined him [[United States dollar|$]]50,000. Rogers got in trouble when on June 29, 2005, he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers knocked him down again.<ref name="ESPN-KennyRogers">{{cite news

While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit Michigan|Detroit]], where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension. Selig decided to uphold the 20 games, however, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games, but upheld the fine.

=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===
{{main|2006 Baseball steroids investigation}}

In [[2005 in baseball|2005]], Selig faced [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on the issue of [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]]. After the Congressional hearings in early 2005, and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue, Selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performance-enhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system. This proposal also included the banning of [[amphetamines]], a first for the major North American sports leagues. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]] and MLB reached an agreement in November on the new policy.<ref>{{cite news |author = |title = MLBPA/MLB joint announcement |url = http://mlbplayers.mlb.com/pa/releases/releases.jsp?content=111505 |publisher = MLBPA |date = 2005-11-15 |accessdate = 2007-03-21}}</ref>

Selig's testimony on the subject has been contradictory.  In 2005, Selig told reporters, “I never even heard about them [steroids] until 1998 or 1999.  I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them.  It wasn’t until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion.”<ref>http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0215-23.htm</ref>  But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: "In 1994, before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA.  As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance enhancing substances from the game."<ref>http://www.baseballinvestigation.com/commissioners-statement.htm</ref>  During the [[1988 ALCS]], Oakland's [[Jose Canseco]] had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids."<ref>http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2009/07/21/baseballs-steroid-era-was-no-surprise-so-hall-of-fame-voters-should-accept-it</ref>  Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, “People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again.”<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/05/mlb-commissioner-bud-selig-drugs-peds</ref>

By early 2006, Selig was forced to deal with the issue of [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]] use.  On March 30, 2006, as a response to the controversy of the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by Barry Bonds, Selig asked former senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball's recent past. [[Joe Sheehan]] from [[Baseball Prospectus]] wrote that the commission has been focusing "blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel", and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sheehan | first = Joe | title = Prospectus Today&nbsp;— Break with the Past | publisher = Baseball Prospectus | date = 2007-05-22 | url = http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6261 | accessdate = 2007-08-14 }}</ref>

Much controversy surrounded Selig and his involvement in [[Barry Bonds]]' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig and the possibility that he and [[Hank Aaron]] would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the [[San Diego Padres]], sitting in Padres owner [[John Moores (baseball)|John Moores]]' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants' baseball game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.

On December 13, 2007, former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell]] released his [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|report on the use of performance-enhancing substances by MLB players]]. The report names many current and former players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs during their career.

Selig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry. [[Chicago Sun Times]] columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] called Selig the "The Steroids Commissioner."<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/742620,mariotti011608.article Selig's only legacy: S-T-E-R-O-I-D-S]{{dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref> Selig has been called to [[United States Congress|Congress]] several times to testify on performance enhancing drug use. Congressman [[Cliff Stearns]] said in December 2007 that Selig should resign because of use of performance enhancing drugs in baseball during his tenure.<ref name="Extension"/>

=== Post-season schedule ===
Selig's decision to extend the traditional post-season schedule into November in an attempt to increase Nielsen ratings was met with widespread disdain, both inside and outside the baseball community. [[Mike Scioscia]], manager of the American League West Division Champion Los Angeles Angels, dismissed the decision as “Ridiculous. I don’t know. Can I say it any clearer than that? We should have never had a day off last Wednesday. We should never have three days off after the season. You shouldn’t even have two days off after the season."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/sports/baseball/25yankees.html?hpw Another Day Off for Yankees and Angels, and It’s Not Exactly Welcome] [[New York Times]], October 25, 2009</ref>

=== Controversies ===
	
Related to the contraction controversy in 2001, [[Rob Dibble]] posted an open letter to Bud Selig, criticizing his actions for benefiting only the Milwaukee Brewers.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Rob Dibble. |url=http://espn.go.com/talent/danpatrick/s/2001/1119/1280454.html |title=Open letter to Bud Selig |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2001-12-01 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}</ref>  Dibble cites that the contraction of the Twins would benefit the Brewers, as they would potentially claim the Twins' share of the upper Midwest market.  

Selig has made some decisions involving the [[Houston Astros]] that were unpopular with their supporters. He ordered the roof at [[Minute Maid Park]] to be opened for games three and four of the [[2005 World Series]], pre-empting the authority held by the Astros. The roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions.<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;John Shea. |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-10-25/sports/17394710_1_general-manager-tim-purpura-roof-astros |title=WORLD SERIES NOTES Roof's not an open and shut case |publisher=Hearst Communications |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}</ref> For [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008, Selig mandated that the Astros play two home games against the [[Chicago Cubs]] in his hometown of Milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting Cubs.

The Milwaukee Brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a Wild Card team, to lose to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the eventual World Series winner.  The home ballparks for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] were both available to host the games.  In 2011, Selig also demanded that the Astros move to the [[American League West]] as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman Jim Crane; the team switched leagues in 2013 in return for $70 million discount in the purchase price.<ref name="MLB-Astros-AL-approved">{{cite web

United States bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross rendered a stern warning to Selig in regards to the [[2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute]].  Treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that Selig did not act in good faith with respect to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].  Selig rejected the television deal that [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]] negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy, claiming McCourt violated the Baseball Agreements although no action taken against [[New York Mets]] owner [[Fred Wilpon]] despite being in a similar position.  Gross stated, "Should the Commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing, the Court may allow LAD (Los Angeles Dodgers) to take further, limited discovery."<ref>{{cite web|author=By&nbsp;Bill Shaikin.

More specifically in regards to the Mets, critics point out that with Selig's personal relationship with Wilpon has allowed him to stall any possible removal of Wilpon as that club's principal owner.
