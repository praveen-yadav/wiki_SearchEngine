'''ArgoUML''' is an [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagramming application written in Java and released under the [[open source]] [[Eclipse Public License]].  By virtue of being a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application, it is available on any platform supported by Java.

ArgoUML does not yet completely implement the UML standard.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/umlsupport/index.html | work = ArgoUML documentation | title = UML Specification Incompatibility list }}</ref>

==History==
ArgoUML was originally developed at [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] by Jason E. Robbins, leading to his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] It is now an open source project hosted by [[Tigris.org]]. The ArgoUML project now includes more than 19,000 registered users and over 150 developers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech-transition.html | title = Tech Transitions at ISR UCI}}</ref>

In 2003, ArgoUML won the Software Development Magazine's annual Readers' Choice Award in the “Design and Analysis Tools” category.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ddj.com/architect/184414997#designtools | title = Dr. Dobb's Readers' Choice Awards, 2003 }}</ref>

ArgoUML development has suffered from lack of manpower. For example, ''Undo'' has been a perpetually requested feature since 2003 but has not been implemented yet.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

{{unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
*All 9 UML 1.4 diagrams supported though not yet implemented. Only class diagram and use-case diagrams are more or less fully implemented.
*Closely follows the UML standard.
*Platform independent – Java 1.5+.
*Click and Go! with Java Web Start (no setup required, starts from your web browser).
*Standard UML 1.4 Metamodel.
*[[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] support.
*Export diagrams as [[GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[PostScript|PS]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[PGML]] and [[SVG]].
*Available in ten languages: EN, EN-GB, DE, ES, IT, RU, FR, NB, PT, ZH.
*Advanced diagram editing and zoom.
*Built-in design critics provide unobtrusive review of design and suggestions for improvements.
*Extensible modules interface.
*[[Object Constraint Language|OCL]] support.
*Forward engineering (code generation supports C++ and C#, Java, PHP&nbsp;4, PHP&nbsp;5, Python, Ruby and, with less mature modules, Ada, Delphi and SQL).
*Reverse engineering / [[JAR (file format)|JAR]]/class file import.

==Weaknesses==
* Partial undo feature (working for graphics edits <ref>{{cite web
