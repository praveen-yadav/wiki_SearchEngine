'''Abacá''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|b|ə|ˈ|k|ɑː}} {{respell|ah-bə|KAH|'}}; from {{lang-es|abacá}} {{IPA-es|aβaˈka|}}), binomial name '''''Musa textilis''''', is a species of [[banana]] native to the [[Philippines]], grown as a commercial crop in the Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica. The plant is of great economic importance, being harvested for its [[fiber]], once generally called [[Manila hemp]], extracted from the trunk or pseudostem. On average, the plant grows about 12 feet (4 meters) tall. The fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes; now most abacá is pulped and used in a variety of specialized paper products including tea bags, filter paper and banknotes.  It is classified as a hard fiber, along with [[coir]], [[henequin]] and [[sisal]].

==Description==

The leaves grow from the trunk of the plant, the bases of the leaves form a ''[[Leaf sheath|sheath]]'' (covering) around the trunk; there are approximately 25 of these, with 5&nbsp;cm in diameter and from 12 to 25 leaves with overlapping [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s, covering the stalk to form a [[shrub]], "false trunk" or pseudostem about 30 to 40&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name="eb"/> They grow in succession, with the oldest growing from the bottom of the trunk and successively younger ones from the top. The sheaths contain the valuable fiber. The coarse fibers range from 5 to 11½ feet (1.5 to 3.5 metres) in length. They are composed primarily of [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and [[pectin]].

==Systematics==
The abacá plant belongs to the [[banana]] family, [[Musaceae]]; it resembles the closely related wild seeded bananas, ''[[Musa acuminata]]'' and ''[[Musa balbisiana]]''. Its scientific name is ''Musa textilis''. Within the [[genus]] ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'', it is placed in section ''Callimusa'' (now including the former section ''Australimusa''), members of which have a [[diploid]] [[chromosome]] number of 2n = 20.<ref name=Wong02/>

==Uses==
[[File:IMG 0791.JPG|thumb|Abaca fiber drying in abaca farm, [[Costa Rica]]]]
Before synthetic textiles came into use, ''M.&nbsp;textilis'' was a major source of high quality fiber: soft, silky and fine.<ref name=Ploe07/> Abacá was first cultivated on a large scale in [[Sumatra]] in 1925 under the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had observed its cultivation in the Philippines for [[cordage]] since the nineteenth century, followed up by plantings in [[Central America]] in 1929 sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].<ref name="eb"/> Commercial planting began in 1930 in [[British North Borneo]]; with the commencement of World War II, the supply from the Philippines was eliminated by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].<ref name="eb"/> Today, abacá is produced commercially in only three countries: Philippines, Ecuador, and Costa Rica.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The Philippines produces 85% of the world's abacá, and the production employs 1.5 million people. Production has declined because of virus diseases.<ref name="NIMBB"/>
[[File:Abacá Mat.jpg|thumb|Mats made from woven Abacá fibers from the [[Philippines]]]]
Most abacá fiber is pulped and processed into specialty paper used in [[tea bag]]s, vacuum bags, currency, and more.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} It can be used to make handcrafts like bags, carpets, clothing and furniture.  Abacá rope is very durable, flexible and resistant to salt water damage, allowing its use in [[hawser]]s, ship's lines and [[fishing net]]s.<ref name="eb"/>  A {{convert|1|in|cm}} rope can require {{convert|4|MT|lb}} to break.<ref name="Colliers"/> Abacá fiber was once used primarily for rope, but this application is now of minor significance.  Lupis is the finest quality of abacá.<ref name="bab1"/> [[Sinamay]] is woven chiefly from abacá.<ref name="bab2"/>

==Cultivation==
The plant is normally grown in well-drained [[loam]]y soil, using pieces of mature root planted at the start of the rainy season.<ref name="eb"/> Growers harvest abacá fields every three to eight months after an initial growth period of 12–25 months and a total lifespan of about 10 years.<ref name="eb"/> The slopes of volcanoes provide a preferred growing environment.<ref name="Colliers"/> Harvest generally includes having several operations concerning the leaf sheaths:
* tuxying (separation of primary and secondary sheath)
* stripping (getting the fibers)
* drying (usually following tradition of sun-drying).

In Costa Rica, more modern harvest and drying techniques are being developed to accommodate the very high yields obtained there.

===Pathogens===
Abacá is vulnerable to a number of pathogens, notably [[abaca bunchy top virus]] and [[abaca bract mosaic virus]].<ref name="NIMBB"/>
