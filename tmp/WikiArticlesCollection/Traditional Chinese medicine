'''Traditional Chinese medicine''' ('''TCM'''; {{zh|t=中醫|s=中医|p=zhōng yī|l=Chinese medicine}}) is a broad range of medicine practices sharing common concepts which have been developed in China and are based on a tradition of more than 2,000 years, including various forms of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Tui na|massage (Tui na)]], [[Qigong|exercise (qigong)]], and dietary therapy.<ref name=TCMNCCAM>Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, [http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm Traditional Chinese Medicine: An Introduction &#91;NCCAM Backgrounder&#93;]</ref>

The doctrines of Chinese medicine are rooted in books such as the ''[[Huangdi Neijing|Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon]]'' and the ''[[Shanghan lun|Treatise on Cold Damage]]'', as well as in cosmological notions like [[Yinyang|yin-yang]] and the [[five phases]]. Starting in the 1950s, these precepts were standardized in the People's Republic of China, including attempts to integrate them with modern notions of [[anatomy]] and [[pathology]]. Nonetheless, the bulk of these precepts, including the [[TCM model of the body|model of the body]], or [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Concept of disease|concept of disease]], is not supported by [[science]] or [[evidence-based medicine]].

TCM's view of the body places little emphasis on anatomical structures, but is mainly concerned with the identification of functional entities (which regulate digestion, breathing, aging etc.). While health is perceived as harmonious interaction of these entities and the outside world, disease is interpreted as a disharmony in interaction. TCM diagnosis includes in tracing symptoms to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|patterns]] of an underlying disharmony, by measuring the pulse, inspecting the tongue, skin, eyes and by looking at the eating and sleeping habits of the patient as well as many other things.

==History==
[[File:Compendium of Materia Medica.gif|thumb|The Compendium of Materia Medica is a pharmaceutical text written by [[Li Shizhen]] (1518–1593 AD) during the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China. This edition was published in 1593.]]

Traces of therapeutic activities in China date from the [[Shang dynasty]] (14th–11th centuries BCE).<ref>{{Harvnb|Unschuld|1985|p=17}}</ref> Though the Shang did not have a concept of "medicine" as distinct from other fields,<ref name="Unschuld_1985_19">{{Harvnb|Unschuld|1985|p=19}}</ref> their [[oracle|oracular]] inscriptions on [[oracle bone|bones]] and tortoise shells refer to illnesses that affected the Shang royal family: eye disorders, toothaches, bloated abdomen, etc.,<ref>{{Harvnb|Unschuld|1985|p=18}}; for detailed explanations of these ailments in Chinese, see {{Harvnb|Peng|2008|pp=193–217}}</ref> which Shang elites usually attributed to curses sent by their ancestors.<ref name="Unschuld_1985_19" /> There is no evidence that the Shang nobility used herbal remedies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Unschuld|1985|p=22}}</ref>

Stone and bone needles found in ancient tombs led [[Joseph Needham]] speculate that acupuncture might have been carried out in the Shang dynasty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lu|Needham|1980}}, pp. 69–70; {{Harvnb|Harper|1998|p=5}}, note 2.</ref> But most historians now make a distinction between medical [[lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]] (or [[bloodletting]]) and acupuncture in the narrower sense of using metal needles to treat illnesses by stimulating specific [[Acupuncture points|points]] along [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|circulation channels]] ("meridians") in accordance with theories related to the circulation of Qi.<ref name="Harper_1998_5">{{Harvnb|Harper|1998|p=5}}, note 2; {{Harvnb|Lo|2002|p=xxxiii}}; {{Harvnb|Epler|1980}}.</ref> The earliest public evidence for acupuncture in this sense dates to the second or first century BCE.<ref>{{Harvnb|Unschuld|1985}}, pp. 93–99; {{Harvnb|Liao|1991|pp=272–74}}; {{Harvnb|Harper|1998|p=5}}, note 2; {{Harvnb|Lo|2002|p=xxxiii}}</ref>

The ''[[Huangdi Neijing|Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon]]'', the oldest received work of Chinese medical theory, was compiled around the first century BCE on the basis of shorter texts from different medical lineages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harper|1998|p=4}}; {{Harvnb|Sivin|1993}}, pp. 193–94; {{Harvnb|Lo|2002|p=xxix}}</ref> Written in the form of dialogues between the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] and his ministers, it offers explanations on the relation between humans, their [[natural environment|environment]], and the [[cosmos]], on the contents of the body, on human vitality and [[pathology]], on the symptoms of illness, and on how to make [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] and therapeutic decisions in light of all these factors.<ref name="autogenerated4">{{Harvnb|Sivin|1993|p=198}}</ref> Unlike earlier texts like ''[[Wushi'er bingfang|Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments]]'', which was excavated in the 1970s from [[Mawangdui|a tomb]] that had been sealed in 168 BCE, the ''Inner Canon'' rejected the influence of spirits and the use of magic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harper|1998|p=11}}</ref> It was also one of the first books in which the cosmological doctrines of [[Yinyang]] and the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] were brought to a mature synthesis.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

The ''[[Shanghan lun|Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders and Miscellaneous Illnesses]]'' was collated by [[Zhang Zhongjing]] sometime between 196 and 220 CE, at the end of the [[Han Dynasty|Han dynasty]]. Focusing on drug prescriptions rather than acupuncture,<ref>{{Harvnb|Sivin|1987|p=179}}; {{Harvnb|Ergil|Ergil|2009|p=30}}</ref> it was the first medical work to combine Yinyang and the Five Phases with drug therapy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Unschuld|1985|p=169}}</ref> This [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] was also the earliest public Chinese medical text to group symptoms into clinically useful "patterns" (''zheng'' 證) that could serve as targets for therapy although the private scrolls held by families were jealously guarded and although it is not known for sure what is in them, the traditional school today say that they have had this information for much longer. Having gone through numerous changes over time, the formulary now circulates as two distinct books: the ''[[Shang Han Lun|Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders]]'' and the ''[[Jingui Yaolue|Essential Prescriptions of the Golden Casket]]'', which were edited separately in the eleventh century, under the [[Song Dynasty|Song dynasty]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Goldschmidt|2009}}, pp. 100–101.</ref>

In the centuries that followed the completion of the ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon'', several shorter books tried to summarize or systematize its contents. The ''[[Nan Jing|Canon of Problems]]'' (probably second century CE) tried to reconcile divergent doctrines from the ''Inner Canon'' and developed a complete medical system centered on [[acupuncture|needling therapy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sivin|1987|p=89}}</ref> The ''AB Canon of Acupuncture and Moxibustion'' (''Zhenjiu jiayi jing'' 針灸甲乙經, compiled by [[Huangfu Mi]] sometime between 256 and 282 CE) assembled a consistent body of doctrines concerning acupuncture;<ref name="autogenerated6">{{Harvnb|Sivin|1987|p=90}}</ref> whereas the ''Canon of the Pulse'' (''Maijing'' 脈經; ca. 280) presented itself as a "comprehensive handbook of diagnostics and therapy."<ref name=autogenerated6 />

===Historical physicians===
These include [[Zhang Zhongjing]], [[Hua Tuo]], [[Sun Simiao]], Tao Hongjing, [[Zhang Jiegu]], and [[Li Shizhen]].

==Philosophical background==
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on [[School of Yin Yang|Yinyangism]] (i.e., the combination of [[Wu xing|Five Phases]] theory with [[yin and yang|Yin-yang]] theory),<ref name="Zou Yan">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> which was later absorbed by [[Daoism]].<ref>Liu 1999, pp. 38–39</ref>
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|right|200px|Yin and yang symbol for balance. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, good health is believed to be achieved by a balance between yin and yang.]]

===Yin and yang===
{{Main|Yin and yang}}

Yin and yang are ancient Chinese concepts which can be traced back to the Shang dynasty<ref name="Men & Guo 2010, p. 60">Men & Guo 2010, p. 60</ref> (1600–1100&nbsp;BC). They represent two abstract<ref name="Men & Guo 2010, p. 62">Men & Guo 2010, p. 62</ref> and complementary aspects that every phenomenon in the universe can be divided into.<ref name="Men & Guo 2010, p. 60"/> Primordial analogies for these aspects are the sun-facing (yang) and the shady (yin) side of a hill.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 56</ref> Two other commonly used representational allegories of yin and yang are water and fire.<ref name="Men & Guo 2010, p. 62"/> In the yin-yang theory, detailed attributions are made regarding the yin or yang character of things:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Phenomenon || Yin || Yang
|-
! Celestial bodies<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 57">Ergil et al. 2009, p. 57</ref>

|-

| downward || upward
|-
! Degree of humidity
| damp/moist || dry
|}

The concept of yin and yang is also applicable to the human body; for example, the upper part of the body and the back are assigned to yang, while the lower part of the body are believed to have the yin character.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 5</ref> Yin and yang characterization also extends to the various body functions, and – more importantly – to disease symptoms (e.g., cold and heat sensations are assumed to be yin and yang symptoms, respectively).<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 6"/> Thus, yin and yang of the body are seen as phenomena whose lack (or overabundance) comes with characteristic symptom combinations:

*Yin vacuity (also termed "vacuity-heat"): heat sensations, possible night sweats, insomnia, dry pharynx, dry mouth, dark urine, a red tongue with scant fur, and a "fine" and rapid pulse.<ref>Kaptchuk 2000, p. 230</ref>
*Yang vacuity ("vacuity-cold"): aversion to cold, cold limbs, bright white complexion, long voidings of clear urine, diarrhea, pale and enlarged tongue, and a slightly weak, slow and fine pulse.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 142">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 142</ref>

TCM also identifies drugs believed to treat these specific symptom combinations, i.e., to reinforce yin and yang.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009. p. 58</ref>
[[File:Wuxing en.svg|thumb|right|200px|Interactions of Wu Xing]]

===Five Phases theory===
{{Main|Wu Xing}}
Five Phases (五行, {{zh|p=wǔ xíng}}), sometimes also translated as the "Five Elements"<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60">Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60</ref> theory, presumes that all phenomena of the universe and nature can be broken down into five elemental qualities – represented by wood (木, {{zh|p=mù}}), fire (火{{zh|p=huǒ}}), earth (土, {{zh|p=tǔ}}), metal (金, {{zh|p=jīn}}), and water (水, {{zh|p=shuǐ}}).<ref name="Aung & Chen 2007, p. 8">Aung & Chen 2007, p. 8</ref> In this way, lines of correspondence can be drawn:

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
! Eye part<ref>Deng 1999, p. 21</ref>
| iris || inner/outer corner of the eye || upper and lower lid     || sclera || pupil
|}

Strict rules are identified to apply to the relationships between the Five Phases in terms of sequence, of acting on each other, of counteraction etc.<ref name="Aung & Chen 2007, p. 8"/> All these aspects of Five Phases theory constitute the basis of the [[Zang-fu|zàng-fǔ]] concept, and thus have great influence regarding the TCM model of the body.<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60"/> Five Phase theory is also applied in diagnosis and therapy.<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 60"/>

Correspondences between the body and the universe have historically not only been seen in terms of the Five Elements, but also of the "Great Numbers" (大數, {{zh|p=dà shū}})<ref>Matuk 2006, p. 6</ref> For example, the number of acu-points has at times been seen to be 365, in correspondence with the number of days in a year; and the number of main [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]] – 12 – has been seen in correspondence with the number of rivers flowing through the [[History of China|ancient Chinese empire]].<ref name="Matuk2006">{{cite journal |title=Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chinese and Western Medical Illustration |author=Camillia Matuk |journal=Journal of Biocommunication |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2006 |url=http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf |pmid= |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name=SDAM>''"There are 365 days in the year, while humans have 365 joints [or acu-points]...

==Model of the body==
{{main|TCM model of the body}}

TCM's view of the human body is only marginally concerned with [[anatomy|anatomical]] structures, but focuses primarily on the body's ''functions''<ref>Matuk 2006, page 5</ref><ref>"Chinese medicine ... emphasizes function. Little emphasis is placed on structure, especially internal structures." As seen at: Ross 1984, p. 6</ref> (such as digestion, breathing, temperature maintenance, etc.):

{{Quote|"The tendency of Chinese thought is to seek out dynamic functional activity rather than to look for the fixed somatic structures that perform the activities. Because of this, the Chinese have no system of anatomy comparable to that of the West."|Ted Kaptchuk|''The Web That Has No Weaver''}}

These functions are aggregated and then associated with a primary functional entity – for instance, nourishment of the tissues and maintenance of their moisture are seen as connected functions, and the entity postulated to be responsible for these functions is xuě (blood).<ref>Ross 1984, p. 13 (table)</ref> These functional entities thus constitute ''concepts'' rather than something with biochemical or anatomical properties<ref>"For example, [the term] Xue is used rather than Blood, since the latter implies the blood of Western medicine, with its precise parameters of biochemistry and histiology. Although Xue and blood share some common attributes, fundamentally, Xue is a different concept." As seen at: Flaws 1984, pp. 12–13</ref>

The primary functional entities used by traditional Chinese medicine are qì, xuě, the five zàng organs, the six fǔ organs, and the meridians which extend through the organ systems.<ref name="Aung, S.K.H. 2007 p. 19">Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, p. 19</ref>  These are all theoretically interconnected: each zàng organ is paired with a fǔ organ, which are nourished by the blood and concentrate qi for a particular function, with meridians being extensions of those functional systems throughout the body.

Attempts to reconcile these concepts with modern science – in terms of identifying a physical correlate of them – have so far failed.<ref>"... Even more elusive is the basis of some of the key traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation of qi, the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information but continue to play an important role in the evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in acupuncture."

===Qi===
{{Main|Qi}}

TCM distinguishes not only one but several different kinds of qi ({{zh|p=qì|s=气|t=氣|}}).<ref name="Aung & Chen 2007, pp 11–12">Aung & Chen 2007, pp 11–12</ref> In a general sense, qi is something that is defined by five "cardinal functions":<ref name="Aung & Chen 2007, pp 11–12"/><ref>"'''氣的生理功能'''...(一)推動作用...(二)溫煦作用...(三)防御作用...(四)固攝作用...(五)氣化作用 ['''Physiological functions of qi''' ... 1.)

# Actuation (推動, tuīdòng) – of all physical processes in the body, especially the circulation of all body fluids such as blood in their vessels. This includes actuation of the functions of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Zàng-fǔ (organs)|zang-fu organs]] and [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]].
# Warming (溫煦, {{zh|p=wēnxù}}) – the body, especially the limbs.
# Defense (防御, {{zh|p=fángyù}}) – against [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|Exogenous Pathogenic Factors]]
# Containment (固攝, {{zh|p=gùshè}}) – of body fluids, i.e. keeping blood, sweat, urine, semen etc. from leakage or excessive emission.
# Transformation (氣化, {{zh|p=qìhuà}}) – of food, drink, and breath into qi, [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Xue|xue]] (blood), and [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Bodily fluids (Jinye)|jinye]] (“fluids”), and/or transformation of all of the latter into each other.
Vacuity of qi will especially be characterized by pale complexion, lassitude of spirit, lack of strength, spontaneous sweating, laziness to speak, non-digestion of food, shortness of breath (especially on exertion), and a pale and enlarged tongue.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 142" />

Qi is believed to be partially generated from food and drink, and partially from air (by breathing).<ref name="yinyanghouse.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/what_is_qi#jing |title=What is Qi? Qi in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref> Another considerable part of it is inherited from the parents and will be consumed in the course of life.<ref name="yinyanghouse.com"/>

In terms of location, TCM uses special terms for qi running inside of the blood vessels and for qi which is distributed in the skin, muscles, and tissues between those. The former is called yíng-qì ({{zh|s=营气|t=營氣}}), its function is to complement xuè and its nature has a strong yin aspect (although qi in general is considered to be yang).<ref name="Elizabeth Reninger">{{cite web |url=http://taoism.about.com/od/qi/a/Qi_Forms.htm |title=Qi (Chi): Various Forms Used In Qigong & Chinese Medicine – How Are The Major Forms Of Qi Created Within The Body? |author=Elizabeth Reninger |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref> The latter is called weì-qì ({{zh|t=衛氣}}), its main function is defence and it has pronounced yang nature.<ref name="Elizabeth Reninger"/>

Qi also circulates in the meridians. Just as the qi held by each of the zang-fu organs, this is considered to be part of the ‘’principal‘’ qi (元氣, {{zh|p=yuánqì}}) of the body<ref>"...元氣生成後，通過三焦而流行分布於全身，內至髒腑，外達腠理肌膚...

===Xue===
In contrast to the majority of other functional entities, xuě (血, "blood") is correlated with a physical form – the [[Blood|red liquid]] running in the blood vessels.<ref name="Blood from a TCM Perspective">{{cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref> Its concept is, nevertheless, defined by its functions: nourishing all parts and tissues of the body, safeguarding an adequate degree of moisture,<ref name="http">{{cite web |url=http://www.yinyanghouse.com/theory/chinese/blood_theory_and_disharmonies |title=The Concept of Blood (Xue) in TCM Acupuncture Theory |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref> and sustaining and soothing both consciousness and sleep.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.shen-nong.com/eng/principles/blood.html|title=Blood from a TCM Perspective |publisher=Shen-Nong Limited |accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref>

Typical symptoms of a lack of xuě (usually termed "blood vacuity" [血虚, {{zh|p=xuě xū}}]) are described as: Pale-white or withered-yellow complexion, dizziness, flowery vision, palpitations, insomnia, numbness of the extremities; pale tongue; "fine" pulse.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis, p. 147</ref>

====Jinye====
Closely related to xuě are the jīnyė (津液, usually translated as "body fluids"), and just like xuě they are considered to be yin in nature, and defined first and foremost by the functions of nurturing and moisturizing the different structures of the body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001–2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=9 December 2010}}</ref> Their other functions are to harmonize yin and yang, and to help with the secretion of waste products.<ref>"三、津液的功能 ...（三）调节阴阳 ...（四）排泄废物 ..."

Chapter 4: Essence, qi, blood, jinye. Section 4: jinye}}</ref>

Jīnyė are ultimately extracted from food and drink, and constitute the raw material for the production of xuě; conversely, xuě can also be transformed into jīnyė.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredlotus.com/theory/substances/jinye.cfm |title=Body Fluids (Yin Ye) |publisher=copyright 2001–2010 by Sacred Lotus Arts |accessdate=3 March 2011}}</ref> Their palpable manifestations are all bodily fluids: [[tears]], [[sputum]], [[Salivary gland|saliva]], [[Gastric acid|gastric juice]], [[Synovial fluid|joint fluid]], [[Persperation|sweat]], [[urine]], etc.<ref>"津液包括各脏腑组织的正常体液和正常的分泌物，胃液、肠液、唾液、关节液等。习惯上也包括代谢产物中的尿、汗、泪等。" [The (term) jinye comprises all physiological bodily fluids of the zang-fu and tissues, and physiological secretions, gastric juice, intestinal juice, saliva, joint fluid etc. Costumarily this also includes metabolic products like urine, sweat, and tears, etc.] As seen at: {{cite web |url=http://www.zysj.com.cn/lilunshuji/jichulilun/44-4-4.html |title=《中医基础理论》第四章 精、气、血、津液. 第四节 津液 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Basics of TCM theory.

===Zang-fu===
{{Main|Zang-fu}}
The '''zàng-fǔ''' ({{zh|s=脏腑|t=臟腑}}) constitute the centre piece of TCM's systematization of bodily functions. Bearing the names of organs, they are, however, only secondarily tied to (rudimentary) [[anatomy|anatomical]] assumptions (the fǔ a little more, the zàng much less).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China – Chinese Medicine – Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> As they are primarily defined by their functions,<ref>Ross 1984, p.6: "... the Zang Fu, the organ systems of TCM, do not refer so much to structures as to functions."</ref><ref>Kaptchuk 2000, p. 76: "The Chinese Liver is defined first by the activities associated with it, the Western liver by its physical structure"</ref> they are not equivalent to the anatomical organs – to highlight this fact, their names are usually capitalized.

The term zàng (臟) refers to the five entities considered to be yin in nature – [[Heart (Chinese medicine)|Heart]], [[Liver (Chinese medicine)|Liver]], [[Spleen (Chinese medicine)|Spleen]], [[Lung (Chinese medicine)|Lung]], [[Kidney (Chinese medicine)|Kidney]] –, while fǔ (腑) refers to the six yang organs – [[Small intestine (Chinese medicine)|Small Intestine]], [[Large Intestine (Chinese medicine)|Large Intestine]], [[Gallbladder (Chinese medicine)|Gallbladder]], [[Urinary Bladder (Chinese medicine)|Urinary Bladder]], [[Stomach (Chinese medicine)|Stomach]] and [[San Jiao|Sānjiaō]].<ref>by citation from the [[Huangdi Neijing]]'s Suwen: ‘’言人身臟腑中陰陽，則臟者為陰，腑者為陽。‘’[Within the human body's zang-fu, there's yin and yang; the zang are yin, the fu are yang].

The zàng's essential functions consist in production and storage of qì and xuě; in a wider sense they are stipulated to regulate digestion, breathing, water metabolism, the musculoskeletal system, the skin, the sense organs, aging, emotional processes, mental activity etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/118Kaleidoscope4651.html |title= Cultural China – Chinese Medicine – Basic Zang Fu Theory |accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref>  The fǔ organs' main purpose is merely to transmit and digest (傳化, {{zh|p=chuán-huà}})<ref>"六腑：膽、胃、小腸、大腸、膀胱、三焦；“傳化物質”。 [The Six Fu: gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, bladder, sanjiao; "transmit and digest"] as seen at {{cite web |url=http://www.notedyy.com/news/html/?341.html |title=中醫基礎理論-髒腑學說 |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=14 December 2010 |language=Chinese |trans_title=Basics of TCM theory – The zangfu concept}}</ref> substances like waste, food, etc.

Since their concept was developed on the basis of [[Wu xing|Wǔ Xíng]] philosophy, each zàng is paired with a fǔ, and each zàng-fǔ pair is assigned to one of five elemental qualities (i.e., the Five Elements or Five Phases).<ref>Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, pp 15–16<</ref> These correspondences are stipulated as:
*Fire (火) = Heart (心, {{zh|p=xīn}}) and Small Intestine (小腸, {{zh|p=xiaǒcháng}}) (and, secondarily, Sānjiaō [三焦, "Triple Burner"] and Pericardium [心包, {{zh|p=xīnbaò}}])
*Earth (土) = Spleen (脾, {{zh|p=pí}}) and Stomach (胃, {{zh|p=weì}})
*Metal (金) = Lung (肺, {{zh|p=feì}}) and Large Intestine (大腸, {{zh|p=dàcháng}})
*Water (水) = Kidney (腎, {{zh|p=shèn}}) and Bladder (膀胱, {{zh|p=pǎngguāng}})
*Wood (木) = Liver (肝, {{zh|p=gān}}) and Gallbladder (膽, {{zh|p=dān}})

The zàng-fǔ are also connected to the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)#Twelve standard meridians|twelve standard meridians]] – each yang meridian is attached to a fǔ organ and five of the yin meridians are attached to a zàng. As there are only five zàng but six yin meridians, the sixth is assigned to the [[Pericardium (Chinese medicine)|Pericardium]], a peculiar entity almost similar to the Heart zàng.<ref>Aung, S.K.H. & Chen, W.P.D. (2007): Clinical introduction to medical acupuncture. Thieme Mecial Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58890-221-4, p. 16</ref>

{{Main|Meridian (Chinese medicine)}}

The meridians (经络, {{zh|p=jīng-luò}}) are believed to be channels running from the
zàng-fǔ in the interior (里, {{zh|p=lǐ}}) of the body to the limbs and joints ("the surface" [表, {{zh|p=biaǒ}}]), transporting qi and xuĕ.<ref>"经络是运行全身气血，联络脏腑肢节，沟通表里上下内外，..."

==Concept of disease==
In general, disease is perceived as a disharmony (or imbalance) in the functions or interactions of yin, yang, qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc. and/or of the interaction between the human body and the environment.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 77">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 77</ref> Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified.<ref name="Ergil et al. 19, p. 148">Ergil et al. 19, p. 148</ref><ref name="Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 1">Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 1</ref> Thus, "pattern discrimination" is the most important step in TCM diagnosis.<ref name="Ergil et al. 19, p. 148"/><ref name="Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 1"/> It is also known to be the most difficult aspect of practicing TCM.<ref>Flaws 1990, p. 5</ref>

In order to determine which pattern is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice.<ref>“Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine”, Giovanni Maciocia, Eastland Press; Revised edition (June 1995)</ref><ref name=Maciocia>{{Cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Maciocia|title=The Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=1989}}</ref> For example, depending on tongue and pulse conditions, a TCM practitioner might diagnose bleeding from the mouth and nose as: "Liver fire rushes upwards and scorches the Lung, injuring the blood vessels and giving rise to reckless pouring of blood from the mouth and nose.".<ref name=Deadman>Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji. [http://www.jcm.co.uk/product/catalog/product/view/7937/some-acupuncture-points-which-treat-disorders-of-blood/ "Some acupuncture points which treat disorders of blood"], ''[[Journal of Chinese Medicine]]''</ref> He might then go on to prescribe treatments designed to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Traditional categorization|clear heat]] or [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Traditional categorization|supplement the Lung]].

===Disease entities===
In TCM, a disease has two aspects: "bìng" and "zhèng".<ref name="ReferenceC">Clavey 1995, p. xxx (30 of the introduction)</ref> The former is often translated as "disease entity",<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146"/> "disease category",<ref>Flaws 1990, p. 6</ref>  "illness",<ref name="ReferenceC"/> or simply "diagnosis".<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The latter, and more important one, is usually translated as "pattern"<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146">Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146</ref><ref name="Flaws 1990, p. 7">Flaws 1990, p. 7</ref> (or sometimes also as "syndrome"<ref name="ReferenceC"/>). For example, the disease entity of a common cold might present with a pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|wind-cold]] in one patient, and with the pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|wind-heat]] in another.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 126</ref>

From a scientific point of view, most of the disease entitites (病, {{zh|p=bìng}}) listed by TCM constitute mere symptoms.<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 146"/> Examples include headache, cough, abdominal pain, constipation etc.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 147</ref>

Since therapy will not be chosen according to the disease entity but according to the pattern, two patients with the same disease entity but different patterns will receive different therapy. Vice versa, patients with similar patterns might receive similar therapy even if their disease entities are different. This is called 异病同治，同病异治 ({{zh|p=yì bìng tóng zhì, tóng bìng yì zhì}},<ref name="Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 1"/> "different diseases, same treatment; same disease, different treatments").

===Patterns===
In TCM, "pattern" (证, {{zh|p=zhèng}}) refers to a "pattern of disharmony" or "functional disturbance" within the functional entities the TCM model of the body is composed of.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 122: "... Chinese medicine does not diagnose a disease, but rather a 'pattern of disharmony'... the concept of disharmony ... refers to the functional disturbance of any bowel, viscus, or vital substance."</ref> There are disharmony patterns of qi, xuě, the body fluids, the zàng-fǔ, and the meridians.<ref name="Clavey 1995, p. xxxi">Clavey 1995, p. xxxi</ref> They are ultimately defined by their symptoms and "signs" (i.e., for example, pulse and tongue findings).<ref>"The ground, however, is the total pattern. The ground is made up of all the other signs and symptoms that are not necessarily pathognomonic of the diagnosed disease." As seen at: Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 3</ref>

In clinical practice, the identified pattern usually involves a combination of affected entities<ref name="Flaws 1990, p. 8">Flaws 1990, p. 8</ref> (compare with [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Typical examples of patterns|typical examples of patterns]]). The concrete pattern identified should account for ''all'' the symptoms a patient has.<ref>Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 3</ref>

====Six Excesses====
The Six Excesses (六淫, {{zh|p=liù yín}},<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 78</ref> sometimes also translated as "Pathogenic Factors",<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WbThUt45ZXgC&pg=PA159&dq=tcm+six#v=onepage&q=tcm%20six&f=false|title=Foundations for integrative musculoskeletal medicine: an east-west approach|author=Marcus & Kuchera|publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=2004|accessdate=22 March 2011|isbn=978-1-55643-540-9}} p. 159</ref> or "Six Pernicious Influences";<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 39">Ross 1984, p. 39</ref> with the alternative term of  六邪, {{zh|p=liù xié}}, – "Six Evils" or "Six Devils"<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 27">Ross 1984, p. 27</ref>) are allegorical terms used to describe disharmony patterns displaying certain typical symptoms.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88: "The six evils are not detected in a lab, but are known through distinctive signs."</ref> These symptoms resemble the effects of six climatic factors.<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 39"/> In the allegory, these symptoms can occur because one or more of those climatic factors (called 六气, {{zh|p=liù qì}}, "the six qi"<ref>Deng 1999 , p. 185</ref>) were able to invade the body surface and to proceed to the interior.<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88">Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88</ref> This is sometimes used to draw causal relationships (i.e., prior exposure to wind/cold/etc. is identified as the cause of a disease),<ref>Deng 1999, p. 185: "Or, abnormal changes in the weather, at inappropriate times for that weather condition, can cause the emergence of disease."</ref> while other authors explicitly deny a direct cause-effect relationship between weather conditions and disease,<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88:"Whether the patient had a specific encounter with a cold wind shortly before the onset of the symptoms is not necessarily relevant."</ref><ref>Ross 1984, p. 39: "The situation is not so much a linear chain of cause and effect,..."</ref> pointing out that the Six Excesses are primarily descriptions of a certain combination of symptoms<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88: "It is the patient's presentation that determines the nature of the evil."</ref> translated into a pattern of disharmony.<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 39"/> It is undisputed, though, that the Six Excesses can manifest inside the body without an external cause.<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88"/><ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 79">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 79</ref> In this case, they might be denoted "internal", e.g., "internal wind"<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 79"/> or "internal fire (or heat)".<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 81</ref>

The Six Excesses and their characteristic clinical signs are:
#Wind (风, {{zh|p=fēng}}): rapid onset of symptoms, wandering location of symptoms, itching, nasal congestion, "floating" pulse;<ref name="Deng 1999, p. 186">Deng 1999, p. 186</ref> tremor, paralysis, convulsion.<ref name="Ergil et al. 2009, p. 88"/>
#Cold (寒, {{zh|p=hán}}): cold sensations, aversion to cold, relief of symptoms by warmth, watery/clear excreta, severe pain, abdominal pain, contracture/hypertonicity of muscles, (slimy) white tongue fur, "deep"/"hidden" or "string-like" pulse,<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, pp. 80 & 142</ref> or slow pulse.<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 38">Ross 1984, p. 38</ref>
#Fire/Heat (火, {{zh|p=huǒ}}): aversion to heat, high fever, thirst, concentrated urine, red face, red tongue, yellow tongue fur, rapid pulse.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 89</ref> (Fire and heat are basically seen to be the same)<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 80">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 80</ref>
#Dampness (湿, {{zh|p=shī}}): sensation of heaviness, sensation of fullness, symptoms of Spleen dysfunction, greasy tongue fur, "slippery" pulse.<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 38"/>
#Dryness (燥, {{zh|p=zào}}): dry cough, dry mouth, dry throat, dry lips, nosebleeds, dry skin, dry stools.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 127</ref>
#Summerheat (暑, {{zh|p=shǔ}}): either heat or mixed damp-heat symptoms.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 82</ref>
Six-Excesses-patterns can consist of only one or a combination of Excesses (e.g., wind-cold, wind-damp-heat).<ref name="Deng 1999, p. 186"/> They can also transform from one into another.<ref name="Deng 1999, p. 186"/>

====Typical examples of patterns====
For each of the functional entities (qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc.), typical disharmony patterns are recognized; for example: qi vacuity and qi stagnation in the case of qi;<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 145–146</ref> blood vacuity, blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xuĕ;<ref>Wiseman % Ellis 1996, p. 147–150</ref> Spleen qi vacuity, Spleen yang vacuity, Spleen qi vacuity with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi vacuity with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen zàng;<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 139 (table)</ref> wind/cold/damp invasion in the case of the meridians.<ref>Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 169-173</ref>

TCM gives detailed prescriptions of these patterns regarding their typical symptoms, mostly including characteristic tongue and/or pulse findings.<ref>cf. Flaws & Finney 1996, pp. 9–133, 137–151, 169–174</ref><ref>cf. Wiseman & Ellis 1996, pp. 145 et sqq.</ref> For example:
* "Upflaming Liver fire" (肝火上炎, {{zh|p=gānhuǒ shàng yán}}): Headache, red face, reddened eyes, dry mouth, nosebleeds, constipation, dry or hard stools, profuse menstruation, sudden [[tinnitus]] or deafness, vomiting of sour or bitter fluids, expectoration of blood, [[irascibility]], impatience; red tongue with dry yellow fur; slippery and string-like pulse.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 173</ref>

====Basic principles of pattern discrimination====
The process of determining which actual pattern is on hand is called 辩证 ({{zh|p=biàn zhèng}}, usually translated as "pattern diagnosis",<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 122</ref> "pattern identification"<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127</ref> or "pattern discrimination"<ref name="Flaws 1990, p. 7"/>). Generally, the first and most important step in pattern diagnosis is an evaluation of the present signs and symptoms on the basis of the "Eight Principles" (八纲, {{zh|p=bā gāng}}).<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127"/><ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 124</ref>
These eight principles refer to four pairs of fundamental qualities of a disease: exterior/interior, heat/cold, vacuity/repletion, and yin/yang.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127"/> Out of these, heat/cold and vacuity/repletion have the biggest clinical importance.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127"/> The yin/yang quality, on the other side, has the smallest importance and is somewhat seen aside from the other three pairs, since it merely presents a general and vague conclusion regarding what other qualities are found.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127"/> In detail, the Eight Principles refer to the following:
* ''Exterior'' (表, {{zh|p=biǎo}}) refers to a disease manifesting in the superficial layers of the body – skin, hair, flesh, and meridians.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 128">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 128</ref> It is characterized by aversion to cold and/or wind, headache, muscle ache, mild fever, a "floating" pulse, and a normal tongue appearance.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 128"/>
* ''Interior'' (里, {{zh|p=lǐ}}) refers to disease manifestation in the zàng-fǔ, or (in a wider sense) to any disease that can not be counted as exterior.<ref>Deng 1999, p. 167</ref> There are no generalized characteristic symptoms of interior patterns, since they'll be determined by the affected zàng or fǔ entity.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 130</ref>
* ''Cold'' (寒, {{zh|p=hán}}) is generally characterized by aversion to cold, absence of thirst, and a white tongue fur.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 132">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 132</ref> More detailed characterization depends on whether cold is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 132"/>
* ''Heat'' (热, {{zh|p=rè}}) is characterized by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 141">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 141</ref> In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with vacuity or repletion.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 133</ref>
* ''Vacuity'' (虚, {{zh|p=xū}}) often referred to as "deficiency", can be further differentiated into vacuity of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Qi|qi]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Blood (Xue)|xuě]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin and yang]], with all their respective characteristic symptoms.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 135</ref> [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|Yin vacuity]] can also be termed "vacuity-heat", while [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yang vacuity]] is equivalent to "vacuity-cold".<ref>Kaptchuck 2000, pp. 230–231</ref>
* ''Repletion'' (实, {{zh|p=shí}}) often called "excess", generally refers to any disease that can't be identified as a vacuity pattern, and usually indicates the presence of one of the Six Excesses,<ref>"...if it not that the right is vacous, then it is that the evil is replete." As seen at: Deng 1999, p. 165</ref> or a pattern of [[Traditional Chinese medicine#stagnation|stagnation]] (of qi, xuě, etc.).<ref>Tierra & Tierra 1998, p. 108</ref> In a concurrent exterior pattern, repletion is characterized by the absence of sweating.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 141"/> The signs and symptoms of repletion-cold patterns are equivalent to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|cold excess]] patterns, and repletion-heat is similar to [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|heat excess]] patterns.<ref>cf. Wiseman & Ellis 1996, pp. 80, 142, 193, 197</ref>
* ''[[Yin and yang]]'' are universal aspects all things can be classified under, this includes diseases in general as well as the Eight Principles' first three couples.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 138">Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 138</ref> For example, cold is identified to be a yin aspect, while heat is attributed to yang.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 138"/> Since descriptions of patterns in terms of yin and yang lack complexity and clinical practicality, though, patterns are usually not labelled this way anymore.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 138"/> Exceptions are [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|vacuity-cold]] and [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Six Excesses|repletion-heat]] patterns, who are sometimes referred to as "yin patterns" and "yang patterns" respectively.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 138"/>

After the fundamental nature of a disease in terms of the Eight Principles is determined, the investigation focuses on more specific aspects.<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127"/> By evaluating the present signs and symptoms against the background of typical disharmony patterns of the various entities, evidence is collected whether or how specific entities are affected.<ref>"For instance, if by eight-principle pattern identification a heat pattern is detected, qi-blood pattern identification will show whether the heat is located in the blood or qi; organ pattern identification will determine what organ or organs are affected; and disease-evil pattern identification will identify any evil present." As seen at: Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 127</ref> This evaluation can be done

There are also three special pattern diagnosis systems used in case of febrile and infectious diseases only ("Six Channel system" or "six division pattern" [六经辩证, {{zh|p=liù jīng biàn zhèng}}]; "Wei Qi Ying Xue system" or "four division pattern" [卫气营血辩证, {{zh|p=weì qì yíng xuě biàn zhèng}}]; "San Jiao system" or "three burners pattern" [三角辩证, {{zh|p=sānjiaō biàn zhèng}}]).<ref name="Clavey 1995, p. xxxi"/><ref>Flaws & Finney 1996, p. 6</ref>

====Considerations of disease causes====
Although TCM and its concept of disease do not strongly differentiate between cause and effect,<ref>Ross 1984, p. 26</ref> pattern discrimination can include considerations regarding the disease cause; this is called 病因辩证 ({{zh|p=bìngyīn biàn zhèng}}, "disease-cause pattern discrimination").<ref name="Flaws 1990, p. 8"/>

There are three fundamental categories of disease causes (三因, {{zh|p=sān yīn}}) recognized:<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 77"/>
# external causes: these include the Six Excesses and "Pestilential Qi".<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 77"/>
# internal causes: the "Seven Affects" (七情, {{zh|p=qì qíng}},<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 77"/> sometimes also translated as "Seven Emotions"<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 40">Ross 1984, p. 40</ref>) – joy, anger, brooding, sorrow, fear, fright and grief.<ref name="Ross 1984, p. 40"/> These are believed to be able to cause damage to the functions of the zàng-fú, especially of the Liver.<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 65</ref>
# non-external-non-internal causes: dietary irregularities (especially: too much raw, cold, spicy, fatty or sweet food; voracious eating; too much alcohol),<ref>Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 83</ref> fatigue, sexual intemperance, trauma, and parasites (虫, {{zh|p=chóng}}).<ref name="Wiseman & Ellis 1996, p. 77"/>

==Diagnostics==
In TCM, there are five diagnostic methods: inspection, auscultation, olfaction, inquiry, and palpation.<ref>[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.</ref>

*Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.
*Auscultation refers to listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing).
*Olfaction refers to attending to body odor.
*Inquiry focuses on the "seven inquiries", which involve asking the patient about the regularity, severity, or other characteristics of:
** chills
** fever
** perspiration
** appetite
** thirst
** taste
** defecation
** urination
** pain
** sleep
** [[menses]]
** [[leukorrhea]]
*Palpation includes feeling the body for tender [[Acupuncture#Qi, meridians and acupuncture points|A-shi points]], palpation of the wrist pulses as well as various other pulses, and palpation of the abdomen.

=== Tongue and pulse ===

Examination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in TCM. Certain sectors of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the zàng-fŭ. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the Liver.
  
Pulse palpation involves measuring the pulse both at a superficial and at a deep level at three different locations on the [[radial artery]] (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for a total of twelve pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain zàng-fŭ.  The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength and volume, and described with qualities like "floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick"; each of these qualities indicate certain [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|disease patterns]]. Learning TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wright, Thomas; Eisenberg, David |title=Encounters with Qi: exploring Chinese medicine |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1995 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=DgFA-kVkuZEC&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=false 53–4]|isbn=0-393-31213-5 |oclc= }}</ref>

===Prescriptions===
Typically, one batch of medicinals is prepared as a [[decoction]] of about 9 to 18 substances.<ref>"Nach der Erfahrung des Verfassers bewegen sich in der VR China 99% der Rezepturen in einem Bereich zwischen 6 und 20 Kräutern; meist sind es aber zwischen 9 und 18,...

A seen at: Kiessler, (2005), p. 24</ref> Some of these are considered as main herbs, some as ancillary herbs; within the ancillary herbs, up to three categories can be distinguished.<ref>"Innerhalb einer Rezeptur wird grob zwischen Haupt- und Nebenkräuter unterschieden. Bei klassischen Rezepturen existieren sehr genaue Analysen zur Funktion jeder einzelnen Zutat, die bis zu drei Kategorien (''Chen'', ''Zun'' und ''Chi'') von Nebenkräutern differenzieren." ("Regarding the content of the prescription, one can roughly differentiate between main herbs and ancillary herbs. For classical prescriptions, detailed analyses exist for the function of each single ingredient, discriminating between up to three categories (''Chen'', ''Zun'', and ''Chi'') of ancillary herbs.") As seen at: Kiessler (2005), p. 25</ref>

===Raw materials===
There are roughly 13,000 medicinals used in China and over 100,000 medicinal recipes recorded in the ancient literature.<ref name="Certainprogress">Certain progress of clinical research on Chinese integrative medicine, Keji Chen, Bei Yu, Chinese Medical Journal, 1999,  112 (10), p. 934, [http://wenku.baidu.com/view/dfc192a0b0717fd5360cdc44.html]</ref> Plant elements and extracts are by far the most common elements used.<ref name="Foster">Foster & Yue 1992, p.11</ref> In the classic ''Handbook of Traditional Drugs'' from 1941, 517 drugs were listed – out of these, 45 were animal parts, and 30 were minerals.<ref name="Foster" />

====Human body parts====
Traditional Chinese Medicine also includes some human parts: the classic [[Materia medica]] ([[Bencao Gangmu]]) describes the use of 35 human body parts and [[excreta]] in medicines, including bones, fingernail, hairs, dandruff, earwax, impurities on the teeth, feces, urine, sweat, organs, but most are no longer in use.<ref name=HDCM>“Human Drugs” in Chinese Medicine and the Confucian View: An Interpretive Study, Jing-Bao Nie, Confucian Bioethics, 2002, Volume 61, Part III, 167–206, {{doi|10.1007/0-306-46867-0_7}}, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r3371v1625353774/] {{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref><ref name=HBNC>THE HUMAN BODY AS A NEW COMMODITY, Tsuyoshi Awaya, The Review of Tokuyama, June, 1999</ref><ref name=CBSH>Commodifying bodies, Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Loïc J.

===Traditional categorization===
The traditional categorizations and classifications that can still be found today are:
* classification according to the [[Chinese herbology#Four Natures|Four Natures]] (四气, {{zh|p=sì qì}}): hot, warm, cool, or cold (or, neutral in terms of temperature).<ref name="autogenerated3">Ergil et al. 2009, p. 232</ref> Hot and warm herbs are used to treat [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|cold]] diseases, while cool and cold herbs are used to treat [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|heat]] diseases.<ref name=autogenerated3 />
* classification according to the [[Chinese herbology#The Five Tastes|Five Flavors]], (五味, {{zh|p=wǔ wèi}}, sometimes also translated as Five Tastes): acrid, sweet, bitter, sour, and salty.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Substances may also have more than one flavor, or none (i.e., a "bland" flavor).<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Each of the Five Flavors corresponds to one of zàng organs, which in turn corresponds to one of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Five Phases theory|Five Phases]].<ref name=autogenerated2 /> A flavor implies certain properties and therapeutic actions of a substance; e.g., saltiness drains downward and softens hard masses, while sweetness is supplementing, harmonizing, and moistening.<ref name=autogenerated3 />
* classification according to the [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]] – more precise, the zàng-organ including its associated meridian – which can be expected to be primarily affected by a given medicinal.<ref>Ergil et al. 2009, p. 234</ref>
* categorization according to the specific function. These categories mainly include:
** exterior-releasing<ref name="autogenerated7">Xu & Wang 2002, Summary of Contents</ref> or exterior-resolving<ref name="autogenerated5">Ergil et al. 2009, p. 239</ref>

===Efficacy===
Regarding traditional Chinese herbal therapy, only a few trials of adequate methodology exist and its effectiveness therefore remains poorly documented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&db=pubmed&cmd=Search&term=36%5Bvolume%5D%20AND%205%5Bissue%5D%20AND%201086%5Bpage%5D%20AND%202007%5Bpdat%5D|title=Placebo-controlled trials of Chinese herbal medicine and conventional medicine comparative study|author=Shang A. et al.|publisher=PubMed.org for Int.J.Epidemol.|date=29 June 2007|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> A high percentage of relevant studies on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are in Chinese databases.

===Cupping===
{{Main|Cupping therapy}}
[[File:Kyutoshin.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Acupuncture and moxibustion after cupping in Japan]]
[[Fire cupping|Cupping]] (拔罐) is a type of Chinese massage, consisting of placing several glass "cups" (open spheres) on the body. A match is lit and placed inside the cup and then removed before placing the cup against the skin. As the air in the cup is heated, it expands, and after placing in the skin, cools, creating lower pressure inside the cup that allows the cup to stick to the skin via [[suction]]. When combined with massage oil, the cups can be slid around the back, offering "reverse-pressure massage".

It has not been found to be effective for the treatment of any disease.<ref name=acs-cupping>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/manualhealingandphysicaltouch/cupping|title=Cupping|date=November 2008|accessdate=4 October 2013|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]}}</ref>

[[Gua Sha]] is abrading the skin with pieces of smooth jade, bone, animal tusks or horns or smooth stones; until red spots then bruising cover the area to which it is done. It is believed that this treatment is for almost any ailment including cholera. The red spots and bruising take 3 to 10 days to heal, there is often some soreness in the area that has been treated.<ref>Gua Sha, Guasha.com, Arya Nielsen, Fellow – National Academy of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, former Chair of the New York State Board for Acupuncture, [http://www.guasha.com Gua Sha ( Guasha ) Chinese medicine and acupuncture treatment by Arya Nielsen.]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmwell.com/TCMNaturalTherapy/GuashaCupping/GuaSha-Treatment-of-Disease.html |title=GuaSha Treatment of Disease |publisher=Tcmwell.com |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thechifarm.com/legacy/acupuncture_treatment/pdf/gua_sha.pdf |title=Gua Sha: A Clinical Overview, Arya Nielson, Chinese Medicine Times |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref><ref>The effect of Gua Sha treatment on the microcirculation of surface tissue: a pilot study in healthy subjects, A Nielsen, N Knoblauch, GJ Dobos, [http://explorejournal.com/retrieve/pii/S1550830707001772 Elsevier]</ref>

===Die-da===
Diē-dá (跌打) or [[bone-setting]] is usually practiced by martial artists who know aspects of Chinese medicine that apply to the treatment of [[Physical trauma|trauma]] and injuries such as bone fractures, sprains, and bruises. Some of these specialists may also use or recommend other disciplines of Chinese medical therapies (or Western medicine in modern times) if serious injury is involved. Such practice of bone-setting (整骨 or 正骨) is not common in the West.

==Regulations==
Many governments have enacted laws to regulate TCM practice.

===Australia===
From 1 July 2012 Chinese medicine practitioners must be registered under the national registration and accreditation scheme with the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia and meet the Board's Registration Standards, in order to practise in Australia.
<ref>http://www.chinesemedicineboard.gov.au Chinese Medicine Board of Australia</ref>

===Hong Kong===
The Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong was established in 1999. It regulates the medicinals and professional standards for TCM practitioners. All TCM practitioners in Hong Kong are required to register with the Council.

The Traditional and Complementary Medicine Bill was passed by Parliament in 2012 establishing the Traditional and Complementary Medicine Council to register and regulate traditional and complementary medicine practitioners, including traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as well as other traditional and complementary medicine practitioners such as those in traditional Malay medicine and traditional Indian medicine.<ref>{{cite web|title=TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE BILL |url=http://www.parlimen.gov.my/files/billindex/pdf/2012/DR302012E.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Official Portal of Traditional & Complementary Medicine Division, Ministry of Health|url=http://tcm.moh.gov.my/v4/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Official Malaysia Traditional Chinese Medicine Centre|url=http://mineswellnesscity.com/Traditional-Chinese-Medicine.php}}</ref>

===Singapore===
The TCM Practitioners Act was passed by Parliament in 2000 and the TCM Practitioners Board was established in 2001 as a statutory board under the Ministry of Health, to register and regulate TCM practitioners.  The requirements for registration include possession of a diploma or degree from a TCM educational institution/university on a gazetted list, either structured TCM clinical training at an approved local TCM educational institution or foreign TCM registration together with supervised TCM clinical attachment/practice at an approved local TCM clinic, and upon meeting these requirements, passing the Singapore TCM Physicians Registration Examination (STRE) conducted by the TCM Practitioners Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Registration Requirements for the Registration of TCM Physicians|url=http://www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/content/hprof/tcmpb/en/leftnav/registration_requirements.html}}</ref>

===United States===
As of July 2012, only six states do not have existing legislation to regulate the professional practice of TCM. These six states are [[Alabama]], [[Kansas]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Wyoming]]. In 1976, [[California]] established an Acupuncture Board and became the first state licensing professional acupuncturists.<ref>[http://www.acupuncture.ca.gov/pubs_forms/consumer_guide.shtml] California Acupuncture Board</ref>
