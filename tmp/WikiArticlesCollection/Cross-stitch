'''Cross-stitch''' is a popular form of [[counted-thread embroidery|counted-thread]] [[embroidery]] in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, [[raster graphics|raster-like]] pattern are used to form a picture. Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable evenweave fabric called [[aida cloth]]. The stitcher counts the threads in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called '''counted cross-stitch''' in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch. Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric ('''stamped cross-stitch'''); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.

Fabrics used in cross-stitch include aida, linen and mixed-content fabrics called 'evenweave'. All cross stitch fabrics are technically "evenweave", it refers to the fact that the fabric is woven to make sure that there are the same number of threads in an inch both left to right and top to bottom (vertically and horizontally). Fabrics are categorized by threads per inch (referred to as 'count'), which can range from 11 to 40 count. Aida fabric has a lower count because it is made with two threads grouped together for ease of stitching. Cross stitch projects are worked from a gridded pattern and can be used on any count fabric, the count of the fabric determines the size of the finished stitching.

==History==
[[Image:Cross stitch detail.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Detail of floral border pattern in cotton. Tea cloth (small tablecloth), [[Hungary]], mid-twentieth century]]

Cross-stitch is one of the oldest forms of embroidery and can be found all over the world.<ref>Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: ''World Textiles'', Bulfinch Press/Little, Brown, 1999, ISBN 0-8212-2621-5, p. 181</ref> Many folk museums show examples of clothing decorated with cross-stitch, especially from continental [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

Two-dimensional (unshaded) cross-stitch in floral and geometric patterns, usually worked in black and red cotton floss on linen, is characteristic of folk embroidery in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]].<ref>''Threads'' (magazine), Issue 11, June/July 1987</ref>

The cross stitch [[sampler (needlework)|sampler]] is called that because it was generally stitched by a young girl to learn how to stitch and to record alphabet and other patterns to be used in her household sewing. These samples of her stitching could be referred back to over the years. Often, motifs and initials were stitched on household items to identify their owner, or simply to decorate the otherwise-plain cloth. In the United States, the earliest known cross-stitch sampler is currently housed at [[Pilgrim Hall]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/s_sampler.htm Loara Standish Sampler<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The sampler was created by Loara Standish, daughter of Captain [[Myles Standish]] and pioneer of the Leviathan stitch, circa 1653. 

Traditionally, cross-stitch was used to embellish items like household linens, tablecloths, dishcloths, and [[doilies]] (only a small portion of which would actually be embroidered, such as a border). Although there are many cross-stitchers who still employ it in this fashion, it is now increasingly popular to work the pattern on pieces of fabric and hang them on the wall for decoration. Cross stitch is also often used to make greeting cards, pillowtops, or as inserts for box tops, coasters and trivets.

Multicoloured, shaded, painting-like patterns as we know them today are a fairly modern development, deriving from similar shaded patterns of [[Berlin wool work]] of the mid-nineteenth century. Besides designs created expressly for cross stitch, there are software programs that convert a photograph or a fine art image into a chart suitable for stitching. One stunning example of this is in the cross stitched reproduction of the Sistene Chapel charted and stitched by Joanna Lopianowski-Roberts.<ref>http://creativityjourney.blogspot.com/2010/08/sistine-chapel-in-cross-stitch.html</ref><ref>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5634216/Cross-stitch-recreation-of-Sistine-Chapel-ceiling.html</ref>

There are many cross-stitching "[[guilds]]" and groups across the United States and Europe which offer classes, collaborate on large projects, stitch for charity, and provide other ways for local cross-stitchers to get to know one another. Individually owned local needlework shops (LNS) often have stitching nights at their shops, or host weekend stitching retreats.

Today cotton floss is the most common embroidery thread. It is a thread made of [[mercerized cotton]], composed of six strands that are only loosely twisted together and easily separable. While there are other manufacturers, the two most-commonly used (and oldest) brands are DMC [http://www.dmc.com/] and Anchor [http://www.coatsandclark.com/Products/Hand+Embroidery/Threads/], both of which have been manufacturing embroidery floss since the 1800s.<ref>http://www.dmc-usa.com/DMC-History.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.coatsandclark.com/About+Coats/History/Coats+History.htm</ref>

Other materials used are pearl (or perle) cotton, Danish flower thread, [[silk]] and [[Rayon]]. Different wool threads, metallic threads or other novelty threads are also used, sometimes for the whole work, but often for accents and embellishments. Hand-dyed cross stitch floss is created just as the name implies - it is dyed by hand. Because of this, there are variations in the amount of color throughout the thread. Some variations can be subtle, while some can be a huge contrast. Some also have more than one color per thread, which in the right project, creates amazing results.

Cross stitch is widely used in traditional Palestinian dressmaking.[[File:Surif cross-stitch.jpg|thumb|Cross stitch from [[Surif]]. Top half of picture is the reverse side.]]

Other stitches are also often used in cross-stitch, among them ¼, ½, and ¾ stitches and backstitches.

Cross-stitch is often used together with other stitches.  A cross stitch can come in a variety of prostational forms. It is sometimes used in [[crewel embroidery]], especially in its more modern derivatives. It is also often used in [[needlepoint]].

A specialized historical form of embroidery using cross-stitch is [[Assisi embroidery]].

There are many stitches which are related to cross-stitch and were used in similar ways in earlier times. The best known are Italian cross-stitch, [[Celtic Cross Stitch]], [[Irish Cross Stitch]], long-armed cross-stitch, Ukrainian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch. Italian cross-stitch and Montenegrin stitch are reversible, meaning the work looks the same on both sides. These styles have a slightly different look than ordinary cross-stitch. These more difficult stitches are rarely used in mainstream embroidery, but they are still used to recreate historical pieces of embroidery or by the creative and adventurous stitcher.

The double cross-stitch, also known as a Leviathan stitch or Smyrna cross stitch, combines a cross-stitch with an upright cross-stitch.

[[Berlin wool work]] and similar [[petit point]] stitchery resembles the heavily shaded, opulent styles of cross-stitch, and sometimes also used charted patterns on paper.

Cross-stitch is often combined with other popular forms of embroidery, such as [[Hardanger embroidery]] or [[blackwork embroidery]]. Cross-stitch may also be combined with other work, such as [[canvaswork]] or [[drawn thread work]]. [[Beadwork]] and other embellishments such as paillettes, charms, small buttons and speciality threads of various kinds may also be used.

==Recent trends in the UK==
Cross-stitch has become increasingly popular with the younger generation of the [[United Kingdom]] in recent years.<ref>[http://www.crossstitchermagazine.co.uk/page/crossstitch?entry=the_manbroidering_revolution Cross Stitcher<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[Great Recession]] has also seen renewal of interest in home crafts. Retailers such as [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] experienced a 17% rise in sales of haberdashery products between 2009 and 2010.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8224494.stm BBC NEWS | Business | The modern 'make do and mend'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Hobbycraft]], a chain of stores selling craft supplies, also enjoyed an 11% increase in sales over the past year.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7020201/Hobbycraft-sews-up-strong-sales.html Hobbycraft sews up strong sales - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The chain is said{{by whom|date=March 2011}} to have benefited from the "make do and mend" mentality of the credit crisis, which has driven people to make their own cards and gifts.

[[Knitting]] and cross stitching have become more popular hobbies for a younger market, in contrast to its traditional reputation as a hobby for retirees.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/may/29/gender Eithne Farry on the women who are making sewing subversive | Life and style | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sewing and craft groups such as [[Stitch and Bitch London]] have resurrected the idea of the traditional craft club.<ref>[http://www.iknit.org.uk/stitchnbitchday.html I Knit London, the UK's First Official Stitch 'n Bitch Day<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At [[Clothes Show Live]] 2010 there was a new area called "Sknitch" promoting modern sewing, knitting and embroidery.<ref>http://www.clothesshowlive.com/sknitch</ref>

In a departure from the traditional designs associated with cross stitch, there is a current trend for more [[postmodern]] or tongue-in-cheek designs featuring retro images or contemporary sayings.<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/article2440693.ece Why cross-stitch is achingly hip again | The Sun |Features<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is linked to a concept known as 'subversive cross stitch', which involves more risque designs, often fusing the traditional sampler style with sayings designed to shock or be incongruous with the old-fashioned image of cross stitch.

Stitching designs on other materials can be accomplished by using a '''Waste Canvas'''.  This waste canvas is a temporary gridded canvas similar to regular canvas used for embroidery that is held together by a water soluble glue, this is removed after completion of stitch design.
