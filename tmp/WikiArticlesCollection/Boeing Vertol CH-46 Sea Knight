The '''Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight''' is a medium-lift [[tandem rotor]] transport [[helicopter]]. It is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment. Additional tasks include combat support, [[search and rescue]] (SAR), support for forward refueling and rearming points, [[CASEVAC]] and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). The Sea Knight was also the [[U.S. Navy]]'s standard medium-lift utility helicopter until it was phased out in favor of the [[MH-60S Knighthawk]] in the early 2000s.

Canada also operated the Sea Knight, designated as CH-113, and operated them in the SAR role until 2004. Other export customers include Japan, Sweden, and Saudi Arabia. The commercial version is the '''BV 107-II''', commonly referred to simply as the "Vertol".

==Development==

===Origins===
Piasecki Helicopter was a pioneering developer of tandem-rotor helicopters, with the most famous previous helicopter being the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] "Flying Banana". Piasecki Helicopter became [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] in 1955 and work began on a new tandem rotor helicopter designated the ''Vertol Model 107'' or V-107 in 1956. The V-107 prototype had two [[Lycoming T53]] [[turboshaft]] engines, producing 877 shp (640&nbsp;kW) each.<ref name=Apostolo>Apostolo, Giorgio. "Boeing Vertol Model 107". ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters''. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. ISBN 978-0-517-43935-7.</ref> The first flight of the V-107 took place on 22 April 1958.<ref name=Donald_V-107>Donald 1997, p. 175.</ref> The V-107 was then put through a flight demonstration tour in the United States and overseas. In June 1958, the U.S. Army awarded a contract to Vertol for ten production aircraft designated "YHC-1A".<ref name="whirly">Spenser, Jay P. ''Whirlybirds, A History of the U.S. Helicopter Pioneers''.

[[File:Marines CH-46 Helicopter.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines from the [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] prepare to board a CH-46 in August 2006.]]

The order was later decreased to three, so the U.S. Army could divert funds to the V-114, also a turbine powered tandem, but larger than the V-107.<ref name="whirly"/> The Army's three YHC-1As were powered by [[General Electric T58|GE-T-58]] engines. The YHC-1As first flew in August 1959, and were followed by an improved commercial/export model, the 107-II.<ref name="CH-46_hist_USN">[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm CH-46 history page], U.S. Navy, 16 November 2000.</ref> During 1960, the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] evolved a requirement for a twin-turbine troop/cargo assault helicopter to replace the piston engine types then in use. Following a design competition, Boeing Vertol was selected to build its model 107M as the HRB-1, early in 1961.<ref name="CH-46_hist_USN"/> Boeing had acquired Vertol in 1960 and renamed the group [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]].<ref name="whirly"/> In 1962 the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] ordered 12 XCH-46B Sea Knights with the ''XH-49A'' designation. but later cancelled the order due to a delay in the delivery schedule. They opted for the [[Sikorsky S-61R]] instead.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.helis.com/database/modelorg/423/|title= US Air Force CH-46B |publisher= |date= |accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>

The Sea Knight was first procured in 1961 by the U.S. Marine Corps to meet their medium-lift requirements.<ref name="vert_Tandom">"Tandem Twosome", ''Vertical Magazine'', February–March 2007.</ref> Its first flight in August 1962 was followed by a change in designation to CH-46A. Fleet introduction of CH-46As with the Marines and the Navy's UH-46As was in November 1964. The UH-46A variant was modified for use in the vertical replenishment role.<ref name="CH-46_hist_USN"/> The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines rated at 1,250 shp (930&nbsp;kW) each and could carry 17 passengers or 4,000 pounds (1,815&nbsp;kg) of cargo.<ref name="vect_CH-46"/>

===Further developments===
Production of the improved CH-46D followed with deliveries beginning in 1966. Its improvements included modified rotor blades and more powerful T58-GE-10 turboshaft engines<ref name="CH-46_hist_USN"/> rated at {{convert|1400|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. The increased power allowed the D-model to carry 25 troop or {{convert|7000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} of cargo.<ref name="vect_CH-46"/> The CH-46D was introduced to the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam theater]] in late 1967, supplementing the U.S. Marine Corps' existing unreliable and problematic CH-46A fleet.<ref>Rottman and Hook 2007, p. 10.</ref> Along with the USMC's CH-46Ds, the U.S. Navy received a small number of UH-46Ds for ship resupply.<ref name="Eden">Eden, Paul, ed. "Boeing-Vertol H-46 Sea Knight", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. ISBN 1-904687-84-9.</ref> Also, approximately 33 CH-46As were upgraded to CH-46Ds.<ref name="vect_CH-46"/>

[[File:CH-46 Machine Gun.jpg|thumb|right|A door gunner manning a pintle-mounted .50-caliber M2 heavy machine gun aboard a U.S. Marine Corps CH-46 in August 2006.]]

The Marines also received CH-46Fs from 1968 to 1971. The F-model retained the D-model's T58-GE-10 engines but revised the avionics and included other modifications. The CH-46F was the final production model.<ref name="CH-46_hist_USN"/> The Sea Knight has undergone upgrades and modifications. Most of the U.S. Marine Corps' Sea Knights were upgraded to CH-46E standard. The CH-46E features fiberglass rotor blades, airframe reinforcement, and further uprated T58-GE-16 engines producing {{convert|1870|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. Some CH-46Es have been given doubled fuel capacity.<ref name="vect_CH-46"/> The Dynamic Component Upgrade (DCU) incorporated starting in the mid-1990s provides for increased capabilities through strengthened drive systems and rotor controls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The commercial variant, the ''BV 107-II'', was first ordered by [[New York Airways]] in 1960. They took delivery of their first three aircraft, configured for 25 passengers, in July 1962.<ref name="vert_Tandom"/> In 1965, Boeing Vertol sold the manufacturing rights of the 107 to [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. Under this arrangement, all Model 107 civilian and military aircraft [[#Japanese versions|built in Japan]] are known as ''KV 107''.<ref name="vert_Tandom"/> On 15 December 2006, [[Columbia Helicopters, Inc]] acquired the [[type certificate]] for the Boeing Vertol 107-II, and is in the process of acquiring a Production Certificate from the FAA. Plans for actual production of the aircraft have not been announced.<ref name="vert_Tandom"/>

==Design==
[[File:US Navy 020514-M-7364D-002 Exercise Cobra Gold 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A U.S. Marine watches two CH-46 Sea Knights in May 2002.]]

The CH-46 has tandem contrarotating rotors powered by two [[General Electric T58|GE T58]] turboshaft engines. The engines are mounted on each side of the rear rotor pedestal with a driveshaft to the forward rotor. The engines are coupled so either could power both rotors in an emergency. The rotors feature three blades and can be folded for on-ship operations.<ref name="vect_CH-46">[http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html "Boeing Sea Knight"]. Vectorsite.net, 1 August 2011.</ref> The CH-46 has fixed tricycle landing gear, with twin wheels on all three units. The gear configuration causes a nose-up stance to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. The main gear are fitted in rear sponsons that also contain fuel tanks with a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).<ref name="vect_CH-46"/>

The CH-46 has a cargo bay with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for extended cargo or for parachute drops. An internal winch is mounted in the forward cabin and can be used to pull external cargo on pallets into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers. A belly sling hook (cargo hook) which is usually rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}. could be attached for carrying external cargo. Although the hook is rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}., the limited power produced by the engines preclude the lifting of such weight. It usually has a crew of three, but can accommodate a larger crew depending on mission specifics. For example, a Search and Rescue variant will usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such a mission. A pintle-mounted 0.50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine gun is mounted on each side of the helicopter for self-defense.<ref name="vect_CH-46"/> Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of armor with the guns.<ref name="CH-46_hist_USN"/>

==Operational history==

===United States===
[[File:Ch-46e.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines load a simulated casualty onto a CH-46E while conducting convoy operations training in May 2004.]]
Known colloquially as the "Phrog", the Sea Knight has been used in all U.S. Marine combat and peacetime environments since its introduction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boeing Vertol 107 – CH-46 Sea Knight |work=Helicopter History Site |publisher=Helis.com |url=http://www.helis.com/60s/h_h46.php}}</ref> As of 2011, it is still regularly flown by the U.S. Marine Corps, its longevity as a reliable airframe has led to such mantras as "phrogs phorever" and "never trust a helicopter under 30".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask A Marine|publisher=HMM-364 Purple Foxy Ladies |url=http://www.purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html}}</ref>

CH-46E Sea Knights were used by the U.S. Marine Corps during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. CH-46Es transported personnel, brought supplies to forward arming and refueling points (FARP), carried ammunition and various tasks. Marine CH-46Es and CH-53Es carried U.S. Army Rangers and Special Operations troops in a mission to extract captured Army Private [[Jessica Lynch]] from an Iraqi hospital on 1 April 2003.<ref>Stout, Jay A. ''Hammer from Above, Marine Air Combat Over Iraq''. Ballantine Books, 2005. ISBN 978-0-89141-871-9.</ref>

While the United States Navy retired the airframe on 24 September 2004, replacing it with the [[SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60S Knighthawk]],<ref name="Navy Swan song">{{cite web|last = Crawley|first=James W.|title=Swan song for Navy's ugly-duckling copter |publisher=SignonSanDiego.com |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040924/news_2m24phrog.html}}</ref> the Marine Corps plans to maintain its fleet until the [[V-22 Osprey|MV-22]] is fully fielded.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Major Acquisition Programs – Aviation Combat Element Programs |publisher=Headquarters Marine Corps |year=2006 |url=http://hqinet001.hqmc.usmc.mil/p&r/concepts/2006/PDF/Chapter%203/Part%203/C&P2006Chap3Part3AviationCombatElementPg188-190MV-22%20Osprey.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> In March 2006 Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 263 (HMM-263) was deactivated and redesignated [[VMM-263]] to serve as the first MV-22 squadron.<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=LCpl Samuel |title=VMM-263 ready to write next chapter in Osprey program |publisher=U.S. Marine Corps |url=http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/0/217128503734FF2B8525712A004D67BC?opendocument}}</ref> The replacement process is expected to continue through the other medium helicopter squadrons into 2014.

===Canada===
The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] procured six CH-113 Labrador helicopters for the SAR role and the [[Canadian Army]] acquired 12 of the similar '''CH-113A Voyageur''' for the medium-lift transport role. The RCAF Labradors were delivered first with the first one entering service on 11 October 1963.<ref name="Milberry">Milberry, Larry: ''Sixty Years – The RCAF and Air Command 1924–1984'', p. 472. McGraw Hill Ryerson, 1984.

The refurbished Voyageurs were re-designated as CH-113A Labradors, thus a total of 15 Labradors were ultimately in service.<ref name="CAM" />

[[File:BoeingVertolCH-113Labrador11301-01.JPG|thumb|left|CH-113 Labrador 11301 showing its rear ramp]]

The Labrador was fitted with a watertight hull for marine landings, a 5,000 kilogram cargo hook and an external rescue hoist mounted over the right front door. It featured an 1,110 kilometer flying range, emergency medical equipment and an 18 person passenger capacity. By the 1990s, heavy use and hostile weather conditions had taken their toll on the Labrador fleet, resulting in increasing maintenance costs and the need for prompt replacement.<ref name="CAM" /> In 1981, a mid-life upgrade of the fleet was carried out by [[Boeing Canada]] in [[Arnprior, Ontario]]. Known as the SAR-CUP (Search and Rescue Capability Upgrade Program), the refit scheme included new instrumentation, a nose-mounted weather radar, tail-mounted auxiliary power unit, a new high-speed rescue hoist mounted over the side door and front-mounted searchlights. A total of six CH-113s and five CH-113As were upgraded with the last delivered in 1984.<ref name="CAM" />

In 1992 it was announced that the Labradors were to be replaced by 15 new helicopters, a variant of the [[AgustaWestland EH101]], designated ''CH-149 Chimo''. The order was subsequently cancelled by the [[Jean Chrétien]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government in 1993, resulting in cancellation penalties, as well as extending the service life of the Labrador fleet. However, in 1998, a CH-113 from [[CFB Greenwood]] crashed on Quebec's [[Gaspé Peninsula]] while returning from a SAR mission, resulting in the deaths of all crewmembers on board. The crash placed pressure upon the government to procure a replacement, thus an order was placed with the manufacturers of the EH101 for 15 aircraft to perform the search-and-rescue mission, designated ''[[CH-149 Cormorant]]''. CH-149 deliveries began in 2003, allowing the last CH-113 to be retired in 2004.<ref name="CAM" /> In October 2005 [[Columbia Helicopters]] of [[Portland, Oregon]] purchased eight of the retired CH-113 Labradors to add to their fleet of 15 Vertol 107-II helicopters.<ref>{{cite web |title = Columbia Helicopters Acquires eight CH-113 Labrador helicopters from Canadian military |work = RotorHub |publisher = RotorHub.com |date = | url = http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&ID=c186be12-8152-418b-9b56-ec198753da2e |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071222234834/http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&ID=c186be12-8152-418b-9b56-ec198753da2e |archivedate = 22 December 2007 |accessdate = 5 December 2010 }}</ref>

=== Sweden ===
In 1963, Sweden procured 10 UH-46B from the US as a transport and anti-submarine helicopter for the Swedish armed forces, designated Hkp4A. In 1973, a further 8 Kawasaki-built KV-107, which were accordingly designated Hkp4B, were acquired to replace the older [[Piasecki H-21]]. During the Cold War, the fleet's primary missions were anti-submarine warfare and troop transportation, they were also frequently employed in the search and rescue role. In the 1980s, the Hkp4A was phased out, having been replaced by the [[Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma]]; the later Kawasaki-built Sea Knights continued in operational service until 2011, they were replaced by the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]].

===Civilian===
[[File:P2CHE.jpg|thumb|Columbia Helicopters BV 107-II]]

The civilian version, designated as the BV 107-II ''Vertol'',<ref name="vert_Columbia">Eichel, Garth. "Columbia Helicopters". ''Vertical Magazine'', February–March 2007.</ref> was developed prior to the military CH-46. It was operated commercially by [[New York Airways]], [[Pan American World Airways]] and later on by [[Columbia Helicopters]].<ref name="vert_Columbia"/> In December 2006, Columbia Helicopters purchased the [[type certificate]] of the Model 107 from Boeing, with the aim of eventually producing new-build aircraft themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Type Certificate Data Sheet No. 1H16 |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|date=17 January 2007 |url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgMakeModel.nsf/0/FA4E77BC4812A0258625726B00663586/$FILE/1H16.pdf|format=.pdf |accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>
