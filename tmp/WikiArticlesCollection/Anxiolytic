An '''anxiolytic''' (also '''antipanic''' or '''antianxiety agent''')<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100020674|antianxiety agent}}</ref> is a drug that inhibits [[anxiety]]. This effect is in contrast to [[anxiogenic]] agents, which increase anxiety.  Together these categories of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compounds may be referred to as [[anxiotropic]] compounds. Some [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] like [[alcoholic beverage]]s (which contain [[ethanol]]) induce anxiolysis. Anxiolytic [[medication]]s have been used for the treatment of [[anxiety]] and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Anxiolytics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]]s.

[[Beta-receptor blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] and [[oxprenolol]], although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the [[somatic]] symptoms of anxiety.

Anxiolytics are also known as '''minor [[tranquilizer]]s'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anxiolytic+tranquilizer|title=anxiolytic (tranquilizer)|work=Memidex (WordNet) Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> The term is less common in modern texts, and was originally derived from a dichotomy with [[major tranquilizer]]s, also known as [[neuroleptics]] or [[antipsychotics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Types of anxiolytics/anti-anxiety drugs==

===Medications===

====Benzodiazepines====
{{Main|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term relief of severe and disabling anxiety. Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[sedation]] is needed. Longer-term uses include treatment for severe anxiety. There is a risk of a [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[rebound syndrome]] after continuous usage for longer than two weeks, and tolerance and dependence may occur if patients stay under this treatment for longer.<ref>Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp236.</ref> There is also the added problem of the accumulation of drug [[metabolite]]s and adverse effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lader M, Tylee A, Donoghue J |title=Withdrawing benzodiazepines in primary care |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19062773 |doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00002 |url=}}</ref> Benzodiazepines include:

* [[Alprazolam]] (Xanax)
* [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium)
* [[Clonazepam]] (Klonopin, Rivotril)
* [[Diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[Etizolam]] (Etilaam) (Actually a benzodiazepine structural analog where the benzene ring has been replaced by a thiophene ring.)
* [[Lorazepam]] (Ativan)
* [[Oxazepam]] (Serax)

Benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage. At higher dosage [[hypnotic]] properties occur.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Montenegro M, Veiga H, Deslandes A |title=[Neuromodulatory effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): a comparative study.] |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=63 |issue=2B |pages=410–5 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=16059590 |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0004-282X2005000300009&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en}}</ref>

* [[Tofisopam]] (Emandaxin and Grandaxin) is a drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties, but, unlike other benzodiazepines, it does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing, or amnestic properties.

====Serotonergic antidepressants====

''' Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors''' or '''serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor'''<ref name="BARLOW">{{cite book |author=Barlow, David H. Durand, V. Mark |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |edition=Fifth |page=239 |chapter=Chapter 7: Mood Disorders and Suicide |isbn=0-495-09556-7 |oclc=192055408 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2009}}</ref> ('''SSRIs''') are a class of compounds typically used as [[antidepressant]]s in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, and some [[personality disorder]]s. SSRIs are primarily classified as antidepressants and typically higher dosages are required to be effective against [[anxiety disorders]] than to be effective against depression; nevertheless, most SSRIs have anxiolytic properties. They can, however, be [[anxiogenic]] early on in the course of treatment due to negative feedback through the serotonergic [[autoreceptors]]. For this reason in some individuals a low dose concurrent benzodiazepine therapy might be beneficial during the early stages of serotonergic therapy to counteract the initial anxiogenic effects current serotonergics antidepressants have.

Older [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) are anxiolytic too; however, their side effects are often more severe in nature. Examples include imipramine, doxepin, amitriptyline, and the unrelated trazodone. [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) are very effective for anxiety, but due to drug dangers, are rarely prescribed. Examples include: [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]].

====Adaptol====
'''[[Adaptol]]''' (Mebicarum / Mebicar) is an anxiolytic produced in [[Latvia]] and used in Eastern Europe. Mebicar has an effect on the structure of limbic-reticular activity, particularly on [[hypothalamus]] emotional zone, as well as on all 4 basic neuromediator systems –  [[gamma-aminobutyric_acid|γ aminobutyric acid]] (GABA), [[choline]], [[serotonin]] and adrenergic activity. Mebicar decreases the brain noradrenaline level, exerts no effect on the dopaminergic systems, increases the brain serotonin level, and does not elicit cholinolytic action.

====Afobazole====

'''[[Afobazole]]''' is an anxiolytic drug launched in Russia in the early 2000s. It produces anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects without any sedative or muscle relaxant actions, making it more selective in action than many currently used drugs for this application. Its mechanism of action remains poorly defined however, with GABAergic, NGF and BDNF release promoting, MT1 receptor antagonism, MT3 receptor antagonism, and sigma agonism all thought to have some involvement. Clinical trials have shown afobazole to be well tolerated and reasonably effective for the treatment of anxiety, although it has yet to be introduced into widespread clinical use outside of Russia. The compound has not been evaluated by the FDA. It is unscheduled in the US and is legal to import by private citizens for personal use.

====Selank====

'''[[Selank]]''' (Russian: Cеланк) is a nootropic, anxiolytic peptide based drug developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian academy of sciences. Selank is a heptapeptide with the sequence Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro. It is a synthetic analogue of a human tetrapeptide tuftsin. As such, it mimics many of its effects. It has been shown to modulate the expression of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and affect the balance of T helper cell cytokines. It has been shown to influence the concentration of monoamine neurotransmitters and induce metabolism of serotonin. There is evidence that it may also modulate the expression of Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in rats.

====Bromantane====

'''[[Bromantane]]''' is a stimulant drug with anxiolytic properties developed in Russia during the late 1980s, which acts mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin in the brain, although it also has anticholinergic effects at very high doses. Study results suggest that the combination of psychostimulant and anxiolytic actions in the spectrum of psychotropic activity of bromantane is effective in treating asthenic disorders compared to placebo. The absence of "withdrawal syndrome" demonstrated a lack of addictive potential in this drug. It is considered novel having both stimulant and anti-anxiety properties.

====Tenoten====
'''[[Tenoten]]''' is a Russian anxiolytic and [[antidepressant]] based on antibodies to brain-specific protein S-100B. [[S100 proteins]] are small calcium-binding proteins interacting with numerous intra- and extra cellular targets involved in diverse physiological functions. In particular, S100 proteins may be involved in the regulation of anxiety-related behavior

====Mexidol====

'''[[Mexidol]]''' ([[Emoxypine]]) is an [[antioxidant]] that is useful as an anxiolytic medication with few side effects (i.e. no sedation, impairment, tolerance or addition potential) compared to benzodiazepines. Its chemical structure resembles that of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B6).

====Azapirones====

Azapirones are a class of [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]] [[agonist]]s.  Currently approved azapirones include [[buspirone]] (Buspar) and [[tandospirone]] (Sediel). [[Gepirone]] (Ariza, Variza) is also in [[clinical development]].

====Barbiturates====
{{Main|Barbiturate}}

[[Barbiturate]]s exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia, though only after benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines have failed. They are rarely prescribed any more.

====Hydroxyzine====
[[Hydroxyzine]] (Atarax) is an old [[antihistamine]] originally approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1956. It possesses anxiolytic properties in addition to its antihistamine properties and is also licensed for the treatment of anxiety and tension. It is also used for its sedative properties as a premed before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm|title= hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax)|accessdate= 17 May 2008|author= medicine net|publisher= medicinenet.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080513104646/http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm| archivedate= 13 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It has been shown to be as effective as [[benzodiazepines]] in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], while producing fewer side-effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Llorca PM, Spadone C, Sol O |title=Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–7 |year=2002 |month=November |pmid=12444816 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v63n1112|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/privatepdf/2002/v63n11/v63n1112.pdf}}</ref>

====Pregabalin====
[[Pregabalin]]'s therapeutic effect appears after 1 week of use and is similar in effectiveness to [[lorazepam]], [[alprazolam]], and [[venlafaxine]], but pregabalin has demonstrated superiority by producing more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and, in addition, unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt [[sleep architecture]] and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment; it also has a low potential for abuse and dependence and may be preferred over the benzodiazepines for these reasons.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bandelow | first1 = B. | last2 = Wedekind | first2 = D. | last3 = Leon | first3 = T. | title = Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a novel pharmacologic intervention. | journal = Expert Rev Neurother | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 769–81 | month = Jul | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1586/14737175.7.7.769 | pmid = 17610384 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = RT. | title = Pregabalin: its efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in generalized anxiety. | journal = Drugs Today (Barc) | volume = 43 | issue = 9 | pages = 601–10 | month = Sep | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1358/dot.2007.43.9.1133188 | pmid = 17940637 }}</ref>

====Validol====
Sublingual administration of [[Validol]] produces a sedative effect, and has moderate reflex and vascular dilative action caused by stimulation of sensory nerve receptors of the oral mucosa followed by the release of endorphins. Validol is typically administered ''as needed'' for symptom relief.<ref>The Great Soviet Encyclopedia http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Validol</ref><ref>Farmak Product Information - Validol http://farmak.ua/assets_images/drugs/instruction/en/25/Validol_Product_Information.pdf</ref><ref>Itop Doctor http://doctor.itop.net/DirectoryItem.aspx?DirId=1&ItemId=268</ref>

====Herbal treatments====
Certain natural substances are reputed to have anxiolytic properties, including the following:

===Over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs===
[[Picamilon]] is a [[prodrug]] formed by combining [[niacin]] with [[GABA]] that is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and is then hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin. It is theorized that the GABA released in this process activates [[GABA receptors]], with potential to produce an anxiolytic response.<ref name="pmid2884549">{{cite journal

Picamilon is sold in the United States as a dietary supplement, while in Russia it is sold as a prescription drug.

[[Chlorpheniramine]] (Chlor-Trimeton)<ref>Psychopharmacology (Berl). 2009 Oct 13;{{doi|10.1007/s00213-009-1695-0}} http://www.anxietyinsights.info/abstract_chlorpheniramine_exerts_anxiolyticlike_effects_an.htm</ref> and [[Diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl) have [[hypnotic]] and [[sedative]] effects with mild anxiolytic-like properties ([[off-label use]]). These drugs are approved by the FDA for [[allergy|allergies]], [[rhinitis]], and [[urticaria]].

[[Melatonin]] has anxiolytic properties, likely mediated by the [[benzodiazepine]]/[[GABAergic]] system.<ref>Pierrefiche G, Zerbib R, Laborit H. (1993). "Anxiolytic activity of melatonin in mice: involvement of benzodiazepine receptors". ''Res Commun Chem Pathol Pharmacol.'' 82(2):131-42. PMID 7905658</ref> It has been used experimentally as an effective premedicant for general anesthesia in surgical procedures.<ref>Naguib M, Gottumukkala V, Goldstein PA. (2007). "Melatonin and anesthesia: a clinical perspective." ''J Pineal Res.'' 42(1):12-21. PMID 17198534</ref>

===Future drugs===
Due to deficits with existing anxiolytics (either in terms of efficacy or side-effect profile), research into novel anxiolytics is active. Possible candidates for future drugs include:

* [[BNC210]]
* [[CL-218,872]]
* [[L-838,417]]
* [[SL-651,498]]
* [[aloradine]]

===Common drugs===
Prescription-free drugs are often poor anxiolytics and often worsen the symptoms over time{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. However, they are often used for self-medication because of their wide availability (e.g. alcoholic beverages).

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Short-term effects of alcohol}}

Ethanol is used as an anxiolytic, sometimes by [[self-medication]]. [[fMRI]] can measure the anxiolytic effects of alcohol in the human brain.<ref>Society for Neuroscience, [http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/18/4583.full.pdf PDF] {{Full|date=March 2013}}</ref>  The [[British National Formulary]] states, "Alcohol is a poor hypnotic because its [[diuretic]] action interferes with [[sleep]] during the latter part of the night." Alcohol is also known to induce alcohol-related [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref>http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa41.htm</ref>

====Inhalants====
{{see also|Inhalant abuse#Patterns of non-medical usage|Street children in Latin America#Drugs}}

The anxiolytic effects of solvents act as positive modulators of GABAA receptors (Bowen and colleagues 2006).<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188822/</ref>

Inhalants are commonly used as anxiolytics by street children in Latin America, Africa, and Asia but also by impoverished indigenous communities.
