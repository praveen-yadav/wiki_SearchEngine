In [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|myth]], '''Demeter''' ({{IPAc-en|d|i|ˈ|m|iː|t|ər|}}; [[Attic Greek|Attic]] {{lang|grc|Δημήτηρ}} ''Dēmētēr''. [[Doric Greek|Doric]]  {{lang|grc|Δαμάτηρ}} ''Dāmātēr'') is the goddess of the harvest, who presided over [[grain]]s and the [[fertility]] of the earth. Her cult titles include Sito ({{lang|grc|σίτος}}: wheat) as the giver of food or corn/grain<ref>[[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], scholia on [[Homer]], 265.</ref> and [[Thesmophoria|Thesmophoros]] ({{lang|grc|θεσμός}}, ''thesmos'': divine order, unwritten law) as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society.<ref name=Finley78>[[Themis]] was an ancient Greek goddess, embodiment of divine order, law. She was the organizer of the communal affairs and she evoked the social order: Finley, ''The World of Odysseus'', rev. ed. Viking Press. (1978:78 note 82)</ref>

Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sanctity of [[marriage]], the [[religious law|sacred law]], and the cycle of [[life expectancy|life and death]]. She and her daughter [[Persephone]] were the central figures of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] that predated the [[Olympian pantheon]]. In the [[Linear B]] [[Mycenean Greek]] tablets of circa 1400–1200 BC found at [[Pylos]], the "two mistresses and the king" may be related with Demeter, Persephone and [[Poseidon]].<ref>[[John Chadwick]], ''The Mycenean World''.

== Etymology ==

[[File:Didrachme de l'île de Paros.jpg|thumb|left|[[Greek drachma|Didrachme]] from Paros island, struck at the [[Cyclades]] and representing Demeter]]
Demeter's character as [[mother-goddess]] is identified in the second element of her name ''meter'' ({{lang|grc|μήτηρ}}) derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*méh₂tēr'' (mother).<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mother Online Etymology Dictionary "mother"]</ref> In antiquity, different explanations were already proffered for the first element of her name. It is possible that ''Da'' ({{lang|grc|Δᾶ}}) (which became Attic ''Ge'' ({{lang|grc|Γῆ}})) is the Doric form of ''De'' ({{lang|grc|Δῆ}}), "earth", the old name of the [[chthonic]] earth-goddess, and that Demeter is "Mother-Earth".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Demeter Online Etymology Dictionary "Demeter"]</ref> This root also appears in the [[Linear B]] inscription ''E-ne-si-da-o-ne'', "earth-shaker", as an aspect of the god [[Poseidon]].<ref>[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/mycen.html Adams, John Paul, ''Mycenean divinities''] List of handouts for California State University Classics 315, retrieved 7 March 2011.</ref> However, the ''dā'' element is not so simply equated with "earth" according to [[John Chadwick]].<ref>Chadwick, ''The Mycenaean World'', Cambridge University Press, 1976, p. 87) "Every Greek was aware of the maternal functions of Demeter; if her name bore the slightest resemblance to the Greek word for 'mother', it would inevitably have been deformed to emphasize that resemblance. [...] How did it escape transformation into ''*Gāmātēr'', a name transparent to any Greek speaker?"  Compare the Latin transformation ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]'' and ''Diespiter'' vis-a-vis ''*Deus pater''.</ref>

The element ''De''- may be connected with ''Deo'', a surname of Demeter<ref>[[Orphic Hymn]] 40 to Demeter (translated by Thomas Taylor: "O universal mother Deo famed, august, the source of wealth and various names".</ref> probably derived from the Cretan word ''dea'' ({{lang|grc|δηά}}), Ionic ''zeia'' ({{lang|grc|ζειά}}) meaning "barley", so that she is the Corn-Mother and the giver of food generally.<ref>Martin Nilsson, ''Geschichte der Griechischen Religion'', vol. I (Verlag C.H.Beck) pp 461-462.</ref>  Arcadian cult to Demeter links her to a male deity (Greek: Πάρεδρος, ''Paredros''), who accompanied the [[Great Goddess (disambiguation)|Great Goddess]] and has been interpreted as a possible substitution for [[Poseidon]]; Demeter may therefore be related to a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]  [[Great Goddess (disambiguation)|Great Goddess]].<ref>Nilsson, 1967:444</ref>

An alternative, Proto-Indo-European etymology comes through [[Potnia]] and [[Despoina]]; where ''Des-'' represents a derivative of [[PIE]] ''*dem'' (house, dome), and Demeter is "mother of the house" (from [[PIE]] ''*dems-méh₂tēr'').<ref>Frisk, ''Griechisches Etymological Woerterbuch.'' Entry 1271</ref>

== Agricultural deity==
According to the Athenian [[rhetorician]] [[Isocrates]], Demeter's greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture, particularly of cereals, and the Mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife.<ref>[[Isocrates]], ''Panegyricus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Isoc.+4+27 4.28]: "When Demeter came to our land, in her wandering after the rape of Kore, and, being moved to kindness towards our ancestors by services which may not be told save to her initiates, gave these two gifts, the greatest in the world — the fruits of the earth, which have enabled us to rise above the life of the beasts, and the holy rite, which inspires in those who partake of it sweeter hopes regarding both the end of life and all eternity".</ref> These two gifts were intimately connected in Demeter's myths and mystery cults. In Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' she is the blond-haired goddess who separates the chaff from the grain.<ref>''[[Odyssey]]'' 5.499</ref> In Hesiod, prayers to [[Zeus]]-Chthonios ([[chthonic]] Zeus) and Demeter help the crops grow full and strong.<ref>[[Hesiod]] ''Works and Days'', 465</ref> Demeter's emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Graves|first=Robert|title=Greek Gods and Heroes|publisher=Dell Laurel-Leaf|year=1960}}</ref>

In [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]], Demeter is the daughter of [[Cronus]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]. At the marriage of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], Demeter lured [[Iasion]] away from the other revelers. They had intercourse in a [[Ridge and furrow|ploughed furrow]] in [[Crete]], and she gave birth to a son, [[Plutus|Ploutos]].<ref>''Odyssey'' 5.125; [[Theogony]] 969 ff.</ref> Her daughter by Zeus was [[Persephone]], Queen of the Underworld.<ref>Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+912&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 912]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D2 ''Homeric Hymn to Demeter'' (2)]; Pausnias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.%208.37.9&lang=original 8.37.9]</ref>

== Festivals and cults ==
{{Main|Eleusinian Mysteries|Thesmophoria}}
Demeter's two major festivals were [[sacred mysteries]]. Her [[Thesmophoria]] festival (11–13 October) was women-only.<ref>Benko, Stephen, ''The virgin goddess: studies in the pagan and Christian roots of mariology,'' BRILL, 2004, note 111 on pp. 63 - 4, and p. 175.</ref> Her [[Eleusinian mysteries]] were open to initiates of any gender or social class. At the heart of both festivals were myths concerning Demeter as Mother and [[Persephone]] as her daughter.

==Myths==
===Demeter and Persephone ===<!-- link to section heading from article Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, section 'Regeneration'. -->
[[File:Demeter in horse chariot w daughter kore 83d40m wikiC Tempio Y di Selinunte sec VIa.JPG|thumb|Demeter drives her horse-drawn chariot containing her daughter [[Persephone|Persephone-Kore]] at Selinunte, Sicily 6th century BC.]]
Demeter's virgin daughter Persephone was abducted to the underworld by [[Hades]]. Demeter [[Agelasta|searched for her]] ceaselessly, preoccupied with her loss and her grief. The seasons halted; living things ceased their growth, then began to die.<ref>Karl Kerenyi, ''The Gods of the Greeks,'' 1951, pp.232 - 41 and notes 784 - 98.</ref> Faced with the extinction of all life on earth, [[Zeus]] sent his messenger [[Hermes]] to the underworld to bring Persephone back. [[Hades]] agreed to release her, but gave her a pomegranate. When she ate the pomegranate seeds, she was bound to him for one third of the  year, either the dry Mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought,<ref>As in Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard, 1985) p. 160.</ref> or the autumn and winter.<ref>As in [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]<!--a reference is still missing--></ref>  There are several variations on the basic myth. In the [[Homeric hymn]] to Demeter, [[Hecate]] assists in the search and later becomes Persephone's underworld attendant.<ref>[http://www.uh.edu/~cldue/texts/demeter.html Homer Hymn to Demeter, trans. Gregory Nagy, lines 50 - 60, 438 - 440.]</ref> In another, Persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive Hades, but is discovered and made to stay. In all versions, Persephone's time in the underworld corresponds with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient [[Greek calendar]], and her return to the [[Upper World (Greek)|upper world]] with springtime. Demeter's descent to retrieve Persephone from the underworld is connected to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].

Demeter and her daughter '''Persephone''' were usually called:<ref>Martin Nilsson (1967) ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'' pp.463, 477</ref>
*'''The goddesses''', often distinguished as "the older" and "the younger" in [[Eleusis]].
*'''Demeters''', in [[Rhodes]] and [[Sparta]]
*'''The thesmophoroi''', "the legislators" in the [[Thesmophoria]].
*'''The Great Goddesses''', in [[Arcadia]].
*'''The mistresses''' in [[Arcadia]].<ref name=Pausanias515>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].''Description of Greece'' 5.15.4, 5, 6</ref>
In [[Mycenaean civilization|Mycenaean]] [[Pylos]], Demeter and Persephone were probably called  "queens" (wa-na-ssoi). <ref name=Mylonas159/>

The myth of the capture of Persephone seems to be pre-Greek. In the Greek version Ploutos (πλούτος, wealth) represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars (''pithoi''). Similar subterranean ''pithoi'' were used in ancient times for funerary practices is fused with Persephone, the Queen of the underworld. At the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields she ascends and is reunited with her mother Demeter, for at this time the old crop and the new meet each other.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com|cla|gpr Martin Nilsson, ''Greek Popular Religion.'' ] pp 48-50</ref>

According to the personal mythology of [[Robert Graves]],<ref>Graves' work on Greek myth was often criticized; see [[The White Goddess#Criticism]] and [[The Greek Myths#Reception|The Greek Myths]].</ref> Persephone is not only the younger self of Demeter,<ref>The idea that Kore (the maiden) is not Demeter's daughter, but Demeter's own younger self, was discussed much earlier than Graves, in [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] (1896), [http://books.google.com/books?id=FKVEsNO6wFYC&pg=PA121&lpg=PP121#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''The Cults of the Greek States'', volume 3, p.121.]</ref> she is in turn also one of three guises of the [[Triple deity|Triple Goddess]] — Kore (the youngest, the maiden, signifying green young grain), Persephone (in the middle, the nymph, signifying the ripe grain waiting to be harvested), and Hecate (the eldest of the three, the crone, the harvested grain), which to a certain extent reduces the name and role of Demeter to that of group name. Before her abduction, she is called Kore; and once taken she becomes Persephone ('she who brings destruction').<ref>Graves, Robert. ''The Greek Myths''. Penguin, 1990. ISBN 0-14-001026-2. 24. pp.94–95.</ref>

=== Demeter at Eleusis ===
[[File:Eleusis2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian trio]]: [[Persephone]], [[Triptolemos]], and Demeter, on a marble [[bas-relief]] from [[Eleusis]], 440–430 BC]]

Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone took her to the palace of [[Celeus]], the King of [[Eleusis]] in [[Attica, Greece|Attica]]. She assumed the form of an old woman, and asked him for shelter. He took her in, to nurse [[Demophon of Eleusis|Demophon]] and [[Triptolemus]], his sons by [[Metanira]]. To reward his kindness, she planned to make Demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with [[ambrosia]] and laid him in the flames of the hearth, to gradually burn away his mortal self. But Metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. Demeter abandoned the attempt. Instead, she taught Triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he in turn taught them to any who wished to learn them. Thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain. The myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as [[Eleusis (mythology)|Eleusis]], [[Rarus]] and [[Trochilus (mythology)|Trochilus]]. The Demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale.<ref>Nilsson (1940), p. 50: "The Demophon<!--Demophoon?--> story in Eleusis is based on an older folk-tale motif which has nothing to do with the Eleusinian Cult. It is introduced in order to let Demeter reveal herself in her divine shape".</ref>

===Demeter and Poseidon <!-- This section is linked from [[Epona]]; if changing this heading, change it there -->===
Demeter and [[Poseidon]]'s names appear in the earliest scratched notes in [[Linear B]] found at [[Mycenae]] and Mycenaean [[Pylos]]. E-ne-si-da-o-ne (earth-shaker) for Poseidon, and Si-to po-ti-ni-ja, who is probably related with Demeter.<ref>George Mylonas (1966), "Mycenae and the Mycenean world ". p.159. Princeton University Press</ref>
 
In the myths of isolated [[Arcadia]] in southern Greece, [[Despoina]], is daughter of Demeter and [[Poseidon]] ''Hippios''. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the [[Bronze age]]. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter who obviously originally had the form or the shape of a mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with the mistress of the animals [[Artemis]], the goddess of Nymphs.

Demeter as mare-goddess was pursued by Poseidon, and hid from him among the horses of King [[Onkios]], but could not conceal her divinity. In the form of a stallion, Poseidon caught and covered her. Demeter was furious ([[erinys]]) at Poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she is known as Demeter Erinys. But she washed away her anger in the River [[Ladon (river)|Ladon]], becoming ''Demeter Lousia'', the "bathed Demeter".<ref>Other ritually bathed goddesses were Argive [[Hera]] and [[Cybele]]; [[Aphrodite]] renewed her own powers bathing herself in the sea.</ref> "In her alliance with Poseidon," [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Gods of the Greeks'', 1951:185.</ref> "she was [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]], who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of [[grain]] or a mare." She bore a daughter [[Despoina]] ({{lang|grc|Δέσποινα}}: the "Mistress"), whose name should not be uttered outside the Arcadian [[Sacred mysteries|Mysteries]],<ref>"In Arcadia she was also a second goddess in the Mysteries of her daughter, the unnameable, who was invoked only as 'Despoina', the 'Mistress'" ([[Karl Kerenyi]], ''Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter''(Princeton University Press) 1967:31f, instancing Pausanias, viii.37.9.</ref> and a horse named [[Arion (mythology)|Arion]], with a black mane and tail.

In [[Arcadia]], Demeter's mare-form was worshiped into historical times. Her ''[[xoanon]]'' of Phigaleia shows how the local cult interpreted her: a Medusa type with a horse's head with snaky hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, probably representing her power over air and water.<ref>L. H. Jeffery (1976). ''Archaic Greece: The Greek city states c.800-500 B.C'' (Ernest Benn Limited) p 23 ISBN 0-510-03271-0</ref>

{{Quotation|The second mountain, Mt. Elaios, is about 30 stades from [[Phigalia|Phigaleia]], and has a cave sacred to Demeter Melaine ["Black"]... the Phigalians say, they accounted the cave sacred to Demeter, and set up a [[Xoanon|wooden image]] in it. The image was made in the following fashion: it was seated on a rock, and was like a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head and hair of a horse, and serpents and other beasts grew out of her head. Her [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]] reached right to her feet, and she held a dolphin in one hand, a dove in the other. Why they made the ''[[xoanon]]'' like this should be clear to any intelligent man who is versed in tradition. They say they named her Black because the goddess wore black clothing. However, they cannot remember who made this xoanon or how it caught fire; but when it was destroyed the Phigalians gave no new image to the goddess and largely neglected her festivals and sacrifices, until finally barrenness fell upon the land.|[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]| Description of Greece ''8.42.1ff.}}

<!--much of this is duplicative and uneditable:===Corn-Mother and Mother-Earth===
In epic poetry and [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Demeter is the Corn-Mother, the goddess of cereals who provides grain for bread and blesses its harvesters. This was her main function at [[Eleusis]], and became panhellenic. In [[Cyprus]], "grain-harvesting" was ''damatrizein''. The main theme in the [[Eleusinian]] mysteries was the reunion of [[Persephone]] with her mother Demeter, when new crops were reunited with the old seed, a form of eternity. However, some cults interpreted Demeter as Mother Earth. At Phigaleia in [[Arcadia]], she was represented as an archaised [[Medusa]] type, horse-headed and snake-haired, holding a dove and dolphin, perhaps to symbolize her power over air and water. In the cult of Flya, she was worshiped as [[Anesidora]] (one who sends up gifts from the underworld) and in Sparta as Demeter-Chthonia ([[chthonic]] Demeter).<ref>[[Pausanias]] I 31,4- III 14,5</ref> This can explain the name Demetrioi that the Athenians gave to the dead, and probably reflects an ancient cult of the dead, linked to the agrarian-belief that a new life would sprout from the dead body, as a new plant arises from buried seed. This was probably a belief shared by initiates in Demeter's mysteries, as interpreted by [[Pindar]]: "Happy is he who has seen what exists under the earth, because he knows not only the end of life, but also his beginning that the Gods will give". In antiquity Demeter was also ''zeidoros arοura'', the Homeric "Mother Earth [[arura|arοura]]" who gave the gift of cereals (''zeai'' or ''deai'').<ref>Martin Nilsson, (1967), ''Die Geschichte der Griechische Religion'', C.F.Beck Verlag Munchen,  pp 462, 466, 675-676.</ref>-->

== Titles and functions ==
Demeter's [[epithet]]s show her many religious functions. She was the "Corn-Mother" who blesses the harvesters. Some cults interpreted her as "Mother-Earth". Demeter may be linked to goddess-cults of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]], and embody aspects of a pre-Hellenic [[Great Goddess (disambiguation)|Great Goddess]].<!--Linear A is not deciphered:In the [[Linear A]] ([[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]) inscriptions appears often the word ''asasarame'',"mistress" that seems to accompany the names of some goddesses.<ref>Similar with [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''išhaššara'',"lady" or "mistress".Palmer sees -me as an [[PI]] possesiv-pronoun and interprets it as "my lady"  similar with the Hittite ''išhaššaraŝamiŝ''.The name does not seem to have [[PIE]] origin,compare [[Ishara]]-[[Ishtar]]:F.Schachermeyer (1964).''Die Minoische Kultur des alten Kreta''.W.Kohlhammer Verlag Stuttgart. p 263</ref> It is possible that the title [[mistress|mistress of the labyrinth]] that appears in a [[Linear B]] inscription belonged originally to Sito,the [[Mother goddess|Great Mother Demeter]] and in the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] this title was kept by her daughter [[Persephone]] (Kore or [[Despoina]]).<ref>R.Wunderlich(1975),''The secret of Creta''.Souvenir Press Ltd.London p 319</ref>--> Her other epithets include:

*[[Poppy goddess]]:

[[Theocritus]], wrote of an earlier role of Demeter as a poppy goddess:
:''For the Greeks Demeter was still a poppy goddess''
:''Bearing sheaves and poppies in both hands.'' — ''Idyll'' vii.157

In a clay statuette from Gazi (Heraklion Museum, Kereny 1976 fig 15), the Minoan [[Papaver somniferum|poppy]] goddess wears the seed capsules, sources of nourishment and narcosis, in her diadem. "It seems probable that the Great [[Mother Goddess]], who bore the names Rhea and Demeter, brought the poppy with her from her Cretan cult to [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusis]], and it is certain that in the Cretan cult sphere, opium was prepared from poppies" (Kerenyi 1976, p 24).

== Portrayals ==

*Demeter was frequently associated with images of the harvest, including flowers, fruit, and grain. She was also sometimes pictured with her daughter Persephone.

*The Black Demeter, a sculpture made by [[Onatas]].

*Demeter is not generally portrayed with a consort: the exception is Iasion, the youth of Crete who lay with Demeter in a thrice-ploughed field, and was sacrificed afterwards—by a jealous, and envious Zeus with a thunderbolt, Olympian mythography adds, but the Cretan site of the myth is a sign that the Hellenes knew this was an act of the ancient Demeter. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

*Demeter is assigned the zodiac constellation Virgo the Virgin by Marcus Manilius in his 1st century Roman work Astronomicon. In art, constellation Virgo holds Spica, a sheaf of wheat in her hand and sits beside constellation Leo the Lion. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
