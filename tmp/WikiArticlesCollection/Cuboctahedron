In [[geometry]], a '''cuboctahedron''' is a [[polyhedron]] with eight triangular faces and six square faces. A cuboctahedron has 12 identical vertices, with two triangles and two squares meeting at each, and 24 identical edges, each separating a triangle from a square. As such it is a [[quasiregular polyhedron]], i.e. an [[Archimedean solid]], being [[vertex-transitive]] and [[edge-transitive]].

Its [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].

==Other names==
*''Heptaparallelohedron'' ([[Buckminster Fuller]])
**Fuller applied the name "[[Dymaxion]]" to this shape, used in an early version of the [[Dymaxion map]].
*With O<sub>h</sub> symmetry, it is a ''[[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]]'' or ''rectified octahedron'' ([[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]])
*With T<sub>d</sub> symmetry, it is a ''[[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]''.
*With D<sub>3d</sub> symmetry, it is a ''triangular [[gyrobicupola]]''.

==Area and volume==
The area ''A'' and the volume ''V'' of the cuboctahedron of edge length ''a'' are:
:<math>A = (6+2\sqrt{3})a^2 \approx 9.4641016a^2</math>
:<math>V = \frac{5}{3} \sqrt{2}a^3 \approx 2.3570226a^3.</math>

==Orthogonal projections==
The ''cuboctahedron'' has four special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered on a vertex, an edge, and the two types of faces, triangular and square. The last two correspond to the B<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> [[Coxeter plane]]s. The skew projections show a square and hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron.

==Cartesian coordinates==
The [[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a cuboctahedron (of edge length √2) centered at the origin are:
:(±1,±1,0)
:(±1,0,±1)
:(0,±1,±1)

An alternate set of coordinates can be made in 4-space, as 12 permutations of:
:(0,1,1,2)

This construction exists as one of 16 [[orthant]] [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] of the [[cantellated 16-cell]].

===Root vectors===
The cuboctahedron's 12 vertices can represent the root vectors of the [[simple Lie group]] A<sub>3</sub>. With the addition of 6 vertices of the [[octahedron]], these vertices represent the 18 root vectors of the [[simple Lie group]] B<sub>3</sub>.

==Geometric relations==
A cuboctahedron can be obtained by taking an appropriate [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a four-dimensional [[16-cell]].

A cuboctahedron has octahedral symmetry. Its first [[stellation]] is the [[polyhedral compound|compound]] of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] and its dual [[octahedron]], with the vertices of the cuboctahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either. 

The cuboctahedron is a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]] and also a rectified [[octahedron]]. 

It is also a [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]. With this construction it is given the [[Wythoff symbol]]: {{nowrap|3 3 {{!}} 2}}. [[Image:Cantellated tetrahedron.png|50px]]

A skew cantellation of the tetrahedron produces a solid with faces parallel to those of the cuboctahedron, namely eight triangles of two sizes, and six rectangles. While its edges are unequal, this solid remains ''vertex-uniform'': the solid has the full tetrahedral [[symmetry group]] and its vertices are equivalent under that group.

The edges of a cuboctahedron form four regular [[hexagon]]s. If the cuboctahedron is cut in the plane of one of these hexagons, each half is a [[triangular cupola]], one of the [[Johnson solid]]s; the cuboctahedron itself thus can also be called a triangular [[bicupola (geometry)|gyrobicupola]], the simplest of a series (other than the [[gyrobifastigium]] or "digonal gyrobicupola"). If the halves are put back together with a twist, so that triangles meet triangles and squares meet squares, the result is another Johnson solid, the [[triangular orthobicupola]], also called an anticuboctahedron.

Both triangular bicupolae are important in [[sphere packing]]. The distance from the solid's center to its vertices is equal to its edge length. Each central [[sphere]] can have up to twelve neighbors, and in a face-centered cubic lattice these take the positions of a cuboctahedron's vertices. In a [[hexagon]]al close-packed lattice they correspond to the corners of the triangular orthobicupola. In both cases the central sphere takes the position of the solid's center.

Cuboctahedra appear as cells in three of the [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s and in nine of the convex [[uniform polychoron|uniform polychora]].

The volume of the cuboctahedron is 5/6 of that of the enclosing cube and 5/8 of that of the enclosing octahedron.
=== Vertex arrangement ===
The cuboctahedron shares its edges and vertex arrangement with two [[nonconvex uniform polyhedron|nonconvex uniform polyhedra]]: the [[cubohemioctahedron]] (having the square faces in common) and the [[octahemioctahedron]] (having the triangular faces in common). It also serves as a cantellated [[tetrahedron]], as being a rectified [[tetratetrahedron]].

The cuboctahedron [[covering space|2-covers]] the [[tetrahemihexahedron]],<ref name="richter">{{Harv|Richter}}</ref> which accordingly has the same [[abstract polytope|abstract]] [[vertex figure]] (two triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) and half the vertices, edges, and faces. (The actual vertex figure of the tetrahemihexahedron is 3.4.3/2.4, with the ''a''/2 factor due to the cross.)

==Related polyhedra==
The cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.

{{Octahedral truncations}}

The cuboctahedron can be seen in a sequence of [[quasiregular polyhedron]]s and tilings:

{{Quasiregular4 table}}

This polyhedron is topologically related as a part of sequence of [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] polyhedra with vertex figure (3.4.n.4), and continues as tilings of the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]]. These [[vertex-transitive]] figures have (*n32) reflectional [[Orbifold notation|symmetry]].

==Related polytopes==
The cuboctahedron can be decomposed into a regular [[octahedron]] and eight irregular but equal octahedra in the shape of the convex hull of a cube with two opposite vertices removed. This decomposition of the cuboctahedron corresponds with the cell-first parallel projection of the [[24-cell]] into three dimensions. Under this projection, the cuboctahedron forms the projection envelope, which can be decomposed into six square faces, a regular octahedron, and eight irregular octahedra. These elements correspond with the images of six of the octahedral cells in the 24-cell, the nearest and farthest cells from the 4D viewpoint, and the remaining eight pairs of cells, respectively.
