The '''carat''' is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]] equal to 200&nbsp;[[gram|mg]] (0.2 [[gram|g]]; 0.007055 [[ounce|oz]]) and is used for measuring [[gemstone]]s and [[pearl]]s.
The current definition, sometimes known as the '''metric carat''', was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]],<ref name="Science1908">{{cite book|author=American Association for the Advancement of Science|authorlink=American Association for the Advancement of Science|title=Science|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D5YCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA144|accessdate=30 June 2012|year=1908|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|page=144}}</ref> and soon afterwards in many countries around the world.<ref>The [[United States]] adopted the metric carat definition on July 1, 1913, the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 April 1914.</ref> The carat is divisible into one hundred ''points'' of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.

In terms of [[diamond]]s, a [[Paragon (diamond)|paragon]] is a flawless stone of at least 100 carat (20&nbsp;g).

The [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] [[Electronic Data Interchange|X.12 EDI]] standard abbreviation for the carat is '''CD'''.<ref>[http://das.ct.gov/Purchase/Info/ANSI_UNITS_OF_MEASURE.pdf State of Connecticut, Dept. of Admin. Services]</ref>

==Etymology==
First attested in English in the mid-15th century, the word ''carat'' came from [[Middle French]] ''carat'', in turn from Italian ''carato'', which came from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''qīrāṭ'' (قيراط), which came from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kerátion'' (κεράτιον) meaning [[carob]] seed (literally "small horn")<ref name=harper>{{OEtymD|carat|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkera%2Ftion κεράτιον], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref><ref>Walter W. Skeat (1888), ''[http://www.archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language]''</ref> 
(diminutive of - ''keras'', "horn"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fras κέρας], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) 
and was a unit of weight<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0122990#m_en_gb0122990 carat], Oxford Dictionaries</ref> 
though it was not likely used to measure gold in classical times.<ref name=harper/>
The [[Latin language|Latin]] word for carat is ''[[siliqua]]''.
This common belief that carat derives from carob seeds stems from the assumption that the seeds had unusually low variability in mass.

However, one group of researchers have found that carob seeds in fact have typical variability compared to the seeds of other species.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbl.2006.0476}}</ref>

This was not the only reason. It is said that, in order to keep regional buyers and sellers of gold honest, potential customers could retrieve their own carob seeds on their way to the market, to check the tolerances of the seeds used by the merchant. If this precaution was not taken, the potential customers would be at the mercy of "2 sets of carob seeds". One set of "heavier" carob seeds would be used when buying from a customer (making the seller's gold appear to be less). Another, lighter set of carob seeds would be used when the merchant wanted to sell to a customer.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} 

In the past, each country had its own carat. It was often used for weighing gold. Starting in the 1570s, it was used to measure weights of diamonds.<ref name=harper/>

==Historical definitions in the United Kingdom==

===Board of Trade carats===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the original '''[[Board of Trade]] carat''' was exactly {{frac|3|1647|9691}} (≈&nbsp;3.170) [[Grain (unit)|grain]]s;<ref>The pre-1888 [[Board of Trade]] carat, of which there were exactly {{frac|151|27|64}} per [[ounce#International troy ounce|ounce troy]], was approximately 205.4094&nbsp;''mg''.</ref> in 1888, the Board of Trade carat was changed to exactly {{frac|3|17|101}} (≈&nbsp;3.168) grains.<ref>The post-1887 Board of Trade carat, of which there were exactly {{frac|151|1|2}}; per ounce troy, was approximately 205.3035&nbsp;mg.</ref> Despite its being a non-metric unit, a number of metric countries have used this unit for its limited range of application.

The Board of Trade carat was divisible into four ''diamond grains'',<ref>Unlike the modern carat, the Board of Trade carat was not used for measuring pearls; those were measured with ''pearl grains''.</ref> but measurements were typically made in multiples of {{frac||1|64}} carat.

===Refiners' carats===
There were also two varieties of ''refiners' carats'' once used in the United Kingdom &mdash; the '''pound carat''' and the '''ounce carat'''.<ref>The refiners&rsquo; carats were the offspring of the [[carat (purity)|carat as a measure of fineness for gold]].</ref> The [[pound (mass)#Troy pound|pound troy]] was divisible into 24 ''pound carats'' of 240 grains troy each; the pound carat was divisible into four ''pound grains'' of 60 grains troy each; and the pound grain was divisible into four ''pound quarters'' of 15 grains troy each. Likewise, the [[ounce#International troy ounce|ounce troy]] was divisible into 24 ''ounce carats'' of 20 grains troy each; the ounce carat was divisible into four ''ounce grains'' of 5 grains troy each; and the ounce grain was divisible into four ''ounce quarters'' of {{frac|1|1|4}} grains troy each.<ref>Chaffers, William. 1883. ''Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate''. 6th edition. [[London]]: Bickers & Son.</ref>

==The carat of the Romans and Greeks==
The ''solidus'' was also a Roman weight unit. There is literary evidence that the weight of 72&nbsp;coins of the type called ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' was exactly 1 Roman pound, and that the weight of 1&nbsp;''solidus'' was 24&nbsp;''siliquae''. The weight of a Roman pound is generally believed to have been 327.45&nbsp;g or possibly up to 5&nbsp;g less. Therefore, the metric equivalent of 1 ''siliqua'' was approximately 189&nbsp;mg. The Greeks had a similar unit of the same value.<ref name="grierson">{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/sho/1960/00000003/00000003/art00001 | last=Grierson | first=Philip | title=The Monetary Reforms of'Abd Al-Malik | journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient | volume=3 | year=1960 | pages=241–264 | doi = 10.1163/156852060X00098 | issue=3}}</ref>

Gold fineness in carats comes from carats and grains of gold in a solidus of coin. One&nbsp;solidus = 24&nbsp;carats, 1&nbsp;carat = 4&nbsp;grains, is preserved right up to this day. Woolhouse's ''Measures, Weights and Moneys of all Nations''<ref>Woolhouse, W.S.B.  ''Measures, Weights and Moneys of all Nations'' 1891</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2012|reason=Why are we citing a 100+ year old book for information on current units, in a section on ancient units?}} gives gold fineness in carats of 4 grains, and silver in (pound) of 12&nbsp;ounces each 20&nbsp;dwt.
