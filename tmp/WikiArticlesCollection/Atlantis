'''Atlantis''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος}}, "island of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]") is a [[fiction]]al island first mentioned in [[Plato]]'s dialogues ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', written in c. 360 BC. According to Plato, Atlantis was a land and sea power situated "in front of the [[Pillars of Hercules]]" that had conquered many parts of Western Europe and Africa 9,000 years before the time of the Athenian lawgiver [[Solon]], i.e. in the [[10th millennium BC]]. After a failed attempt to invade [[Classical Athens|Athens]], Atlantis sank into the ocean "in a single day and night of misfortune."

The possible existence of Atlantis was discussed throughout [[classical antiquity]], but it was usually rejected and occasionally parodied by later authors. [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] wrote: "It is only in modern times that people have taken the Atlantis story seriously; no one did so in antiquity".<ref>Alan Cameron, [http://books.google.com/books?id=R6_g1cNj2jMC Greek Mythography in the Roman World], Oxford University Press (2004) p. 124</ref> The ''Timaeus'' remained known in a [[Latin]] rendition by [[Calcidius]] through the [[Middle Ages]], and the allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up by [[Humanism|Humanists]] in [[utopia]]n works of several [[Renaissance]] writers, such as [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]'' and [[Thomas More|More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''. In the [[United States]], [[Ignatius L. Donnelly|Donnelly]]'s 1882 publication ''[[Atlantis: the Antediluvian World]]'' unleashed widespread interests from [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientists]]. As a theme, Atlantis inspires today's light fiction, from [[science fiction]] to comic books to films. Its name has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations.

In academia, the Atlantis story is seen as one of the many myths Plato incorporated into his work for stylistic reasons,<ref name=Moors>{{cite book |last=Moors |first=Kent F. |year=1982 |title=Platonic Myth: An Introductory Study |location=Washington, DC |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=0-8191-2314-5 }}</ref> in this case to represent his conceptualized ideal state (see ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'') in action.<ref name="Hackforth">{{cite journal |last=Hackforth |first=R. |title=The Story of Atlantis: Its Purpose and Its Moral |journal=[[The Classical Review]] |volume=58 |issue=1 |year=1944 |pages=7–9 |jstor=701961 }}</ref><ref name=David>{{cite journal |first=Ephraim |last=David |title=The Problem of Representing Plato's Ideal State in Action |journal=[[Rivista di Filologia e di Istruzione Classica|Riv.

==Plato's account==
{{Further|Timaeus (dialogue)|Critias (dialogue)}}

[[File:Plato Timaeus.jpg|Right|thumb|A 15th-century Latin translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'']]
[[Plato]]'s dialogues ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', written in 360 BC, contain the earliest references to Atlantis. For unknown reasons, Plato never completed ''Critias''. Plato introduced Atlantis in ''Timaeus'':

{{quote|For it is related in our records how once upon a time your State stayed the course of a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlantic ocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia to boot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands to the whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritable ocean. For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.<ref>''Timaeus'' 24e–25a, R. G. Bury translation (Loeb Classical Library).</ref>}}

The four persons appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians [[Critias]] and [[Hermocrates]] as well as the philosophers [[Socrates]] and [[Timaeus of Locri]], although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic dialogues]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.

The ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions an allegedly historical tale that would make the perfect example, and follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the "perfect society" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the "perfect" traits described in the ''Republic''.

===''Critias''===
According to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] gods of old divided the land so that each god might own a lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis—Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com}}</ref><ref>Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for "bigger than" ("meson") and "between" ("mezon") – {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis – New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}</ref> but it afterwards was sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. The Egyptians, Plato asserted, described Atlantis as an island comprising mostly mountains in the northern portions and along the shore, and encompassing a great plain of an oblong shape in the south "extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi]." Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&nbsp;... broke it off all round about<ref>''Critias'' 113, Bury translation.</ref>&nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].<ref>''Critias'' 116a, Bury translation.</ref>

In Plato's myth, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island towards the pillars of Hercules.<ref>The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].</ref> The other four pairs of twins—Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes—were also given "rule over many men, and a large territory."

Poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each of the city's rings. The walls were constructed of red, white and black rock quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]] and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.<ref>Critias 116bc</ref>

According to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules as far as Egypt and the European continent as far as [[Tyrrhenia]], and subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.

{{quote|But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day and night befell them, when the whole body of your warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as it settled down.<ref>''Timaeus'' 25c–d, Bury translation.</ref>}}

The [[Logographer (history)|logographer]] [[Hellanicus of Mytilene|Hellanicus of Lesbos]] wrote an earlier work titled ''Atlantis'', of which only a few fragments survive. Hellanicus' work appears to have been a genealogical one concerning the daughters of Atlas<ref name="Luce">{{cite book |year=1978 |title=Atlantis, Fact or Fiction? |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-10482-3 |first=John V. |last=Luce |authorlink=John V. Luce |chapter=The Literary Perspective |editor-first=Edwin S. |editor-last=Ramage |page=72 }}</ref> (Ἀτλαντὶς in Greek means "of Atlas"), but some authors have suggested a possible connection with Plato's island. [[John V. Luce]] notes that when he writes about the genealogy of Atlantis's kings, Plato writes in the same style as Hellanicus and suggests a similarity between a fragment of Hellanicus's work and an account in the ''Critias''.<ref name="Luce" /> Rodney Castleden suggests Plato may have borrowed his title from Hellanicus, and that Hellanicus may have based his work on an earlier work on Atlantis.<ref>Castleden 2001, p. 164</ref>

Castleden has pointed out that Plato wrote of Atlantis in 359 BCE, when he returned to Athens from Sicily. He notes a number of parallels between the physical organisation and fortifications of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and Plato's description of Atlantis.<ref>Castleden 2001, pp. 156–158.</ref> Gunnar Rudberg was the first who elaborated the idea that Plato's attempt to realize his political ideas in the city of Syracuse could have heavily inspired the Atlantis account.<ref>[[Gunnar Rudberg|Rudberg, G.]] (1917/2012).

==Interpretations==

===Ancient===
Some ancient writers viewed Atlantis as fiction while others believed it was real.<ref>[[Heinz-Günther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (2005). 'Where the Lord of the Sea Grants Passage to Sailors through the Deep-blue Mere no More: The Greeks and the Western Seas', ''Greece & Rome'', vol. 52, pp.&nbsp;153–171 [pp. 161–171].</ref> The philosopher [[Crantor]], a student of Plato's student [[Xenocrates]], is often cited as an example of a writer who thought the story to be historical fact. His work, a commentary on Plato's ''Timaeus'', is lost, but [[Proclus]], a [[Neoplatonist]] of the 5th century AD, reports on it.<ref>Timaeus 24a: {{lang|grc|τὰ γράμματα λαβόντες}}.</ref> The passage in question has been represented in the modern literature either as claiming that Crantor actually visited Egypt, had conversations with priests, and saw hieroglyphs confirming the story or as claiming that he learned about them from other visitors to Egypt.<ref>Cameron 2002{{full|date=July 2013}}</ref> Proclus wrote:

{{quote|As for the whole of this account of the Atlanteans, some say that it is unadorned history, such as Crantor, the first commentator on Plato. Crantor also says that Plato's contemporaries used to criticize him jokingly for not being the inventor of his Republic but copying the institutions of the Egyptians. Plato took these critics seriously enough to assign to the Egyptians this story about the Athenians and Atlanteans, so as to make them say that the Athenians really once lived according to that system.}}

The next sentence is often translated "Crantor adds, that this is testified by the prophets of the Egyptians, who assert that these particulars [which are narrated by Plato] are written on pillars which are still preserved." But in the original, the sentence starts not with the name Crantor but with the ambiguous ''He'', and whether this referred to Crantor or to Plato is the subject of considerable debate. Proponents of both Atlantis as a myth and Atlantis as history have argued that the word refers to Crantor.<ref>Castleden 2001, p,168</ref>

Alan Cameron argues that it should be interpreted as referring to Plato, and that when Proclus writes that "we must bear in mind concerning this whole feat of the Athenians, that it is neither a mere myth nor unadorned history, although some take it as history and others as myth", he is treating "Crantor's view as mere personal opinion, nothing more; in fact he first quotes and then dismisses it as representing one of the two unacceptable extremes".<ref name="Cameron 1983">Cameron, Alan (1983). 'Crantor and Posidonius on Atlantis', ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 33, No. 1 (1983), pp.&nbsp;81–91</ref>

Cameron also points out that whether ''he'' refers to Plato or to Crantor, the statement does not support conclusions such as Otto Muck's "Crantor came to Sais and saw there in the temple of Neith the column, completely covered with hieroglyphs, on which the history of Atlantis was recorded. Scholars translated it for him, and he testified that their account fully agreed with Plato's account of Atlantis"<ref>Muck, Otto Heinrich, ''The Secret of Atlantis'', Translation by Fred Bradley of ''Alles über Atlantis'' (Econ Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf-Wien, 1976), Times Books, a division of Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co., Inc., Three Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016, 1978. ISBN 978-0-671-82392-4</ref> or J. V. Luce's suggestion that Crantor sent "a special enquiry to Egypt" and that he may simply be referring to Plato's own claims.<ref name="Cameron 1983"/>

Another passage from Proclus' commentary on the ''Timaeus'' gives a description of the geography of Atlantis: <blockquote>That an island of such nature and size once existed is evident from what is said by certain authors who investigated the things around the outer sea. For according to them, there were seven islands in that sea in their time, sacred to [[Persephone]], and also three others of enormous size, one of which was sacred to Hades, another to Ammon, and another one between them to Poseidon, the extent of which was a thousand stadia [200&nbsp;km]; and the inhabitants of it—they add—preserved the remembrance from their ancestors of the immeasurably large island of Atlantis which had really existed there and which for many ages had reigned over all islands in the Atlantic sea and which itself had like-wise been sacred to Poseidon. Now these things Marcellus has written in his ''Aethiopica''".<ref>[[Proclus]], ''Commentary on Plato's Timaeus'', p. 117.10–30 (=''FGrHist'' 671 F 1), trans. Taylor, Nesselrath.</ref></blockquote> Marcellus remains unidentified.

Other ancient historians and philosophers believing in the existence of Atlantis were [[Strabo]] and [[Posidonius]].<ref>Strabo 2.3.6</ref>

[[File:Posidonio de Apamea.jpg|thumb|200px|A bust of [[Posidonius]].]]
Plato's account of Atlantis may have also inspired [[parody|parodic]] imitation: writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his voluminous ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between King [[Midas]] and [[Silenus]], a companion of [[Dionysus]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis (Cos?): ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|Εὐσεβής}}, "Pious-town") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|Μάχιμος}}, "Fighting-town"). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer [[Hyperborea]], but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-Günther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.<ref>[[Heinz-Günther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (1998). 'Theopomps Meropis und Platon: Nachahmung und Parodie', ''Göttinger Forum für Altertumswissenschaft'', vol. 1, pp.&nbsp;1–8.</ref>

Zoticus, a [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher of the 3rd century AD, wrote an epic poem based on Plato's account of Atlantis.<ref>[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], ''Life of Plotinus'', 7=35.</ref>

The 4th-century historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], relying on a lost work by [[Timagenes]], a historian writing in the 1st century BC, writes that the [[Druids]] of [[Gaul]] said that part of the inhabitants of Gaul had migrated there from distant islands. Some have understood Ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of Atlantis's actual sinking into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus in fact says that "the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the [[Rhine]]" (''Res Gestae'' 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north (Britain, the Netherlands or Germany), not from a theorized location in the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west.<ref>Fitzpatrick-Matthews, Keith. ''[http://www.kmatthews.org.uk/cult_archaeology/lost_continents.html Lost Continents: Atlantis].''</ref> Instead, the Celts that dwelled along the ocean were reported to venerate twin gods ([[Dioscori]]) that appeared to them coming from that ocean.<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4A.html] [[Bibliotheca historica]] – [[Diodorus Siculus]] 4.56.4: ''"And the writers even offer proofs of these things, pointing out that the Celts who dwell along the ocean venerate the Dioscori above any of the gods, since they have a tradition handed down from ancient times that these gods appeared among them coming from the ocean. Moreover, the country which skirts the ocean bears, they say, not a few names which are derived from the Argonauts and the Dioscori."''</ref>

===Jewish and Christian===
The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher [[Philo]] in the early 1st century AD wrote about the destruction of Atlantis in his ''On the Eternity of the World'', xxvi. 141, in a longer passage allegedly citing Aristotle's successor [[Theophrastus]]:<ref>T. Franke, ''Aristotle and Atlantis'', 2012; pp.&nbsp;131–133</ref>

{{quote|...&nbsp;And the island of Atalantes [translator's spelling; original: {{lang|grc|Ἀτλαντὶς}}] which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the Timaeus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inundation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book35.html |title=Philo: On the Eternity of the World |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>}}

Some scholars believe {{who|date=July 2012}} [[Clement of Rome]] cryptically referred to Atlantis in his [[First Epistle of Clement]], 20: 8:

{{quote|...&nbsp;The ocean which is impassable for men, and the worlds beyond it, are directed by the same ordinances of the Master.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-lightfoot.html |title=First Clement: Clement of Rome |publisher=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>}}

On this passage the theologian [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] (''Apostolic Fathers'', 1885, II, p.&nbsp;84) noted: "Clement may possibly be referring to some known, but hardly accessible land, lying without the pillars of Hercules. But more probably he contemplated some unknown land in the far west beyond the ocean, like the fabled Atlantis of Plato&nbsp;..."<ref>Lightfoot, translator, ''The Apostolic Fathers'', II, 1885, P. 84, Edited & Revised by Michael W. Holmes, 1989.</ref>

Other early Christian writers wrote about Atlantis, though they had mixed views on whether it once existed or was an untrustworthy myth of pagan origin.<ref>[[L. Sprague de Camp|De Camp, LS]] (1954). ''[[Lost Continents|Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature]]''. New York: Gnome Press, p. 307.

[[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] in the 6th century wrote of Atlantis in his ''[[Christian Topography]]'' in an attempt to prove his theory that the world was flat and surrounded by water:

{{quote|...&nbsp;In like manner the philosopher Timaeus also describes this Earth as surrounded by the Ocean, and the Ocean as surrounded by the more remote earth. For he supposes that there is to westward an island, Atlantis, lying out in the Ocean, in the direction of Gadeira (Cadiz), of an enormous magnitude, and relates that the ten kings having procured mercenaries from the nations in this island came from the earth far away, and conquered Europe and Asia, but were afterwards conquered by the Athenians, while that island itself was submerged by God under the sea. Both Plato and Aristotle praise this philosopher, and Proclus has written a commentary on him. He himself expresses views similar to our own with some modifications, transferring the scene of the events from the east to the west. Moreover he mentions those ten generations as well as that earth which lies beyond the Ocean. And in a word it is evident that all of them borrow from Moses, and publish his statements as their own.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Pearse |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cosmas_12_book12.htm |title=Cosmas Indicopleustes, Christian Topography (1897) pp. 374-385.

===Modern===
Aside from [[Plato]]'s original account, modern interpretations regarding Atlantis are an amalgamation of diverse, speculative movements that began in the 16th century.<ref>[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, KL.]] ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology,'' Mountain View, Mayfield 1999. ISBN 978-0-07-811697-1</ref>  Contemporary perceptions of Atlantis share roots with [[Mayanism]], which can be traced to the beginning of the [[Modern Age]], when European imaginations were fueled by their initial encounters with the indigenous peoples of the [[New World]].<ref name="Hoopes 2011">{{cite book |author=Hoopes, John W. |chapter=Mayanism Comes of (New) Age |editor=Joseph Gelfer |title=2012: Decoding the Counterculture Apocalypse |year=2011 |location=London |publisher=Equinox Publishing  |isbn=978-1-84553-639-8 |pages=38–59}}</ref>  From this era sprang [[apocalyptic]] and [[utopian]] visions that would inspire many subsequent generations of theorists.<ref name="Hoopes 2011"/>

Most of these interpretations are considered [[pseudohistory]], [[pseudoscience]], or [[pseudoarchaeology]], as they have presented their works as [[academic]] or [[scientific]], but lack the standards and/or criteria.

Much speculation began as to the origins of the [[Mayans]], which led to a variety of narratives and publications which tried to rationalize the discoveries within the context of the [[Bible]] and which had undertones of [[racism]] in their connections between the Old and New World.  The [[Europeans]] believed the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in [[ruins]] and by sharing a common [[history]] they insinuate that another race must have been responsible.

In the middle and late 19th century, several renowned [[Mesoamerican]] [[scholars]], starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], formally proposed  that Atlantis was somehow related to Mayan and [[Aztec]] culture.

French scholar [[Brasseur de Bourbourg]] traveled extensively through [[Mesoamerica]] in the mid-1800s, and was renowned for his translations of [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] texts, most notably the [[sacred]] book [[Popol Vuh]], as well as a comprehensive [[history]] of the region.  However, soon after these publications, [[Brasseur de Bourbourg]] lost his academic credibility, due to his claim that the [[Maya peoples]] had descended from the [[Toltecs]], who he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior [[civilization]] of Atlantis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Evans, R. Tripp |year=2004 |title=Romancing the Maya: Mexican Antiquity in the American Imagination, 1820–1915 |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-70247-7 |page=113 }}</ref>  His work combined with the skillful, romantic illustrations of [[Jean Frederic Waldeck]], which visually alluded to [[Egypt]] and other aspects of the [[Old World]], creating an authoritative [[fantasy]] and exciting much interest in the connections between worlds.

Inspired by Brasseur de Bourbourg's diffusion theories, pseudoarchaeologist [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] traveled to [[Mesoamerica]] and performed some of the first [[excavations]] of many famous Mayan ruins.  Le Plongeon invented [[narratives]], such as the kingdom of Moo saga, which [[romantically]] drew connections between himself, his wife Alice, and [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] deities [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]], as well as with [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who had just discovered the ancient city of [[Troy]] from [[Homer]]'s [[epic poetry|epics]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Evans, R. Tripp |year=2004 |title=Romancing the Maya: Mexican Antiquity in the American Imagination, 1820–1915 |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-70247-7 |pages=141–6 }}</ref>  He also believed that he had found connections between the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Mayan languages]], which produced a [[narrative]] of the destruction of Atlantis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brunhouse, Robert L. |year=1973 |title=In Search of the Maya: The First Archaeologists |location=Albuquerque |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |isbn=0-8263-0276-9 |page=153 }}</ref>

=====Ignatius Donnelly=====
The 1882 publication of ''[[Atlantis: the Antediluvian World]]'' by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] stimulated much popular interest in Atlantis.  He was greatly inspired by early works in [[Mayanism]], and like them attempted to establish that all known [[ancient civilizations]] were descended from Atlantis, which he saw as a technologically sophisticated, more advanced [[culture]].  Donnelly drew parallels between creation stories in the Old and New Worlds, attributing the connections to Atlantis, where he believed existed the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]].<ref>Donnelly 1941: 192-203</ref>  As implied by the title of his book, he also believed that Atlantis was destroyed by the [[Great Flood]] mentioned in the Bible.

Donnelly is credited as the "father of the 19th century Atlantis revival" and is the reason the [[myth]] endures today.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Stephen |year=1991 |title=Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-8238-8 |pages=137–8 }}</ref>  He unintentionally promoted an alternative method of inquiry to history and science, and the idea that myths contain hidden information that opens them to "ingenious" interpretation by people who believe they have new or special insight.<ref>Jordan, Paul (2006). "Esoteric Egypt". In Garrett G. Fagan. Archaeological Fantasies. London and New York: Routledge. pp. 23–46. ISBN 978-0-415-30593-8</ref>

=====Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophists=====
The Russian mystic [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] and her partner [[Henry Steel Olcott]] founded their [[Theosophical Society]] in the 1870s with a philosophy that combined western [[romanticism]] and [[eastern world|eastern]] religious concepts.  Blavatsky and her followers in this group are often cited as the founders of [[New Age]] and other spiritual movements.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Blavatsky took up [[Donnelly]]'s interpretations when she wrote ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), which she claimed was originally dictated in Atlantis itself. She maintained that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to [[Plato]], who describes them mainly as a military threat).  She believed in a form of racial [[evolution]] (as opposed to primate evolution), in which the Atlanteans were the fourth "[[Root Race]]", succeeded by the fifth and most superior "[[Aryan race]]" (her own race).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The [[Theosophists]] believed that the civilization of Atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago but destroyed itself through internal [[warfare]] brought about by the inhabitants' dangerous use of [[psychic]] and [[supernatural]] powers.

[[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[Anthroposophy]] and [[Waldorf Schools]], along with other well known [[Theosophists]], such as [[Annie Besant]], also wrote of [[cultural]] evolution in much the same vein.

=====Nazism and occultism=====
{{See also|Nazism and occultism}}

[[Blavatsky]] had also been inspired by the work of the 18th-century [[astronomer]] [[Jean-Sylvain Bailly]], who had "Orientalized" the Atlantis [[myth]] in his mythical continent of [[Hyperborea]], a reference to [[Greek myths]] featuring a Northern European region of the same name, home to a giant, godlike race.<ref name="Edelstein 2006: 268">{{cite journal |author=Edelstein, Dan |year=2006 |title=Hyperborean Atlantis: Jean-Sylvain Bailly, Madame Blavatsky, and the Nazi Myth |journal=Studies in eighteenth-century culture |volume=35 |pages=267–291 [p. 268] |issn=0360-2370 |doi=10.1353/sec.2010.0055}}</ref>  Her retooling of this theory in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' provided the [[Nazis]] with a mythological precedent and pretense for their ideological platform and subsequent genocide.<ref name="Edelstein 2006: 268" />

[[Julius Evola]]'s writing in 1934 also suggested that the Atlanteans were [[Hyperborean]], [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] supermen who originated at the North Pole (see [[Thule]]). Similarly, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (in ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', 1930) spoke of a "Nordic-Atlantean" or "Aryan-Nordic" master race.

=====Edgar Cayce=====
[[Edgar Cayce]] was a man from humble upbringings in [[Kentucky]] who allegedly possessed [[psychic]] abilities, which were performed from a trance-like state.  In addition to healing the sick from this state, he also spoke frequently on the topic of Atlantis.  In his "life readings," he purportedly revealed that many of his subjects were [[reincarnations]] of people that had lived on Atlantis, and by tapping into their [[collective consciousness]], the "[[Akashic Records]]" (a term borrowed from [[Theosophy]]), he was able to give detailed descriptions of the lost continent.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cayce, Edgar Evans |year=1968 |title=On Atlantis |location=New York and Boston |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=0-446-35102-4 |pages=27–8 }}</ref>  He also asserted that Atlantis would "rise" again in the 1960s (sparking much popularity of the myth in that decade), as well as that there is a "[[Hall of Records]]" beneath the [[Egyptian Sphinx]] that holds the historical texts of Atlantis.

====Recent times====
As [[continental drift]] became more widely accepted during the 1960s, and the increased understanding of [[plate tectonics]] demonstrated the impossibility of a lost continent in the geologically recent past,<ref>{{cite book |title=Greece Before History: An Archaeological Companion and Guide |last=Runnels |first=Curtis |coauthors=Murray, Priscilla |year=2004 |publisher=Stanford UP |location=Stanford |isbn=0-8047-4036-4 |page=130 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rg4rTjo0OCQC&pg=PA130 |accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> most "Lost Continent" theories of Atlantis began to wane in popularity.

Plato scholar [[Julia Annas]], [[Regents Professor]] of Philosophy at the [[University of Arizona]], had this to say on the matter:

{{quote|The continuing industry of discovering Atlantis illustrates the dangers of reading Plato. For he is clearly using what has become a standard device of fiction—stressing the historicity of an event (and the discovery of hitherto unknown authorities) as an indication that what follows is fiction. ''The idea is that we should use the story to examine our ideas of government and power''. We have missed the point if instead of thinking about these issues we go off exploring the sea bed. The continuing misunderstanding of Plato as historian here enables us to see why his distrust of imaginative writing is sometimes justified.<ref>J. Annas, ''Plato: A Very Short Introduction'' (OUP 2003), p.42 ''(emphasis not in the original)''</ref>}}

One of the proposed explanations for the historical context of the Atlantis story is a warning of Plato to his contemporary fourth-century fellow-citizens against their striving for naval power.<ref name=Morgan />

[[Kenneth Feder]] points out that Critias's story in the ''Timaeus'' provides a major clue. In the dialogue, Critias says, referring to Socrates' hypothetical society:

{{quote|And when you were speaking yesterday about your city and citizens, the tale which I have just been repeating to you came into my mind, and I remarked with astonishment how, by some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of Solon.&nbsp;...<ref>''Timaeus'' 25e, Jowett translation.</ref>}}

Feder quotes A. E. Taylor, who wrote, "We could not be told much more plainly that the whole narrative of Solon's conversation with the priests and his intention of writing the poem about Atlantis are an invention of Plato's fancy."<ref>[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, KL.]] ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology,'' Mountain View, Mayfield 1999, p. 164 ISBN 978-0-07-811697-1</ref>

{{Main|Location hypotheses of Atlantis}}
Since Donnelly's day, there have been dozens of locations proposed for Atlantis, to the point where the name has become a generic concept, divorced from the specifics of Plato's account. This is reflected in the fact that many proposed sites are not within the Atlantic at all. Few today are scholarly or archaeological hypotheses, while others have been made by [[psychic]] (e.g., [[Edgar Cayce]]) or other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. (The Atlantis researchers Jacques Collina-Girard and Georgeos Díaz-Montexano, for instance, each claim the other's hypothesis is pseudoscience.)<ref>Collina-Girard, Jacques, ''L'Atlantide retrouvée: enquête scientifique autour d'un mythe'' (Paris: Belin – pour la science, 2009).</ref><ref name="DiazAtlantis">{{cite web | url=http://usuarios.lycos.es/atlantisiberia/release_news.htm | title=Atlantis in Gibraltar, between Iberia and Africa | author=María Fdez-Valmayor (possible pseudonym of Diaz-Montexano)}}</ref><ref name="AtlantisInsider">{{cite web | url=http://www.mysterious-america.net/atlantisinsider.html | title=Atlantis Insider: Brief Reviews of the Latest in the Search for Atlantis | first=Greg | last=Little | month=September | year=2004}}</ref> Many of the proposed sites share some of the characteristics of the Atlantis story (water, catastrophic end, relevant time period), but none has been demonstrated to be a true historical Atlantis.

[[File:Santorini Landsat.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Satellite image of the islands of [[Santorini]]. From the [[Minoan eruption]] event, and the 1964 discovery of [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] on the island, this location is one of many sites purported to have been the location of Atlantis]]

===In or near the Mediterranean Sea===
Most of the historically proposed locations are in or near the Mediterranean Sea: islands such as [[Sardinia]], [[Crete]], [[Santorini]], Sicily, Cyprus, and [[Malta]]; land-based cities or states such as [[Troy]],<ref>Zangger, Eberhard, ''The Flood from Heaven: Deciphering the Atlantis legend'', New York: William Morrow and Company, 1993</ref> [[Tartessos]], and Tantalus (in the province of [[Manisa]], [[Turkey]]); [[Israel]]-[[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] or [[Canaan]];{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and northwestern Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asalas.org/doku.php |title=Plato's Atlantis in South Morocco? |publisher=Asalas.org}}</ref><ref>http://www.atlantis-bakhu.com/ Atlantis-Bakhu</ref> The [[Thera eruption]], dated to the 17th or 16th century BC, caused a large [[tsunami]] that some experts hypothesize devastated the [[Minoan civilization]] on the nearby island of Crete, further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the story.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6568053.stm The wave that destroyed Atlantis] Harvey Lilley, BBC News Online, 2007-04-20. Retrieved 2007-04-21.</ref>

A. G. Galanopoulos argued that Plato's dating of 9,000 years before Solon's time was the result of an error in translation, probably from Egyptian into Greek, which produced "thousands" instead of "hundreds". Such an error would also rescale Plato's Atlantis to the size of Crete, while leaving the city the size of the crater on Thera; 900 years before Solon would be the 15th century BC.<ref>Galanopoulos, Angelos Geōrgiou, and Edward Bacon, ''Atlantis: The Truth Behind the Legend'', Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1969</ref> In the area of the [[Black Sea]] the following locations have been proposed: [[Bosporus]] and [[Ancomah]]<ref>[http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/atlantis/ Atlantis and Lost city of Ancomah]</ref><ref>[http://www.karalahana.com/english/archive/folklore.html Ancomah myth in Turkish Folklore]</ref> (a legendary place near [[Trabzon]]).

===In the Atlantic Ocean and Europe===
[[File:Doggerland.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map showing hypothetical extent of [[Doggerland]] (c.&nbsp;8,000&nbsp;BCE), which provided a land bridge between Great Britain and continental Europe.]]

Spanish scientists have dismissed Freund's speculations, claiming that he sensationalised their work. The anthropologist Juan Villarías-Robles, who works with the [[Spanish National Research Council]], said, "Richard Freund was a newcomer to our project and appeared to be involved in his own very controversial issue concerning King Solomon's search for ivory and gold in [[Tartessos]], the well documented settlement in the Doñana area established in the first millennium BC", and described Freund's claims as "fanciful".<ref>{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Edward|title=Lost city of Atlantis 'buried in Spanish wetlands'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8381219/Lost-city-of-Atlantis-buried-in-Spanish-wetlands.html|accessdate=18 March 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|date=14 March 2011}}</ref>

A similar theory had previously been put forward by a German researcher, Rainer W. Kühne, but based only on satellite imagery and placing Atlantis in the [[Marismas de Hinojos]], north of the city of [[Cádiz]].<ref name=Antiquity>{{cite journal|last=Kühne|first=Rainer W.|journal=Antiquity|date=June 2004|volume= 78| issue = 300|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/078/300/default.htm|accessdate=10 July 2011|publisher=Department of Archaeology, University of York|issn=0003598X}}</ref> Before that, the historian [[Adolf Schulten]] had stated in the 1920s that Plato had used Tartessos as the basis for his Atlantis myth.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schulten|first=Adof|title=Tartessos und Atlantis|journal=Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen|year=1927|volume=73|pages=284–288|language=German}}</ref>

The location of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names. Popular culture often places Atlantis there, perpetuating the original Platonic setting. Several hypotheses place the sunken island in northern Europe, including [[Doggerland]] in the [[North Sea]], and [[Sweden]] (by [[Olof Rudbeck]] in ''[[Olof Rudbeck|Atland]]'', 1672–1702). Doggerland, as well as [[Viking Bergen Island]], is thought to have been flooded by a tsunami following the [[Storegga slide]] c. 6100 BCE.<ref>[http://sprint.clivar.org/soes/staff/ejr/Rohling-papers/2008-Weninger%20et%20al%20Documenta%20Praehistorica.pdf Bernhard Weninger et al., The catastrophic final flooding of Doggerland by the Storegga Slide tsunami, Documenta Praehistorica XXXV, 2008]</ref> Some have proposed the [[Celtic Sea#Seabed|Celtic Shelf]] as a possible location, and that there is a link to Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lovgren |first=Stefan |title=Atlantis "Evidence" Found in Spain and Ireland |publisher=[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]] |date=19 August 2004 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0819_040819_atlantis.html }}</ref>
