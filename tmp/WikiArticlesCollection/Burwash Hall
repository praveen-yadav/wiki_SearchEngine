'''Burwash Hall''' is the second oldest of the residence buildings at [[Toronto]]'s [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]].  Construction began in 1911 and was completed in 1913.  It was named after [[Nathanael Burwash]], a former president of Victoria.  The building is an extravagant [[Neo-Gothic]] work with [[turret]]s, [[gargoyle]]s, and [[battlement]]s.  The architect was [[Henry Sproatt]].

The building is divided between the large dining hall in the northwest and the student residence proper.  The residence area is divided into two sections.  The Upper Houses, built in 1913, consist of four houses: North House, [[Middle House]], [[Gate House]], and [[South House]].   The Lower Houses were built in 1931 and were originally intended to house theology students at Emmanuel College, whose current building was opened the same year.  Ryerson House, Nelles House, Caven House, Bowles-Gandier House are now mostly home to undergraduate arts and science students.  The latter two are mostly reserved for students in the new Vic One Programme.

Famous residents of Burwash include [[Vincent Massey]], [[Lester B. Pearson]], [[Don Harron]], and [[Donald Sutherland]].  The upper houses were gutted and renovated in 1995.  The lower houses have only been partially upgraded.  Before the renovations the entire building was all male, but now every house is co-ed.

Each Upper House consists of three floors.  The lower floor contains a [[common room]] equipped with kitchen facilities, couches and a television.  The upper floors each have their own kitchen and dining area.  All except North House have a very high bathroom ratio, with Gate House being the best with nine washrooms for its twenty-eight residents.  Upper Houses are divided between double rooms and singles, with about sixty percent of the population being in doubles.

The Lower Houses each have four floors, but are much narrower with each level having only four rooms.  Each level also has its own kitchen, but these are much smaller than in the Upper Houses. The Lower Houses do have far larger and better fitted common rooms that are similar to the ones the Upper Houses had before the renovations.  The rooms in the Lower Houses are also considered more luxurious with [[hardwood floor]]s and large sizes. Rooms in the Lower Houses are more expensive, however. Until 2003 the Lower Houses were restricted to upper year students but with the [[double cohort]] of graduates from Ontario schools many of the rooms were transformed into doubles and now hold first years.

To the west the Upper Houses look out on the Vic Quad and the main Victoria College building across it.  West of the Lower Houses is the new Lester B. Pearson Garden of Peace and International Understanding and the [[E.J. Pratt Library]] beyond it.  From the eastern side of the building, the Upper Houses look out at [[Rowell Jackman Hall]] and the Lower Houses see the [[St. Michael's College (U of T)|St. Michael's College]] residence of [[Elmsley]].  The only exception is the view from Gate House's tower that looks down St. Mary's Street.

The dining hall is perhaps the best known part of the building to outsiders.  It is the University of Toronto's largest, holding some 250 students and sixteen large tables.  Hanging on the western wall is [[Queen Victoria]]'s burial flag, given to the college soon after her death.  Under the flag is the [[High Table|high table]] where the professors and college administration lunch.  Historically, the Upper Houses each had their own table.  Gate sat in the southwest corner, Middle sat in the far northeast, South sat in the table to the west of Middle, while North sat to the west of the southeast corner. The only lower house to have had a designated table was Caven, in the northwest corner beside the alumni table. (Note that prior to the 1995 renovations, some of these houses, particularly North and Caven, 'traditionally' sat elsewhere)

==Gate House==

'''Gate House''' is one of the four Upper Houses of the Burwash Hall residence. Until 2007, when Victoria administration made it co-ed, Gate House was one of the last remaining all-male residence building in the University of Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title=Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> The Gate House emblem is the Phoenix, visible in the bottom-right corner of the Victoria College insignia.

Gate House, with the rest of Upper Burwash, opened in 1913 and has held students every year since then except 1995, when it was renovated.<ref>{{cite web|author=Houghton, Sarah|date=2003-03-12|title=One Hundred Years of Architecture|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about/history/One_Hundred_Years_of_Architecture.htm|accessdate=2007-06-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070525051149/http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/about/history/One_Hundred_Years_of_Architecture.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-25}}</ref> As an all-male residence from 1913 to 2007 it held a number of unique traditions. For 20 years Gate House hosted an annual party called Novemberfest in the Burwash dining hall.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tsang, Sharon|date=2002-12-04|title='Student aspect' of Vic liquor license suspended|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2002/12/04/News/student.Aspect.Of.Vic.Liquor.License.Suspended-337730.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> The Victoria Dean of Students cancelled Novemberfest in 2003, when police discovered widespread underage drinking and over 800 people in the dining hall, in violation of the fire code.<ref>{{cite web|author=Salonen, Rachel|date=2002-01-22|title='Student pub taken out of students' hands|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2003/01/22/News/Student.Pub.Taken.Out.Of.Students.Hands-350656.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> Another Gate House tradition that no longer occurs is the "stirring the chicken," a dinner and keg party where house members cook chicken fajitas for hundreds of guests. Until 2007, Gate House held secretive first-year initiation ceremonies called Traditionals, which involved writing slogans on campus buildings in chalk, singing songs to the all-women's residence (who would then sing back to them), and leading first-years around the house blindfolded.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bao, Jane|date=2007-01-07|title='Boy's club dismembered|publisher=The Varsity''|url=http://www.thevarsity.ca/article/1417|accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref> Since Novemberfest, Gate House continued to have conflict with the Administration. In 2004 the Dean evicted three Gate House residents for allegedly "hog-tying" a first-year student.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doukas, Alex|date=2004-03-17|title='Three students booted from res|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2004/03/17/News/Three.Students.Booted.From.Res-637000.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref> In 2007 President Paul W. Gooch wrote that Gate House undertook an "escalating series of actions" that were "defiant" and "disparaging of women", in response to Gate members constructing a 2.5-metre snow penis and placing a cooked pig's head in an Annesley bathroom.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sibonney, Claire|date=2007-12-19|title='University of Toronto's Animal House laid to rest|publisher=[[Reuters]]''|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1960484520071219?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0}}</ref> As punishment, during the fall exam period Gooch evicted two residents and relocated the remainder of Gate House to other places in the residence system, banned all current Gate House students from entering the building in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> Since this decision Gate House has become a co-ed residence identical to the other Upper Burwash houses. Notable residents of Gate House include  [[Lester B. Pearson]], former Prime Minister of Canada, and [[Simon Pulsifer]], who Time Magazine nicknamed "The Duke of Data" for his contributions to Wikipedia.<ref>

During its 93 years as a men's residence, Gate House developed a distinct character and reputation. These antics included pranks, toga parties, streaking, caroling to other residences, hazing rituals, "beer bashes" and "incessant pounding" on the Gate House table in the dining hall.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richards, Jason|date=2004-09-18|title='Gate House Traditionals Exposed|publisher=The Strand''|url=http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2002/09/18/Stranded/Gate-House.Traditionals.Exposed-290475.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> Paul Gooch wrote that these traditions gave Gate House an "ethos" that contradicted his vision of residence life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>

The all-male Gate House was known as a social centre and spirited, tight-knit community. According to Grayson Lee, who created the snow penis sculpture in 2007, most of its residents were "heartbroken" to leave.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sibonney, Claire|date=2007-12-19|title='University of Toronto's Animal House laid to rest|publisher=[[Reuters]]''|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1960484520071219?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0}}</ref> Former Gate House President Dave Ruhl commented that "the Gate House camaraderie is unique" and that living there was "one of the most important parts of the university experience" for many.<ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>

The Reuters news agency nicknamed Gate House "U of T's Animal House" because Donald Sutherland's memories of its parties are said to have influenced the script of the 1978 movie.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sibonney, Claire|date=2007-12-19|title='University of Toronto's Animal House laid to rest|publisher=[[Reuters]]''|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSN1960484520071219?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0}}</ref> The Toronto Star described Gooch's decision to put an end to its traditions, activities and distinguishing characteristics as "neutering Animal House."<ref>{{cite web|author=Taylor, Bill|date=2007-12-19|title='Party's over at U of T residence.|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]''|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/286958|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>

Gate House has three floors which house 28 students, as well as a don and the Victoria College Residence Life Co-ordinator. Above the gate there is a tower that rises three stories higher and has a turret-style roof. The tower is locked during the school year and entering it is a Level 4 offense under the Victoria residence agreement for which the punishment is eviction from residence.

The '''first floor''' has one double room and one bathroom available to students. About half of the floor is taken up by the apartment of the Residence Life Coordinator. Lastly, on the first floor there is a house common room with a kitchen and two couches.[http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Victoria/assets/Upper_Burwash_1st_Floor_10571_579514.jpg?method=1]  The '''second floor''' has three double rooms and seven single rooms. It has three single washrooms and one larger communal one, as well as its own kitchen. This floor is home to the residence don, who has a larger room with a private washroom. The '''third floor''' is identical to the second except that in place of the don's room there are two single rooms.[http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/Assets/Victoria/assets/Upper_Burwash_2nd_and_3rd_Floor_10570_797531.jpg?method=1]
