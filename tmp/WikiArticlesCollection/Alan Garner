'''Alan Garner''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 17 October 1934) is an [[English people|English]] novelist best known for his [[children's fantasy]] novels and his retellings of traditional British folk tales. His work is firmly rooted in the landscape, history and folklore of his native county of [[Cheshire]], [[North West England]], being set in the region and making use of the native [[Cheshire dialect]].

Born into a working-class family in [[Congleton]], Garner grew up around the nearby town of [[Alderley Edge]], and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as 'The Edge', where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region. Studying at Manchester Grammar School and then briefly at [[Oxford University]], in 1957 he moved to the nearby village of Blackden, where he bought and renovated an Early Modern building known as Toad Hall. His first novel, ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'', was published in 1960. A children's fantasy novel set on the Edge, it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters. Garner completed a sequel, ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]'' (1963), but left the third book of the trilogy he had envisioned. Instead he produced a string of further fantasy novels, ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967) and ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]'' (1973).

Turning away from fantasy as a genre, Garner produced ''[[The Stone Book Quartet]]'' (1979), a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family. He also published a series of British folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled ''Alan Garner's Fairy Tales of Gold'' (1979), ''Alan Garner's Book of British Fairy Tales'' (1984) and ''A Bag of Moonshine'' (1986). In his subsequent novels, ''[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]'' (1996) and ''[[Thursbitch (novel)|Thursbitch]]'' (2003), he continued writing tales revolving around Cheshire, although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work. In 2012, he finally published a third book in the Weirdstone trilogy, ''[[Boneland]]''.

===Early life: 1934–1956===

 |quote =<poem>
I had to get aback [to familial ways of doing things], by using skills that had been denied to my ancestors; but I had nothing that they would have called worthwhile. My ability was in language and languages. I had to use that, somehow. And writing was a manual craft. But what did I know that I could write about? I knew the land.
</poem>

}}

Garner was born in the front room of his grandmother's house in [[Congleton]], Cheshire, on 17 October 1934.<ref name="Philips 1981">[[#Phi81|Philip 1981]]. p. 11.</ref> He grew up nearby in [[Alderley Edge]], a well-to-do rural Cheshire village that had effectively become a suburb of [[Manchester]].<ref name="Philips 1981"/> Growing up in a "a rural working-class family",<ref name="Thompson">[[#Tho89|Thompson and Garner 1989]].</ref> Garner's ancestors had been connected to Alderley Edge since at least the 16th century, with Alan tracing his lineage back to the death of William Garner in 1592.<ref>[[#Gar10|Garner 2010]]. p. 05.</ref> The Garner family had passed on "a genuine oral tradition", teaching their children folk tales about The Edge, which included a description of a king and his army of knights that slept under it, guarded by a wizard.<ref name="Thompson"/> In the mid-19th century, Alan's great-great grandfather Robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the rock of a cliff next to a well, known locally at that time as the Wizard's Well.<ref>[[#Gar10|Garner 2010]]. pp. 08–09.</ref> Living in this rural environment, Robert Garner and his other relatives had all been craftsmen, with each successive generation trying to "improve on, or do something different from, the previous generation."<ref>[[#Gar10|Garner 2010]]. p. 07.</ref>

Alan's grandfather, Joseph Garner, "could read, but didn't and so was virtually unlettered". Instead, he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about The Edge;<ref name="Thompson"/> Alan later remarked that as a result he was "aware of [the Edge's] magic" as a child, when he and his friends often played there.<ref>[[#Gar10|Garner 2010]]. p. 09.</ref> The story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in the young Alan's life, becoming, he explained, "deeply embedded in my psyche", and heavily influencing his later novels.<ref name="Thompson"/>

Garner faced several life-threatening childhood illnesses.<ref name="Philips 1981"/> He went to a local village school, where he found that despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native [[Cheshire dialect]]:<ref name="Philips 1981"/> when he was six his primary school teacher washed out his mouth with soapy water.<ref name=Garth>{{cite journal | title=The Storyteller | author=Garth, John | journal=Oxford Today | year=2013 | month=Trinity Term | volume=25 | issue=2 | pages=44–48}}</ref> However, he was able to attend [[Manchester Grammar School]],<ref name="Philips 1981"/> as the fees were means-tested and therefore free to his family, before beginning to study Classics at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].<ref name=Garth/> Garner was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, although he noted that this removed him from his "cultural background" and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who "could not cope with me, and I could not cope with" them.<ref name="Thompson"/> Looking back, he remarked, "I soon learnt that it was not a good idea to come home excited over regular verbs".<ref name=Garth/>

In the summer holidays of 1956, he began to write, drafting the first chapter of ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen''. His parents persuaded him to return to Oxford for his second year, but during that [[Michaelmas term]] (in the autumn) the novel "just lay there, dead", as did the [[Homer]] of his academic studies. His tutor, Colin Hardie, told him he could leave to "discover whether you have an original mind"; failing that, he could return to complete his degree and study others. Thus Garner spent only four of the usual nine terms at Oxford.<ref name=Garth/>

===''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' and ''The Moon of Gomrath'': 1957–1964===

[[File:Toad Hall at Blackden.JPG|thumb|right|In 1957, Garner purchased and began renovating Toad Hall at Blackden in Cheshire.]]

In 1957, Garner purchased Toad Hall, a Late Mediaeval building in Blackden, seven miles away from Alderley Edge. In the late 19th century the Hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers' cottages, but Garner obtained both for a total of £670, and proceeded to convert it back into a single home.<ref>[[#Bla08|Blackden Trust 2008]].</ref>

It was at Toad Hall that Garner set about writing his first novel, which would be titled ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen|The Weirdstone of Brisingamen: A Tale of Alderley]]''. Set in Alderley Edge, it revolved around two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to live in the area with their mother's old nurse maid, Bess, and her husband, Gowther Mossock. Setting about to explore the Edge, they discover a race of malevolent creatures, the ''svart alfar'', who dwell in the Edge's abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them, until they are rescued by the wizard Cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are amassing at the Edge in search of the titular "weirdstone of Brisingamen". Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that "I couldn't write and teach; the energies were too similar", and so began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.<ref name="Thompson"/>

Garner sent his debut novel to the publishing company [[William Collins, Sons and Co Ltd|Collins]], where it was picked up by the company's head, Sir William Collins, who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–55).<ref name="Lake 2010. p. 317">[[#Lak10|Lake 2010]]. p. 317.</ref> Garner, who went on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that "Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it."<ref name="Lake 2010. p. 317"/> On its release in 1960, ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' proved to be a "resounding success... both critically and commercially", later being described as "a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children."<ref>[[#Lak10|Lake 2010]]. pp. 316–317.</ref>

[[File:Garner in the field.jpg|thumb|left|Garner at his home in Blackden, 2011.]]

With his first book published, Garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter, living a "hand to mouth" lifestyle on a "shoestring" budget.<ref name="Thompson"/> He also worked on a sequel to ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'', which would be known as ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''.

''The Moon of Gomrath'' also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan, with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the Brollachan who has recently entered the world. With the help of the wizard Cadellin, the Brollachan is exorcised, but Susan's soul also leaves her body, being sent to another dimension, leading Colin to find a way to bring it back.

In an interview given in 1989, Garner admitted that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan, envisioning a trilogy, but that he had intentionally decided not to write it, instead moving on to write something different.<ref name="Thompson"/> However ''Boneland'', the conclusion to the sequence, was belatedly published in August 2012.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/15/alan-garner-weirdstone-brisingamen-trilogy-boneland "Alan Garner to conclude Weirdstone of Brisingamen trilogy"].

===''Elidor'', ''The Owl Service'' and ''Red Shift'': 1964–1973===

Set in contemporary Manchester, ''Elidor'' tells the story of four children who enter into a broken down Victorian church, only to find a portal to the magical realm of Elidor. Here, they are entrusted by King Malebron to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting to take control of Elidor. Successfully doing so, the children return home to Manchester with the treasures, but are pursued by the evil forces who need them to seal their victory.

''The Owl Service'' was set in Wales, and used as its basis a story in the Mediaeval Welsh epic, the ''[[Mabinogion]]''.

===''The Stone Book'' series and Folkloric collections: 1974–1994===
''[[The Stone Book]]'' series (1976–1978, ''The Stone Book Quartet'' in its omnnibus editions)<ref name=isfdb-stonebook>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?12025 Stone Book series]. [[The Internet Speculative Fiction Database]]. Retrieved 11 July 2012.</ref> is poetic in style and inspiration. Garner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading "[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]": the footnotes would not have been needed by his father. This and other aspects of his work are the object of detailed analysis by Neil Philips in ''A Fine Anger: A Critical Introduction to the Work of Alan Garner'' (Collins, 1981)''.

In a 1989 interview, Garner noted that although writing ''The Stone Book Quartet'' had been "exhausting", it had been "the most rewarding of everything" he'd done to date.<ref name="Thompson"/>

===''Strandloper'', ''Thursbitch'' and ''Boneland'': From 1995 ===

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote =<poem>
As I turned toward writing, which is partially intellectual in its function, but is primarily intuitive and emotional in its execution, I turned towards that which was numinous and emotional in me, and that was the legend of King Arthur Asleep Under the Hill. It stood for all that I'd had to give up in order to understand what I'd had to give up. And so my first two books, which are very poor on characterization because I was somehow numbed in that area, are very strong on imagery and landscape, because the landscape I had inherited along with the legend.
</poem>
 |source = Alan Garner, 1989<ref name="Thompson"/>
}}

In 1996, Garner's novel ''[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]'' was published. His collection of essays and public talks, ''The Voice That Thunders'', contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with [[bipolar disorder]]), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In ''The Voice That Thunders'' he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought (at the height of the [[neoliberal]] tide) which preceded ''Strandloper'' to 'forsake "literature", and become instead a "popular" writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'.<ref>Alan Garner, ''The Voice That Thunders'' (London 1997), p. 35.</ref> Garner feared that "making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death"<ref>Garner, ''Thunders'', p. 36.</ref> – perhaps on analogy with [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]]'s dictum that "the ruin of every novelist ... has been effected by driving him into a groove"<ref>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, ''The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' (London 2001), p. 203.</ref> – and felt unable to comply.

Garner's novel, ''[[Thursbitch]]'', was published in 2003. Garner's novel, ''Boneland'', was published in 2012, nominally completing a trilogy begun some 50 years earlier with ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]''.

==Literary style==

{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right
 |quote =<poem>
I have four filing cabinets of correspondence from readers, and over the years the message is clear and unwavering. Readers under the age of eighteen read what I write with more passion, understanding, and clarity of perception than do adults. Adults bog down, claim that I'm difficult, obscurantist, wilful, and sometimes simply trying to confuse. I'm not; I'm just trying to get the simple story simply told... I didn't consciously set out to write for children, but somehow I connect with them. I think that's something to do with my psychopathology, and I'm not equipped to evaluate it.
</poem>
 |source = Alan Garner, 1989<ref name="Thompson"/>
}}

Although Garner's early work is often labelled as "children's literature", Garner himself rejects such a description, informing one interviewer that "I certainly have never written for children" but that instead he has always written purely for himself.<ref name="Thompson"/> Neil Philip, in his critical study of Garner's work (1981), commented that up till that point, "Everything Alan Garner has published has been published for children",<ref>[[#Phi81|Philip 1981]]. p. 7.</ref> although he went on to relate that "It may be that Garner's is a case" where the division between children's and adult's literature is "meaningless" and that his fiction is instead "enjoyed by a type of person, no matter what their age."<ref>[[#Phi81|Philips 1981]]. p. 8.</ref>

The English author and academic [[Charles Butler (author)|Charles Butler]] noted that Garner was attentive to the "geological, archaeological and cultural history of his settings, and careful to integrate his fiction with the physical reality beyond the page."<ref>[[#But09|Butler 2009]]. p. 146.</ref> As a part of this, Garner had included maps of Alderley Edge in both ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' and ''The Moon of Gomrath''.<ref>[[#But09|Butler 2009]]. pp. 146–147.</ref> Garner has spent much time investigating the areas that he deals with in his books; writing in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' in 1968, Garner commented that in preparation for writing his book ''Elidor'':

:I had to read extensively textbooks on physics, Celtic symbolism, unicorns, medieval watermarks, megalithic archaeology; study the writings of [[Carl Jung|Jung]]; brush up my [[Plato]]; visit [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill|Silbury]] and [[Coventry Cathedral]]; spend a lot of time with demolition gangs on slum clearance sites; and listen to the whole of [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'' nearly every day.<ref>[[#Gar68|Garner 1968]]. p. 577.</ref>

==Recognition and legacy==

[[File:The Medicine House.JPG|thumb|right|The Medicine House, an Early Modern building that was moved to Blackden by Garner.]]

In the fiftieth anniversary edition of ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'', published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2010, several notable British fantasy novelists praised Garner and his work. [[Susan Cooper]] related that "The power and range of Alan Garner's astounding talent has grown with every book he's written", whilst [[David Almond]] called him one of Britain's "greatest writers" whose works "really matter".<ref>[[#Pul10|Pullman et al 2010]]. p. 02.</ref> [[Philip Pullman]], the author of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy, went further when he remarked that:

:"Garner is indisputably the great originator, the most important British writer of fantasy since [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], and in many respects better than Tolkien, because deeper and more truthful... Any country except Britain would have long ago recognised his importance, and celebrated it with postage stamps and statues and street-names. But that's the way with us: our greatest prophets go unnoticed by the politicians and the owners of media empires. I salute him with the most heartfelt respect and admiration."<ref name="Pullman p. 01">[[#Pul10|Pullman et al 2010]]. p. 01.</ref>

Another British fantasy writer, [[Neil Gaiman]], claimed that "Garner's fiction is something special" in that it was "smart and challenging, based in the here and the now, in which real English places emerged from the shadows of folklore, and in which people found themselves walking, living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth."<ref name="Pullman p. 01"/> Praise also came from Nick Lake, the editorial director of [[HarperCollins]] Children's Books, who proclaimed that "Garner is, quite simply, one of the greatest and most influential writers this country has ever produced."<ref>[[#Lak10|Lake 2010]]. pp. 315–316.</ref>
