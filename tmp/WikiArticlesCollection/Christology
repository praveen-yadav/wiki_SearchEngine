'''Christology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Χριστός ''Khristós'' and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the field of study within [[Christian theology]] which is primarily concerned with the nature and person of [[Jesus Christ]] as recorded in the [[canonical Gospels]] and the [[New Testament Epistles|epistles]] of the [[New Testament]].<ref name=Gerald3>''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X pages 1-3</ref> Primary considerations include the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of [[God the Father]]. As such, Christology is concerned with the details of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry, his acts and teachings]], to arrive at a clearer understanding of who he is in his person, and his role in [[Christian salvation|salvation]].<ref name=CathChristology>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14597a.htm Catholic encyclopedia: Christology]</ref> A major component of the Christology of the [[Apostolic Age]] was that of [[Paul the Apostle]]. His central themes were the notion of the [[pre-existence of Christ]] and the worship of Christ as ''[[Kyrios (Biblical term)|Kyrios]]'' ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: ''Lord'').<ref name=Aloys >''Christ in Christian Tradition: From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon' by Aloys Grillmeier, John Bowden 1975 ISBN 0-664-22301-X pages 15-19 [http://books.google.com/books?id=LH-cBwmmY2cC&pg=PA15&dq=Pauline+Christology&hl=en&ei=udXdTJ7NAYvHswa0lKCLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Pauline%20Christology&f=false]</ref>

The [[pre-existence of Christ]] is considered a central theme of Christology. Proponents of Christ's deity argue the Old Testament has many cases of [[Christophany]]: "The pre-existence of Christ is further substantiated by the many recorded Christophanies in the Bible."<ref>''Theology for Today'' by [[Elmer Towns|Elmer L. Towns]] 2008 ISBN 0-15-516138-5 page 173</ref> Christophany is often considered a more accurate term than the term [[Theophany]] due to the belief that all the visible manifestations of God (or Jehovah) are in fact the preincarnate Christ. Many argue that the appearances of "[[Angel of the Lord|the Angel of the Lord]]" in the Old Testament were the preincarnate Christ. "Many understand the angel of the Lord as a true theophany. From the time of Justin on, the figure has been regarded as the preincarnate [[Logos]]."<ref>"[[Angel of the Lord]]" by T. E. McComiskey in ''The Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'' 2001 ISBN 0-8010-2075-1 page 62</ref>

Following the [[Apostolic Age]], there was fierce and often politicized debate in the [[Early centers of Christianity|early church]] on many interrelated issues. Christology was a major focus of these debates, and was addressed at every one of the [[first seven ecumenical councils]]. The second through fourth of these councils are generally entitled "Christological councils," with the latter three mainly elucidating what was taught in them and condemning incorrect interpretations.<ref name="first seven">{{Citation|last=Davis, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]]|first=Leo Donald|title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)|year=1990|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5616-7|pages=342}}</ref> The [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 issued a formulation of the being of Christ &mdash; that of two natures, one human and one divine, "united with neither confusion nor division."<ref name="first seven"/> This is called the doctrine of the [[hypostatic union]],<ref name="first seven"/> which is still held today amongst most [[Protestant]], [[Catholic]], and [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, referred to as [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].

==Terms and concepts==
{{see also|Christ|Incarnation|Resurrection}}
{{Christology}}
Over the centuries, a number of terms and concepts have been developed within the framework of Christology to address the seemingly simple questions: "who was Jesus and what did he do?" A good deal of theological debate has ensued and significant schisms within Christian denominations took place in the process of providing answers to these questions. After the [[Middle Ages]], systematic approaches to Christology were developed.

The term "Christology from above" refers to approaches that begin with the [[Divinity of Christ|divinity]] and [[pre-existence of Christ]] as the ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'' (the Word), as expressed in the [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1|prologue to the Gospel of John]] ({{bibleref|John|1:1-14|ESV}}). These approaches interpret the works of Christ in terms of his divinity. Christology from above was emphasized in the ancient Church, beginning with [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in the second century.<ref name=Gerald16/><ref name=Pannenberg33>''Jesus God and Man'' by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 ISBN 0-664-24468-8 page 33</ref> The term "Christology from below", on the other hand, refers to approaches that begin with the human aspects and the ministry of Jesus (including the miracles, parables, etc.) and move towards his divinity and the mystery of incarnation.<ref name=Gerald16>''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X pages 16-17</ref><ref name=Pannenberg33/>

The concept of "Cosmic Christology", first elaborated by [[Saint Paul]], focuses on how the arrival of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] forever changed the nature of the [[cosmos]].<ref name=Aloys /><ref name="Jesus page 282">''The Witness of Jesus, Paul and John: An Exploration in Biblical Theology'' by Larry R. Helyer 2008 ISBN 0-8308-2888-5 page 282</ref> The terms "functional", "[[Ontology|ontological]]" and "[[Christian soteriology|soteriological]]" have been used to refer to the perspectives that analyze the "works", the "being" and the "[[Christian soteriology|salvific]]" standpoints of Christology.<ref>''Christology from within and ahead'' by Mark L. Y. Chan 2001 ISBN 90-04-11844-6 pages 59-62 [http://books.google.com/books?id=9NQJ74t0aE4C&pg=PA59&dq=ontological+christology&hl=en&ei=n6rfTOTAJM2Kswbao6X8Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ontological%20christology&f=false]</ref> Some essential sub-topics within the field of Christology include the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], and [[Christian salvation|salvation]].

The term "monastic Christology" has been used to describe spiritual approaches developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. The [[Franciscan]] piety of the 12th and 13th centuries led to "popular Christology". Systematic approaches by theologians, such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], are called "scholastic Christology".<ref name=mini7 >''Christology: Biblical And Historical'' by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 74-76 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&pg=PA74&dq=christology+franciscan&hl=en&ei=px3jTNHFJc3BswaKu7XnCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=christology%20franciscan&f=false]</ref>

==Beginnings==
[[File:V&A - Raphael, St Paul Preaching in Athens (1515).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Saint Paul]] delivering the ''[[Areopagus sermon]]'' in [[Athens]], by [[Raphael]], 1515]]

[[Early Christians]] found themselves confronted with a set of new concepts and ideas relating to the life, death and [[resurrection of Jesus]], as well the notions of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] and [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redemption]], and had to use a new set of terms, images and ideas to deal with them.<ref name=McGrath >''Christianity: an introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath pages 2006 ISBN 1-4051-0901-7 137-141</ref> The existing terms and structures available to them were often insufficient to express these religious concepts, and taken together, these new forms of discourse led to the beginnings of Christology as an attempt to understand, explain and discuss their understanding of the nature of Christ.<ref name=McGrath />

Furthermore, as early Christians (following the [[Great Commission]]) had to explain their concepts to a new audience which
had at times been influenced by Greek philosophy, they had to present arguments that at times
resonated with, and at times confronted, the beliefs of that audience. A key example is the [[Apostle Paul]]'s [[Areopagus sermon]] that appears in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16-34|NIV|}}. Here, the apostle attempted to convey the underlying concepts about Christ to a Greek audience, and the sermon illustrates some key elements of future Christological discourses that were first brought forward by Paul.<ref name=McGrath /><ref>''Creation and redemption: a study in Pauline theology'' by John G. Gibbs 1971 Brill Publishers pages 151-153</ref><ref name=Watson >''Mercer Commentary on the New Testament'' by Watson E. Mills 2003 ISBN 0-86554-864-1 pages 1109-1110</ref>

The [[Kyrios|''Kyrios'' title]] for Jesus is central to the development of [[New Testament]] Christology, for the [[Early Christianity|early Christians]] placed it at the center of their understanding, and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries.<ref name=MiniJohnson >''Christology: Biblical And Historical'' by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 229-235 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&pg=PA231&dq=Kyrios+christology&hl=en&ei=hTbeTIlPzfiyBoT30fUL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Kyrios%20christology&f=false]</ref> The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the ''Kyrios'' title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of ''Kyrios'' included the [[pre-existence of Christ]], for they believed if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning.<ref name=MiniJohnson /><ref name=Cullmann >''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 pages 234-237 [http://books.google.com/books?id=79Zovlpi8uQC&pg=PA234&dq=Kyrios&hl=en&ei=WtjdTIyAHcfzsgb_qbCTDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Kyrios&f=false]</ref>

In everyday [[Aramaic]], ''Mari'' was a very respectful form of polite address, which means more than just "Teacher" and was somewhat similar to [[Rabbi]]. In Greek, this has at times been translated as ''Kyrios''. While the term ''Mari'' expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek ''Kyrios'' came to represent his lordship over the world.<ref name=Cullmann2 >''The Christology of the New Testament'' by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 202 [http://books.google.com/books?id=79Zovlpi8uQC&pg=PA202&dq=mari+aramaic+jesus&hl=en&ei=DUDeTMDXGoT2sgbW5tmEDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=mari%20aramaic%20jesus&f=false]</ref>

===Apostolic Christology===
[[File:The Four Evangelists.jpg|thumb|240px|left|The [[Four Evangelists]], by [[Pieter Soutman]], 17th century]]
{{cquote2|<center>And he asked them, "But who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." — {{bibleref|Matthew|16:15-16|ESV}}, [[English Standard Version|ESV]]</center>}}
No writings were left by Jesus, and the study of the various Christologies of the [[Apostolic Age]] is based on early Christian documents.<ref name=Gerald3 /> The Gospels provide episodes from the life of Jesus and some of his works, but the authors of the New Testament show little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life,<ref name=Rahner731 >''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 page 731</ref> and as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#21:25|John 21:25]], the Gospels do not claim to be an exhaustive list of his works.<ref name=Gerald3 /> 

Christologies that can be gleaned from the three [[Synoptic Gospels]] generally emphasize the humanity of Jesus, his sayings, his [[Parables of Jesus|parables]], and his [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]]. The [[Gospel of John]] provides a different perspective that focuses on his divinity.<ref name=CathChristology /> The first 14 verses of the Gospel of John are devoted to the divinity of Jesus as the ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', usually translated as "Word", along with his pre-existence, and they emphasize the cosmic significance of Christ, e.g. {{bibleverse||John|1:3|ESV}}: "All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." In the context of these verses, the Word made flesh is identical with the Word who was in the beginning with God, being exegetically equated with Jesus.<ref name=CathChristology />

A foremost contribution to the Christology of the Apostolic Age is that of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. The central Christology of Paul conveys the notion of Christ's pre-existence and the identification of Christ as ''[[Kyrios (Biblical term)|Kyrios]]''.<ref name="Aloys" /> The [[Pauline epistles]] use ''Kyrios'' to identify Jesus almost 230 times, and express the theme that the true mark of a Christian is the confession of Jesus as the true Lord.<ref name=Gerald142 >''Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus'' by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X page 142</ref> Paul viewed the superiority of the Christian revelation over all other divine manifestations as a consequence of the fact that Christ is the [[Son of God]].<ref name=CathChristology />

The Pauline epistles also advanced the "cosmic Christology" later developed in the fourth gospel, elaborating the cosmic implications of Jesus' existence as the Son of God, as in {{bibleref|2&nbsp;Corinthians|5:17|ESV}}: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come." Also, in {{bibleref|Colossians|1:15|ESV}}: "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation."<ref name=Aloys /><ref name="Jesus page 282"/>

Eventually, by the [[Ecumenical Council]] of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon in 451]], the ''[[Hypostatic union]]'' was decreed&mdash;the proposition that Christ has one human nature ''<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[physis]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>'' and one divine nature ''[physis]'', united with neither confusion nor division&mdash;making this part of the creed of [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Christianity]].<ref name=Editors1999/><ref name=Rausch2003/> Although some of the debates seems, for a modern student, to be over a theological [[iota]], they took place in controversial political circumstances, reflecting the relations of temporal powers and divine authority, it certaintly resulted in schisms, among others what separated the [[Church of the East]] from the Church of the Roman Empire.<ref>Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, Vol XIV p207, translated edition by H.R.

In 325, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] defined the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] and their relationship with one another - decisions which were reratified at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. The language used was that the one God exists in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit); in particular, it was affirmed that the Son was ''[[homoousios]]'' (of same substance) as the Father. The [[Nicene Creed]] declared the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus.<ref>Jonathan Kirsch, ''God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism'' (2004)</ref><ref>Charles Freeman, ''The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason'' (2002)</ref><ref>Edward Gibbons, ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' (1776-88), 21</ref>

In 431, the [[First Council of Ephesus]] was initially called to address the views of [[Nestorius]] on [[Mariology]], but the problems soon extended to Christology, and schisms followed. The 431 council was called because in defense of his loyal priest Anastasius, Nestorius had denied the ''[[Theotokos]]'' title for [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] and later contradicted [[Proclus]] during a sermon in [[Constantinople]]. Pope [[Celestine I]] (who was already upset with Nestorius due to other matters) wrote about this to [[Cyril of Alexandria]], who orchestrated the council. During the council, Nestorius defended his position by arguing there must be two persons of Christ, one human, the other divine, and Mary had given birth only to a human, hence could not be called the ''Theotokos'', i.e. "the one who gives birth to God". The debate about the single or dual nature of Christ ensued in Ephesus.<ref>''The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology'' by Berard L.

==Christological issues==

===Person of Christ===
[[File:Christ Pantocrator niche Holy Trinity Meteora.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Pantocrator]], Holy Trinity's monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]
{{Main|Person of Christ}}
{{See also|Trinity|Hypostatic union}}

The '''Person of Christ''' refers to the study of the human and divine natures of [[Christ|Jesus Christ]] as they coexist within one person.<ref name=Erickson >''Introducing Christian Doctrine'' by Millard J. Erickson, L. Arnold Hustad 2001 ISBN page 234</ref> There are no direct discussions in the [[New Testament]] regarding the [[Hypostatic union|dual nature]] of the Person of Christ as both divine and human.<ref name=Erickson /> Hence, since the early days of Christianity, theologians have debated various approaches to the understanding of these natures, at times resulting in schisms.<ref name=Erickson />

Historically in the Alexandrian school of thought (fashioned on the [[Gospel of John]]), Jesus Christ is the [[Logos (Christianity)|eternal ''Logos'']] who already possesses unity with the Father before the act of [[Incarnation]].<ref name=Waldrop >''Karl Barth's christology'' by Charles T. Waldrop 1985 ISBN 90-279-3109-7 pages 19-23</ref> In contrast, the Antiochian school views Christ as a single, unified human person apart from his relationship to the divine.<ref name=Waldrop />

[[John Calvin]] maintained there was no human element in the Person of Christ which could be separated from the Person of [[Logos (Christianity)|The Word]].<ref>''Calvin's Christology'' by Stephen Edmondson 2004 ISBN 0-521-54154-9 page 217</ref> Calvin also emphasized the importance of the "Work of Christ" in any attempt at understanding the Person of Christ and cautioned against ignoring the Works of Jesus during his ministry.<ref>''Calvin's First Catechism'' by I. John Hesselink 1997 ISBN 0-664-22725-2 page 217</ref>

The study of the Person of Christ continued into the 20th century, with modern theologians such as [[Karl Rahner]] and [[Hans Urs von Balthasar|Hans von Balthasar]]. Rahner pointed out the coincidence between the Person of Christ and the Word of God, referring to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#8:38|Mark 8:38]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#9:26|Luke 9:26]] which state whoever is ashamed of the words of Jesus is ashamed of the Lord himself.<ref>''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 page 1822</ref> Balthasar argued the union of the human and divine natures of Christ was achieved not by the "absorption" of human attributes, but by their "assumption". Thus, in his view, the divine nature of Christ was not affected by the human attributes and remained forever divine.<ref>''The eschatology of Hans Urs von Balthasar'' by Nicholas J. Healy 2005 ISBN 0-19-927836-9 pages 22-23</ref>

===Nativity and the Holy Name===
{{see also|Nativity of Jesus|Holy Name of Jesus}}

The [[Nativity of Jesus]] impacted the Christological issues about his Person from the earliest days of Christianity. Luke's Christology centers on the dialectics of the dual natures of the earthly and heavenly manifestations of existence of the Christ, while Matthew's Christology focuses on the mission of Jesus and his role as the savior.<ref>''Theology of the New Testament'' by Georg Strecker 2000 ISBN 0-664-22336-2 pages 401-403</ref><ref>''Matthew'' by [[Grant R. Osborne]] 2010 ISBN 0-310-32370-3 lxxix</ref> The [[Christian soteriology|salvific]] emphasis of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:21|Matthew 1:21]] later impacted the theological issues and the devotions to [[Holy Name of Jesus]].<ref>''Matthew 1-13'' by Manlio Simonetti 2001 ISBN 0-8308-1486-8 page 17</ref><ref>Matthew 1-2/ Luke 1-2'' by Louise Perrotta 2004 ISBN 0-8294-1541-6 page 19</ref><ref>''All the Doctrines of the Bible'' by Herbert Lockyer 1988 ISBN 0-310-28051-6 page 159</ref>

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:23|Matthew 1:23]] provides a key to the "Emmanuel Christology" of Matthew. Beginning with 1:23, Matthew shows a clear interest in identifying Jesus as "God with us" and in later developing the Emmanuel characterization of Jesus at key points throughout the rest of his Gospel.<ref name=Kupp >''Matthew's Emmanuel'' by David D. Kupp 1997 ISBN 0-521-57007-7 pages 220-224</ref> The name Emmanuel does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on it in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:20|Matthew 28:20]] ("I am with you always, even unto the end of the world") to indicate Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.<ref name=Kupp /><ref name=Kingsbury17 >''Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 ISBN 0-664-25752-6 page 17</ref> According to [[Ulrich Luz]], the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages.<ref>''The theology of the Gospel of Matthew'' by Ulrich Luz 1995 ISBN 0-521-43576-5 page 31</ref>

===Crucifixion and Resurrection===
{{Main|Crucifixion of Jesus|Resurrection of Jesus|}}
The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent [[resurrection of Jesus]] provides a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the [[Pauline Epistles]].<ref>''Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology'' by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 ISBN 0-664-25752-6 page 106</ref>

A central element in the Christology presented in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan".<ref name=Matera67  >''New Testament christology'' by Frank J. Matera 1999 ISBN 0-664-25694-5 page 67</ref> In this view, as in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:23|Acts 2:23]], the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus "at the hands of the  lawless" is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.<ref name=Matera67 /><ref>''The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns'' by Marion L. Soards 1994 ISBN 0-664-25221-4 page 34</ref>

Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term "the cross of Christ" used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.<ref name=Schwarz132 >''Christology'' by Hans Schwarz 1998 ISBN 0-8028-4463-4 pages 132-134</ref> For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant [[eschatological]] consequences, as in Cor 2:8.<ref name=Schwarz132 /> In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Phil 2:8), died "at the right time" (Rom 4:25) based on the plan of God.<ref name=Schwarz132 /> For Paul, the "power of the cross" is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.<ref name=Schwarz132 />

===Threefold office===
{{Main|threefold office}}

The [[threefold office]] (Latin ''munus triplex'') of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] is a [[Christian]] doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by [[Eusebius]] and more fully developed by [[John Calvin]]. It states that Jesus [[Christ]] performed three functions (or "offices") in his earthly ministry - those of [[prophet]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018:14-22;&version=31; Deuteronomy 18:14-22]), [[priest]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20110:1-4;&version=31; Psalm 110:1-4]), and [[kingly office of Christ|king]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202;&version=31; Psalm 2]).  In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head.  Thus, the term messiah, meaning "anointed one", is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the [[Book of Hebrews]].

===Mariology===
{{main|Roman Catholic Mariology}}
Some Christians, notably [[RCTerm|Roman Catholics]], view [[Mariology]] as a key component of Christology.<ref>"Mariology Is Christology", in [[Vittorio Messori]], ''The Mary Hypothesis'', Rome: 2005. [http://www.zenit.org/article-14658?l=english]</ref> In this view, not only is Mariology a logical and necessary consequence of Christology, but without it, Christology is incomplete, since the figure of Mary contributes to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did.<ref>Paul Haffner, 2004 ''The mystery of Mary'' Gracewing Press ISBN 0-85244-650-0 page 17</ref> Certain Christian traditions of Protestant heritage tend not to hold this view.

[[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) expressed this sentiment about [[Roman Catholic Mariology]] when in two separate occasions he stated, "The appearance of a truly Marian awareness serves as the touchstone indicating whether or not the Christological substance is fully present"<ref>[[Communio]], 1996, Volume 23, page 175</ref> and "It is necessary to go back to Mary, if we want to return to the truth about Jesus Christ."<ref>Raymond Burke, 2008 ''Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, seminarians, and Consecrated Persons'' ISBN 1-57918-355-7 page xxi</ref>
