{{TopicTOC-Chemistry}}
The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to chemistry:

'''[[Chemistry]]''' &ndash; [[science]] of atomic [[matter]] (matter that is composed of [[chemical element]]s), especially its [[chemical reaction]]s, but also including its properties, structure, composition, behavior, and changes as they relate the chemical reactions.<ref name=definition>{{cite web|url=http://chemweb.ucc.ie/what_is_chemistry.htm |title=What is Chemistry? |publisher=Chemweb.ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-06-12}}</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.</ref> Chemistry is centrally concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms, and particularly with the properties of [[chemical bond]]s.

== Nature of chemistry ==
Chemistry can be described as all of the following:
* An [[academic discipline]]: one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals.
* A scientific field (a branch of [[science]]) &ndash; widely-recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are several geophysics-related scientific journals.
** A [[natural science]] &ndash; one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world using [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]].
*** A [[physical science]] &ndash; one that studies non-living systems.
*** A [[biological science]] &ndash; one that studies the role of chemicals and chemical processes in living organisms. ''See [[Outline of biochemistry]].''

==Branches of chemistry==
* [[Physical chemistry]] &ndash; study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include [[chemical thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[electrochemistry]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[spectroscopy]], and more recently, [[astrochemistry]].<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Herbst, Eric | title = Chemistry of Star-Forming Regions | journal = Journal of Physical Chemistry A | date = May 12, 2005 | volume = 109 | pages = 4017–4029 | issue = 18 | doi = 10.1021/jp050461c | pmid = 16833724}}</ref>  Physical chemistry has large overlap with [[molecular physics]].

'''The Atomic Model Timeline'''
* The idea of what an atom is has changed over time.
* Different scientists and their discoveries have led to the development of the current model of an atom.
* Other examples include:
** The [[solar system]] (BIG made SMALL)
** The [[biological cell]] (SMALL made BIG)

The [[Democritus]] Model
* A Greek philosopher
* He conceived the idea of the atom to describe matter.
* [[Atom]] comes from the word ''atomos'' which means "indivisible".
* He believed that matter was finite (had a limit)
* He believed the smallest piece of matter was an indestructible and indivisible particle which he called the "atom".
