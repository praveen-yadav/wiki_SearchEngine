In many legal jurisdictions related to [[English law#Common law|English common law]], '''affray''' is a [[public order]] offence consisting of the fighting of one or more persons in a public place to the terror (in {{lang-fr|à l'effroi}}) of ordinary people (the ''[[wikt:liege|lieges]]'').  Depending on their actions, and the laws of the prevailing jurisdiction, those engaged in an affray may also render themselves liable to prosecution for [[assault]], [[riot act|unlawful assembly]], or [[riot]]; if so, it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged.<ref name="britannica">"Affray", [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1911</ref>

==Australia==
In [[Queensland]], section 72 of the Criminal Code of 1899<ref>Schedule 1 to the [[Criminal Code Act 1899]] (Qld)</ref> defines affray as taking part in a fight in a public [[highway]] or taking part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access.

Section 72 says "Any person who takes part in a fight in a public place, or takes part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access, commits a misdemeanour. Maximum penalty—1 year’s imprisonment."<ref>[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf "Criminal Code Act 1899"], retrieved 22 July 2009 from the website of the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel</ref>
