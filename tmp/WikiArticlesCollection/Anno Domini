'''''{{lang|la|Anno Domini}}''''' ('''AD''' or '''A.D.''') and '''Before Christ''' ('''BC''' or '''B.C.''') are designations used to label or number years used with the  [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s.

It is sometimes specified more fully as ''Anno Domini Nostri Iesu (Jesu) Christi'' ("In the Year of Our Lord Jesus Christ"). This  [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years from the start of this [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the era. There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&nbsp;BC.  This dating system was devised in 525, but was not widely used until after 800.<ref name=Teresi1997>{{cite journal|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm|authorlink=Dick Teresi|first=Dick|last=Teresi|title=Zero|journal=[[The Atlantic]]|date=July 1997}}

The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted for pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation and commercial integration and recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Universal Postal Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html|author=Eastman, Allan|title=A Month of Sundays|publisher=Date and Time|accessdate=2010-05-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100506002355/http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html| archivedate=2010-05-06 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}
</ref>

Traditionally, [[English language|English]]  followed [[Latin]] usage by placing the abbreviation before the year number for AD.<ref>This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''Anno 500'' means "in the year 500"; ''anno domini 500'' means "in the year 500 of Our Lord". Just as "500 in the year" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas "AD 500" preserves syntactic order when translated.</ref>
Since BC is not derived from Latin it is placed after the year number (for example: AD&nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&nbsp;BC). However, placing the AD after the year number (as in "{{CURRENTYEAR}}&nbsp;AD") is also becoming common usage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).<ref>''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.
</ref> Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However this would mean that the ~33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be present in either BC or AD time scales.<ref>Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.

As the reckoning to the year of the birth of Jesus has become a global standard, a terminology that is inclusive of non-Christian peoples is to call this the [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE or C.E.), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common Era (BCE or B.C.E.).

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]  to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]].
His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767</ref> The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".<ref>[http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.</ref> Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred.

:However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], year of the world, or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.<ref name=BHS>{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003}}</ref>{{rp|778}}

Blackburn & Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:<ref name=BHS/>{{rp|778–9}}
*In modern times Incarnation is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered Incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity
*The civil, or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August
*There were inaccuracies in the list of consuls
*There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years

It has also been speculated by [[Declercq|Georges Declercq]]<ref>Declercq, Georges, "Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000</ref> that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]].  At the time it was believed that the [[Resurrection of the dead|Resurrection]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus.  The old [[Anno Mundi]] calendar theoretically commenced with the [[creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]].  It was believed that based on the Anno Mundi calendar Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006</ref><ref>Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328</ref> Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection of Christ and the end of the world <ref>Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000</ref> but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.  Dionysius therefore searched for a new end of the world at a later date. He was heavily influenced by ancient [[cosmology]], in particular the doctrine of the [[Great Year]] that places a strong emphasis on [[planetary conjunction]]s.  Dionysius decided that when all the planets were in conjunction this cosmic event would mark the end of the world.  Dionysius accurately calculated that this conjunction would occur in May AD 2000, about 1500 years after the life of Dionysius. Dionysius then applied another cosmological timing mechanism based on [[precession of the equinoxes]] (that had only been discovered about six centuries earlier).  Though incorrect, many people at the time believed that the precessional cycle was 24,000 years which included twelve [[astrological age]]s of 2,000 years each.  Dionysius believed that if the planetary alignment of May 2000 marked the end of an age, then the birth of Jesus Christ marked the beginning of the age 2,000 years earlier on the 23rd March (the date of the Northern Hemisphere Spring Equinox and beginning of many yearly calendars from ancient times).  He therefore deducted 2,000 years from the May 2000 conjunction to produce AD 1<ref>Consideration of the Origin of the Yearly Count in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars. Cosmology Through Time.

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used Anno Domini dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', finished in 731. In this same history he also used another [[Latin]] term, "''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus''" ("the time before the Lord's true incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era,<ref>Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.</ref>
thus establishing the standard of not using a [[year zero]],<ref>Compare Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence, with Chapter 3.</ref> even though he used zero in his [[computus]]. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded Anno Domini as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" (''Annunciation style'').<ref name=BHS/>{{rp|881}}

On the continent of [[Europe]], Anno Domini was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by [[Alcuin]]. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings|his successors]] popularizing the usage of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.<ref name=CathEncy>Gerard, 1908</ref>  In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.<ref name=CathEncy-Chron >

[[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Even though Anno Domini was in widespread use by the 9th century, Before Christ (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression "''anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam''" (before the Incarnation of the Lord) twice. "''Anno an xpi nativitate''" (before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.<ref>[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. "xpi" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is a cryptic abbreviation for ''christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno christi'' or its cryptic form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.</ref> In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.<ref>

===Change of year===
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation started replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, different people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, year number changed on different days, which created slightly different styles in chronology:<ref>[http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf C.R. Cheney, ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history'', Cambridge University Press, 1945–2000, pp. 8–14.]</ref>
* from 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e. from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called "calculus pisanus" since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* from 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e. from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] together with the Anno Domini in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) till the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany till the second quarter of the 13th century.
* from 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second "Annunciation style" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to the one of Pisa, so it got the name of "calculus florentinus". It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1751.
* from Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That "mos gallicanus" bound to a movable feast was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (1165–1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101. The Annunciation style also caused a major problem: in some years, there was no Easter, and in other years, that feast was celebrated twice; for example, Easter occurred on 23 March 1504 (i.e. in 1505 for us) and on 12 April 1506, but not in 1505.<ref>[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/easter/easter_text2a.htm Easter Sunday/Jewish Passover calculator]</ref>

==Historical birth date of Jesus==
:''See also: [[Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Nativity of Jesus]] and [[Chronology of Jesus#Year of birth|Chronology of Jesus]]''

According to Doggett, "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".<ref>Doggett 1992, 579.</ref> According to [[Matthew 2:1]]<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:1|KJV}}</ref> [[Herod the Great|King Herod the Great]] was alive when [[Chronology of Jesus|Jesus was born]], and [[Matthew 2:16]],<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|2:16|KJV}}</ref> says Herod ordered the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] in response to Jesus' birth. Blackburn and Holford-Strevens fix King Herod's death shortly before [[Passover]] in 4 BC<ref name=BHS/>{{rp|770}}, and say that those who accept the story of the Massacre of the Innocents sometimes associate the star that led the [[Biblical Magi]] with the [[Conjunction (astronomy)|planetary conjunction]] of 15 September 7 BC or [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] of 12 BC (less likely since comets were usually considered bad omens); even historians who do not accept the Massacre accept the birth under Herod as a tradition older than the written gospels.<ref name=BHS/>{{rp|776}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Jesus was conceived during the reign of Herod the Great{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:5-38}} (''i.e.'', before 4 BC) while also stating that Jesus was born when [[Quirinius|Cyrenius]] (or Quirinius) was the governor of [[Syria]] and carried out the [[Census of Quirinius|census]] of the Roman provinces of Syria and Iudaea.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:1-3}} The Jewish historian [[Josephus]], in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (''ca.'' AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and that the census occurred sometime between AD 6&ndash;7,<ref>Flavius Josephus. [http://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&cd=2#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1–2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (''i.e.'', Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (''i.e.'', Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to 2 September 31 BC. Therefore 31 BC + 37 years = AD 6&ndash;7.</ref>
which is incompatible with a conception prior to 4 BC. On this point, Blackburn and Holford-Strevens state that "St. Luke raises greater difficulty ... Most critics therefore discard Luke".

The Gospel of Luke also states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" {{Bibleref2c|Luke|3:23}} during the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar {{Bibleref2c|Luke|3:1}}.  Tiberius began his reign as Caesar in September of AD 14. The 15th year of his reign would then be AD 28 or 29. If Jesus was born in 5 or 4 BC, that would put the start of Jesus' ministry around age 32 to 34. Most scholars do not see this as a contradiction of Luke's claim that Jesus was "about thirty years old." Some scholars rely on John 8:57:<ref>{{Bibleverse||John|8:57|KJV|}}</ref> "thou are not yet fifty years old", making the earliest possible year for Jesus's birth c. 18 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=776}} "Most critics therefor discard Luke; some have rehabilitated John, who seems to imply that Jesus was born ''c''. 18 BC."</ref>{{rp|776}}

==Other eras==
{{Further2|[[Calendar era]]}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for all of the years of their reign alongside their regnal years.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.</ref> Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this Incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were only used, and are still only used, in [[Ethiopia]], accounting for the eight- or seven-year discrepancy between the Gregorian and the [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the World. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the Christian world. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).<ref>Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.</ref>

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.<ref name=CathEncy/>

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]], and is still used officially by the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] church. It also used to be used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion]] of Jesus Christ, which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in the occasional medieval manuscript.

The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.
</ref>
the alternative abbreviations [[Common Era|CE and BCE]] are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

Anno Domini is sometimes referred to as the Common Era, Christian Era, or Current Era (abbreviated as ''C.E.'' or ''CE'').
CE is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly use religious titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce_info1.htm |author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Justification of the use of "CE" & "BCE" to identify dates. Trends |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org|date=20 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html |author=William Safire|title=On Language: B.C./A.D. or B.C.E./C.E.?|journal=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=17 August 1997}}</ref>
For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and hence are more appropriate for [[interfaith dialog]] than the conventional B.C./A.D." Upon its foundation, the [[Republic of China]] adopted the [[Minguo Era]], but used the Western calendar for international purposes. The translated term was 西元 ("Western Era"). Later, in 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] adopted 公元 (''gōngyuán'', "Common Era") for all purposes domestic and foreign.

==No year zero==
{{further|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them. Because of this, most experts agree that a new century begins in a year with the last digits being "01" (1801, 1901, 2001); new millennia likewise began in 1001 and 2001.  A common misconception is that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.);<ref name="Teresi1997"/> moreover, this convention  was widely used to celebrate the new millennium in the year 2000.  For computational reasons [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.<ref>To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero).  For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0). [Doggett, 1992, p. 579]</ref> In common use, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

==Proposed reforms==
The following are [[Calendar reform|proposed reforms]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]]:
* [[Human Era]]
* [[International Fixed Calendar]] (also called the ''International Perpetual calendar'')
* [[Leap week calendar]]s
** [[Common-Civil-Calendar-and-Time]]
** [[Pax Calendar]]
** [[Symmetry454]]
* [[World Calendar]]
* [[World Season Calendar]]
