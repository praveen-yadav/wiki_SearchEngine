A '''chambered cairn''' is a burial monument, usually constructed during the [[Neolithic]], consisting of a [[cairn]] of stones inside which a sizeable (usually stone) chamber was constructed. Some chambered cairns are also [[passage grave|passage-graves]]. They are found throughout [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], with the largest number in [[Scotland]].

Typically, the chamber is larger than a [[cist]], and will contain a larger number of interments, which are either [[Excarnation|excarnated]] bones or inhumations (cremations). Most were situated near a settlement, and served as that community's "graveyard".

===Background===
During the early Neolithic (4000-3300 BC) architectural forms are highly regionalised with timber and earth monuments predominating in the east and stone chambered cairns in the west. During the later Neolithic (3300-2500 BC) massive circular enclosures and the use of [[grooved ware]] and [[Unstan ware]] pottery emerge.<ref>Noble (2006) p. 15</ref> Scotland has a particularly large number of chambered cairns and they are found in various different types described below. Along with the excavations of settlements such as [[Skara Brae]], [[Links of Noltland]], [[Barnhouse]], [[Rinyo]] and [[Balfarg]] and the complex site at [[Ness of Brodgar]] these cairns provide important clues as to what civilization in Scotland was like in the Neolithic.<ref>Barclay (2005) pp. 41, 46</ref> However the increasing use of cropmarks to identify  sites in [[Central Lowlands|lowland]] areas has tended to diminish the relative value of these cairns in Neolithic studies.<ref>Barclay, Gordon "The Neolithic" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p. 131</ref>

In the early phases bones of numerous bodies are often found together and it has been argued that this suggests that in death at least, the status of individuals was played down.<ref>Barclay (2005) p. 20</ref> During the late Neolithic [[henge]] sites were constructed,<ref>Barclay (2005) p. 29</ref> single burials began to become more commonplace and by the [[Bronze Age]] it is possible that even where chambered cairns were still being built they had become the burial places of prominent individuals rather than of communities as a whole.<ref name=B5255>Barclay (2005) pp. 52, 55</ref><ref>Barclay, Gordon "The Neolithic" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) pp. 132-33</ref>

===Clyde-Carlingford court cairns===
{{Main|Court cairn}}
[[File:Cairnholy2.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cairn Holy II - a chambered cairn near [[Newton Stewart]].]]
The Clyde or Clyde-Carlingford type are principally found in northern and western [[Ireland]] and southwestern Scotland. They first were identified as a separate group in the [[Firth of Clyde]] region, hence the name. Over 100 have been identified in Scotland alone. Lacking a significant passage, they are a form of [[gallery grave]]. The burial chamber is normally located at one end of  a rectangular or trapezoidal cairn, while a roofless, semi-circular forecourt at the entrance provided access from the outside (although the entrance itself was often blocked), and gives this type of chambered cairn its alternate name of [[Court tomb|court tomb or court cairn]]. These forecourts are typically fronted by large stones and it is thought the area in front of the cairn was used for public rituals of some kind. The chambers were created from large stones set on end, roofed with large flat stones and often sub-divided by slabs into small compartments. They are generally considered to be the earliest in Scotland.<ref>Noble (2006) pp. 104-05</ref>

Examples include Cairn Holy I and Cairn Holy II near [[Newton Stewart]],<ref>Noble (2006) pp. 111-12</ref> a cairn at [[Port Charlotte]], [[Islay]], which dates to 3900-4000 BC,<ref name=N108>Noble (2006) p. 108</ref><ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/37313/details/islay+port+charlotte/ "Islay, Port Charlotte"].

===Orkney-Cromarty===
[[Image:Unstan chambered cairn entrance by Bruce McAdam.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to [[Unstan Chambered Cairn]], [[Orkney]]]]
The Orkney-Cromarty group is by far the largest and most diverse. It has been subdivided into Yarrows, Camster and Cromarty subtypes but the differences are extremely subtle. The design is of dividing slabs at either side of a rectangular chamber, separating it into compartments or stalls.<ref name=Ritch29>Ritchie, Graham "The Early Peoples" in Omand (2003) p. 29</ref> The number of these compartments ranges from 4 in the earliest examples to over 24 in an extreme example on [[Orkney]]. The actual shape of the cairn varies from simple circular designs to elaborate 'forecourts' protruding from each end, creating what look like small [[amphitheatres]]. It is likely that these are the result of cultural influences from mainland [[Europe]], as they are similar to designs found in [[France]] and [[Spain]].

Examples include [[Midhowe Chambered Cairn|Midhowe]] on [[Rousay]] and [[Unstan Chambered Cairn]] from the [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney Mainland]], both of which date from the mid 4th millennium BC and were probably in use over long periods of time. When the latter was excavated in 1884, grave goods were found that gave their name to [[Unstan ware]] pottery.<ref name=Ritch29/><ref>[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/tombs/midhowe/index.html "The Midhowe Stalled Cairn, Rousay"].

===Maeshowe===
[[File:PicMaesEntrance.jpg|thumb|The interior of [[Maeshowe]]]]
The [[Maeshowe]] group, named after the famous Orkney monument, is among the most elaborate. They appear relatively late and only in Orkney<ref name=Ritch29/> and it is not clear why the use of cairns continued in the north when their construction had largely ceased elsewhere in Scotland. They consist of a central chamber from which lead small compartments, into which burials would be placed. The central chambers are tall and steep-sided and have [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] roofing faced with high quality stone.<ref>Barclay (2005) pp. 40-41</ref>
[[File:Vinquoy chambered tomb - geograph.org.uk - 190143.jpg|thumb|left| The entrance to the Vinquoy cairn on [[Eday]]]]
In addition to Maeshowe itself, which was constructed c. 2700 BC, there are various other examples from the Orkney Mainland. These include [[Quanterness]] chambered cairn (3250 BC) in which the remains of 157 individuals were found when excavated in the 1970s,<ref name=Fraser13>Fraser, David (1980) ''Investigations in Neolithic Orkney''.

Examples from elsewhere in Orkney are the Vinquoy cairn, found at an elevated location on the north end of the island of  [[Eday]]<ref>Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 58</ref> and [[Quoyness]] on [[Sanday, Orkney|Sanday]] constructed about 2900 BC and which is surrounded by an arc of Bronze Age mounds.<ref>[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/tombs/quoyness/index.html "The Quoyness Cairn, Sanday"].

===Bookan===
[[File:Huntersquoy chambered cairn, Eday - geograph.org.uk - 224640.jpg|thumb|Huntersquoy chambered cairn, [[Eday]]]]
The Bookan type is named after a cairn found to the north-west of the [[Ring of Brodgar]] in Orkney, which is now a dilapidated oval mound, about 16 metres in diameter.  Excavations in 1861 indicated a rectangular central chamber surrounded by five smaller chambers. Because of the structure's unusual design, it was originally presumed to be an early form. However, later interpretations and further excavation work in 2002 suggested that the have more in common with the later Maeshowe type rather than the stalled Orkney-Cromarty cairns.<ref>[http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/worldheritagesite/bookancairn.htm "The Bookan Chambered Cairn, Sandwick"]. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 5 August 2012.</ref>

===Shetland===
[[File:Chambered Cairn, Muckle Ward, Vementry Isle - geograph.org.uk - 886701.jpg|thumb|The [[Vementry]] cairn]]
The [[Shetland]] or Zetland group are relatively small passage graves, that are [[round cairn|round]] or [[heel-shaped cairn|heel-shaped]] in outline.  The whole chamber is cross or [[trefoil]]-shaped and there are no smaller individual compartments. An example is to be found on the uninhabited island  of [[Vementry]] on the north side of the West [[Mainland, Shetland|Mainland]], where it appears that the cairn may have originally been circular and its distinctive heel shape added as a secondary development, a process repeated elsewhere in Shetland. This probably served to make the cairn more distinctive and the forecourt area more defined.<ref name=N123>Noble (2006) p. 123</ref>

===Hebridean===
[[File:Chambered Cairn at Rubh' an Dunain - geograph.org.uk - 180698.jpg|thumb|left|Chambered cairn at [[Rubha an Dùnain]]]]
Like the Shetland cairn the [[Hebrides|Hebridean]] group appear relatively late in the Neolithic. They are largely found in the [[Outer Hebrides]], although a mixture of cairn types are found here.<ref name=N123/> These passage graves are usually larger than the Shetland type and are round or have funnel-shaped forecourts, although a few are long cairns - perhaps originally circular but with later tails added.<ref>Noble (2006) p. 124</ref> They often have a polygonal chamber and a short passage to one end of the cairn.

The [[Rubha an Dùnain]]  peninsula on the island of  [[Skye]] provides an example from the 2nd or 3rd millennium BC.<ref>Armit (1996) p. 73</ref><ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/11028/details/skye+rubh+an+dunain+viking+canal// "Skye, Rubh' An Dunain, 'Viking Canal' "].

===Bronze Age===
[[File:Corrimony Chambered Cairn - 3 - 29042008.JPG|thumb|Corrimony chambered cairn]]
In addition to the increasing prominence of individual burials,<ref name=B5255/> during the Bronze Age regional differences in architecture in Scotland became more pronounced.<ref>Barclay (2005) p. 49</ref> The [[Clava cairn]]s date from this period, with about 50 cairns of this type in the [[Inverness]] area.<ref>Barclay, Gordon "The Neolithic" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p. 136</ref> [[Corrimony chambered cairn]] near [[Drumnadrochit]] is an example dated to 2000 BC or older.
