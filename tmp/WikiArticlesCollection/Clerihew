A '''clerihew''' is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced. The line length and meter are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

:Sir Christopher Wren
:Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
:If anyone calls
:Say I am designing St. Paul's."<ref name=bentley>{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}</ref>

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre (for comic effect)
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages<ref>[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]</ref>
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.  According to a letter in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name "at the end of the first line", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref>

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description (similar to the schoolboy style of ''[[1066 and All That]]'')

The unbalanced and unpolished [[poetic meter]] and line length parody the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], and the clerihew in form also parodies the [[eulogy]].

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines about [[Humphry Davy]] came into his head during a science class.<ref name=gale>{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}</ref> Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.<ref name=First>{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}</ref> The first use of the word in print was in 1928.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> Clerihew published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as "edited by E. Clerihew";<ref name=gale/> ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

Bentley's friend, [[G. K. Chesterton]], was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.<ref name=gale/> Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|page=94|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-929928-5}}</ref> and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

==Examples==
The first ever clerihew was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
:Sir Humphry Davy
:Abominated gravy.
:He lived in the odium
:Of having discovered [[sodium]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A25568445 BBC - h2g2 - Sir Humphry Davy FRS (1778 - 1829)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

When this clerihew was published in 1905, "Was not fond of"<ref name=First/> was replaced by "Abominated". Other classic clerihews by Bentley include:
:[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
:Ought never to have occurred.
:One can only wonder
:At so grotesque a blunder.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}</ref>

:[[John Stuart Mill]],
:By a mighty effort of will,
:Overcame his natural bonhomie
:And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.<ref>''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=642–43|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1}}</ref>

Auden's "Literary Graffiti" includes:
:Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
:Was completely staggered
:When his bride-to-be
:Announced, "I am [[She (novel)|She]]!"

The subject of a clerihew written by the students of his alma mater, Sherborne School in England, was one of the founders of computing:
:[[Turing]]
:Must have been alluring
:To get made a don
:So early on.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodges|first=Andrew|year=1983|title=Alan Turing: the enigma|page=94|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-671-52809-2}}</ref>

A clerihew much appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]], and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
:[[Sir James Dewar]]
:Is smarter than you are
:None of you asses
:Can liquify gases.

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' Magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
:Did [[Descartes]]
:Depart
:With the thought
:"[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]"?
