'''Adware''', or '''advertising-supported software''', is any [[software]] package which automatically renders advertisements in order to generate revenue for its author. The advertisements may be in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process. The functions may be designed to analyze which Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there. The term is sometimes used to refer to software that [[#As malware|displays unwanted advertisements.]]<ref name="MS-Enc-Sec">{{cite book

== Advertising-supported software ==
In legitimate software, the advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the program. Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and in some cases, it may allow the software to be provided to the user free of charge or at a reduced price. The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product.<ref name="zdnetfeature">{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/feature-ad-supported-software-1339291796/|title=Feature: Ad-supported software|first=David|last=Braue|date=4 September 2008|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> The use of advertising-supported software in business is becoming increasingly popular, with a third of [[information technology|IT]] and business executives in a 2007 survey by [[McKinsey & Company]] planning to be using ad-funded software within the following two years.<ref name="informationweek">{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/businesses-warm-to-no-cost-ad-supported/199204001|title=Businesses Warm To No-Cost, Ad-Supported Software|first=Mary|last=Hayes Weier|date=5 May 2007|work=[[Information Week]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> Advertisement funded software is also one of the [[Business models for open-source software]].

=== In application software ===
Some software is offered in both an advertising-supported mode and a paid, advertisement-free mode. The latter is usually available by an online purchase of a license or registration code for the software that unlocks the mode, or the purchase and download of a separate version of the software.{{efn|For example, in 2007 [[Microsoft]] changed its productivity suite [[Microsoft Works]] to be advertising-supported.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-works-to-become-a-free-ad-funded-product/604|title=Microsoft Works to become a free, ad-funded product|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|date=30 July 2007|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> Works was subsequently replaced with the [[Microsoft Office 2010]] software suite operating in a "starter" mode that included advertisements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-adds-an-office-starter-edition-to-its-distribution-plans/4197|title=Microsoft adds an 'Office Starter' edition to its distribution plans|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|date=9 October 2009|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> {{As of|2012}}, this product is also being phased out and replaced with [[Office Web Apps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-begins-phasing-out-starter-edition-of-its-office-suite/13001|title=Microsoft begins phasing out Starter edition of its Office suite|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|date=21 June 2012|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>}}

Some software authors offer advertising-supported versions of their software as an alternative option to business organizations seeking to avoid paying large sums for software licenses, funding the development of the software with higher fees for advertisers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Ad-supported-software-reaches-specialized-audience-3501806.php|title=Ad-supported software reaches specialized audience|first=Ari|last=Levy|date=23 April 2012|newspaper=[[SF Gate]]|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>

According to [[Federal Trade Commission]] staff’s view,<ref>{{cite web|last=Majoras|first=Deborah Platt|title=FTC Staff Report. Monitoring Software on Your PC: Spyware, Adware, and Other Software|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=4 april 2005}}</ref>  there appears to be general agreement that software should be considered "[[spyware]]” only if it is downloaded or installed on a computer without the user’s knowledge and consent. However, unresolved issues remain concerning how, what, and when consumers need to be told about software installed on their
computers for consent to be adequate. For instance, distributors often disclose in an End User Licensing Agreement (EULA) that there is additional software bundled with primary software, but some panelists and commenters did not view such disclosure as sufficient to infer consent to the installation of the bundled software.

== As malware ==
The term ''adware'' is frequently used to describe a form of [[malware]] (malicious software),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/keep-a-clean-machine/malware-and-botnets|title=Malware &amp; Botnets|author=[[National Cyber Security Alliance]]|publisher=StaySafeOnline.org|quote=The terms 'spyware' and 'adware' apply to several different [malware] technologies...|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/itsecurity/basics/malicious-software/|title=Viruses and other forms of malicious software|date=5 July 2012|publisher=[[Princeton University]] Office of Information Technology|quote=malware also includes worms, spyware and adware.|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> usually that which presents unwanted advertisements to the user of a computer.<ref name=AAA>{{cite news |url= http://www.spywareloop.com/news/adware |title=Adware in SpyWareLoop.com|author=  Vincentas |newspaper=''Spyware Loop'' |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/securitycenter/spyware-glossary#Adware|title=Malware from A to Z|publisher=[[Lavasoft]]|quote=[Adware] delivers advertising content potentially in a manner or context that may be unexpected and unwanted by users.|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref> The advertisements produced by adware are sometimes in the form of a [[Pop-up ad|pop-up]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/glossary/|title=Data Privacy Day Glossary|author=[[National Cyber Security Alliance]]|publisher=StaySafeOnline.org|quote=Adware: type of malware that allows popup ads on a computer system, ultimately taking over a user's Internet browsing.|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>

When the term is used in this way, the severity of its implication varies.

Programs have been developed to detect, quarantine, and remove advertisement-displaying malware, including [[Ad-Aware]], [[Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware]], [[Spyware Doctor]] and [[Spybot - Search & Destroy]]. In addition, almost all commercial [[antivirus software]] currently detect adware and spyware, or offer a separate spyware detection package.<ref>{{cite web
