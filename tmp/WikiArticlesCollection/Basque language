'''Basque''' ([[endonym]]: {{lang|eu|''Euskara''}}, {{IPA-eu|eus̺ˈkaɾa|IPA}}) is the ancestral language of the [[Basque people]], who inhabit the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region spanning an area in northeastern [[Spain]] and southwestern [[France]]. It is spoken by 27% of Basques in all territories (714,136 out of 2,648,998).<ref name="VInkesta"/> Of these, 663,035 live in the Spanish part of the Basque Country and the remaining 51,100 live in the French part.<ref name=VInkesta/>  Basque is considered to be a [[language isolate]].<ref>Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2012. Spain. Steven L. Denver (ed.), ''Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures, and Contemporary Issues'', Vol. 3. Armonk, NY: M .E. Sharpe, pp. 674-675.</ref>

In academic discussions of the distribution of Basque in Spain and France, it is customary to refer to [[French Basque Country|three ancient provinces]] in France and four Spanish provinces. Native speakers are concentrated in a contiguous area including parts of the Spanish [[Autonomous communities in Spain|autonomous communities]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]] and in the western half of the French ''[[Department (administrative division)|département]]'' of [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]. The Basque Autonomous Community is an administrative entity within the binational ethnographic Basque Country incorporating the traditional Spanish provinces of [[Biscay]], [[Gipuzkoa]], and [[Álava]], which retain their existence as politico-administrative divisions.

Gipuzkoa, most of Biscay, a few municipalities of Álava and the northern area of Navarre formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language. By contrast, most of Álava, western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of [[Navarre]] are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish language either because Basque had been [[Language shift|replaced]] by Spanish along the centuries in some areas (most of Álava and central Navarre), or because it had never been spoken there, in other areas ([[Encartaciones]] and southeastern Navarre).

Like the other [[Languages of Spain]] except [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (Castilian), the public use of Basque was severely restricted and regarded as a sign of separatism during the main part of the 20th century (namely under [[Francoist Spain|Francoist Dictatorship]] and [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s rule).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In southwestern France, the ancient Basque-populated provinces were [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], and [[Soule]]. These territories and [[Béarn]] were consolidated into a single ''département'' in 1790 under the name ''Basses-Pyrénées'', a name which persisted until 1970's when it was changed to ''[[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]]''.

A standardized form of the Basque language, called [[Standard Basque|Euskara Batua]], was developed by the [[Euskaltzaindia|Basque Language Academy]] in the late 1960s. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today. The role of this standard Basque language depends on the linguistic educational model of each region and each school. In most areas of the Spanish Basque Country, the educational Model D, where all subjects are taught in Basque, except "Spanish language and literature" (which is taught in Spanish) is now the predominant model. In Navarre the majority of the students follows the Model G (all subjects in Spanish), but Model D makes up almost 26%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consejoescolar.educacion.navarra.es/attachments/article/368/Informe%20del%20Sistema%20Educativo%20en%20Navarra%202011-2012.pdf |title=Navarrese Educational System. Report 2011/2012 |publisher=Navarrese Educative Council |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref> In France, the Basque language school Seaska and the association for a bilingual (Basque and French) schooling Ikasbi meet a wide range of Basque language educational needs up to the Sixth Form, while often struggling to surmount financial and administrative constraints.

Apart from this standardized version, there are five main Basque dialects: [[Bizkaian]], [[Gipuzkoan]], and [[Upper Navarrese]] in Spain, and [[Navarrese–Lapurdian]] and [[Zuberoan]] (in France). Although they take their names from the mentioned historic provinces, the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries.

==Names of the language==
In Basque, the name of the language is officially ''Euskara'' (alongside various [[Basque dialects#Dialectal divergence|dialect]] forms). There are currently three etymological theories of the name ''Euskara'' that are taken seriously by linguists and [[wikt:Vasconist|Vasconists]] which are discussed in detail on the [[Basque people#Etymology of the word Basque|Basque people]] page.

In French the language is normally called ''basque'' or, in recent times, ''euskara''. There is a greater variety of Spanish names for the language. Today, it is most commonly referred to as ''el vasco'', ''la lengua vasca'' or ''el euskera''. Both terms, ''vasco'' and ''basque'', are inherited from Latin [[ethnonym]] ''[[Vascones]]'' which in turn goes back to the Greek term οὐασκώνους (''ouaskōnous''), an ethnonym used by [[Strabo]] in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (23 CE, Book III).<ref name=Trask>[[Larry Trask|Trask, R.L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 ISBN 0-415-13116-2</ref>

The term ''Vascuence'', derived from Latin ''vasconĭce'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=vascuence|title=Diccionario de la lengua española|publisher=Real Academia Española|accessdate=22 November 2008}}</ref> has acquired negative connotations over the centuries and is not well liked amongst Basque speakers generally. Its use is documented at least as far back as the 14th century when a law passed in [[Huesca]] in 1349 stated that ''Item nuyl corridor nonsia usado que faga mercadería ninguna que compre nin venda entre ningunas personas, faulando en algaravia nin en abraych nin en basquenç: et qui lo fara pague por coto XXX sol''—essentially penalizing the use of Arabic, Hebrew or Vascuence (Basque) with a fine of 30 [[French sol|sols]].

==History and classification==
{{see also|Origin of the Basques}}

Though geographically surrounded by [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Romance language]]s, Basque is classified as a [[language isolate]]. It is the last remaining descendant of the [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of Western Europe.<ref name="Trask"/> Consequently, its prehistory may not be reconstructible by means of the [[comparative method]] except by applying it to differences between dialects within the language. Little is known of its origins but it is likely that an early form of the Basque language was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages to the area.

Some authors have noted that the words for "knife" (''aizto''), "ax" (''aizkora'') and "hoe" (''aitzur'') seem to derive from the word for "stone" (''haitz''), and have therefore concluded that the language dates to the Stone Age or Neolithic period, when those tools were made of stone;<ref>''Journal of the Manchester Geographical Society'', volumes 52-56 (1942), page 90</ref><ref>Kelly Lipscomb, ''Spain'' (2005), page 457</ref> others find this unlikely; see [[Origin of the Basques#The aizkora controversy|the ''aizkora'' controversy]].

Latin inscriptions in [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitania]] preserve a number of words with [[cognates]] in reconstructed [[proto-Basque]], for instance the personal names ''Nescato'' and ''Cison'' (''neskato'' and ''gizon'' mean "young girl" and "man" respectively in modern Basque). This language is generally referred to as [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and is assumed to have been spoken in the area before the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] conquests in the western [[Pyrenees]]. Some authors even argue that the [[Late Basquisation|language moved westward]] during [[Late Antiquity]], after the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], into the north part of [[Hispania]] in which [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque is spoken today]].<ref name="Trask"/>

Roman neglect of this area allowed Aquitanian to survive while the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] and [[Tartessian language]]s became extinct. Through the long contact with Romance languages, Basque adopted a sizable number of Romance words. Initially the source was Latin, later [[Gascon language|Gascon]] (a branch of [[Occitan language|Occitan]]) in the northeast, [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the southeast and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the southwest.

===Hypotheses on connections with other languages===

The impossibility of linking Basque with its Indo-European neighbors in Europe has inspired many scholars to search for its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many [[pseudoscientific language comparison|pseudoscientific comparisons]], the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts to connect Basque with geographically very distant language families. All hypotheses on the origin of Basque are controversial, and the suggested evidence is not generally accepted by most linguists. Some of these hypothetical connections are as follows:

* [[Iberian language|Iberian]]: another ancient language once spoken in the peninsula, shows several similarities with [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] and Basque. However, there is not enough evidence to distinguish geographical connections from linguistic ones. Iberian itself remains [[unclassified language|unclassified]]. Eduardo Orduña Aznar claims to have established correspondences between Basque and Iberian numerals<ref>Orduña 2005</ref> and noun case markers.
* the [[Ligurian substrate]] hypothesis proposed in the 19th century by d'Arbois de Joubainville, J. Pokorny, P. Kretschmer and several other linguists encompasses the Basco-Iberian hypothesis.
* [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: Linking Basque to [[Kartvelian languages]] is now widely discredited. The hypothesis was inspired by the existence of the ancient [[Caucasian Iberia|Kingdom of Iberia]] in the [[Caucasus]] and further by some typological similarities between the two languages.<ref>José Ignacio Hualde, Joseba Lakarra, Robert Lawrence Trask (1995), ''Towards a history of the Basque language'', p. 81. John Benjamins Publishing Company, ISBN 90-272-3634-8.</ref> According to [[James Patrick Mallory|J.P. Mallory]], in his 1989 book ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans'', the hypothesis was also inspired by a Basque place-name ending in - ''dze''.
* [[Northeast Caucasian languages]], such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]], are seen by the French linguist Michel Morvan as more likely candidates for a very distant connection.<ref>[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/mt26s.html A Final (?) Response to the Basque Debate in Mother Tongue 1] (John D. Bengston)</ref>
* [[Dené–Caucasian]] superfamily: Based on the possible Caucasian link, some linguists, for example [[John Bengtson]] and [[Merritt Ruhlen]], have proposed including Basque in the [[Dené–Caucasian]] superfamily of languages, but this proposed superfamily includes languages from North America and Eurasia, and its existence is highly controversial.<ref name="Trask"/>
* [[Vasconic substratum hypothesis]]: This proposal, made by the German linguist [[Theo Vennemann]], claims that there is enough toponymical evidence to conclude that Basque is the only survivor of a larger family that once extended throughout most of Europe, and has also left its mark in modern [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in Europe.<ref>[http://www.germanistik.uni-muenchen.de/germanistische_linguistik/TV/Vennemann.htm Theo Vennemann homepage]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

==Geographic distribution==
[[Image:Euskara.png|thumb|180px|left|Percentage of fluent speakers of Basque (areas where Basque is not spoken are included within the 0-4% interval).]]

[[Image:Navarra - Mapa densidad euskera 2001.svg|thumb|right|Percentage of people fluent in Basque language in Navarre (2001), including second-language speakers.]]
The region in which Basque is spoken has contracted over centuries, especially in its Northern, Southern and Eastern borders. Nothing is known about the limits of this region in ancient times, but on the basis of toponyms and epigraphs, it seems that in the beginning of the [[Common Era]] it stretched to the river [[Garonne]] in the North (including the South-Western lands of present-day [[France]]); at least to [[Aran Valley]] to the East (now a [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-speaking part of [[Catalonia]]), including lands on both sides of the [[Pyrenees]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|location=Zarautz (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1|page=16}}</ref> the Southern and Western boundaries are not clear at all.

The [[Reconquista]] temporarily counteracted this contracting tendency when the Christian lords called on Northern Iberian peoples – Basques, [[Asturia]]ns, and "[[Franks]]" – to colonize the new conquests. The Basque language became the main everyday language, {{Where|date=January 2013}} while other languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[French language|French]], or Latin were preferred for the administration and high education.

By the 16th century the Basque-speaking area was reduced basically to the present-day seven provinces of the Basque Country, excluding the Southern part of Navarre, the South-Western part of Álava and the Western part of Biscay, and including some parts of [[Béarn]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|location=Zarautz (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1|page=17}}</ref>

In 1807, Basque was still spoken in the northern half of Alava — including its capital city [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=Arabako euskara|year=2012|publisher=Elkar|location=Andoain (Gipuzkoa)|isbn=978-84-15337-72-0|page=21}}</ref> — and a vast area in central Navarre, but in these two provinces Basque experienced a rapid decline that pushed it Northwards. In the [[French Basque Country]], Basque was still spoken in all the territory except in [[Bayonne]] and some villages around, and including some bordering towns in Béarn.

In the 20th century, however, the rise of [[Basque nationalism]] spurred increased interest in the language as a sign of ethnic identity, and with the establishment of autonomous governments in the [[Southern Basque Country|Spanish Basque Country]], it has recently made a modest comeback. In this Southern part, Basque-language schools for children and Basque teaching centres for adults have brought the language to areas such as [[Encartaciones]] and the Ebro Ribera in Navarre, where it is not known if it has ever been spoken before; and in the French Basque Country these schools and centres have almost stopped the decline of the language.

===Official status===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
[[Image:Navarra - Zonificacion linguistica.svg|thumb|Official status of the Basque language in Navarre]]
Historically, Latin or Romance languages have been the official languages in this region. However, Basque was explicitly recognized in some areas. For instance, the [[fuero|local charter]] of the Basque-[[Reconquista|colonized]] [[Ojacastro]] valley (now in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the 13th and 14th centuries.

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 states in Article 2 that the [[Spanish language]] is the official language, but allows autonomous communities to provide a co-official language status for the other [[languages of Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx#I2 |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Spanish Constitutional Court |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref> Consequently, the Statute of Autonomy of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] establishes Basque as the co-official language of the autonomous community. The Statute of [[Navarre]] establishes Spanish as the official language of Navarre but grants co-official status to the Basque language in the Basque-speaking areas of Northern Navarre. Basque has no official status in the [[Northern Basque Country]] (i.e. the Basque area in [[France]]) and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is permitted (with translation), as Basque is officially recognized on the other side of the border.

The positions of the various existing governments differ with regard to the promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre. The "Ley del Vascuence" ("Law of Basque"), seen as contentious by many Basques, but considered fitting Navarra's linguistic and cultural diversity by the main political parties of Navarre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20110217/navarra/el-parlamento-rechaza-ley-hacer-oficial-euskera-toda-navarra.html?not=2011021711344312&idnot=2011021711344312&dia=20110217&seccion=navarra&seccion2=politica&chnl=10 |title=Navarrese Parliament rejects to gran Basque Language co-official status in Spanish-speaking areas by suppressing the linguistic delimitation|publisher=Diario de Navarra |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}</ref> divides Navarre into three language areas: Basque-speaking, non-Basque-speaking, and mixed. The support for the language and the linguistic rights of citizens vary depending on which of the three areas they are in.

===Demographics===
[[Image:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumbnail|260px|right|Map showing the historical retreat and expansion of Basque within the context of its linguistic neighbors between the year 1000 and 2000]]
The 2006 sociolinguistic survey of all Basque-speaking territories showed that in 2006 of all people aged 16 and above:<ref name=IVInkesta>''IV. Inkesta Soziolinguistikoa'' Gobierno Vasco, Servicio Central de Publicaciones del Gobierno Vasco 2008, ISBN 978-84-457-2775-1</ref>
* in the Basque Autonomous Community, 30.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 18.3% [[Passive speakers (language)|passive speakers]] and 51.5% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in Gipuzkoa (49.1% speakers) and lowest in Álava (14.2%). These results represent an increase from previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16-24 age range (57.5%) vs 25.0% in the 65+ age range. The percentage of fluent speakers turns out to be even higher if those under 16 are also taken into account, given that the proportion of bilinguals is particularly high in this age group (76.7% of those aged between 10 and 14 and 72.4% of those aged 5–9): 37.5% of the population aged 6 and above in the whole Basque Autonomous Community, 25.0% in Álava, 31.3% in Biscay and 53.3% in Gipuzkoa.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-738/es/contenidos/informacion/argitalpenak/es_6092/adjuntos/MAPAcast.pdf|title=IV Mapa Sociolingüístico: 2006|publisher=Servicio Central de Publicaciones del Gobierno Vasco, Vitoria-Gasteiz|year=2008|format=PDF|isbn=978-84-457-2942-7|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>
* in French Basque Country, 22.5% were fluent Basque speakers, 8.6% passive speakers and 68.9% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in Labourd and Soule (55.5% speakers) and lowest in the [[Bayonne]]-[[Anglet]]-[[Biarritz]] conurbation (8.8%). These results represent another decrease from previous years (24.8% in 2001 and 26.4 in 1996). The highest percentage of speakers is in the 65+ age range (32.4%). The lowest percentage is found in the 25-34 age range (11.6%) but there is a slight increase in the 16-24 age range (16.1%)
* in Navarre 11.1% were fluent Basque speakers, 7.6% passive speakers and 81.3% did not speak Basque. The percentage was highest in the Basque-speaking Zone in the North (60.1% speakers) and lowest in the non-Basque speaking Zone in the South (1.9%). These results represent a slight increase from previous years (10.3% in 2001, 9.6% in 1996 and 9.5% in 1991). The highest percentage of speakers can now be found in the 16-24 age range (19.1%) vs 9.1% in the 65+ age range.

Taken together, in 2006 out of a total population of 2,589,600 (1,850,500 in the Autonomous Community, 230,200 in the Northern Provinces and 508,900 in Navarre), there were 665,800 who spoke Basque (aged 16 and above). This amounts to 25.7% Basque bilinguals overall, 15.4% passive speakers and 58.9% non-speakers. Compared to the 1991 figures this represents an overall increase of 137,000, from 528,500 (out of a population of 2,371,100) fifteen years previously.<ref name=IVInkesta/>

The 2011 figures show an increase of some 64,000 speakers compared to the 2006 figures to 714,136, with significant increases in the Autonomous Community but a slight drop in the Northern Basque Country to 51,100, overall amounting to an increase to 27% of all inhabitants of Basque provinces (2,648,998 in total).<ref name=VInkesta/>

===Dialects===

The modern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence, sometimes making cross-dialect communication difficult. This is especially true in the case of [[Bizkaian]] and [[Zuberoan]], which are regarded as the most divergent Basque dialects.

Modern Basque dialectology distinguishes five dialects:<ref name=Zuazo2010>{{cite book|last=Zuazo|first=Koldo|title=El euskera y sus dialectos|year=2010|publisher=Alberdania|isbn=978-84-9868-202-1}}</ref>

*[[Upper Navarrese dialect|Upper Navarrese]]
*[[Lower Navarrese dialect|Lower Navarrese-Lapurdian]]
*[[Souletin dialect|Souletin (Zuberoan)]]

These dialects are divided in 11 sub-dialects, their minor varieties being 24.

===Influence on other languages===
{{See also|List of Spanish words of Basque/Iberian origin}}
Although the influence of the neighboring [[Romance languages]] on the Basque language (especially the lexicon, but also to some degree Basque phonology and grammar) has been much more extensive, there has been some feedback from Basque into these languages as well. In particular [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], and to a lesser degree [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have been influenced. In the case of Aragonese and Gascon, this has been through [[Substratum|substrate]] interference following [[language shift]] from [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] or Basque to a Romance language, affecting all levels of the language, including place names around the Pyrenees.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title=La toponymie hispanique prérromane et la survivance du basque jusqu'au bas moyen age|journal=IV Congrès International de Sciences Onomastiques|year=1960}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title=Estudis de toponímia catalana, I|year=1965|publisher=Barcino|isbn=978-84-7226-080-1|pages=153–217 |authorlink=Miscel·lània de toponimia bascoide a Catalunya}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Coromines|first=Joan|title=De toponimia vasca y vasco-románica en los Bajos Pirineos|journal=Fontes linguae vasconum: Studia et documenta|year=1972|issue=12|pages=299–320|issn=0046-435X}}</ref><ref>Rohlfs, Gerhard (1980), Le Gascon: études de philologie pyrénéenne.

Although a number of words of alleged Basque origin in the Spanish language are circulated (e.g. ''anchoa'' 'anchovies', ''bizarro'' 'dashing, gallant, spirited', ''cachorro'' 'puppy', etc.), most of these have more easily explicable Romance etymologies or not particularly convincing derivations from Basque.<ref name=Trask/> Ignoring cultural terms, there is one strong [[loanword]] candidate, ''ezker'', long held to be the source of the Pyrennean and [[Iberian Romance]] words for "left (side)" (''izquierdo'', ''esquerdo'', ''esquerre'', ''quer'', ''esquer'').<ref name=Trask/><ref name="Corominas">''izquierdo'' in the ''[[Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico]]'', volume III, [[Joan Corominas]], [[José A. Pascual]], [[Editorial Gredos]], 1989, Madrid, ISBN 84-249-1365-5.</ref> The lack of initial {{IPA|/r/}} in Gascon could arguably be due to a Basque influence but this issue is under-researched.<ref name=Trask/>

The other most commonly claimed substrate influences:
*the [[Old Spanish]] merger of {{IPA|/v/}} and {{IPA|/b/}}.
*the simple five vowel system.
*change of initial {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/h/}} (e.g. ''fablar'' → ''hablar'', with Old Basque lacking {{IPA|/f/}} but having /h/).

The first two features are common, widespread developments in many Romance (and non-Romance) languages,<ref name=Trask/> and as a result few linguists put much credence in the substrate proposal.  The change of /f/ to /h/, however, occurred historically only in a limited area ([[Gascony]] and [[Old Castile]]) that corresponds almost exactly to areas where heavy Basque bilingualism is assumed, and as a result has been widely postulated (and equally strongly disputed).  Substrate theories are often difficult to prove (especially in the case of phonetically plausible changes like /f/ to /h/).  As a result, although many arguments have been made on both sides, the debate largely comes down to the a priori tendency on the part of particular linguists to accept or reject substrate arguments.

Examples of arguments against the substrate theory,<ref name=Trask/> and possible responses:
#Spanish did not fully shift {{IPA|/f/}} to {{IPA|/h/}}, instead, it has preserved {{IPA|/f/}} before consonants such as {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}} (cf ''fuerte'', ''frente''). (On the other hand, the occurrence of {{IPA|[f]}} in these words might be a secondary development from an earlier sound such as {{IPA|[h]}} or {{IPA|[ɸ]}} and learned words (or words influenced by written Latin form). Gascon does have {{IPA|/h/}} in these words, which might reflect the original situation.)
#Evidence of Arabic loanwords in Castilian points to {{IPA|/f/}} continuing to exist long after a Basque substrate might have had any effect on Castilian. (On the other hand, the occurrence of {{IPA|/f/}} in these words might be a late development.  Many languages have come to accept new phonemes from other languages after a period of significant influence.  For example, French lost /h/ but later regained it as a result of Germanic influence, and has recently gained {{IPA|/ŋ/}} as a result of English influence.)
#Basque regularly developed Latin {{IPA|/f/}} into {{IPA|/b/}}.
#The same change also occurs in parts of Sardinia, Italy and the Romance languages of the Balkans where no Basque substrate can be reasonably argued for. (On the other hand, the fact that the same change might have occurred elsewhere independently does not disprove substrate influence. Furthermore, parts of Sardinia also have prothetic /a/ or /e/ before initial /r/, just as in Basque and Gascon, which may actually argue for some type of influence between both areas.)

==Grammar==

{{Main|Basque grammar}}

Basque is an [[ergative–absolutive language]]. The subject of an [[intransitive verb]] is in the [[absolutive case]] (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the [[direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]. The subject of the transitive verb is marked differently, with the [[ergative case]] (shown by the suffix ''-k''). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.

The [[auxiliary verb]], which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with any direct object and the indirect object present. Among European languages, this [[polypersonal agreement]] is found only in Basque, some [[languages of the Caucasus]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (all non-Indo-European). The ergative–absolutive alignment is also unique among European languages, but not rare worldwide.

Consider the phrase:

:''{{Audio|martinek1.ogg|Martinek egunkariak erosten dizkit.}}''
:{| cellpadding="2"
|-
| Martin-ek || egunkari-ak || erosten || di-zki-t
|-
| Martin-ERG || newspaper-PL || buy-GER || AUX.(s)he/it/they.OBJ-PL.OBJ-me.IO [(s)he/it_SBJ]
|}
:"Martin buys the newspapers for me."

''Martin-ek'' is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending ''-k'' (with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-e-''). ''Egunkariak'' has an ''-ak'' ending which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is ''erosten dizkit'', in which ''erosten'' is a kind of gerund ("buying") and the auxiliary ''dizkit'' means "he/she (does) them for me". This ''dizkit'' can be split like this:

* ''di-'' is used in the present tense when the verb has a subject (ergative), a direct object (absolutive), and an indirect object, and the object is him/her/it/them.
* ''-zki-'' means the absolutive (in this case the newspapers) is plural, if it were singular there would be no infix; and
* ''-t'' or '-da-' means "to me/for me" (indirect object).
* in this instance there is no suffix after ''-t''. A zero suffix in this position indicates that the ergative (the subject) is third person singular (he/she/it).

The phrase "you buy the newspapers for me" would translate as:

:''{{Audio|Zuekegunkariak.ogg|Zuek egunkariak erosten dizkidazue}}''
:{| cellpadding="2"
|-
| Zu-ek || egunkari-ak || erosten || di-zki-da-zue
|-
| you-ERG || newspaper-PL || buy-GER || AUX.(s)he/it/they.OBJ-PL.OBJ-me.IO-you(pl.).SBJ
|}

The auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue and means 'you pl. (do) them for me'

*''di-'' indicates that the main verb is transitive and in the present tense
*''-zki-'' indicates that the direct object is plural
*''-da-'' indicates that the indirect object is me (to me/for me) {-t becomes -da- when not final.}
*''-zue'' indicates that the subject is you (plural)

In spoken Basque, the auxiliary verb is never dropped even if it is redundant: "Zuek niri egunkariak erosten dizkidazue", you pl. buying the newspapers for me. However, the pronouns are almost always dropped: "egunkariak erosten dizkidazue", the newspapers buying be-them-for-me-you(plural). The pronouns are used only to show emphasis: "egunkariak zuek erosten dizkidazue", it is you (pl.) who buy the newspapers for me; or "egunkariak niri erosten dizkidazue", it is me for whom you buy the newspapers.

Modern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Colloquial Basque, however, only uses indicative present, indicative past, and imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a ''nor'' (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori'' (absolutive–dative) paradigm, as in the sentence ''Aititeri txapela erori zaio'' ("The hat fell from grandfather['s head]").<ref>[http://www.ehu.es/grammar/gram42.htm#1.4.2.2.%20%20Potential%20paradigms:%20absolut (Basque) INFLECTION §1.4.2.2. Potential paradigms: absolutive and dative.]</ref> Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for passive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned, and also has a ''nor-nork'' (absolutive–ergative) paradigm and possibly a ''nor-nori-nork'' (absolutive–dative–ergative) paradigm. The last would entail the ''dizkidazue'' example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of ''nor-nori-nork'' in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. (This draws on a language universal: *"Yesterday the boss presented the committee me" sounds at least odd, if not incorrect.) The most ubiquitous auxiliary, ''izan,'' can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the main verb.

There are more persons in the singular (5) than in the [[plural]] (3) for synthetic (or filamentous) verbs because of the two familiar persons—[[T-V distinction|informal]] masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun ''hi'' is used for both of them, but where the masculine form of the verb uses a ''-k'', the feminine uses an ''-n.'' This is a property not found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for "listener" (the [[allocutive]]) even if the verb contains no second person constituent. If the situation is one in which the familiar masculine may be used, the form is augmented and modified accordingly; likewise for the familiar feminine.
(''Gizon bat etorri da'', "a man has come"; ''gizon bat etorri duk'', "a man has come [you are a male close friend]", ''gizon bat etorri dun'', "a man has come [you are a female close friend]", ''gizon bat etorri duzu'', "a man has come [I talk to you]")<ref name="hitano">[http://www.hiru.com/es/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aspecto, tiempo y modo] in Spanish, [http://www.hiru.com/eu/euskara/euskara_01550.html Aditzen aspektua, tempusa eta modua]{{dead link|date=March 2013}} in Basque.</ref>
Notice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Still, the restriction on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong since all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense with the familiar forms entirely. Note, however, that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it used to be the second person plural, started being used as a singular formal, and then the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.

All the other verbs in Basque are called periphrastic, behaving much like a participle would in English. These have only three forms total, called [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: perfect (various suffixes), habitual<ref name="ARKing">{{cite book |last=King |first=Alan R. |year=1994 |title=The Basque Language: A Practical Introduction |page=393 |publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |isbn=0-87417-155-5}}</ref> (suffix ''-t[z]en''), and future/potential (suffix. ''-ko/-go''). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix ''-tu'' in the perfect, adapted from the Latin ''-tus'' suffix. The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.

Within a verb phrase, the periphrastic comes first, followed by the auxiliary.

A Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number. These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again.  It has been estimated that, with two levels of [[recursion]], a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms.<ref>[Agirre et al., 1992]</ref>

Basic syntactic construction is [[subject–object–verb]] (unlike Spanish, French or English where a [[subject–verb–object]] construction is more common). The order of the phrases within a sentence can be changed with thematic purposes, whereas the order of the words within a phrase is usually rigid. As a matter of fact, Basque phrase order is topic–focus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] is stated first, then the [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. In brief, the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. This rule is also applied in questions, for instance, ''What is this?'' can be translated as ''Zer da hau?'' or ''Hau zer da?'', but in both cases the question tag ''zer'' immediately precedes the verb ''da''. This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word ''galdegai'' (focus) is used.

In negative sentences, the order changes. Since the negative particle ''ez'' must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence follows. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: ''Aitak frantsesa ikasten du,'' "Father is learning French," in the negative becomes ''Aitak ez du frantsesa ikasten,'' in which ''ikasten'' ("learning") is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.

Basque has a distinction between [[laminal consonant|laminal]] and [[Apical consonant|apical]] articulation for the alveolar fricatives and affricates. With the laminal alveolar fricative {{IPA-eu|s̻|}}, the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth.  This is the usual /s/ in most European languages.  It is written with an orthographic ''z''.  By contrast, the [[voiceless apicoalveolar fricative]] {{IPA-eu|s̺|}} is written ''s''; the tip of the tongue points toward the upper teeth and friction occurs at the tip (apex).  For example, ''zu'' "you" is distinguished from ''su'' "fire".  The affricate counterparts are written with orthographic ''tz'' and ''ts''.  So, ''etzi'' "the day after tomorrow" is distinguished from ''etsi'' "to give up"; ''atzo'' "yesterday" is distinguished from ''atso'' "old woman".

In the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical ''s'' and the alveolar affricate ''tz'' are used.

Basque also features postalveolar sibilants ({{IPA|/ʃ/}}, written ''x'', and {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, written ''tx''), sounding like English ''sh'' and ''ch''.

There are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and [[motherese]] (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, ''tanta'' "drop" vs. ''ttantta'' {{IPA|/canca/}} "droplet". A few common words, such as ''txakur'' {{IPA|/tʃakur/}} "dog", use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: ''zakur'' "big dog". Many dialects of Basque exhibit a derived palatalization effect in which coronal onset consonants are changed into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the {{IPA|/n/}} in ''egin'' "to act" becomes palatal in southern and western dialects when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added: {{IPA|/eɡina/}} = {{IPA|[eɡiɲa]}} "the action", {{IPA|/eɡines/}} = {{IPA|[eɡiɲes]}} "doing".

The letter ''j'' has a variety of realizations according to the regional dialect: {{IPA|[j, dʒ, x, ʃ, ɟ, ʝ]}}, as pronounced from west to east in south Bizkaia and coastal Lapurdi, central Bizkaia, east Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, south Navarre, inland Lapurdi and Low Navarre, and Zuberoa, respectively.<ref>Trask, R. L. (1997). ''The History of Basque'', London and New York: Routledge, pp. 155-157, ISBN 0-415-13116-2.</ref>

The letter ''h'' is silent in the Spanish Basque provinces, but pronounced in the French ones.  Unified Basque spells it except when it is predictable, in a position following a consonant.<ref>Trask, ''The History of Basque'', pp. 157-163.</ref>

The vowel system is the same as Spanish for most speakers. It consists of five pure vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o u/}}. <!-- It is thought that Spanish took this system from Basque. [References?] --> Speakers of the Zuberoan dialect also have a sixth, front rounded vowel (represented in writing by ''ü'' and pronounced as {{IPA|/y/}}), as well as a set of contrasting nasalized vowels, indicating a strong influence from [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

Unless they are recent loanwords (e.g., Ruanda (Rwanda), radar...), words cannot begin with the letter ''r'', and when they are borrowed from elsewhere, the initial ''r-'' is changed to ''err-'', more rarely to ''irr-'' (irratia [the radio], irrisa [the rice]. This is similar to how in Spanish, words with ''s''+ consonant (such as "state") get an initial ''e'' (''estado'').

===Stress and pitch===

Basque features great dialectal variation in [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], from a weak [[pitch accent]] in the central dialects to a marked stress in some outer dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement. Stress is in general not distinctive (and for historical comparisons not very useful); there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms). E.g., ''basóà'' ("the forest", absolutive case) vs. ''básoà'' ("the glass", absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish ''vaso''); ''basóàk'' ("the forest", ergative case) vs. ''básoàk'' ("the glass", ergative case) vs. ''básoak'' ("the forests" or "the glasses", absolutive case).

Given its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard [[orthography]] and [[Euskaltzaindia]] (the Academy of the Basque Language) provides only general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a [[Syntagmatic structure|syntagma]], and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.

This scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} which sets its sound apart from the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodical]] patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). Some ''Euskaldun berriak'' ("new Basque-speakers", i.e., second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, giving rise to a pronunciation that is considered substandard{{By whom|date=June 2011}}; e.g., pronouncing ''nire ama'' ("my mum") as ''nire áma'' (– – ´ –), instead of as ''niré amà'' (– ´ – `).

==Vocabulary==
By contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has adopted many words from [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], among others. There is a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Basque phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: ''lore'' ("flower", from ''florem''), ''errota'' ("mill", from ''rotam'', "[mill] wheel"), ''gela'' ("room", from ''cellam''), ''gauza'' ("thing", from ''causa'').

==Writing system==
{{Main|Basque alphabet}}
[[Image:Ascain Stèle discoïdale.jpg|thumb|An example of Basque lettering in a funerary stela.]]
Basque is written using the [[Latin script]] including ''[[ñ]]'' and sometimes ''[[ç]]'' and ''[[ü]]''. Basque does not use ''Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy '' for words that have some tradition in this language; nevertheless, the Basque alphabet (established by [[Euskaltzaindia]]) does include them for loanwords:<ref>[http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/arauak/dok/Araua_0017.pdf Basque alphabet]</ref>
: Aa Bb Cc (and, as a variant, Çç) Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Ññ Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz

The phonetically meaningful [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] ''dd, ll, [[rr (digraph)|rr]], ts, tt, tx, tz'' are treated as double letters.

All letters and digraphs represent unique [[phoneme]]s. The main exception is when ''l'' or ''n'' are preceded by ''i'', that in most dialects palatalizes their sound into /[[ʎ]]/ and /[[ɲ]]/, even if these are not written. Hence, ''[[Ikurriña]]'' can also be written ''Ikurrina'' without changing the sound, while the proper name ''Ainhoa'' requires the mute ''h'' to break the palatalization of the ''n''.

''H'' is mute in most regions, but in the Northeast is pronounced in many places, the main reason for its existence in the Basque alphabet.
Its acceptance was a matter of contention during the standardization since the speakers of the most extended dialects had to learn where to place these h's, silent for them.

[[Image:Basquefontsample.png|thumb|left|The letters of the alphabet in a Basque style font.]]
In [[Sabino Arana]]'s (1865–1903) alphabet,<ref name="Arana">''Lecciones de ortografía del euskera bizkaino'', Arana eta Goiri'tar Sabin, Bilbao, Bizkaya'ren Edestija ta Izkerea Pizkundia, 1896 (Sebastián de Amorrortu).</ref> ''ll'' and ''rr'' were replaced with ''[[ĺ]]'' and ''[[ŕ]]'', respectively.

A typically Basque style of lettering is sometimes used for inscriptions.
It derives from the work of stone and wood carvers and is characterized by thick [[serif]]s.
(See Basque fonts available for download in the External Links section.)

===Number system used by millers===
[[Image:Errotarienzenbakiak.jpg|thumb|An example of the number system employed by millers.]]
Basque millers traditionally employed a separate number system of unknown origin.<ref>Aguirre Sorondo ''Tratado de Molinología – Los Molinos de Guipúzcoa'' Eusko Ikaskuntza 1988 ISBN 84-86240-66-2</ref> In this system the symbols are either arranged along a vertical line or horizontally. On the vertical line the single digits and fractions are usually off to one side, usually at the top. When used horizontally, the smallest units are usually on the right and the largest on the left.

The system is, as is the Basque system of counting in general, [[vigesimal]]. Although the system is in theory capable of indicating numbers above 100, most recorded examples do not go above 100 in general. Interestingly, fractions are relatively common, especially 1/2.

The exact systems used vary from area to area but generally follow the same principle with 5 usually being a diagonal line or a curve off the vertical line (a '''V''' shape is used when writing a 5 horizontally). Units of ten are usually a horizontal line through the vertical. The twenties are based on a circle with intersecting lines.

This system is not in general use anymore but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.
