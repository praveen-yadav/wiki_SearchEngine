'''Dieting''' is the practice of [[eating]] food in a regulated fashion to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight. Dieting is often used in combination with [[physical exercise]] to [[weight loss|lose weight]] in those who are [[overweight]] or [[obese]].  Some athletes, however, follow a diet to gain weight (usually in the form of [[skeletal muscle|muscle]]). Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight.

Diets to promote [[weight loss]] are generally divided into four categories: [[low-fat diet|low-fat]], [[low-carbohydrate diet|low-carbohydrate]], [[calorie restriction|low-calorie]], and [[very low calorie diet|very low calorie]].<ref name=Strychar>{{cite journal |author=Strychar I |title=Diet in the management of weight loss |journal=CMAJ |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16389240 |pmc=1319349 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.045037 |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/174/1/56}}</ref> A [[meta-analysis]] of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between the main diet types (low calorie, low carbohydrate, and low fat), with a 2–4 kilogram weight loss in all studies.<ref name=Strychar/>  At two years, all calorie-reduced diet types cause equal weight loss irrespective of the macronutrients emphasized.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sacks FM, Bray GA, Carey VJ, ''et al.'' |title=Comparison of Weight-Loss Diets with Different Compositions of Fat, Protein, and Carbohydrates |journal=N.

Long-term studies of dieting however indicate that the majority of individuals who dieted, regain virtually all of the weight that was lost after dieting, regardless of whether they maintain their diet or exercise program.<ref name="weight science"/> After two years of dieting up to two thirds of dieters are even heavier than they are prior to beginning their regimen, and therefore [[American Psychological Association|APA]] judges that diets 'do not lead to sustained weight loss or health benefits for the majority of people.'<ref>{{cite book|last=Foxcroft|first=Louise|title=Calories and Corsets: A history of dieting over two thousand years|year=2011|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ih5qnNit-KIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=american%20psychological&f=false}}</ref> Weight loss by dieting, while of benefit to those classified as unhealthy, may also slightly increase the mortality rate for individuals who are otherwise healthy.<ref name="weight science"/><ref name="harrington"/><ref name="nature2007"/>

The first popular diet was "Banting", named after [[William Banting]]. In his 1863 pamphlet, ''Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public'', he outlined the details of a particular low-carbohydrate, low-calorie diet that had led to his own dramatic weight loss.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jennifer Petrelli; Kathleen Y. Wolin |title=Obesity (Biographies of Disease) |publisher=Greenwood |location=Westport, Conn |year=2009 |pages=11 |isbn=0-313-35275-5}}</ref>

==Types of diets==

===Low-fat diets===
{{Main|Low-fat diet}}
Low-fat diets involve the reduction of the percentage of fat in one's diet. Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2–12&nbsp;months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of 3.2&nbsp;kg (7.1&nbsp;lb) over habitual eating.<ref name=Strychar/>

===Low-carbohydrate diets===
{{Main|Low-carbohydrate diet}}
Low carbohydrate diets such as [[Atkins diet|Atkins]] and Protein Power are relatively high in protein and fats. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes ''[[ketogenic diet|ketogenic]]'' (i.e. they restrict carbohydrate intake sufficiently to cause [[ketosis]]).

===Low-calorie diets===
{{Main|Calorie restriction}}
Low-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500–1,000 calories per day, which can result in a 0.5&nbsp;kilogram (1.1&nbsp;lb) to 1&nbsp;kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) weight loss per week. Some of the most commonly used low-calorie diets include [[DASH diet]] and [[Weight Watchers]]. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 [[randomized controlled trial]]s to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3–12 months.<ref name=Strychar/>

===Very low-calorie diets===
{{Main|Very low calorie diet}}
Very low calorie diets provide 200–800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to [[starvation]] and produce an average weekly weight loss of 1.5–2.5&nbsp;kilograms (3.3–5.5&nbsp;lb). "2-4-6-8", a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally fasting,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dietspotlight.com/2-4-6-8-diet-review/ | title=2-4-6-8 Diet Review | accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> after which the cycle repeats.  These diets are not recommended for general use as they are associated with [[Adverse effect (medicine)|adverse side effect]]s such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of [[gout]], and [[electrolyte imbalance]]s. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.<ref name=Strychar/>

===Detox diets===
{{Main|Detox diet}}
Detox diets claim to eliminate undesirable "toxins" from the human body rather than claiming to cause weight loss. Many of these use [[herbs]], [[homeopathy|homeopathic remedies]], or [[celery]] and other juicy low-[[calorie]] [[vegetable]]s.

==Fat loss versus muscle loss==
Weight loss typically involves the loss of fat, water and muscle. [[Overweight]] people, or people suffering from [[obesity]], typically aim to reduce the percentage of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. Additionally, as muscle tissue is denser than fat, fat loss results in increased loss of body volume compared with muscle loss. Reducing even 10% body fat can therefore have a dramatic effect on a person's body shape. To determine the proportion of weight loss that is due to decreased fat tissue, various methods of measuring [[body fat percentage]] have been developed.

[[Muscle]] loss during weight loss can be restricted by regularly lifting weights (or doing [[push-ups]] and other strength-oriented [[calisthenics]]) and by maintaining sufficient [[protein]] intake. Those on low-carbohydrate diets, and those doing particularly strenuous exercise, may wish to increase their protein intake. According to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Dietary Reference Intake]] for protein is 0.8&nbsp;grams per kilogram of body weight for adults. Endurance athletes, such as those who compete in distance running or cycling require many more calories in order to maintain weight. Due to the large caloric intake these athletes must consume it can be particularly tricky to ensure they obtain the nutrition required to maintain muscle mass.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Gretchen|title=Why Some Olympic Athletes Need to Gorge|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/sports/olympics/why-some-olympic-athletes-need-to-gorge.html?ref=nutrition|accessdate=5 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 July 2012}}</ref>

Excessive protein intake, though not connected to declined kidney functioning in healthy individuals,<ref>http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/25</ref><ref>http://www.annals.org/content/138/6/460.abstract</ref> may be harmful to those with certain kidney diseases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=11234|title=High-Protein Diets|publisher=[[American Heart Association]]|accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> There is no conclusive evidence that moderately high protein diets in healthy individuals are dangerous; it has only been shown that these diets are dangerous in individuals already suffering from kidney and liver problems.

The [[Basal Metabolic Rate]], which is the amount of [[calories]] the body expends at rest, meaning without performing any [[physical activity]], is influenced by the person's total [[weight]] and total amount of [[muscle]]. The more muscle, the more calories a person can burn naturally. When the amount of muscle is increased, then more calories can be ingested without gaining weight. Conversely, if the amount of [[fat]] is increased, increasing the number of calories ingested will only add weight.

Normally, when people lose weight, they lose a combination of fat and muscle. If the diet plan includes a daily caloric intake greater than the basal metabolic rate (BMR), the person will most likely lose fat. In contrast, if the person follows a diet that includes a lower caloric intake than the BMR, this person will lose fat but also a higher percentage of muscle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Severe diets may make people lose 50% fat and 50% muscle weight thus affecting their [[metabolism]] because by losing muscle the BMR is affected.

Maintaining muscle mass while losing fat is therefore a key factor to reach both the ideal weight and [[Human body|body]] composition.

==Energy obtained from food==
The energy intake from food is limited by the efficiency of [[digestion]] and the efficiency of utilization. The efficiency of digestion is largely dependent on the type of food being eaten, while efficiency of utilization is affected by a variety of factors, including age, gender, body weight, [[hormone]] levels, and many more.

[[Mastication|Chewing]], especially in the elderly, has been shown to increase the intake of [[micronutrient]]s. However, the effect of chewing on the intake of [[macronutrient]]s, such as sugars, fats, and proteins has not been observed.<ref>Ildebrando appollonio, Corrado Carabellese, Alessandra Frattola, Marco Trabucchi: "Influence of dental status on dietary intake and survival in community-dwelling elderly subjects". Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref>

==Proper nutrition==
[[Food]] provides nutrients from six broad classes: [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, [[fat]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral]]s, and [[water]]. Carbohydrates are metabolized to provide energy. Proteins provide [[amino acid]]s, which are required for cell construction, especially for the construction of muscle cells. Essential [[fatty acid]]s are required for brain and cell membrane construction. Vitamins and trace minerals helps to keep good electrolyte balance and are used for metabolic processes.  [[Dietary fiber]] also affects one's health, although it's not digested into the body.

The [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[World Health Organization]] publish guidelines for dietary intakes of all known essential nutrients.

Sometimes dieters will ingest excessive amounts of vitamin and mineral supplements. While this is usually harmless, some nutrients are dangerous. Men (and women who don't [[menstruation|menstruate]]) need to be wary of [[iron poisoning]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Retinol (oil-soluble vitamin A) is toxic in large doses. [[Vitamin E]] supplements have been found in some studies to increase mortality, congenital heart defects in offspring and an increased risk of stroke (see the corresponding article).{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Most people can obtain their nutritional needs from their diet.  In any event, a multivitamin taken once a day will suffice for the majority of the population.

Weight loss diets that manipulate the proportion of macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have not been shown to be any more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing).<ref>http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030201/cochrane.html</ref> Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.

Besides the importance of eating a balanced diet that includes all the necessary [[nutrients]], other factors also contribute to healthy nutrition. As well, drinking sufficient amounts of water is often claimed to help eliminate [[toxins]] and fat. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Heavily processed and fried foods as well as sweets, [[junk foods]], and [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] should also be avoided in a healthy diet.<ref name="D">{{cite web|url=http://www.mikesfitness.com/article_nutrition.php |title=Nutrition |date=|accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref>

Also a topic of great importance discussed among nutritionists as well as psychologists is the attitude to weight-loss and the consumption of food in general. Voicing ideas such as "it's just one burger" during and after weight loss regimes is discouraged, and often is said on the part of an insecure individual who has reached the unfortunate conclusion that nothing can be done any longer and that any effort to do so is futile. The advice given is, avoid reaching such a conclusion, as not only does it change one's perception of the effect of excessive amounts of food on the body, but also encourages a 'lacklustre' lifestyle and approach to life as a whole.

Nutritionists also agree on the importance of avoiding fats, especially saturated fats, to reduce weight and to be healthier. They also agree on the importance of reducing [[salt]] intake because commercial foods such as [[snacks]], [[biscuits]], and [[bread]], among others, already contain salt, thus contributing to an excess of salt daily intake.<ref name="E">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.case.edu/health/medical/nutrition.html |title=Why is Proper Nutrition Important?|date=|accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref>

MyPyramid Food Guidance System is the result of extensive research performed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to revise the original [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. It offers a wide array of personalized options to help individuals make healthy food choices. It also provides advice on physical activity.<ref name="F">{{cite web|url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/guidelines/index.html |title=Dietary Guidelines |date=|accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref>

==How the body eliminates fat==
All body processes require energy in order to function properly. When the body is expending more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is [[glycogen]] (by [[glycogenolysis]]). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder, in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested [[nutrients|macronutrients]], mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins [[lipolysis]], the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or [[fat cells]], are broken down into [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acids]], which can be used to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.

Fats are also secreted by the [[sebaceous gland]]s (in the skin).

==Weight loss groups==
Some weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include [[Weight Watchers]] and [[Peertrainer]]. The latter include, [[Overeaters Anonymous]], also several groups run by local churches, hospitals, and like-minded individuals.

These organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on [[twelve-step program]]s, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.<ref>[http://www.real-weight-loss-tips.cothe pow  Many programs counseling, emotional support, problem-solving, and useful informationm/weight-loss-challenge.html Challenge & Support for Effective Weight Loss]</ref>

==Food diary==
A 2008 study published in the [[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]] showed that dieters who kept a daily food [[Personal journal|diary]] (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if you write your food down, you wouldn't eat as many calories.<ref>{{cite news| title= Using food diaries doubles weight loss, study shows | url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2008-07-08-food-diaries%5FN.htm | date= July 8, 2008 | work=USA Today | first=Nanci | last=Hellmich | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>  Accordingly, diet journal software and websites have gained significant popularity, and help people track calorie consumption, calorie burning, weight loss goals, and nutritional balance.

==Medications==
Certain medications can be prescribed to assist in weight loss. The most recent prescription weight loss medication released is Acomplia (generic name Rimonabant), manufactured by Sanofi Aventis. Used to treat obesity in persons with a BMI ([[body mass index]]) of 30 or above, as well as for smoking cessation treatments, Acomplia is still pending FDA approval for use in the United States. Other weight loss medications, like [[amphetamine]], are addictive and consequently are now banned in the US for casual weight loss. Some supplements, including those containing [[vitamin]]s and [[dietary mineral|minerals]], may not be effective for weight loss.

===Diuretics===
[[Diuretic]]s induce weight loss through the excretion of water. Diuretics, which can be used in the forms of medications, supplements, or [[herb]]s, reduce overall body weight, but have no effect on an individual's total [[body fat]] content.  Diuretics can thicken the blood, cause cramping, kidney and liver damage. In a single report, the death of Jacqueline Henson was found to be related to swelling in her brain, which was associated with excessive water consumption over a short period of time, while she was on a special water diet.<ref>[http://www.infoniac.com/health-fitness/woman-dies-because-of-water-diet.html Woman Dies Because Of Water Diet]</ref>

===Stimulants===
[[Stimulant]]s such as [[ephedrine]], [[green tea]], [[caffeine]] or [[synephrine]] work to increase the [[basal metabolic rate]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Possible weight loss effects of drinking water prior to meals==
{{Main | Weight loss effects of water}}
A 2009 review found that existing limited evidence suggests that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500 ml of water prior to meals for a 12 week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in [[Weight loss effects of water|main article]].)

==Dangers of fasting==
{{Main|Fasting}}
Lengthy [[fasting]] can be dangerous due to the risk of [[malnutrition]] and should be carried out under medical supervision. During prolonged fasting or [[very low calorie diet]]s, the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the [[Human brain|brain]], causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of intermittent fasting have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent this issue.

==Side effects==
Dieting, especially extreme food-intake reduction and rapid weight loss, can have the following side effects and consequences:
*Subsequent weight re-gain
*Lowered [[metabolism]], causing future attempts at weight loss to become more difficult, and making weight gain easier
*[[Muscle atrophy]]
*Risk of developing [[eating disorder]]s, especially [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], even if initial intentions of dieting were health-wise
*[[hunger|Prolonged hunger]]
*[[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
*[[Libido|Reduced sex drive]]
*[[Fatigue (medical)|Fatigue]]
*[[Irritability]]
*[[Fainting]]
*[[Paranasal sinus|Sinus]] problems (especially [[post-nasal drip]])
*[[Rash]]es
*[[Acidosis]]
*[[Bloodshot eyes]]
*[[Gallbladder]] disease
*[[Seizures]]
*[[Malnutrition]], possibly leading to [[death]]
*[[Constipation]], due to lack of food-intake
*[[Dehydration]], due to lack of fluid-intake

While there are studies that showed the health and medical benefits of weight loss, a study in 2005 of around 3000 Finns over an 18-year period showed that weight loss from dieting can result in increased mortality, while those who maintained their weight fared the best.<ref name="weight science"/><ref name="nature2007"/><ref>{{cite journal |author= Sørensen TI, Rissanen A, Korkeila M, Kaprio J |title= Intention to Lose Weight, Weight Changes, and 18-y Mortality in Overweight Individuals without Co-Morbidities |journal= PLoS Medicine |year=2005 |volume=2|issue=6; e171|pmc=1160579 }}</ref> Similar conclusion is drawn by other studies,<ref name="weight science">{{cite journal |title= Weight science: evaluating the evidence for a paradigm shift |author= Bacon L, Aphramor L. |journal=Nutr J |year=2011 |volume=10:9|pmc=3041737 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ingram DD, Mussolino ME. |title=Weight loss from maximum body weight and mortality: the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File |journal=Int J Obes |year=2010|volume=34|pages=1044–1050.|pmid=  20212495 |doi=10.1038/ijo.2010.41 |issue=6}}</ref> and although other studies suggest that intentional weight loss has a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy, it is associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals and the slightly overweight but not obese.<ref name="harrington">{{cite journal |author= Harrington M, Gibson S, Cottrell RC |title= A review and meta-analysis of the effect of weight loss on all-cause mortality risk |journal=Nutr Res Rev. |year=2009 |volume=22|issue=1|pages=93–108 |pmid=19555520 |doi=10.1017/S0954422409990035}}</ref> This may reflect the loss of subcutaneous fat and beneficial mass from organs and muscle in addition to [[visceral fat]] when there is a sudden and dramatic weight loss.<ref name="nature2007">{{cite journal |url=|title=The Two Faces of Fat|author=Kendall Powell|journal=Nature|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=525–7|date=2007 May 31|pmid=17538594|doi=10.1038/447525a}}</ref>

==Low carbohydrate versus low fat==
{{Main|Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets}}
Many studies have focused on diets that reduce calories via a low-carbohydrate ([[Atkins diet]], [[Scarsdale diet]], [[Zone diet]]) diet versus a low-fat diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The [[Nurses' Health Study]], an observational [[cohort study]], found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less [[coronary heart disease]].<ref name="pmid17093250">{{cite journal |author=Halton TL, Willett WC, Liu S, ''et al.'' |title=Low-carbohydrate-diet score and the risk of coronary heart disease in women |journal=N.

==Low glycemic index==
"The [[glycemic index]] (GI) factor is a ranking of foods based on their overall effect on blood sugar levels. The diet based around this research is called the [[Low GI diet]]. Low glycemic index foods, such as lentils, provide a slower, more consistent source of glucose to the bloodstream, thereby stimulating less insulin release than high glycemic index foods, such as white bread."<ref name="pmid17636786">{{cite journal |last1=Thomas|first1=Diana|last2=Elliott|first2=Elizabeth J.|last3=Baur|first3=Louise|title=Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesity|journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online)|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD005105|publication-date=2007.Jul.18|date=2006.Jul.31|pmid=17636786|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|publication-place=USA|place=University of Sydney, Children's Hospital at Westmead, CEBPGAN (Centre for Evidence Based Paediatrics Gastroenterology and Nutrition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005105/pdf_fs.html|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Diana}}</ref><ref name="pmid6259925">{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=D.J.|last2=Wolever|first2=T.M.|last3=Taylor|first3=R.H.|last4=Barker|first4=H.|last5=Fielden|first5=H.|last6=Baldwin|first6=J.M.|last7=Bowling|first7=A.C.|last8=Newman|first8=H.C.|last9=Jenkins|first9=A.L.|title=Glycemic index of foods: a physiological basis for carbohydrate exchange|journal=[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/5/1264 the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]|publication-place=USA|publisher=The American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Inc|volume=34|issue=3|pages=362–6|date=1981.Mar|pmid=6259925|url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/34/3/362.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref>

The glycemic load is "the mathematical product of the glycemic index and the carbohydrate amount".<ref name="pmid12949357">{{cite journal|last1=Brand-Miller|first1=Janette Cecile|last2=Thomas|first2=M.|last3=Swan|first3=V.|last4=Ahmad|first4=Z.I.|last5=Petocz|first5=P.|last6=Colagiuri|first6=S.|author1-link=Jennie Brand-Miller|title=Physiological Validation of the Concept of Glycemic Load in Lean Young Adults|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2728–32|publication-date=2003.09.01|pmid=12949357|publisher=The American Society for Nutritional Sciences|publication-place=USA|place=Human Nutrition Unit, School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia|url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/133/9/2728.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|year=2003}}</ref>

In a [[randomized controlled trial]] that compared four diets that varied in carbohydrate amount and glycemic index found complicated results:<ref name="pmid16864756">{{cite journal|last1=McMillan-Price|first1=J.|last2=Petocz|first2=P.|last3=Atkinson|first3=F.|last4=O'neill|first4=K.|last5=Samman|first5=S.|last6=Steinbeck|first6=K.|last7=Caterson|first7=I.|last8=Brand-Miller|first8=Janette Cecile|author8-link=Jennie Brand-Miller|title=Comparison of 4 Diets of Varying Glycemic Load on Weight Loss and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Overweight and Obese Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|publisher=American Medical Association|publication-place=USA|place=Human Nutrition Unit, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia|volume=166|issue=14|pages=1466–75|publication-date=2006.Jul.24|pmid=16864756|doi=10.1001/archinte.166.14.1466|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/166/14/1466.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|year=2006}}</ref>
*Diet 1 and 2 were high carbohydrate (55% of total energy intake)
**Diet 1 was high-glycemic index
**Diet 2 was low-glycemic index
*Diet 3 and 4 were high protein (25% of total energy intake)
**Diet 3 was high-glycemic index
**Diet 4 was low-glycemic index

Diets 2 and 3 lost the most weight and fat mass; however, low density lipoprotein fell in Diet 2 and rose in Diet 3. Thus the authors concluded that the high-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index  diet was the most favorable.

A [[meta-analysis]] by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that low glycemic index or low glycemic load diets led to more weight loss and better lipid profiles. ''However'', the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] grouped low glycemic index and low glycemic load diets together and did not try to separate the effects of the load versus the index.<ref name="pmid17636786">{{cite journal |author=Thomas DE, Elliott E, Baur L |title=Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesity |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD005105 |year=2007 |pmid=17636786 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2 |editor1-last=Thomas |editor1-first=Diana}}</ref>

==Feminist perspectives==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Numerous feminists have written and spoken about the societal pressure on women to diet. [[Fat feminism]] is a movement that began in late sixties that opposes dieting, and instead promotes the [[Health at Every Size]] (HAES) approach and encourages women to accept their bodies' [[basal metabolic rate]].
In ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', [[Naomi Wolf]] calls dieting "the most potent political sedative in women's history".
