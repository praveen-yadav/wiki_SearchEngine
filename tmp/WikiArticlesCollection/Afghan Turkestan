'''Afghan Turkestan''' is a region in northern [[Afghanistan]], on the border with the former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s of [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. In the 19th century there was a province in Afghanistan named [[Turkestan Province]] until abolished by [[Abdur Rahman]],<ref>Angus Hamilton. ''Afghanistan''. W. Heinemann, 1906.

The whole territory, from the junction of the [[Kokcha]] river with the [[Amu Darya]] on the north-east to the province of [[Herat province|Herat]] on the south-west, was some {{convert|500|mi|km}} in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the [[Hindu Kush]] of 114 miles (183&nbsp;km). It thus comprised about {{convert|57,000|sqmi|km2}} or roughly two-ninths of the former kingdom of Afghanistan.

==Geography==
The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the [[Karakum Desert]].

==Population==
The bulk of the people are [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] with large concentrations of [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]] and [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]].<ref>[[USA Today]] - [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/05/13/pashtuns.htm Pashtuns say they're being brutalized], May 12, 2002.</ref>

==History==
Ancient Balkh or [[Bactria]] was an integral part of [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]], and was occupied by [[Indo-Iranians]]. In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the [[Achaemenian Empire]] and later became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. About 250 BC [[Diodotus of Bactria|Diodotus (Theodotus)]], governor of [[Bactria]] under the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucidae]], declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to [[Parthia]]n and nomadic movements about 126 BC. After this came a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak.  The district was devastated by [[Genghis Khan]], and has never since fully recovered its prosperity. For about a century it belonged to the [[Delhi]] empire, and then fell into [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] hands.  In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of [[Ahmad Khan Durrani]], and so remained under his son Timur.  But under the fratricidal wars of Timur's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs.  At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the [[emir]] Dost Mahommed the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850, Akcha and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859.  The sovereignty over Andkhui, Shibarghan, Saripul and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim.  Under the strong rule of [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Abdur Rahman]] these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of Habibullah the bonds once more relaxed.

In 1890 the [[district of Qataghan and Badakhshan]] was divided from Afghan Turkestan and made into the [[Qataghan-Badakhshan Province]]. Administration of the province was assigned to the [[Northern Bureau]] in [[Kabul]].<ref name=mcchesiraj> Fayz Muḥammad Katib. Siraj al-tawarıkh. V. III.
