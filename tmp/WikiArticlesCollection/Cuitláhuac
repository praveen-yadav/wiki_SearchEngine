'''Cuitláhuac''' ({{Audio-IPA|Cuitlahuac1.ogg|kwit'lawak}}) (c. 1476 &ndash; 1520)<ref>For year of birth, see entry for [http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/1.hist/CU.html#CUITLAHUAC "CUITLAHUAC"], ''Dictionnaire de la langue nahuatl classique'' (Wimmer 2006).</ref>  or '''Cuitláhuac''' (in Spanish orthography; in {{lang-nah|cuitlāhuac}},<ref>Wimmer (2006).</ref> honorific form '''Cuitlahuatzin''') was the 10th ''[[tlatoani]]'' (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlan]] for 80 days during the year [[Aztec calendar|Two Flint]] (1520).<ref name="cha">Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 56–57, 164–165, 216–217.</ref>

Cuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler [[Axayacatl]] and a younger brother of [[Moctezuma II]], the previous ruler of Tenochtitlan.<ref>Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 148–151.</ref> His mother's father, also called [[Cuitlahuatzin I|Cuitlahuac]], had been ruler of [[Itztapalapan]],<ref>Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 42–43.</ref> and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially.<ref>Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 50–51.</ref>

Cuitláhuac was made ''tlatoani'' of Tenochtitlan during the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]]; After Pedro de Alvarado had ordered [[the massacre in the Main Temple]], the Aztecs were very upset and started to fight and put a siege to the Spaniards. [[Hernán Cortés]] ordered Moctezuma to ask his people to stop fighting. Moctezuma told him that they would not listen to him and suggested Cortés free Cuitláhuac so that he could convince them to dispose of their arms and not fight anymore. Cortés then freed Cuitláhuac and once Cuitláhuac was free he led his people against the conquistadors. He succeeded and the Spaniards were driven out of Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520. Cuitláhuac was ritually married to Moctezuma's eldest daughter, a ten- or eleven-year-old girl who later was called [[Isabel Moctezuma]].<ref>Chipman, Donald E. (2005). Moctezuma's Children: Aztec Royalty Under Spanish Rule, 1520–1700. Austin: University of Texas Press, pp. 40-41 ISBN 0-292-70628-6. OCLC 5713428</ref>

After having ruled for just 80 days, Cuitláhuac died of [[smallpox]]<ref name="cha"/> that had been introduced to the [[New World]] by the [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. His elder brother [[Matlatzincatzin]], who had been ''[[cihuacoatl (position)|cihuacoatl]]'' ("president"), resigned upon Cuitláhuac's death.<ref name="chb">Probably from Chimalpahin (1997); broken reference.</ref> As soon as Cuitláhuac died, [[Cuauhtémoc]] was made the next ''tlatoani''.<ref name="cha"/>

The modern [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[municipio (Mexico)|municipality]] of [[Cuitláhuac, Veracruz]] and the [[Mexico City Metro]] station [[Metro Cuitláhuac]] are named in honor of Cuitláhuac. The [[asteroid]] [[2275 Cuitláhuac]] is also named after this ruler.

There is an Avenue in Mexico City Called Cuitláhuac (Eje 3 Norte) that runs from Avenue Insurgentes to Avenue Mexico-Tacuba and that is part of an inner ring; also many streets in other towns and villages in Mexico are so called.
