'''Charles Elwood''' "'''Chuck'''" '''Yeager''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|ɡ|ər}}; born February 13, 1923) is a retired [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and noted [[test pilot]]. In 1947, he became the first pilot to (officially) travel [[sound barrier|faster than sound]]. 

Yeager's career began in [[World War II]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of [[flight officer]] (the [[World War II]] USAAF equivalent to [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]]) and became a [[North American P-51 Mustang]] [[fighter pilot]].

After the war, Yeager became a test pilot of many types of aircraft including experimental rocket-powered aircraft. As the first human to break the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, he flew the experimental [[Bell X-1]] at [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 at an altitude of 45,000&nbsp;ft (13,700 m). Although [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] was the first to fly faster than Mach 2 in 1953, Yeager shortly thereafter set a new record of Mach 2.44.<ref name="yeagerbio_252">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 252.</ref>

Yeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in [[Germany]] and in [[Southeast Asia]] during the [[Vietnam War]], and in recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units he then was promoted to brigadier general. Yeager's flying career spans more than 60 years and has taken him to every corner of the globe, including the [[Soviet Union]] during the height of the [[Cold War]].

Yeager's popularity soared in the 1980s, when he was prominently featured in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'' and in its [[The Right Stuff (film)|1983 movie adaptation]], in which he was portrayed by [[Sam Shepard]].
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early life==
Yeager was born to farming parents Susie Mae and Albert Hal Yeager in [[Myra, West Virginia]], and graduated from high school in [[Hamlin, West Virginia]]. He had two brothers, Roy and Hal, Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (killed by Roy with a shotgun while still an infant)<ref name="yeagerbio_6">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 6.</ref> and Pansy Lee. His first experience with the military was as a teen at the [[Citizens Military Training Camp]] at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On February 26, 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse, and the couple had four children. Glennis Yeager died in 1990.

The name "Yeager" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|ɡ|ər}}) is an Anglicized form of the [[German language|German]] name ''Jäger'' or ''Jaeger'' (German: "hunter"), and so is common among immigrants of that community. He is the uncle of former baseball catcher [[Steve Yeager]].{{#tag:ref|Chuck Yeager is not related to [[Jeana Yeager]], one of the two pilots of the [[Rutan Voyager]] aircraft, which circled the world without landing or refueling.|group=N}}

==Career==

===World War II===
Yeager enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on September 12, 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at [[George Air Force Base]], [[Victorville, California]]. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than two months later, prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Blessed with unusually sharp vision (a [[visual acuity|visual acuity rated 20/10]]), which once enabled him to shoot a deer at {{convert|600|yd}},<ref name="yeagerbio_297">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 297.</ref> Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training.

He received his wings and a promotion to [[Warrant Officer (United States)#Flight Officer|Flight Officer]] at [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], [[Arizona]], where he graduated from class 43C on March 10, 1943. Assigned to the [[357th Fighter Group]] at [[Tonopah, Nevada]], he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s (earning a seven-day grounding order for pruning a tree belonging to a local farmer during a training flight),<ref>''Take Off magazine'', Issue 36, p. 991.</ref> and went overseas with the group on November 23, 1943.

[[File:P51-1 300.jpg|thumb|[[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51D-20NA]], ''Glamorous Glen III'', is the aircraft in which Yeager achieved most of his aerial victories.]]
Stationed in the [[United Kingdom]] at [[RAF Leiston]], Yeager flew [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]s in combat with the [[363d Fighter Squadron]]. He named his aircraft ''Glamorous Glennis''<ref>[http://www.cebudanderson.com/357profileglamorousglend.htm "357th Fighter Group Profile."] ''cebudanderson.com.'' Retrieved: December 8, 2010.</ref> after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945. Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over [[France]] on his eighth mission, on March 5, 1944.<ref name=EscapeEvasion>[http://narademo.umiacs.umd.edu/cgi-bin/isadg/viewitem.pl?item=105467 "Escape and Evasion Case File for Flight Officer Charles (Chuck) E. Yeager."] ''narademo.umiacs.umd.edu.'' Retrieved: December 8, 2010.</ref> He escaped to Spain on March 30 with the help of the ''[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]'' (French Resistance) and returned to England on May 15, 1944. During his stay with the ''Maquis'', Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat, although he did help to construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father.<ref name="yeagerbio_45">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 45.</ref> He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for helping another airman, who had lost part of his leg during the escape attempt, to cross the [[Pyrenees]].

Despite a regulation that "evaders" (escaped pilots) could not fly over enemy territory again to avoid compromising resistance groups, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, bomber pilot Captain Fred Glover, in speaking directly to the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], on June 12, 1944. With Glover pleading their case, they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the ''Maquis'' resistance movement was by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, if Yeager or Glover were shot down again, there was little or nothing about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy.

Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the air force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.

Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On 12 October 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make "[[ace in a day]]," shooting down five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of his "ace in a day" kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager later reported both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter (a German [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]). 

Another victory, which was not officially counted for Yeager, came during the period before his combat status was reinstated. During a training flight in his P-51 over the [[North Sea]], he happened on a German [[Junkers Ju 88]] heavy fighter attacking a downed [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] crew. Yeager's quick thinking and reflexes saved the B-17 crew, but because he was not yet cleared for flying combat again, his gun camera film and credit for the kill were given to his wingman, Eddie Simpson. (Yeager later mistakenly recalled that the credit had given Simpson his fifth kill.)

In his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that "atrocities were committed by both sides" and went on to recount going on a mission with orders from the [[Eighth Air Force]] to "strafe anything that moved."<ref name="Wolfgang W. E p454">Samuel 2004, p. 454.</ref><ref name="J. Coady p.13">Coady 2008, p. 13.</ref> During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H. Boschkay, "If we are going to do things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side."<ref name="Wolfgang W. E p454"/><ref name="J. Coady p.13"/> Yeager further noted, "I’m certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory."<ref>Yeager and Janos 1985, pp. 63, 80.</ref>

Yeager was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] while at Leiston, and was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|captain]] before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15, 1945, and returned to the United States in early February. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose [[Wright Field]] to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel [[Albert Boyd]], head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.<ref name="yeagerbio_60">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 60.</ref>

===Postwar===
[[File:Yeager supersonic flight 1947.ogg|thumb|Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947 in the X-1]]
Yeager remained in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now [[Edwards Air Force Base]]). After [[Bell Aircraft]] test pilot [[Chalmers Goodlin|"Slick" Goodlin]] demanded $150,000 to break the sound "barrier," the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1|Bell XS-1]] in a [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] program to research high-speed flight.<ref name="yeagerbio_121">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 121.</ref><ref name="right_stuff_52-53">Wolfe 1979, pp. 52–53.</ref>

[[File:Chuck Yeager X-1 (color).jpg|thumb|Yeager in the Bell X-1 cockpit.]]
Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges were along the lines of "Yeager better have paid-up insurance."<ref name="yeagerbio_157">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 157.</ref> Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs falling from a horse. He was so afraid of being removed from the mission that he went to a veterinarian in a nearby town for treatment and told only his wife, as well as friend and fellow project pilot [[Jack Ridley (pilot)|Jack Ridley]] about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch of the X-1.

Yeager broke the [[sound barrier]] on October 14, 1947, flying the X-1 at [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.07 at an altitude of 45,000&nbsp;ft (13,700&nbsp;m).<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D13F9355A1B7B93C0AB1789D95F438485F9 "New U.S. Plane Said to Fly Faster Than Speed of Sound."] ''[[The New York Times]],'' December 22, 1947. Quote: "An experimental rocket plane, the Bell XS-1, has flown faster than the speed of sound a number of times recently, Aviation Week reports in an issue to be released tomorrow."</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some aviation historians contend that American pilot [[George Welch (pilot)|George Welch]] broke the sound barrier two weeks before Yeager, while twice diving an [[North American F-86 Sabre|XP-86 Sabre]] on October 1, 1947, and again, just 30 minutes before Yeager's X-1 flight. Quote: The capabilities of the Sabre were finally released in June 1948 when the U.S. Air Force and North American announced that the XP-86, piloted by George Welch, had broken the sound barrier in a dive. However, the date of Welch's achievement was given as April 26, 1948 with no mention made of his earlier flights.<ref>

This was accomplished by flying to an altitude of approximately 45,000 ft (13,720 m) and with full power applied accelerating to the maximum level flight speed. The aircraft would then be rolled to inverted flight and pulled down until it was pointing straight down at the ground at full power and allowed to accelerate until it was supersonic (Mach 1). Minor buffeting would occur and supersonic flight would be momentarily achieved at approximately 35,000 ft (10,670 m).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20061028050426/http://www.aviation.technomuses.ca/pdf/SabreMk6.pdf  "Canada Aviation and Space Museum Canadair F-86 Sabre Mk 6."] ''Canada Aviation and Space Museum''. Retrieved: December 8, 2010.</ref> There was also a disputed claim by German pilot [[Hans Guido Mutke]] that he was the first person to break the sound barrier, on April 9, 1945, in a [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]].|group=N}} Yeager was awarded the [[Mackay Trophy|MacKay]] and [[Collier Trophy|Collier Trophies]] in 1948 for his mach-transcending flight, and the [[Harmon Trophy|Harmon International Trophy]] in 1954. The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's]] [[National Air and Space Museum]].

Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. He was also one of the first American pilots to fly a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]], after its pilot defected to [[South Korea]].<ref>Clark 1954, p. 208.</ref><ref>Kum-Suk and Osterholm 2007, p. 158.</ref> Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a [[chase plane|chase aircraft]] for the civilian pilot [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]], a close friend, as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.<ref name="yeagerbio_252" />

On November 20, 1953, the U.S. Navy program involving the [[Douglas Skyrocket|D-558-II Skyrocket]] and its pilot, Scott Crossfield, became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield's speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed "Operation NACA Weep." Not only did they beat Crossfield, but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the [[Wright brothers|50th anniversary of flight]] in which Crossfield was to be called "the fastest man alive."<ref name="yeagerbio_252" />

The Ridley/Yeager USAF team achieved Mach 2.44 on December 12, 1953. Shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, Yeager experienced a loss of aerodynamic control of the X-1A due to [[inertial coupling]] at approximately {{convert|80000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. With the aircraft simultaneously rolling, pitching, and yawing out of the sky, Yeager dropped {{convert|51000|ft|m}} in 51 seconds before regaining control of the aircraft at approximately {{convert|29000|ft|m}}. He was able to land the aircraft without further incident.<ref name="yeagerbio_252" />

[[File:Charles Yeager photo portrait head on shoulders left side.jpg|thumb|Charles Yeager photo portrait.]]
Yeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From May 1955 to July 1957 he commanded the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86H Sabre]]-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport|Hahn AB]], [[Germany]], and [[Toul-Rosieres Air Base]], [[France]]; and from 1957 to 1960 the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100D Super Sabre]]-equipped [[1st Fighter Squadron (United States)|1st Fighter Day Squadron]] (later, while still under Yeager's command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) at [[George Air Force Base]], California, and [[Morón Air Base]], [[Spain]].

Now a full Colonel<ref>Yeager (n.d.). To New Heights: 1961-1975. Retrieved from http://www.chuckyeager.com/1961-1975-to-new-heights.</ref> in 1962, after completion of a year's studies at the [[Air War College]], Yeager became the first commandant of the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School]], which produced astronauts for [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. Between December 1963 and January 1964,<ref name=Crash>[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/NF-104A_crash_site.htm "The Crash of Chuck Yeager's NF-104A".] ''check-six.com'', December 10, 1963.</ref> Yeager completed five flights in the [[NASA M2-F1]] [[lifting body]]. An accident during a test flight in one of the school's [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104]]s put an end to his record attempts.

In 1966, Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at [[Clark Air Base]], the [[Philippines]], whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in [[South Vietnam]] and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he accrued another 414 hours of combat time in 127 missions, mostly in a [[Martin B-57 Canberra]] light bomber. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]], [[North Carolina]], and led the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] wing in [[South Korea]] during the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|''Pueblo'' crisis]].

On June 22, 1969, Yeager was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and was assigned in July as the vice-commander of the [[Seventeenth Air Force]].

From 1971 to 1973, at the behest of [[Ambassador]] Joe Farland, Yeager was assigned to [[Pakistan]] to advise the [[Pakistan Air Force]].<ref name="yeagerbio_391">Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 391.</ref> During the [[Indo-Pakistan War of 1971|Indo-Pakistan War]], Yeager reputedly provided an assessment that the [[Pakistani Army]] would be in [[New Delhi]] within a week.<ref>Ingraham, Edward C.

===Post-retirement career===
[[File:Edw-yeager-monument-8.jpg|thumb|Monument to Yeager at [[Edwards Air Force Base]].]]
On March 1, 1975, following assignments in Germany and Pakistan, Yeager retired from the Air Force at [[Norton Air Force Base]], although he continued to occasionally fly for the USAF and NASA as a consulting test pilot at Edwards AFB.{{#tag:ref|For his consultant work to the Test Pilot School Commander at Edwards Air Force Base, Yeager was paid one dollar annually, along with all the flying time he wanted. The $1 allowed him to be covered by [[workers' compensation]] insurance. |group=N}}

Yeager made a cameo appearance in the movie ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983). He played "Fred," a bartender at [[Happy Bottom Riding Club|"Pancho's Place"]], which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, "if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years."<ref>Yeager and Janos 1985, p. 172.</ref> His own role in the movie was played by [[Sam Shepard]].

For several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to [[General Motors]], serving as the public face of [[AC Delco]], the company's automotive parts division.<ref name="yeagerbio_418">Yeager and Janos 1985, p.  418.</ref> In 1986, Yeager was invited to drive the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] [[pace car]] for the [[1986 Indianapolis 500|70th running of the Indianapolis 500]]. In [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988]], Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the [[Rogers Commission]] that investigated the explosion of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']].<ref>[http://www.456fis.org/CHUCK_YEAGER_BIOGRAPHY.htm "Brigadier General Charles E. Yeager."] ''The 456th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.'' Retrieved: December 8, 2010.</ref>

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yeager set a number of light, general aircraft performance records for speed, range, and endurance. Most notable were flights conducted on behalf of [[Piper Aircraft]]. On one such flight, Yeager performed an emergency landing as a result of fuel exhaustion. On another, he piloted Piper's [[turboprop]] [[Piper PA-42 Cheyenne|Cheyenne 400LS]] to a time-to-height record: FL350 (35,000 feet) in 16 minutes, exceeding the climb performance of a Boeing 737 at gross weight.

Yeager is fully retired from military test flying, after having maintained that status for three decades after his official retirement from the Air Force. On October 14, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new ''Glamorous Glennis III'', an [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15D Eagle]], past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] piloted by [[Bob Hoover]], a legendary air-show pilot who had been Yeager's wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was Yeager's last official flight with the U.S. Air Force. At the end of his speech to the crowd, Yeager concluded, "All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force." Later that month, he was the recipient of the ''[[Tony Jannus Award]]'' for his achievements.

On October 14, 2012 on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again in a [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], out of [[Nellis Air Force Base]] at the age of 89.<ref>Rogers, Keith.

==Awards and honors==

In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal "equivalent to a noncombat [[Medal of Honor]] ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the XS-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947." President [[Gerald Ford]] presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on December 8, 1976.<ref>[[s:Page:United States Statutes at Large Volume 89.djvu/1094|"Public Law 94-179."]] ''United States Statutes.'' Retrieved: September 10, 2012.</ref>{{#tag:ref|This is apparently a unique award, as the law that created it states it is equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor. It is referred to as a Special Congressional Silver Medal in the President's Daily Diary (also see for a list of ceremony attendees).<ref>[http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0036/pdd761208.pdf "The Daily Diary of President Gerald R.

Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by some {{who|date=May 2013}} to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. [[Marshall University]] has named its highest academic scholarship, the [[Society of Yeager Scholars]], in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of [[Experimental Aircraft Association]]'s [[Young Eagles|Young Eagle Program]] since 1994, and  has been named the program's Chairman Emeritus.<ref>Ford, Harrison.

Additionally, [[Yeager Airport]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia]], is named after Yeager. The [[Interstate 64]]/[[Interstate 77]] bridge over the [[Kanawha River]] in Charleston is named in his honor. On October 19, 2006, the state of [[West Virginia]] also honored Yeager with a marker along [[Corridor G (Appalachian Development Highway System)|Corridor G]] (part of [[U.S. Route 119|U.S. 119]]) in his home Lincoln County, as well as renamed part of the highway the ''Yeager Highway''.<ref name=YeagerComesHome>[http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=15274 "Yeager Comes Home."] ''[[WOWK-TV]]'', August 19, 2006.</ref>

==Personal life==
Yeager, and his wife Glennis, moved to [[Grass Valley, California]] after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements and commercial ventures.<ref name="Moller">Moller, Dave.

In 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott D'Angelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003.<ref name='LAT'/> Subsequent to the commencement of their relationship, a bitter dispute arose between Yeager, his children and D'Angelo. The children contended that the much younger D'Angelo had married him for his fortune, which Yeager and D'Angelo denied. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused D'Angelo of "undue influence" on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars from his pension fund.<ref name="Tresniowski"/><ref name='LAT'>Hubler, Shawn.
