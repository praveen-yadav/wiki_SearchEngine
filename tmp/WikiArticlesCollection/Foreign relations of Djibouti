===Eritrea===
With the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] (1998–2000), Ethiopia channeled most of its trade through Djibouti. Though Djibouti is nominally neutral, it broke off relations with Eritrea in November 1998, renewing relations in 2000. Eritrea's President Isaias visited Djibouti in early 2001 and President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] made a reciprocal visit to Asmara in the early summer of 2001. While Djibouti’s President Ismail Omar Guelleh has close ties with Ethiopia’s ruling [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF), he has tried to maintain an even hand, developing relations with [[Eritrea]]. On June 10, 2008 [[2008 Ras Doumeira border crisis|clashes]] broke out in the Ras Doumeira region between Djibouti and Eritrea.

===Ethiopia===
Diplomatic relations between the two countries was established in 1984.<ref name=MFA-Dj>[http://mfa.gov.et/Foreign_Policy_And_Relation/Bilateral.php "Ethiopia - Djibouti relations"], Ministry of Foreign Affairs website (accessed 9 October 2009)</ref> Relations between the countries are generally good. Both countries share ownership of the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railroad]]; however, this utility is in need of repairs and upgraded capacity. The railroad is tied to the [[Port of Djibouti]], which provides port facilities and trade ties to landlocked Ethiopia. Disputes between the [[Afar people|Afar]] and [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] people of Djibouti have the potential of involving Ethiopian citizens of these groups.

* The border between the two countries is based on the [[Franco-Ethiopian treaty (1897)|Franco-Ethiopian convention]] of 20 March 1897. A protocol signed by France and Ethiopia on 16 January 1954, stated that the demarcation of the boundary between the colony of Dibouti and Ethiopia as considered final, which became effective 28 February of that year. With the independence of Djibouti, there have been no significant issues over this border.<ref>[http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS154.pdf "Djibouti – Ethiopia Boundary"], U.S. Department of State, International Boundary Study No. 154 – February 20, 1976</ref>
* Djibouti President [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]] paid an official visit to Ethiopia in October 1991, when a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed between the two countries. Since 1991, the two countries have signed over 39 protocols agreements.<ref name=MFA-Dj/>

===France===

===United States===
{{Main|Djibouti-United States relations}}
The U.S. and Djibouti have forged strong ties in recent years. Foreign Aid from the U.S. plays the lead role in Djibouti's economy. In 2002, [[Military of the United States|United States]] units began operations from Djibouti with the aim of countering the possible threat of Islamic terrorism in the [[Horn of Africa]].

In April 1977, the United States established a [[Consulate General]] in Djibouti and upon independence in June 1977 raised the status of its mission to an embassy. The first U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Djibouti arrived in October 1980. Over the past decade, the United States has been a principal provider of humanitarian assistance for famine relief, and has sponsored health care, education, good governance, and security assistance programs.

Djibouti has allowed the U.S. military, as well as other nations, access to its [[port]] and [[airport]] facilities. The Djiboutian Government has been very supportive of U.S. and Western interests, particularly during the [[Gulf War|Gulf crisis of 1990-91]] and after the [[terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]]. In 2002, Djibouti agreed to host a U.S. military presence at [[Camp Lemonnier]], a former [[French Foreign Legion]] base outside the capital that now houses approximately 3,500 American personnel. U.S. service members organise and provide development and security assistance from the compound to administrations in the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Yemen]] as part of the [[War On Terror]]. As a victim of past international terrorist attacks, President [[Guelleh]] continues to take a very proactive position against terrorism.

===Turkey===
Relations between [[Turkey]] and Djibouti encompass the political, economic and military sectors. In 2012, exports from Turkey to Djibouti were estimated at $30.7 million USD, with $387,000 in imports from Djibouti. Aggregate bilateral trade between the two nations also totaled $31 million in volume.<ref name="Tmofa">{{cite web|title=Relations between Turkey and Djibouti|url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/relations-between-turkey-and-djibouti.en.mfa|publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>

==International organisations==
Djibouti is a member of the [[African Union]], [[Arab League]], [[La Francophonie]] and [[United Nations]].

In 1996, the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD), a developmental organisation of seven countries in East Africa, established its headquarters in [[Djibouti City]]. IGAD's mandate is for regional cooperation and economic integration. 

After the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, Djibouti joined the Global War on Terror. It is now home to the [[Camp Lemonnier]] military compound.

Djibouti is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).
