'''Bob Jones University''' ('''BJU''') is a [[Private university|private]], non-denominational [[Protestant]] university in [[Greenville, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=vii.}};{{cite book|author=Dalhouse, Mark Taylor|title=An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism & the Separatist Movement|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1996|pages=1–2}}: "The flourishing status of an institution committed to a militant theological and cultural conservatism marks Bob Jones University as worthy of note for observers of American religion."</ref>

The university was founded in 1927 by evangelist [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] (1883–1968). The current president, [[Stephen Jones (academic administrator)|Stephen Jones]], is the great-grandson of the founder and the fourth consecutive member of the Jones family to serve as president.

Since 2005 BJU has been accredited by the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]], a [[National accreditation|national accrediting organization]] recognized by the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]].<ref name="accreditation">"Accreditation under TRACS will enable our graduates to realize the benefits of accreditation without compromise to the University's Bible-based philosophy and practices.

==History==
[[File:Bob Jones, Sr.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bob Jones, Sr.]], the university's founder]]
Established in 1927 near [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], on the Florida panhandle, Bob Jones College moved to [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] in 1933, and to its present campus in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] in 1947, where it became Bob Jones University.<ref>On the move to Greenville see, [[John A. Matzko|John Matzko]], "'This Is It, Isn't It, Brother Stone?' The Move of Bob Jones University from Cleveland, Tennessee, to Greenville, 1946-47," ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'', 108 (July 2007), 235-256. The former Cleveland campus currently serves as the home of [[Lee University]], an institution supported by the [[Church of God (Cleveland)|Church of God]].</ref> There have been four presidents: Bob Jones, Sr. (1927–1947); [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] (1947–1971); [[Bob Jones III]], (1971–2005); and [[Stephen Jones (academic administrator)|Stephen Jones]], (2005 to the present).

From its inception, BJU has been located in the South "but has never had a predominantly southern constituency." In 2006, the state with the largest number of students enrolled was South Carolina, but many of these were married students who had moved from other parts of the country to attend the University. Other states with large representations in the student body are Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Ohio.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dalhouse, Mark Taylor|title=An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism & the Separatist Movement|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1996|pages=148–151}}</ref>

==Campus==
The university occupies 205 acres at the eastern city limit of Greenville. The institution moved into its initial 25 buildings during the 1947-48 school year. Additional buildings have been constructed on an average of more than one per year, and most have been faced with light yellow brick similar to that chosen for the original buildings.  The University has recently updated their dining common and snack bar.  The snack bar now includes Chick Fil' A, Brody's Grill, and Papa Johns.<ref>BJU Catalog (2011-12), 235; John Matzko, "'This is it, Isn't it, Brother, Stone?'

===Museum and gallery===
[[Bob Jones, Jr.]] was a connoisseur of European art and began collecting after [[World War II]] on about $30,000 a year authorized by the University Board of Directors.<ref name="art">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=193–196}}{{cite book|author=Jones Jr., Bob|title=Cornbread and Caviar|publisher=BJU Press|year=1985|pages=48–49}} “A Collector’s Dream” ''Greenville Piedmont'', 9 February 1989, A1.</ref> Jones first concentrated on the [[Baroque painting|Italian Baroque]], a style then out of favor and relatively inexpensive in the years immediately following the war.<ref name="art"/> Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, and a notable collection of Russian icons.<ref name="MandG">[http://bjumg.org/the-collection/ Museum & Gallery Collections]</ref> The museum also includes a variety of Holy Land antiquities collected in the early 20th century by missionaries Frank and Barbara Bowen.<ref name="MandG"/>
Not surprisingly, the gallery is especially strong in Baroque paintings and includes notable works by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], [[Gerard David]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[van Dyck]], and [[Gustave Doré]].<ref name="MandG"/> Included in the Museum & Gallery collection are seven very large canvases, part of a series by [[Benjamin West]] painted for [[George III]], called "The Progress of Revealed Religion," which are displayed in the War Memorial Chapel.<ref>[http://bjumg.org/the-benjamin-west-collection/ BJU Museum & Gallery website history of the West paintings].</ref> ([[Baroque painting|Baroque art]] was created during—and often for—the [[Counter-Reformation]] and so, ironically, BJU has been criticized by some other fundamentalists for promoting “false Catholic doctrine” through its art gallery.)<ref>[http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/bju/fundam.htm] Example of fundamentalist criticism of BJU for promoting Catholicism.

Fundamentalist Bob Jones University has it" ''Christian Century'', Nov 22, 2011].</ref>

After the death of Bob Jones, Jr., Erin Jones, the wife of BJU president Stephen Jones became director. According to David Steel, curator of European art at the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], Erin Jones "brought that museum into the modern era," employing "a top-notch curator, John Nolan," and following "best practices in conservation and restoration." The museum now regularly cooperates with other institutions, lending works for outside shows such as a Rembrandt exhibit in 2011.<ref>David Gibson, [http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2011-11/looking-catholic-art-fundamentalist-bob-jones-university-has-it "Looking for Catholic art? Fundamentalist Bob Jones University has it" ''Christian Century'', Nov 22, 2011].</ref>

In 2008, the BJU Museum & Gallery opened a satellite location, the "Museum & Gallery at Heritage Green" near downtown Greenville, which features rotating exhibitions from the main museum as well as interactive children's activities. The Heritage Green building, an extensively remodeled [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant, joined the neighboring [[Upcountry History Museum]] and the Greenville Children's Museum, all of which feature "the latest in museum technology.".q<ref>"Extraordinary art made more accessible,"''Greenville News'', [http://www.greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008803170303 March 17, 2008]; "Sacred art museum opens today", ''Greenville News'', [http://greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080419/OPINION/804190306/1004/NEWS01 April 19, 2008].

===Library===
[[File:JerusalemChamberBJU.JPG|thumb|right|Jerusalem Chamber, Mack Library, containing a collection of rare Bibles.]]
The {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Mack Library (named for [[John Sephus Mack]]) holds a collection of more than 300,000 books and includes seating for 1,200 as well as a computer lab and a computer classroom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=434}}</ref> (Its ancillary, a music library, is included in the Gustafson Fine Arts Center.)

The library's Fundamentalism File collects periodical articles and ephemera about social and religious matters of interest to evangelicals and fundamentalists.<ref>The Fundamentalism File, created in 1978, has more than 100,000 non-book items, mostly articles listed under 5,000 subject headings; it also contains the papers of three notable 20th-century fundamentalists: G. Archer Weniger (1915-1982), W. O. H. Garman (1899-1983), and Gilbert Stenholm (1915-1989). [http://libguides.bju.edu/ffile BJU Library website, Fundamentalism File, Introduction to the File]</ref> The university Archives holds copies of all university publications, [[oral histories]] of faculty and staff members, surviving remnants of university correspondence, and pictures and artifacts related to the Jones family and the history of the university.<ref>[http://libguides.bju.edu/content.php?pid=208607&sid=1738606 BJU Archives Research]. For instance, the archives hold decades of working scripts for university stage performances.</ref>

==Academics==
The university consists of seven colleges and schools that offer more than 60 undergraduate majors, including fourteen associate degree programs.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/academics/majors/ BJU website]</ref> Although BJU has an unranked and untenured faculty, most University employees consider their positions as much ministries as jobs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|publisher=BJU Press|year=1997|pages=251–252}}{{cite book|author=Wright, Melton|title=Fortress of Faith: The Story of Bob Jones University|publisher=BJU Press|year=1984|page=194}}: "Bob Jones University has a scholarly, dedicated faculty who regard teaching as not just a profession but as a Christian calling."</ref> It is common for retiring professors to have served the university for thirty, forty, and even occasionally, fifty years, a circumstance that has contributed to the stability and conservatism of an institution of higher learning that has virtually no endowment and at which faculty salaries are "sacrificial."<ref>''Voice of the Alumni'' [publication of the BJU Alumni Association], 1996-2006. In 1993, the CFO Roy Barton said that teachers' salaries were kept as "low as possible in order to offer affordable higher education to Christians." Barton said he could name "dozens of people who work here for half or a third of what they could be earning on the outside, but they are here because of a desire to be part of the ministry of training young people." ''Greenville News'', April 18, 1993, "Upstate Business," 11. In the same ''Greenville News'' issue, Bob Jones III said, "Everyone here is like a missionary." (10)</ref>

===Religious education===
The School of Religion includes majors for both men and women, although only men (approximately 500 per year) train as ministerial students.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/academics/college-and-schools/religion/ BJU School of Religion].</ref> Many of these students go on to a [[seminary]] after completing their undergraduate degree. Others take ministry positions straight from college, and rising juniors participate in a church internship program to prepare them for the pastoral ministry. In 1995 there were 1,290 BJU graduates serving as senior or associate pastors in churches across the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dalhouse, Mark Taylor|title=An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism & the Separatist Movement|pages=148–151}}</ref>

===Fine Arts===
The Division of Fine Arts has the largest faculty of the university's six undergraduate schools.<ref>Of the approximately 350 faculty members listed in the 2007-08 catalog, about a hundred, or roughly 30% taught in the Division of Fine Arts. ''Bob Jones University Catalog, 2007-08'', 341-47.</ref> Each year the university presents an [[opera]] in the spring semester and Shakespearean plays in both the fall and spring semesters.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/events/fine-arts/cod/ Concert, opera, & drama series, BJU website]. In 2011 the university won second place in the professional division of the National Opera Association 2009-10 video competition for its production of ''[[Samson et Dalila]]''. [http://www.noa.org/competitions/opera-production/2009-2010-winners.html NOA website].</ref> A service called “Vespers,” presented occasionally throughout the school year, combines music, speech, and drama.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=87–89, 191}}. Turner gives a detailed description of the development of Vespers from a recital potpourri to a themed program with a specific Christian message. [http://www.bju.edu/events/fine-arts/vespers.php BJU website]</ref> The Division of Fine Arts includes an RTV department with a campus radio and television station, [[WBJU]]. More than a hundred concerts, recitals, and laboratory theater productions are also presented annually.<ref name="Eternity 2008"/>

Each fall, as a recruiting tool, the university sponsors a "High School Festival" in which students compete in music, art, and speech (including preaching) contests with their peers from around the country.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/collegian/index.php?issue=80&article=800 High school students to compete in Fall Festival] Article from BJU website by Jeanne Petrizzo describing the festival</ref> In the spring, a similar competition sponsored by the [[American Association of Christian Schools]], and hosted by BJU since 1977, brings thousands of national finalists to the university from around the country. In 2005, 120 of the finalists from previous years returned to BJU as freshmen.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/collegian/index.php?issue=44&article=384 BJU ''Collegian'' article from BJU website]</ref>

===Rankings and accreditation===
Bob Jones, Sr. was leery of academic accreditation almost from the founding of the college, and by the early 1930s, he had publicly stated his opposition to holding [[regional accreditation]].<ref>However, in the earliest college catalog (called “An Epoch in Education”) Jones wrote, “Having met all the requirements, we have made application for admission to the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.” (32)</ref> Not surprisingly, Jones and the college were criticized for this stance, and academic recognition, as well as student and faculty recruitment, were hindered.<ref name=p68>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=68}}</ref>

In 1944, Jones wrote to [[John Walvoord]] of [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] that while the university had "no objection to educational work highly standardized….We, however, cannot conscientiously let some group of educational experts or some committee of experts who may have a behavioristic or atheistic slant on education control or even influence the administrative policies of our college." <ref>Jones to Walwoord, May 8, 1944 in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=354–355}}</ref> Five years later, Jones reflected that “it cost us something to stay out of an association, but we stayed out. We have lived up to our convictions.”<ref>Jones to James O. Buswell, May 12, 1949, in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=68}}</ref> In any case, lack of accreditation seems to have made little difference during the post-war period, when the university more than doubled in size.<ref name=p68/>

Because graduates did not have the benefit of accredited degrees, the faculty felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=203}}</ref> Early in the history of the college, there had been some hesitancy on the part of other institutions to accept BJC credits at face value, but by the 1960s, BJU alumni were being accepted by most of the major graduate and professional schools in the United States.<ref>"BJU's reputation in academic circles gradually became more respected for the intellectual preparation and strong character of its graduates. By the 1960s several graduate schools actively courted university alumni, and BJU graduates were accepted into most of the major graduate programs in the country despite the school's opposition to regional accreditation." {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=203, 353–355}}</ref> Undoubtedly helpful was that some of the university’s strongest programs were in the areas of music, speech, and art, disciplines in which ability could be measured by audition or portfolio rather than through paper qualifications.<ref name="Michael Collins 2007">Michael Collins, "Accreditation at Bob Jones University" (2007), unpublished paper, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.</ref>

By the early 2000s (decade), however, the university quietly reexamined its position on accreditation as [[degree mills]] proliferated and various government bureaucracies, such as law enforcement agencies, began excluding BJU graduates on the grounds that the university did not appear on appropriate federal lists.<ref name="Michael Collins 2007"/> In 2004, the university began the process of joining the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]. Candidate status—effectively, accreditation—was obtained in April 2005, and full membership in the Association was conferred in November 2006.<ref>BJU is also a founding member of the [[American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries]], a small group of institutions "clearly identified with the historic Christian fundamentalist tradition."[http://www.aaccs.info/members.asp American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries].</ref> In December 2011, BJU announced its intention to apply for regional accreditation with the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).<ref>[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20111207/NEWS/312070043/BJU-pursue-accreditation ''Greenville News'', December 7, 2011]. The university said that "significant changes" in SACS' approach to accreditation, including "respect [for] the stated mission of the institution, including religious mission” had addressed its earlier concerns about regional accreditation.

===''Unusual Films''===
Both [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] and [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] believed that [[film]] could be an excellent medium for mass evangelism, and in 1950, the university established ''Unusual Films'' within the School of Fine Arts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=196–197}}</ref> (The studio name derives from a former BJU promotional slogan, "The World's Most Unusual University".)<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=143}}</ref> [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] selected a speech teacher, [[Katherine Stenholm]], as the first director. Although she had no experience in cinema, she took summer courses at the [[University of Southern California]] and received personal instruction from Hollywood specialists, such as [[Rudolph Sternad]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=196–199}}; [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827889/ biographical information on Sternad]</ref>

Unusual Films has produced seven feature-length films: ''Wine of Morning'', ''Red Runs the River'', ''Flame in the Wind'', ''Sheffey'', ''Beyond the Night'', ''The Printing'', and ''Milltown Pride''.<ref>[http://www.bjupress.com/nav/category/Unusual%20Films%20Productions?parent_category_rn=281459 List of movies produced by Unusual Films]</ref> ''Wine of Morning'' (1955), based on a novel by Bob Jones, Jr., represented the United States at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>"''Wine of Morning'' was selected by the University Film Producers Association to represent the United States at the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television Schools in Cannes, France, and following a showing at the Congress, garnered praise from the international film community. ''Wine of Morning'' was also awarded four 'Christian Oscars' from the National Evangelical Film Foundation for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Producer." {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=198}}. There may have been some [[Cold War]] posturing involved in the nomination of this film. The president of the UFPA wrote to Stenholm that the "excellence of your production, ''Wine of Morning''...will provide the high quality which it is desirable to use in these international showings. We feel that the contrast between your film with its religious background and [the Russian entry] would be most revealing and that the contrast would reflect credit on our way of life." ("Bob Jones Religious Film To Represent US Colleges," ''The (Columbia, SC) State'', May 2, 1958, 12C).</ref> The first four films are historical dramas set, respectively, in the time of Christ, the U.S. Civil War, 16th-century Spain, and the late 19th-century South—the latter a fictionalized treatment of the life of Methodist evangelist, [[Robert Sheffey|Robert Sayers Sheffey]]. ''Beyond the Night'' closely follows an actual 20th-century missionary saga in Central Africa, and ''The Printing'' uses composite characters to portray the persecution of believers in the former [[Soviet Union]]. All the films have an evangelistic emphasis, and curiously, [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] plays villains in four of them. For twenty years Unusual Films emphasized children's films and video production<ref>List of recent films on the [http://protect.bju.edu/cstore/index.php?p=product&id=382&parent=183 BJU website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}.</ref> before, in 2011, it released [http://www.milltownpride.com/ ''Milltown Pride''], a [[feature film|feature-length film]] set in 1920s [[Upstate South Carolina]].

Unusual Films also maintains a student film production program. Freshmen shoot and edit a project shot on [[16mm]] [[Transparency (photography)|reversal]] black-and-white film. Sophomores are also required to write and direct such a project. Before graduation, seniors produce a sizable project on 16&nbsp;mm color negative film. Nevertheless, basic photography and video production are an integral part of the BJU cinema major.<ref>BJU Catalog, 2007–08, 156, 279.</ref>

===BJU Press===

==Controversies==

===Religious===

====Billy Graham====
[[File:Billy Graham bw photo, April 11, 1966.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], who attended BJU for one semester, was later at odds with the University]]
One of the earliest controversies to center on BJU was the break that occurred in the late 1950s between separatist fundamentalists and [[neo-evangelical]]s represented by the newly prominent evangelist [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]]. Graham had briefly attended Bob Jones College, and the university conferred an [[honorary degree]] on him in 1948.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=167}}</ref> During the 1950s, however, Graham began distancing himself from the older fundamentalism and, in preparation for his 1957 New York Crusade, he sought broad ecumenical sponsorship.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=171–181}} "The Protestant Council leadership was made up largely of clergy who denied the virgin birth of Christ, His deity, His bodily resurrection from the dead...and virtually every other historic Christian doctrine for which Bob Jones, Sr., his university, and other Fundamentalist leaders had fought....To further increase the breadth of his appeal, Graham began to accept invitations to speak at liberal seminaries in the Northeast—Union, Colgate, and other centers of American Modernism." (174) William Martin, ''A Prophet with Honor: The Billy Graham Story'' (New York: William Morrow, 1991), 98.</ref>

Bob Jones, Sr. argued that if members of Graham’s campaign executive committee had rejected major tenets of orthodox Christianity, such as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and the deity of Christ, then Graham had violated 2 John 9-11, which prohibits receiving in fellowship those who do “not abide in the teaching of Christ.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=180}}</ref> In the 1960s, Graham further irritated fundamentalists by gaining the endorsement of Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]] for his Boston campaign and accepting honorary degrees from two Roman Catholic colleges.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=185–186}}</ref>

As was his policy, Graham ignored criticism of his campaigns<ref>Lewis F. Brabham, ''A New Song in the South: The Story of the Greenville S.C. Billy Graham Crusade'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1966), 128.</ref> and, in 1966, claimed not to know why the University opposed them;<ref>"When Billy Graham arrived in Greenville for the March 1966 crusade, he issued a statement to the Greenville newspapers saying he really did not know what accounted for the split between him and Bob Jones University." {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=184}}</ref> but members of his staff openly accused Jones of jealousy on the grounds that Jones’s evangelistic meetings had never been as large as Graham’s.<ref>Graham associate T. W. Wilson, who had attended BJC, wrote Bob Jones, Sr., "What is the matter? Many times I have heard you say, 'I have preached to more people than any man in America.' Now that you can say this no longer, could it be that you have actually let the green-eyed old Monster of Jealousy creep into your heart?" Wilson to Jones, May 21, 1957, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=179}}</ref> Graham’s father-in-law, [[L. Nelson Bell]], mailed a fiery ten-page letter to most members of the BJU faculty and student body (as well as to thousands of pastors across the country) accusing Jones of “hatred, distortions, jealousies, envying, malice, false witnessing, and untruthfulness.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=182–183}}</ref>

In what seemed to the Joneses to be a deliberate affront, Graham held his only American campaign of 1966 in Greenville, South Carolina.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=183}} Graham had only three campaigns scheduled that year: London, Berlin, and Greenville, South Carolina.</ref> Under penalty of expulsion, the university forbade any BJU dormitory student from attending the Graham meetings.<ref>"No Bob Jones University dormitory student will be permitted to go to a single meeting of the Greenville crusade. No Bob Jones University adult student, if he is married or lives in town, may attend the crusade and remain as a student." [[Bob Jones, Jr.]], Chapel talk, February 8, 1965, Mack Library Archives, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=184}}. An exception was made for Bob Jones Academy students who lived in town with their parents.</ref> In a four-page position paper delivered to students in 1965, Bob Jones, Jr., condemned Billy Graham's "ecumenical evangelism" as unscriptural and "heretical," noting that Graham shared his platform with Catholic priests and that one could not "be a good Catholic and a good, spiritual Christian." When Graham arrived in Greenville, Jones, Jr. emphasized that the basis of the university's position was scriptural and not personal. "The Bible commands that false teachers and men who deny the fundamentals of the faith should be accursed; that is, they shall be criticized and condemned. Billy approves them, Billy condones them, Billy recommends them....I think that Dr. Graham is doing more harm in the cause of Jesus Christ than any living man; that he is leading foolish and untaught Christians, simple people that do not know the Word of God, into disobedience to the Word of God."<ref>Jones, "The Position of Bob Jones University in Regard to the Proposed Billy Graham Crusade in Greenville, A Chapel Talk by Dr. Bob Jones, Jr., on February 8, 1965"; ''Greenville News'', March 4, 1966, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=184–185}}</ref>

The negative publicity caused by the rift with Graham, itself a reflection of a larger division between separatist fundamentalists and [[neo-evangelicalism|neo-evangelicals]], precipitated a decline in BJU enrollment of about 10% in the years 1956-59. Seven members of the university board (of about a hundred) also resigned in support of Graham, including Graham himself and two of his staff members. By 1966, when Graham appeared in Greenville, BJU enrollment had strongly rebounded and continued to grow thereafter until the mid-1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=179–188, 253}}</ref>

====King James Version of the Bible====
[[File:Bible-KJV.JPG|thumb|right|King James Version of the Bible]]
The university requires use of the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible in its services and classrooms, but it does not hold that the KJV is the only acceptable English translation or that it has the same authority as the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=244–245}} [http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/position-statements/translation.php "Statement about Bible Translations," BJU website].</ref> The [[King-James-Only Movement]]—or more correctly, movements, since it has many variations—became a divisive force in fundamentalism only as conservative modern Bible translations, such as the [[New American Standard Bible]] (NASB) and the [[New International Version]] (NIV) began to appear in the 1970s. BJU has taken the position that orthodox Christians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (including fundamentalists) agreed that while the KJV was a substantially accurate translation, only the original manuscripts of the Bible written in Hebrew and Greek were infallible and inerrant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=244–245}}</ref> Bob Jones, Jr. called the KJV-only position a "heresy" and "in a very definite sense, a blasphemy."<ref>{{cite book|author=Jones Jr., Bob|title=Cornbread and Caviar|page=179}}</ref>

The university's stand has been condemned by some other fundamentalists. In 1998, [[Pensacola Christian College]] produced a widely distributed videotape, arguing that this "leaven of fundamentalism" was passed from the 19th-century Princeton theologian [[Benjamin B. Warfield]] (1851–1921) to Charles Brokenshire (1885–1954), who served BJU as Dean of the School of Religion, and then to current BJU faculty members and graduates.<ref>[http://www.troyandjessica.com/node/20 Documents on the BJU-Pensacola controversy archived on a private website].</ref> Ironically, [[Peter Ruckman]], a BJU graduate, has argued the most extreme version of the KJV-only position, that all translations of the Bible since the KJV have been of satanic origin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=244}}</ref>

====Criticism of Catholicism and Mormonism====
The three Bob Joneses, especially Bob Jones, Jr., sharply criticized the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. For instance, Jones, Jr. once said that Catholicism was "not another Christian denomination. It is a satanic counterfeit, an ecclesiastic tyranny over the souls of men....It is the old harlot of the book of the Revelation—'the Mother of Harlots.'" All popes, Jones asserted, "are demon possessed."<ref>Philip Jenkins, [[The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice]] (Oxford University Press, 2004), 24. "[[Pope Paul VI]], archpriest of [[Satan]], a deceiver and an anti-Christ, has, like [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], gone to his own place....[A] "pope must be an opportunist, a tyrant, a hypocrite, and a deceiver or he cannot be a pope....A pope claims to be Christ's vice-regent on earth; that is, he blasphemously and arrogantly claims to have the divine prerogatives to forgive sins, to assign his enemies to hell...and to speak on matters of faith and morals with the same infallibility as the Holy Bible."(1978)''Faith for the Family'' (October 1978, 2, 4)</ref> In 2000, then-president Bob Jones III referred, on the university's web page, to Mormons and Catholics as "cults which call themselves Christian."<ref>[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/15/story_1544_1.html Beliefnet.com]</ref> Furthermore, in 1966, BJU awarded an honorary doctorate to the Rev. [[Ian Paisley]], future British MP, leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], and Moderator of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]], who has referred to the Pope as a "Roman anti-Christ." <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/ian-paisley-can-the-big-man-say-yes-441754.html ''The Independent'', March 25, 2007]. After the death of Pope John XXIII in 1963, Paisley held a rally objecting to the lowering of the Union flag at Belfast City Hall in conjunction with "the lying eulogies now being paid to the Roman Antichrist".</ref>
Bob Jones III has argued that the university is not so much anti-Catholic or [[anti-Mormon]] as it is opposed to the idea that all men, regardless of religious beliefs, will eventually get to heaven: "Our shame would be in telling people a lie, and thereby letting them go to hell without Christ because we loved their goodwill more than we loved them and their souls…. All religion, including Catholicism, which teaches that salvation is by religious works or church dogma is false. Religion that makes the words of its leader, be he Pope or other, equal with the Word of God is false. [[Sola Scriptura]]. From the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onward, it has been understood that there is no commonality between the Bible way, which is justification by faith in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, and salvation by works, which the faithful, practicing Catholic embraces."<ref>[http://www.sullivan-county.com/news/bob_jones/bju.htm Sullivan County News]; [http://greenvilleonline.com/news/2002/02/18/2002021819515.htm Greenville News, February 18, 2002]</ref>

===Racial===

====Segregation====
Although BJU admitted Asians and other ethnic groups from its inception, it did not enroll [[Black (people)|black]] students until 1971, eight years after the [[University of South Carolina]] and [[Clemson University]] had been integrated by court order. From 1971 to 1975, BJU admitted only married blacks, although the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) had already determined in 1970 that "private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies" were not entitled to federal tax exemption. Late in 1971, BJU filed suit to prevent the IRS from taking its tax exemption, but in 1974, in ''[[Bob Jones University v. Simon]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the university did not have standing to sue until the IRS actually assessed taxes.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=416&invol=725] BOB JONES UNIVERSITY v. SIMON, 416 U.S. 725 (1974)</ref> Over a year later, on May 29, 1975, the University Board of Trustees authorized a change in policy to admit "students of any race," a move that occurred shortly before the announcement of the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Runyon v. McCrary]]'' (427 U.S. 160 [1976]), which prohibited racial exclusion in private schools.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=226–227}}</ref>

In May 1975, as it prepared to allow unmarried blacks to enroll, BJU adopted more detailed rules prohibiting interracial dating and marriage—threatening expulsion for any student who dated or married interracially, who advocated interracial marriage, who was "affiliated with any group or organization which holds as one of its goals or advocates interracial marriage," or "who espouse, promote, or encourage others to violate the university's dating rules and regulations."<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=461&invol=574 ''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574, 581)</ref> In 1982 BJU's then-president Bob Jones III, during interviews in which he defended the school's tax-exempt status, cited nine passages from the Bible - drawn both from the Old and New Testaments - which he claimed demonstrated that God intended races to be segregated:<ref>Associated Press "Theologians dispute Jones' Theory". ''[[The Item|The Daily Item]]'', Sumter. February 2, 1982</ref> "The Bible clearly teaches, starting in the 10th chapter of Genesis and going all the way through, that God has put differences among people on the earth to keep the earth divided", he said, adding that inter-racial marriage was "playing into the hands of the antichrist and the one-world system."<ref>Christopher Connell, "Uniqueness caused Bob Jones University to lose tax status". ''[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]'', November 24, 1982.</ref>

Later, in a 2000 interview, Bob Jones III said that [[interracial dating]] had been prohibited since the 1950s and that the policy had originated in a complaint by parents of a male Asian student who believed that their son had "nearly married" a white girl.<ref name=christoday2000>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/110/53.0.html Christianity Today article];[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0003/03/lkl.00.html "Larry King Live" transcript]</ref> He also admitted: "We can't point to a verse in the Bible that says you shouldn't date or marry inter-racial."<ref name=christoday2000/>

====''Bob Jones University v. United States'' (1983)====
{{main|Bob Jones University v. United States}}
[[File:Rodeheaver2009.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Rodeheaver Auditorium]]
On January 19, 1976, the Internal Revenue Service notified the university that its tax exemption had been revoked retroactively to December 1, 1970. The school appealed the IRS decision all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the University met all other criteria for tax-exempt status and that the school's racial discrimination was based on sincerely held religious beliefs, that "God intended segregation of the races and that the Scriptures forbid interracial marriage." <ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=461&invol=574 ''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574 @725)</ref> The university was not challenged about the origin of its interracial dating policy, and the District Court accepted "on the basis of a full evidentiary record" BJU's argument that the rule was a sincerely held religious conviction, a finding affirmed by all subsequent courts.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=461&invol=574 ''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574, footnote 28)</ref> In December 1978, the federal district court ruled in the university's favor; two years later, that decision was overturned by the [[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]].

On January 8, 1982, just before the case was to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, President [[Ronald Reagan]] authorized his Treasury and Justice Departments to ask that the BJU case be dropped and that the previous court decisions be vacated. Political pressure quickly brought the Reagan administration to reverse itself and to ask the Court to reinstate the case. Then, in a virtually unprecedented move, the Court invited [[William T. Coleman, Jr.]] to argue the government's position in an [[amicus curiae]] brief, thus ensuring that the prosecution's position would be the one the Court wished to hear.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=230}} "On April 19, the Court announced that it would not allow the NAACP to join the case, and in a step considered unprecedented by legal scholars and 'extraordinary' even to the NAACP's leadership, the Supreme Court Appointed a prosecutor of its own—black attorney and civil rights activist William T. Coleman. Bob Jones III commented that 'this puts the court in the position of creating an issue to be litigated and insisting that an issue be heard when one of the two litigants declares "no contest."'"</ref> The case was heard on October 12, 1982, and on May 24, 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Bob Jones University in ''[[Bob Jones University v. United States]]'' (461 U.S. 574). The university refused to reverse its interracial dating policy and (with difficulty) paid a million dollars in back taxes. Also, in the year following the Court decision, contributions to the university declined by 13 percent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=236}}</ref>

====Dropping the no-interracial-dating rule (2000)====
In 2000, following a media uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] to the university, Bob Jones III abruptly dropped the interracial dating rule, announcing the change on [[CNN|CNN's]] "[[Larry King Live]]".<ref>For negative commentary on this announcement by Bob Jones III, see Anonymous BJU Graduate, "Dancing with Compromise" (April 2000), [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=285&Itemid=27 The Multiracial Activist].</ref> Five years later when asked for his view of the rule change, the current president, Stephen Jones, replied, "I've never been more proud of my dad than the night he...lifted that policy."<ref>Susannah Meadows, "Passing the Torch at Bob Jones U."

====Apology for "racially hurtful" policies (2008)====
In November 2008, the university declared itself "profoundly sorry" for having allowed "institutional policies to remain in place that were racially hurtful."<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-11-24-bob-jones-university-race_N.htm USA Today, November 24, 2008]; [http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/position-statements/race-statement.php Statement about Race at Bob Jones University]. In the statement, the university admitted to having "conformed to the culture" rather than providing "a clear Christian counterpoint to it." Earlier that year some BJU alumni expressed concern that the university had never repudiated its racist past and petitioned the school to make a formal apology. [http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20081122/NEWS01/311220002&referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL Greenville News, November 22, 2008].</ref> That year BJU enrolled students from fifty states and nearly fifty countries, representing diverse ethnicities and cultures, and the BJU administration declared itself "committed to maintaining on the campus the racial and cultural diversity and harmony characteristic of the true Church of Jesus Christ throughout the world."<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/position-statements/race-statement.php Statement about Race at Bob Jones University].</ref>

By 2005, the university had established two [[501(c)(3)]] charitable organizations to provide scholarship assistance solely for minority students.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/financial/aid/ Financial Aid].

===Political===
As a twelve-year-old, Bob Jones, Sr. made a twenty-minute speech in defense of the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]]. Jones was a friend and admirer of [[William Jennings Bryan]] but also campaigned throughout the South for [[Herbert Hoover]] (and against [[Al Smith]]) during the 1928 presidential election. Even the authorized history of BJU notes that both Bob Jones, Sr. and Bob Jones, Jr. “played political hardball” when dealing with the three municipalities in which the school was successively located. For instance, in 1962, Bob Jones, Sr. warned the Greenville City Council that he had “four hundred votes in his pocket and in any election he would have control over who would be elected.” <ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=3, 10, 78, 246, 428}}</ref>

====Republican powerhouse====
[[File:Ron Strom.jpg|thumb|Both [[Ronald Reagan]] (left) and [[Strom Thurmond]] (right) played influential roles in the political life of BJU]]
From the inception of Bob Jones College, a majority of students and faculty were northerners, and therefore many were already Republicans living in the "[[Solid South]]." <ref>Turner, 246; Interviews of Mary Gaston Stollenwerck Jones by Margaret Beall Tice, (September–October 1973), University Archives, Mack Library, BJU. Bob Jones, Sr. had held many evangelistic campaigns in the North prior to founding the college, and he correctly guessed that a new college in Florida would be more attractive to northerners than a new college in his home state of Alabama.</ref> After South Carolina Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] switched his allegiance to the Republican Party in 1964, BJU faculty members became increasingly influential in the new state Republican party, and BJU alumni were elected to local political and party offices. In 1976, candidates supported by BJU faculty and alumni captured the local Republican party with unfortunate short-term political consequences, but by 1980 the [[Christian right|religious right]] and the [[country club Republican|"country club" Republicans]] had joined forces.<ref>Alan Ehrenhalt, ''The United States of Ambition: Politicians, Power and the Pursuit of Office'' (New York: Random House, 1991), 98-99. "With its factions bitterly opposed to each other, the Republican party lost virtually all its state legislative seats in Greenville County, even as Gerard Ford was carrying the county against Jimmy Carter by more than 3,000 votes." (98)</ref> From then on, most Republican candidates for local and statewide offices sought the endorsement of Bob Jones III and greeted faculty/staff voters at the University Dining Common.<ref>"As late as 1978 the state representative for most of the Bob Jones precincts was Sylvia Dreyfus, a liberal Jewish Democrat. That does not happen anymore. These days, when elections are held in the districts that surround the university, anybody who does not have a Bob Jones connection does not have a realistic chance." Ehrenhalt, 99.</ref>

National Republicans soon followed. [[Ronald Reagan]] spoke at the school in 1980, although the Joneses supported his opponent, [[John Connally]], in the South Carolina primary.<ref>"GOP debaters politick in state," ''Greenville News'', February 29, 1980. Reagan said he was "surprised" by Jones's endorsement of Connally.</ref> (Later, Bob Jones III denounced Reagan as "a traitor to God's people" for choosing [[George H.W. Bush]]—whom Jones called a "devil"—as his vice president. Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being a good president.)<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402413.html ''Washington Post'', May 4, 2005]</ref> In the 1990s, other Republicans such as [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Phil Gramm]], [[Bob Dole]], and [[Alan Keyes]] also spoke at BJU.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=248}}</ref> Democrats were rarely invited to speak at the university, in part because they took political and social positions (especially support for abortion rights) opposed by the [[Christian right|Religious Right]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=246–248}}. As Bob Jones Jr. wrote in his memoirs, "While the lecture platform of Bob Jones University will never be open to dishonest Liberals like [[Ted Kennedy]], conservative politicians and honorable statesmen have been speaking from that platform for many years." {{cite book|author=Jones Jr., Bob|title=Cornbread and Caviar|publisher=BJU Press|year=1985|page=197}}</ref>

====2000 election====
On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as candidate for President, spoke during school's chapel hour.<ref name="nohtva">[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/022800wh-gop-bush.html ''New York Times'' website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific reference to the university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating his opposition to the university's anti-Catholicism. (The [[John McCain]] campaign targeted Catholics with a "Catholic Voter Alert," phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.)<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/conventions/republican/features/turning.points/ CNN website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor]] of [[New York]] for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that....I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone."<ref name="nohtva"/> Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that [[John McCain]] had fathered an [[illegitimate]] child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from [[Bangladesh]], and later [[push poll]]ing also implied that the child was biracial.)<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/14/ip.00.html CNN website]</ref>

====Withdrawal from politics====
Although the March 2007 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' listed BJU as one of "The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites" because of its past influence on American politics,<ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3754&page=1 "The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites"]. The others mentioned were the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo; [[Potala Palace]] in Tibet; [[Ayodhya]], Uttar Pradesh state, India; and the [[Temple Mount]]/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem.</ref> BJU has seen little political controversy since Stephen Jones became president. When asked by a ''[[Newsweek]]'' reporter if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, "It would not be my choice." Further, when asked if he felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, "The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We’re not here to save the culture." <ref>Susannah Meadows, "Passing the Torch at Bob Jones U." ''Newsweek'' "Web Exclusive" [MSNBC link expired], January 29, 2005, hard copy at [http://158.158.239.51:81/search?/YPassing+&SORT=D/YPassing+&SORT=D&SUBKEY=Passing%20/1%2C282%2C282%2CB/frameset&FF=YPassing+&SORT=D&12%2C12%2C Fundamentalist File, Mack Library, BJU].</ref> In a 2005 ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by "some of the more vitriolic comments" made by his predecessors. "I don't want to get specific," he said, "But there were things said back then that I wouldn't say today."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/04/AR2005050402413_5.html Washington Post, April 4, 2005.]</ref> In October 2007 when Bob Jones III, as "a private citizen," endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for the Republican nomination for president, Stephen Jones made it clear that he wished "to stay out of politics" and that neither he nor the university had endorsed anyone.<ref>[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071021/NEWS01/710210319 Greenville News, October 21, 2007].</ref> Despite a hotly contested South Carolina primary, none of the candidates appeared on the platform of BJU's Founders' Memorial Amphitorium during the 2008 election cycle.<ref>Candidate [[Ron Paul]] did speak in a large classroom to an overflow crowd. BJU's vice president for administration said, “We purposefully chose a room in the Alumni building because we do not want candidates to hold rallies on campus. We want interested students, faculty and staff to benefit from the educational experience of listening to a candidate, and hopefully, as a result, be able to make a more informed voting decision.” ''BJU Collegian'', January 25, 2008.</ref> In April 2008 Stephen Jones told a reporter, "I don't think I have a political bone in my body."<ref>''Greenville Journal'' (April 4, 2008), 32.</ref>

"I believe in the inspiration of the [[Bible]] (both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]s); the [[Creationism|creation]] of man by the direct act of [[God]]; the incarnation and virgin birth of our Lord and Saviour, [[Jesus]] Christ; His identification as the Son of God; His vicarious atonement for the [[sin]]s of mankind by the shedding of His blood on the cross; the [[resurrection]] of His body from the tomb; His power to save men from sin; the new birth through the regeneration by the [[Holy Spirit]]; and the gift of eternal life by the grace of God."
|-
| style="text-align: left;"|— BJU Creed
|}
Religion is a major aspect of life and curriculum at BJU. The BJU Creed, written in 1927 by journalist and prohibitionist [[Samuel W. Small|Sam Small]], is recited by students and faculty four days a week at chapel services.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/about-bju/creed.php BJU website.]</ref>

The university also encourages [[church planting]] in areas of the United States "in great need of fundamental churches," and it has provided financial and logistical assistance to ministerial graduates in starting more than a hundred new churches.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/church-planting/ BJU website on church planting]</ref> Bob Jones III has also encouraged non-ministerial students to put their career plans on hold for two or three years to provide lay leadership for small churches.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=270–271}}</ref> Students of various majors participate in Missions Advance (formerly Mission Prayer Band), an organization that prays for missionaries and attempts to stimulate campus interest in world evangelism.<ref name="studentlife">[http://www.bju.edu/campus/life/orgs.html BJU Student Life]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}; ''Collegian'', 24 (February 4, 2011), 1.</ref> During summers and Christmas breaks, approximately 150 students participate in teams that use their musical, language, trade, and aviation skills to promote Christian missions around the world.<ref name="Eternity 2008"/> Although a separate nonprofit corporation, Gospel Fellowship Association, an organization founded by Bob Jones Sr. and associated with BJU, is one of the largest fundamentalist mission boards in the country.<ref>[http://www.gfamissions.org/ GFA Missions website][http://www.bju.edu/about-bju/additional-ministries.php BJU website]. BJU's website calls it an "additional ministry."</ref> Through its "Timothy Fund," the university also sponsors international students who are training for the ministry.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/giving/students.html BJU website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}; "Timothy program offers foreign students Bible training," [http://www.bju.edu/collegian/index.php?issue=70&article=679 ''Collegian'', April 12, 2007].</ref>

===Rules of conduct===
Strict rules govern student life at BJU.<ref>[www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf Student Handbook (pdf)] ([http://www.webcitation.org/67JNFOPWa Archive]). In January 2012, [http://www.collegemagazine.com/editorial/2104/The-Top-10-Most-Sexually-Repressed-Colleges ''College Magazine.com''] identified BJU as number 1 among the "Ten Most Prude Colleges" ahead of other religious universities such as Bringham Young (3) and Notre Dame (6).</ref> Some of these are based directly on the university's interpretation of the Bible. For instance, the 2011-12 Student Handbook states, "Students are to avoid any types of entertainment that could be considered immodest or that contain profanity, scatological realism, sexual perversion, erotic realism, lurid violence, occultism and false philosophical or religious assumptions." Grounds for immediate dismissal include stealing, immorality (including sexual relations between unmarried students), possession of hard-core pornography, use of alcohol or drugs, and participating in a public demonstration for a cause the university opposes.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011-12, 28,45.]</ref> Similar "moral failures" are grounds for terminating the employment of faculty and staff. In 1998, a homosexual alumnus was threatened with arrest if he visited the campus.<ref>[http://ctlibrary.com/1504 ''Christianity Today'' website.]</ref>

Other rules are not based on a specific biblical passage. For instance, the Handbook notes that "there is no specific Bible command that says, 'Thou shalt not be late to class,' but a student who wishes to display orderliness and concern for others will not come in late to the distraction of the teacher and other students."<ref>''BJU Day Student Handbook'', 07-08, 7.</ref> In 2008 a campus spokesman also said that one goal of the dress code was "to teach our young people to dress professionally" on campus while giving them "the ability to...choose within the biblically accepted options of dress" when they were off campus.<ref>"BJU Changes Dress Code," ''Greenville Journal'', May 2, 2008, 18.</ref>

Additional rules include the requirement that freshman resident hall students sign out before leaving campus and that resident hall students abide by a campus curfew of 10:30 pm, with lights out at midnight.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/residence.php "Student Expectations," BJU website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> Students are forbidden to go to movie theaters while in residence, or listen to most contemporary popular music.<ref>[www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011-12, 28-29.]. "While students are at the University, our goal is to teach them to appreciate music that is spiritually edifying and culturally valuable. For the BJU student, this precludes most of the music of our popular culture including rock, rap, jazz and country, as well as religious music that borrows from these styles." ''Bob Jones University Student Handbook'' (2010-11), 28.</ref> Male students are required to have conservative hairstyles, and facial hair is prohibited for students under 25.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2012-13, p. 39.]</ref> Women are expected to dress modestly and wear knee-length dresses or skirts to class and religious services.<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011-12, 31-33.]</ref> The university prohibits students from wearing clothing that displays the logos of [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] or its subsidiary [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]] because these companies have "shown an unusual degree of antagonism to biblical morality."<ref>[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011-12, 32.]</ref>

==Athletics==
BJU's athletic teams compete in Division I of the [[National Christian College Athletic Association]] (NCCAA) and are collectively known as the Bruins. The school began its inaugural intercollegiate season with four teams: men's soccer, men's basketball, women's soccer, and women's basketball. Intercollegiate golf and cross country teams were added in the 2013-2014 school year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bju.edu/athletics/|title=BJU athletics|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>
