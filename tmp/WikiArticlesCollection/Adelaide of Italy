'''Adelaide of Italy''' (931 – 16 December 999), also called '''Adelaide of Burgundy''', was the second wife of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]], [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name="ce">Campbell, Thomas. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01140c.htm St. Adelaide.]" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012 </ref> Empress Adelaide was perhaps the most prominent European woman of the 10th century; she was regent of the Holy Roman Empire as the guardian of her grandson in 991-995.<ref name="ce"/>

==Life==
Born in [[Orbe]], today in [[Switzerland]], she was the daughter of [[Rudolf II of Burgundy]] and [[Bertha of Swabia]].<ref name="McKitterick 1999">{{cite book|last=McKitterick|first=Rosamond|title=The new Cambridge medieval history|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0521364477|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>  Her first marriage, at the age of fifteen, was to the son of her father's rival in Italy, [[Lothair II of Italy|Lothair II]], the nominal [[King of Italy]]<ref name="Gallick 2009">{{cite book|last=Gallick|first=Sarah|title=The big book of women saints|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins e-books|location=Pymble, NSW|isbn=0061956562}}</ref>; the union was part of a political settlement designed to conclude a peace between her father and [[Hugh of Provence]], the father of Lothair. They had a daughter, [[Emma of Italy]].

===Marriage to Otto I===
[[Image:Meissner-dom-stifter.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide and her second spouse Otto&nbsp;I the Great]]
The [[Calendar of Saints]] states that her first husband was poisoned by the holder of real power, his successor, [[Berengar of Ivrea]], who attempted to cement his political power by forcing her to marry his son, [[Adalbert of Ivrea|Adalbert]]; when she refused and fled, she was tracked down and imprisoned for four months at [[Como]]. 

According to Adelheid's contemporary biographer, Odilo of Cluny, she managed to escape from captivity. After a time spent in the marshes nearby, she was rescued and taken to a "certain impregnable fortress," likely the fortified town of Canossa near Reggio.<ref> Odilo of Cluny, ''Epitaph of Adelheid'' ch. 3, in Gilsdorf, ''Queenship and Sanctity'', 131 </ref> She managed to send an emissary to throw herself on the mercy of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]]. His brothers were equally willing to save the dowager queen, but Otto got an army into the field: they subsequently met at the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] capital of [[Pavia]] and were married in 951; he was crowned [[emperor]] in Rome, 2&nbsp;February 962 by [[Pope John&nbsp;XII]], and, most unusually, she was crowned [[empress consort|empress]] at the same ceremony.<ref name="McKitterick 1999" />  Her children were: Henry, born in&nbsp;952; Bruno, born&nbsp;953; [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda]], the first [[Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg]], born about&nbsp;954; and [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], later [[Holy Roman Emperor]], born&nbsp;955.

In Germany, the crushing of a revolt in 953 by [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]], Otto's son by his first marriage,  cemented the position of Adelaide, who retained all her dower lands. She accompanied Otto in 966 on his third expedition to Italy, where she remained with him for six years.

===Retirement===
Adelaide had long entertained close relations with [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform, and in particular with its abbots [[Majolus]] and [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. She retired to a nunnery she had founded in c.&nbsp;991 at [[Selz Abbey|Selz]] in [[Alsace]].<ref>“[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-adelaide-of-burgundy Saint Adelaide of Bugundy]”. Saints.SQPN.com. 15 June 2012. Web. {2012-9-20}. </ref> Though she never became a nun, she spent the rest of her days there in prayer. On her way to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] to support her nephew [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolf&nbsp;III]] against a rebellion, she died at Selz Abbey on December&nbsp;16, 999, days short of the millennium she thought would bring the [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]] of Christ. She had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the Slavs. She was thus a principal agent&mdash;almost an embodiment&mdash;of the work of the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in the construction of the religion-culture of western Europe.<ref>"The Saints: A concise Biographical Dictionary", edited by John Coulson, published by Hawthorn Books, Inc. 1960.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/adelaide.HTM]</ref>
A part of her relics are preserved in a shrine in Hanover. Her feast day, December 16, is still kept in many German dioceses.

==Issue==
In 947, Adelaide was married to King [[Lothair II of Italy]]. The union produced one child:
*[[Emma of Italy]] - born 948, queen of France and wife of [[Lothair of France]]

In 951, Adelaide was married to King [[Otto I]], the future Holy Roman Emperor. The union produced four children:
*Henry - born 952
*Bruno - born 953
*[[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda]] - born 954, [[Abbess of Quedlinburg]]
*[[Otto II]] - born 955, [[Holy Roman Emperor]]

==Legacy==
Adelaïde is the heroine of [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s 1817 [[opera]], ''[[Adelaide di Borgogna]]'' and [[William Bernard McCabe]]'s 1856 novel ''Adelaide, Queen of Italy, or The Iron Crown''.

Adelaide is a featured figure on [[Judy Chicago]]'s installation piece ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', being represented as one of the 999 names on the ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]].''<ref name="Adelaide">{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Adelaide | work=Elizabeth A.
