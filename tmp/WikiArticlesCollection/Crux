'''Crux''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ʌ|k|s}} is the [[List of constellations by area|smallest]] of the 88 modern [[constellation]]s, but is one of the most distinctive. Its name is [[Latin]] for [[cross]], and it is dominated by a cross-shaped [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that is commonly known as the '''Southern Cross'''. 

==Visibility==
[[Image:Crux (Southern Cross) from Hobart, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The five brightest stars in Crux are clearly visible in the top right. The [[red giant]] [[Gacrux]] and orange giant [[Epsilon Crucis|Epsilon]] are distinctly different from the three other major stars of the constellation, which are blue-white in colour.]]

[[File:Crux-20100220.jpg|thumb|right|Stacked image of six identical frames of Crux.]]
Crux is easily visible from the [[southern hemisphere]] at practically any time of year. It is also visible near the horizon from [[Tropics|tropical latitudes]] of the [[northern hemisphere]] for a few hours every night during the northern winter and spring. For instance, it is visible from [[Cancun]] or any other place at latitude 25° N or less at around 10 pm at the end of April.<ref>{{cite book | title=Field Guide to the Stars and Planets | author=Pasachoff, Jay M | year=2000 | publisher=Houghton Miflin | isbn=978-0-395-93431-9 | page=67}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Ian Ridpath.com: Constellations | accessdate=March 4, 2011}}</ref>As you can see it is clearly shown that there are 5 main stars.

==Location and identification==
Contrary to popular belief,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Crux is not opposite to [[Ursa Major]]. In fact, in tropical regions both Crux (low in the south) and Ursa Major (low in the north) can be seen in the sky from April to June. Crux is exactly opposite to [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] on the celestial sphere, and therefore it cannot appear in the sky with the latter at the same time. For locations south of 34°S, Crux is circumpolar and thus always visible in the night sky.

Crux is bordered by the constellations [[Centaurus]] (which surrounds it on three sides) and [[Musca]].

Crux is sometimes confused with the nearby [[Vela (constellation)#False Cross|False Cross]] by stargazers. Crux is somewhat [[kite (geometry)|kite]]-shaped, and it has a fifth star ([[Epsilon Crucis|ε Crucis]]). The False Cross is [[diamond]]-shaped, somewhat dimmer on average, does not have a fifth star and lacks the two prominent nearby "Pointer Stars."

===Stars===

Three of the five main Crux stars—[[Alpha Crucis|Acrux]], [[Beta Crucis|Mimosa]], and [[Delta Crucis]]—are co-moving B-type members of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]], the nearest [[stellar association|OB association]] to the [[Sun]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Nearest OB Association: Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco OB2)|author=Preibisch, T., Mamajek, E.|year=2008|journal=Handbook of Star-Forming Regions|volume=2|pages=0|bibcode=2008hsf2.book..235P|arxiv=0809.0407}}</ref> They are among the highest-mass stellar members of the Lower Centaurus-Crux subgroup of the association, with ages of roughly 10 to 20&nbsp;million years.<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode=1989A&A...216...44D | author=de Geus, E.

====Markers====
Since the [[celestial sphere|southern sky]] lacks an easily visible [[pole star]], Alpha and Gamma (known as [[Acrux]] and [[Gacrux]] respectively) are commonly used to mark south. Tracing a line from Gacrux to Acrux leads to a point close to the Southern Celestial Pole.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} Alternatively, if a line is constructed perpendicularly between [[Alpha Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri]], the point where the above mentioned line and this line intersect marks the Southern Celestial Pole. The two stars of Alpha and Beta Centauri are often referred to as the "Southern Pointers" or just "The Pointers", allowing people to easily find the asterism of the Southern Cross or the constellation of Crux.

====Letters and names====
The four main stars that form the asterism are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Crucis. [[Alpha Crucis]], called Acrux, is a triple star 321 light-years from Earth. Blue-tinged and magnitude 0.8 to the unaided eye, it has two close components of magnitude 1.3 and 1.8, as well as a wide component of magnitude 5. The two close components are divisible in a small amateur telescope and the wide component is divisible in a pair of binoculars. [[Beta Crucis]], called Mimosa, is a blue-hued giant of magnitude 1.3, 353 light-years from Earth. It is a [[Beta Cephei]]-type [[Cepheid variable]] with a variation of less than 0.1 magnitudes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} [[Gamma Crucis]], called Gacrux, is a [[double star]]. The primary is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 1.6, 88 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 6.5, 264 light-years from Earth. [[Delta Crucis]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 2.8, 364 light-years from Earth. It is the dimmest of the Southern Cross stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

There are several dimmer stars within the borders of Crux. [[Epsilon Crucis]] is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 3.6, 228 light-years from Earth. [[Iota Crucis]] is a [[binary star]] 125 light-years from Earth. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is of magnitude 9.5. [[Mu Crucis]] is a double star where the unrelated components are about 370 light-years from Earth. The primary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.0 and the secondary is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.1. Mu Crucis is divisible in small amateur telescopes or large binoculars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Southern Cross and Coalsack Dark Nebula.jpg|thumb|Southern Cross and Coalsack Nebula]]
The [[Coalsack Nebula]] is the most prominent [[dark nebula]] in the skies, easily visible to the naked eye as a prominent dark patch in the southern Milky Way. It is large, five degrees by seven degrees, and is 600 light-years from Earth. Not all of the nebula is in the borders of Crux; some of it is technically in [[Musca]] and [[Centaurus]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

The [[open cluster]] NGC 4755, better known as the [[Jewel Box (star cluster)|Jewel Box]] or Kappa Crucis Cluster, has an overall magnitude of 4.2—to the naked eye it appears to be a fuzzy star—{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}and is about 7600 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} The cluster was given its name by [[John Herschel]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} About seven million years old, an age that makes it one of the youngest open clusters in the Milky Way, it appears to have the shape of a letter A. The Jewel Box Clusters is a Shapley class g and Trumpler class I 3 r cluster; it is a very rich, centrally-concentrated cluster detached from the surrounding star field. It has more than 100 stars that range significantly in brightness.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=87}} The brightest stars are mostly [[blue supergiant]]s, though the cluster contains a few bright [[red supergiant]]s. [[Kappa Crucis]] is a true member of the cluster that bears its name, and is one of the brighter star at magnitude 5.9.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}}

==History==
[[Image:Southern Celestial Map of Mestre João Faras.gif|thumb|Depiction of the Crux (labelled 'Las Guardas') by physician-astronomer Mestre [[João Faras]] in his letter of May 1, 1500, to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] from the newly discovered land of [[Brazil]]]]

Crux was visible to the [[Ancient Greeks]]; [[Ptolemy]] regarded it as part of the constellation Centaurus.<ref>Pasachoff, [http://books.google.pl/books?hl=pl&id=aKPWAAAAMAAJ&q=crux#search_anchor ''Stars and Planets''], 2006, p. 144.</ref>{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=247}} It was entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the [[precession of the equinoxes]] gradually lowered its stars below the [[Europe]]an horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=132-133}} By AD 400, most of the constellation never rose above the horizon for Athenians.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The 15th-century Venetian navigator [[Alvise Cadamosto]] made note of what was probably the Southern Cross on exiting the [[Gambia River]] in 1455, calling it the ''carro dell'ostro'' ("southern chariot").  However, Cadamosto's constellation had too many stars and was tilted incorrectly.<ref>"We likewise observed...due south by compass, a constellation of six large bright stars, in the figure of a cross in this form...we conjectured this to be the southern chariot, but could not expect to observe the principal star, as we had not yet lost sight of the north pole." A. Cadamosto ''Navigatione'', written c.1465 (1550 Ramusio edition, [http://books.google.com/books?id=iZ5TZHXOnYcC&pg=RA2-PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false p.116r];  1811 Kerr edition [http://books.google.com/books?id=YVjm2VmuOlgC&pg=PA244#v=onepage&q&f=false p.244])</ref> Historians generally credit [[João Faras]] - astronomer and physician of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] who accompanied [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] in the discovery of Brazil in 1500 - for being the first European to depict it correctly.  Faras sketched and described the constellation (calling it "Las Guardas") in a letter written on the beaches of Brazil on May 1, 1500, to the Portuguese monarch.<ref>{{citation |title = Revista do Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Brasileiro |location = Rio de Janeiro |year = 1843 |volume = V nº 19. |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=fx1-Np41_90C&pg=PA342#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> 

Another early modern description clearly describing Crux as a separate constellation is attributed to [[Andrea Corsali|Andreas Corsali]], an Italian navigator who from 1515 to 1517 sailed to China and the East Indies in an expedition sponsored by King Manuel I. In 1516, Corsali wrote a letter to the monarch describing his observations of the southern sky, which included a small map showing 19 stars and the two Magellanic Clouds in a geocentric orientation, along with a vivid textual description of the Southern Cross.<ref>{{citation |author = Nick Kanas | title = Star Maps: History, Artistry, and Cartography, Second Edition |location = Chichester, U.K. |year = 2012 |page = 118| ISBN =978-1-4614-0917-5}}</ref>

[[Émerie Mollineux]] has also been cited as the first uranographer to distinguish Crux; his illustration dates to 1592. Later adopters of the constellation included [[Jakob Bartsch]] in 1624 and [[Augustin Royer]] in 1679. Royer is sometimes wrongly cited as initially distinguishing Crux.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=247}} Explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] depicted Crux as an [[almond]], called "Mandorla".{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}}

Crux was first shown as a separate constellation on the celestial globes of [[Petrus Plancius]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]] in 1598 and 1600. Its stars were first catalogued separately from Centaurus by [[Frederick de Houtman]] in 1603.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/crux.htm | title=Ian Ridpath’s Star Tales – Crux | accessdate=August 5, 2013}}</ref>

==Cultural significance of the Southern Cross==
The most prominent feature of Crux is the distinctive asterism known as the Southern Cross. It has great significance in the cultures of the southern hemisphere.

===Flags and symbols===
{{main|Southern Cross Flag}}
[[Image:Southern cross appearing on a number of flags.PNG|thumb|250px|Crux, appearing on a number of flags and insignia]]
Beginning in the colonial age, Crux became used as a national symbol by several southern nations. The brightest stars of Crux appear on the flags of [[flag of Australia|Australia]], [[flag of Brazil|Brazil]], [[flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]]. They also appear on the flags of the [[flag of Victoria|Australian state of Victoria]], the [[flag of Australian Capital Territory|Australian Capital Territory]], the [[flag of Northern Territory|Northern Territory]], as well as the flag of [[Magallanes Region of Chile]], the flag of [[Londrina]] (Brazil) and several [[Argentina|Argentine]] provincial flags and emblems (for example, ''[[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]]'' and ''[[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]]''). The flag of the [[Mercosur]] trading zone displays the four brightest stars. Crux also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Brazil|Brazilian coat of arms]].

In Australia, the Southern Cross played a crucial role as symbol of the [[Eureka Stockade]]. In the Eureka Oath from [[Peter Lalor]]'s famous speech in 1854 under the [[Eureka Flag]] he proclaimed "We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties." Of the Australian national flag, the Australian poet [[Banjo Paterson]] wrote in 1893: <blockquote>The English flag may flutter and wave,<br> where the world wide oceans toss,<br>but the flag the Australian dies to save,<br>is the flag of the Southern Cross.''</blockquote>
The Southern Cross was written into the lyrics of "[[Advance Australia Fair]]" in 1901: "Beneath our radiant Southern Cross"; the song was adopted as the Australian National Anthem in 1984. The victory song of the Australian national cricket team is entitled "[[Under the Southern Cross I Stand]]".

The Southern Cross was included in the lyrics of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]] (1909): "''A imagem do Cruzeiro resplandece''" ("the image of the Cross shines"). The five stars are also in the logo of the Brazilian football team [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]] and the [[Brazilian coat of arms]]; it is mentioned in the Brazilian national anthem, and even featured as the name of the currency (the ''[[Brazilian cruzeiro|cruzeiro]]'' from 1942 to 1986 and again from 1990 to 1994. The constellation is displayed in all coins of the current series of the [[Brazilian real]].

In [[O Sweet Saint Martin's Land]], the lyrics for the Southern Cross are ''Thy Southern Cross the night''.

A stylized version of Crux appears on the Australian [[Eureka Flag]]. The constellation was also used on the dark blue, shield-like patch worn by personnel of the U.S. Army's [[Americal Division]], which was organized in the Southern Hemisphere, on the island of [[New Caledonia]], and also the blue diamond of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], which fought on the Southern Hemisphere islands of [[Guadalcanal]] and [[New Britain]].

===In non-Western astronomy===
In [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]], Crux and the [[Coalsack]] mark the head of the 'Emu in the Sky' in several [[Aboriginal cultures]], while Crux itself is said to be a [[possum]] sitting in a tree and a representation of the sky deity Mirrabooka. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In ancient [[Jyotisha|Hindu astrology]], the modern Crux is referred to as ''[[Trishanku]]''.<ref name="crux">{{Cite web | title = Crux - Trishanku| publisher = Space Yuga | date =2010-02-10 | url = http://spaceyuga.com/crux-constellation-hindu-mythological-name-trishanku/ | accessdate = 2011-06-15}}</ref>

Various peoples in the [[East Indies]] and Brazil viewed the four main stars as the body of a [[ray (fish)|ray.]]{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}} In both Indonesia and Malaysia, it is known as ''Bintang Pari'' and ''Buruj Pari'' respectively ("ray stars")

The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people of Indonesia called this constellation ''Gubug pèncèng'' ("raking hut") or ''lumbung'' ("the granary"), because the shape of the constellation was like a [[raking hut]].<ref>{{cite journal |last = Daldjoeni |first = N. |year = 1984  |title = Pranatamangsa, the javanese agricultural calendar – Its bioclimatological and sociocultural function in developing rural life. |url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/vru6945817245389/ |journal = The Environmentalist |volume = 4 |pages=15–18 |doi=10.1007/BF01907286}}</ref>

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name for the Southern Cross is ''Te Punga'' ("the [[anchor]]"). It is thought of as the anchor of Tama-rereti's ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]'' (the [[Milky Way]]), while the Pointers are its rope.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?wordID=10907 |title=Māori Dictionary; Waka o Tama-rereti, Te |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref>

In [[Mapudungun]], the language of Patagonian [[Mapuche]]s, the name of the Southern Cross is ''Melipal'', which means "four stars". In [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the language of the [[Inca]] civilization, Crux is known as "[[Chakana]]", which means literally "stair" (''chaka'', bridge, link; ''hanan'', high, above), but carries a deep symbolism within Quechua mysticism.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/941062 |title = Chakana: Inca Cross |date = 23 June 2007 |accessdate = 9 July 2012}}</ref>

In Samoa the constellation is called ''Sumu'' ("triggerfish") because of its rhomboid shape, while α and β Centauri are called ''Luatagata'' (Two Men), just as they are in Tonga.

In [[Tonga]] it is known as ''Toloa'' ("duck"); it is depicted as a duck flying south, with one of his wings ([[Delta Crucis|δ Crucis]]) wounded because ''Ongo tangata'' ("two men", [[α Centauri|α]] and [[β Centauri]]) threw a stone at it. The Coalsack is known as ''Humu'' (the "[[triggerfish]]"), because of its shape.{{sfn|Velt|1990}}

Among [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]s, the four most visible stars of Crux are considered ''iggaren'', i.e. four ''[[Maerua crassifolia]]'' trees.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The [[Tswana people]] of [[Botswana]] saw the constellation as ''Dithutlwa'', two giraffes - Acrux and Mimosa forming a male, and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Andrew|year=1986|title=Some Aspects of Tswana Cosmology|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=18|pages=33–37|jstor=40979758 }}</ref>

Acrux and Mimosa make up one foot of the Great Rhea, a constellation encompassing [[Centaurus]] and [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]] along with the two bright stars. The Great Rhea was a constellation of the [[Bororo people]] of Brazil. The [[Mocoví people]] of Argentina also saw a [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] including the stars of Crux. Their rhea is attacked by two dogs, represented by bright stars in Centaurus and Circinus. The dogs' heads are marked by [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha]] and [[Beta Centauri]]. The rhea's body is marked by the four main stars of Crux, while its head is [[Gamma Centauri]] and its feet are the bright stars of [[Musca]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=251}}

The [[Bakairi people]] of Brazil had a sprawling constellation representing a bird snare. It included the bright stars of Crux, the southern part of Centaurus, Circinus, at least one star in [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]], the bright stars of Musca, [[Beta Chamaeleonis|Beta]] and [[Delta Chamaeleonis]], [[Volans]], and Mensa.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=250}}

The peoples of the [[Solomon Islands]] saw several figures in the Southern Cross. These included a knee protector and a net used to catch [[Palolo worm]]s. Neighboring peoples in the [[Marshall Islands]] saw these stars as a fish.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}}

Two Pacific constellations also included [[Gamma Centauri]]. [[Torres Strait Islanders]] in modern-day Australia saw Gamma Centauri as the handle and the four stars as the [[trident]] of [[Tagai]]'s Fishing Spear. The [[Aranda people]] of central Australia saw the four Cross stars as the talon of an [[eagle]] and Gamma Centauri as its leg.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=249}}

===In popular culture===

[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Gaucho]]s are well known for using it for night orientation in the vast [[Pampa]]s and [[Patagonia|Patagonic]] regions. It is also of cultural significance, as it is referenced in several songs and literature, including the [[Martin Fierro]]. The Argentinian singer [[Charly Garcia]] says that he is from the southern cross in the song "No voy en tren".

The [[Argentine Air Force]] acrobatic display team is called ''[[Southern Cross Aerobatic Squadron|Cruz del Sur]]'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Southern Cross".

In the ''Victory At Sea'' suite, [[Richard Rodgers]] wrote "Beneath The Southern Cross" to depict the battleships in convoy and the loneliness of the sailors in the Southern Pacific during World War II. This tango melody is also "No Other Love Have I" in the musical "Me and Juliet" and a popular hit for [[Perry Como]] during the 1950s.

[[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]] (Crux/Southern Cross Sports Club) is a first class football (soccer) club in Brazil.

[[Melbourne]]'s [[Southern Cross Hotel]] was built and named in 1962 and was one of the city's foremost hotels during the decade. The hotel was demolished in 2005 and replaced by the similarly named office building known as [[Southern Cross Tower]]. There is a town in the Western Australian wheatbelt approx 300&nbsp;km east of Perth called [[Southern Cross, Western Australia|Southern Cross]]. Melbourne's [[Southern Cross railway station, Melbourne|Spencer Street Station]] was rebuilt and renamed "Southern Cross Station" in 2006.

The 1974 Australian [[America's Cup]] Challenger was named "Southern Cross" KA 4 representing the Royal Perth Yacht Club and was defeated 4-0 sailing off Newport Rhode Island by "Courageous" US26 sailing for the New York Yacht Club. Southern Cross became the trial horse for the 1977 Australian Challenger "Australia" KA 5 representing the Sun City Yacht Club that was defeated 4-0 sailing off Newport Rhode Island by Courageous US26 sailing for the New York Yacht Club.

The [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] uses a stylized image of the Southern Cross as a corporate logo.

[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|"Southern Cross"]] is also a 1982 song by the classic rock group [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]], written by Rick Curtis, Michael Curtis, and [[Stephen Stills]]. This song was also covered by [[Jimmy Buffett]] and is commonly played at his concerts.

After identifying a need for a church for Afrikaans speakers living in Holland, a church was established in Leusden and is known as Suiderkruis Kerk. (Southern Cross Church) There is a town called Suiderkruis (Southern Cross) in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. The opening lines of South African composer [[Koos du Plessis]]' Christmas carol, 'Somerkersfees' (Summer Christmas) are:
:''Welkom o stille nag van vrede''   (Welcome, o silent night of peace)
:''Onder die suiderkruis''            (Beneath the Southern Cross)

''[[Zeitgeist: the Movie]]'' claims that the Sun can be in the ''vicinity'' of Crux: this is seen through the northern hemisphere of the earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/C/Constellation |at=(Table of all constellations) |title=Constellation |publisher=Swinburne University |work=Cosmos - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/Z/Zodiac |title=Zodiac |publisher=Swinburne University |work=Cosmos - The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy}}</ref>

In the 2006 video game [[Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception]], Crux plays a major roll in the story of the game and is the name of the player's radio operator.

==Use in navigation==
[[Image:Pole01-eng.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Locating the south celestial pole]]
In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the Southern Cross is frequently used for navigation in much the same way that the [[Pole Star]] is used in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. 

The south celestial pole can be located from the [[Southern Cross]] (Crux) and its two "pointer" stars [[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri|β Centauri]]. Draw an imaginary line from [[Gamma Crucis|γ Crucis]] to [[Alpha Crucis|α Crucis]]&mdash;the two stars at the extreme ends of the long axis of the cross&mdash;and follow this line through the sky. Either go four and a half times the distance of the long axis in the direction the narrow end of the cross points, or join the two pointer stars with a line, divide this line in half, then at right angles draw another imaginary line through the sky until it meets the line from the Southern Cross. This point is 5 or 6 degrees from the south celestial pole. Very few bright stars of importance lie between Crux and the pole itself, although the constellation [[Musca]] is fairly easily recognised immediately beneath Crux.<ref name= Grainger/>

A technique used in the field is to clench one's fist and to view the cross, aligning the first knuckle with the axis of the cross.  The tip of the thumb will indicate south.<ref name= Grainger>{{cite book
