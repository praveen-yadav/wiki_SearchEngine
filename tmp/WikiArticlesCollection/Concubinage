'''Concubinage''' is an [[interpersonal relationship]] in which a person (presumed to be a woman) engages in an ongoing relationship (usually matrimonially and sexually oriented) with another person to whom they are not or cannot be married. The inability to marry may be due to differences in social rank (including [[slave]] status), or because the non-concubine is already married. In many historical cases, the relationship involved a man in a high social status, who had a legally sanctioned [[wife]] and maintained a second household with the lesser "wife". The woman in such a relationship is referred to as a '''concubine'''.

Historically, concubinage was frequently voluntary (by the woman and/or her family's arrangement), as it provided a measure of economic security for the woman involved.

Under [[Roman law]], [[Roman culture]] under the empire came to tolerate concubinage as long as the relationship was durable and exclusive; for Roman jurists, concubinage was an honorable ''[[de facto]]'' situation.<ref>Paul Veyne, "The Household and its Freed Slaves", in Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, eds, ''A History of Private Life; From Pagan Rome to Byzantium'' 1987:76).</ref>

Concerning the concubine's legal status or the legal definition of her status, in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] for example, concubinage was akin, although inferior, to marriage. The children of a concubine were recognized as legal [[offspring]] of the father. However, their inheritance rights may have been inferior to younger children of a marriage, or they may have received a smaller inheritance. Men frequently used concubines to bear heirs when they were not able to produce sons with their wives.

==Ancient Greece==
In [[Ancient Greece]], the practice of keeping a slave concubine (Greek ''pallakis'') was little recorded but appears throughout Athenian history. Law prescribed that a man could kill another man caught attempting a relationship with his concubine for the production of free children, which suggests that a concubine's children were not granted citizenship.<ref name="Davidson">{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens |page = 98 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}</ref> While references to the sexual exploitation of maidservants appear in literature, it was considered disgraceful for a man to keep such women under the same roof as his wife.<ref>{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | pages = 98–99 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}</ref> Some interpretations of ''[[hetaera]]'' have held they were concubines when one had a permanent relationship with a single man.<ref>{{cite book | author = James Davidson | title = Courtesans and Fishcakes:  The Consuming Passions of Classical Athens | page = 101 | ISBN = 0-312-18559-6 }}</ref>

==Ancient Roman ''concubinae'' and ''concubini''==
{{Details|Marriage in ancient Rome#Concubinage}}
Concubinage was an institution practiced in [[ancient Rome]] that allowed a man to enter into an informal but recognized relationship with a woman (''concubina'', plural ''concubinae'') not his wife, most often a woman whose lower [[Social class in ancient Rome|social status]] was an obstacle to marriage. Concubinage was "tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family".<ref>Grimal, Love in Ancient Rome (University of Oklahoma Press) 1986:111.</ref> It was not considered derogatory to be called a ''concubina'', as the title was often inscribed on tombstones.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kiefer, Sexual Life in Ancient Rome (Kegan Paul International) 2000:50.</ref>

A ''concubinus'' was a young male [[slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] chosen by his master as a sexual partner. Romans did not mark same-sex relations as "homosexual" if an adult male used a slave or prostitute, characteristically a youth, as his passive partner (see [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome]]). These relations, however, were expected to play a secondary role in marriage, within which institution an adult male demonstrated his masculine authority as head of the household ''([[paterfamilias]])''. In one of his [[epithalamium|wedding poems]], [[Catullus]] (''[[floruit|fl.]]'' mid-1st century BC) assumes that the young bridegroom has a ''concubinus'' who considers himself elevated above the other slaves, but who will be set aside as his master turns his attention to marriage and family life.<ref>[[Catullus]], ''Carmen'' 61; Amy Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), pp. 534–535.</ref>

==In the Bible==

Among the [[Israelites]], men commonly acknowledged their concubines, and such women enjoyed the same rights in the house as legitimate wives.<ref name="JewEncPil">{{cite web|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp. Greek, παλλακίς).|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=313&letter=P&search=Pilegesh|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2002-2011}}</ref> The principal difference in the [[Bible]] between a wife and a concubine is that wives had [[dowry|dowries]], while concubines did not.

The concubine may not have commanded the same respect and inviolability as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as "wife" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means "concubine". (However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife - specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}</ref>) In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}</ref> The Bible notes several incidents of intercourse between a man and another man's concubine, and none of them resulted in capital punishment for either party,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:7|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:22|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|19:2|}}</ref> although the man to whom the concubine belonged was dishonored by such a relationship.<ref name="JewEncPil" /> For instance, [[David]] is portrayed as having been dishonored when his concubines had a sexual relationship with his son [[Absalom]].<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:21-25|}}</ref>

Because it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, legitimate wives often gave their maids to their husbands to atone, at least in part, if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]].<ref name="JewEncPil" /> The children of the concubine had equal rights with those of the legitimate wife;<ref name="JewEncPil" /> for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}</ref> Later<ref name="JewEncPil" /> biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1-3}}</ref>

==In Judaism==
In Judaism, concubines are referred to by the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''pilegesh''. The term is a non-Hebrew, non-Semitic loanword derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word, ''pallakis'', Greek ''παλλακίς'',<ref>Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994</ref><ref>Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999</ref><ref>Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002</ref> meaning "a mistress staying in house".

According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]],<ref name="JewEncPil" /> the difference between a concubine and a full wife was that the latter received a ''[[ketubah|marriage contract]]'' (Hebrew:''ketubah'') and her marriage (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]'') was preceded by a formal betrothal (''[[erusin]]''). Neither was the case for a concubine. One opinion in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] argues that the concubine should also receive a ''marriage contract'', but without a clause specifying a divorce settlement.<ref name="JewEncPil" />

Certain Jewish thinkers, such as [[Maimonides]], believed that concubines were strictly reserved for kings, and thus that a commoner may not have a concubine. Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[Human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage. Even before Maimonides' assertions, [[Sunni Muslims]] officially prohibited ''[[mutah]]'' (i.e., temporary marriage) relationships. Some commentators {{Who|date=November 2009}} have suggested that Maimonides changed his view in response to the Sunni prohibition, just as [[Gershom ben Judah]] banned [[polygamy]] after Christians prohibited the practice.

Maimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25</ref> Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.

In the Hebrew of the contemporary [[State of Israel]], the word ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word ''[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]''&mdash;i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations&mdash;regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Kosher sex without marriage|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=16328|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=16 March 2006|author=MATTHEW WAGNER}}</ref><ref>Adam Dickter, "ISO: Kosher Concubine", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html SUZANNE GLASS, "THE CONCUBINE CONNECTION"], ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996</ref>

==Ancient China==
[[File:A Chinese Emperor With his Concubines Inspecting his Fantasy Fishing Fleet.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A European painting of an [[Emperor of China]] inspecting his fantasy fishing fleet with his concubines]]

In [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], successful men often supported several concubines. For example, it has been documented that [[Chinese Emperors]] accommodated thousands of concubines.<ref name=CAC>{{cite web|title=Concubines of Ancient China|url=http://www.beijingmadeeasy.com/beijing-history/concubines-of-ancient-china|work=Beijing Made Easy|publisher=Beijing Made Easy|accessdate=13 June 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}</ref> A concubine's treatment and situation were highly variable and were influenced by the social status of the male to whom she was engaged, as well as the attitude of the wife. The position of the concubine was generally inferior to that of the wife. Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to "legitimate" children. Allegedly, concubines were occasionally buried alive with their masters to "keep them company in the afterlife."<ref name="CAC"/>

Despite the limitations imposed on ancient Chinese concubines, history and literature offer examples of concubines who achieved great power and influence. For example, in one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of China, ''[[The Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' (believed to be a [[semi-autobiographical]] account of author [[Cao Xueqin]]'s own family life), three generations of the Jia family are supported by one favorite concubine of the Emperor.

Imperial concubines, kept by Emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], were traditionally guarded by [[eunuchs]] to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the Emperor.<ref name="CAC"/> Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Dowager Empress Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in China’s history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to the [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only surviving son, who would become the [[Tongzhi Emperor]]. She would eventually become the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in China for 47 years after her son's death.<ref name=EmpressChina>{{cite book|author= Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Books}}</ref>

==In Thailand==
In Thailand, men were permitted{{when|date=March 2013}} to have multiple wives, whom they could sell, as well as their children. The principal wife could only be divorced.  If her husband died, she inherited the property rights to the secondary wives.<ref>Michel Jacq-Hergoualch, ''Le Siam'', ''Guide Belles Lettres des Civilisations,'' [[Les Belles Lettres]] 2004, ISBN 2-251-41023-6, pp. 210-211.</ref>

==In Islam==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}
[[File:Jules Laurens 14.jpg|thumb|''Women of the Harem'' by [[Jules Laurens]], circa 1847|alt=Painting of seated women, with man standing]]
Chapter four (Surat-un-Nisa), verse three of the Quran <ref>Al-Quran Chapter 4, Verse 3</ref> states that a man may be married to a maximum of four women if he can treat them with justice or depend on his slave woman. 
Islam considered every human free from birth (Deen-al-Fitrah).<ref>Al-Quran, Chapter 5</ref> It further rendered concubinage acceptable as a social need only under certain guidelines. Children of concubines were declared legitimate as children born in wedlock. In ancient times, Islam imposed very strict checks on how a woman became a concubine in order to prevent misuse.

In ancient times, two sources for concubines were permitted under an Islamic regime. Primarily, non-Muslim women taken as prisoners of war were made concubines as happened after the [[Battle of Bani Qariza]].<ref name="Majlisi, M. B. 1966">Majlisi, M. B. (1966). Hayat-ul-Qaloob, Volume 2, Translated by Molvi Syed Basharat Hussain Sahib Kamil, Imamia Kutub Khana, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>  Alternately, in ancient (Pagan/Pre-Islamic) times, sale and purchase of human slaves was a socially legal exercise. However, Islam encouraged their [[manumission]] in general. On embracing Islam, it was encouraged to manumit slave women or bring them into formal marriage (Nikah).

According to the rules of Islamic Fiqas, what is ''halal'' (permitted) by Muhammad cannot be altered by any authority or individual. Therefore, although the ''concept'' of concubinage is ''halal'', concubines are no longer available in this modern era nor allowed to be sold or purchased in accordance with the latest human rights standards. However, as change of existing Islamic law is impossible, if there happens to be a concubine in this modern era anyhow, she must be given all the due rights which Islam had preserved in the past. It is further clarified that all domestic and organizational female employees are not concubines in this era and hence sex is forbidden with them unless Nikkah (formal marriage) or mut'ah (temporary marriage - which only Shiite Islam permits) is committed through the proper channels. The Sunni scholars also do not allow ''[[mut'ah]]'', or temporary marriage. According to Shiite scholars it is the Islamic mode of engagement before Nikkah (formal long term marriage) to assess each other's suitability as a spouse. Engagement before marriage is a need for which Shiite Islamic interpretation provides Mut'ah. Although sometimes the two are confused, Mut'ah is not concubinage.

==In the United States==

When [[slavery]] became institutionalized in the North American colonies, white men, whether or not they were married, sometimes took enslaved women as concubines. Marriage between the races was prohibited by law in the colonies and the later United States. Many colonies and states also had laws against [[miscegenation]], or any interracial relations. From 1662 the Colony of Virginia, followed by others, incorporated into law the principle that children took their mother's status, i.e., the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]''. All children born to enslaved mothers were born into slavery, regardless of their father's status or ancestry.<ref name="Kolchin17">[[Peter Kolchin]], ''American Slavery, 1619-1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17</ref> This led to generations of [[mixed-race]] slaves, some of whom were otherwise considered legally white (one-eighth or less African, equivalent to a great-grandparent) before the [[American Civil War]].

In some cases, men had long-term relationships with enslaved women, giving them and their mixed-race children freedom and providing their children with apprenticeships, education and transfer of capital. In other cases, the men did nothing for the women except in a minor way. Such arrangements were more prevalent in [[Southern United States|the South]] during the antebellum years.

Historians widely believe that the widower [[Thomas Jefferson]], both before and during his presidency of the United States in the early 19th century, had an intimate relationship of 38 years with his [[mixed-race]] slave [[Sally Hemings]] and fathered all of her six children of record.<ref name="Hemings">[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html "Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account"], Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved 22 June 2011. Quote: "Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife’s death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings."</ref> He freed all four of her surviving children as they came of age. The Hemings' were the only slave family to go free from Monticello. The children were seven-eighths European in ancestry and legally white. Three entered the white community as adults. A [[Jefferson-Hemings controversy|1998 DNA study]] showed a match between the Jefferson male line and a male descendant of Sally Hemings.<ref name="Hemings"/>

In [[Louisiana]] and former French territories, a formalized system of concubinage called ''[[plaçage]]'' developed. European men took enslaved or [[free people of color|free women of color]] as mistresses after making arrangements to give them a dowry, house or other transfer of property, and sometimes, if they were enslaved, offering freedom and education for their children.<ref name="everyculture.com">[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Creoles.html  Helen Bush Caver and Mary T.
