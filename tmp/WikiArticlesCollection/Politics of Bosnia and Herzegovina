{{Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
'''Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. Members of the parliament are chosen according to a [[proportional representation]] system.<ref>http://izbori.ba/documents/ZAKONI/POIZpw110508.pdf</ref>

The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.
The system of government established by the [[Dayton Accord]] is an example of [[consociationalism]], as representation is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power. 

Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into two ''Entities'' - the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]], which each have largely autonomous political power, as well as the district of [[Brčko District|Brčko]], which is jointly administered by both. Each of the Entities has its own constitution.

==Dayton Agreement==
Due to the [[Dayton Agreement]], signed 14 December 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina forms an international protectorate, with decisive power given to the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government - based on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the former socialist régime - is charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy.

The Dayton Agreement established the Office of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] (OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About 250 international and 450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

==High Representative==
{{main|High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly or to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative are often seen as dictatorship.<ref>[http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/KnausandMartin.pdf Knaus and Martin, Travails of the European Raj, Journal of Democracy, 14(3):60 (2003)]</ref><ref>[http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sshl/pdf/JISB%20BOS%203%20-%20Parish.pdf Matthew Parish, The Demise of the Dayton Protectorate, Journal of Intevention and Statebuilding December 2007]</ref> Even the symbols of Bosnian statehood (flag, coat of arms) have been chosen by the Highest Representative rather than by the Bosnian people. The source of the authority of the High Representative is essentially contractual. His mandate derives from the Dayton Agreement, as confirmed by the [[Peace Implementation Council]], an ad hoc body with a Steering Board composed of representatives of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[United States]], the [[presidency of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

==Executive branch==
The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serb]], [[Croat]]), each elected for a rotating 8-month term within their 4-year term as a presidency members. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters electing both the Bosniak and the Croat, and Republika Srpska voters electing the Serb. The Presidency is the [[head of state]] and it is mainly responsible for the [[foreign policy]] and proposing the [[budget]]. 

The Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and other ministers as appropriate.

The Council is responsible for carrying out various policies and decisions in the fields of diplomacy, economy, inter-Entity relations and other matters as agreed by the Entities.

Each of the Entities has its own Council of Ministers, which deal with internal matters not dealt with by the state Council.

==Judicial branch==
=== Constitutional Court ===

The [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the RS, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency.

Terms of initial appointees are 5 years, unless they resign or are removed for cause by consensus of the other judges. Once appointed, judges are not eligible for reappointment. Judges subsequently appointed will serve until the age of 70, unless they resign or are removed for cause. Appointments made 5 years after the initial appointments may be governed by a different law of selection, to be determined by the Parliamentary Assembly.

Proceedings of the Court are public, and decisions will be published. Rules of court are adopted by a majority of the Court, and decisions are final and binding.

The Constitutional Court's original jurisdiction lies in deciding any constitutional dispute that arises between the Entities or between Bosnia and Herzegovina and an Entity or Entities. Such disputes may be referred only by a member of the Presidency, by the Chair of the Council of Ministers, by the Chair or Deputy Chair of either chamber of the Parliamentary Assembly, or by one-fourth of the legislature of either Entity.

The Court also has appellate jurisdiction within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===State Court===
The [[State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] consists of three divisions - Administrative, Appellate and Criminal - having jurisdiction over cases related to state-level law and appellate jurisdiction over cases initiated in the entities.

A War Crimes Chamber was added in January 2005, and has currently adopted two cases transferred from the ICTY, as well as dozens of war crimes cases initiated in cantonal courts.

The State Court also deals with organized crime, economic crime and corruption cases. For example, former Presidency member [[Dragan Ćović]] is currently on trial for involvement in organized crime syndicates.

===Human Rights Chamber===
The [[Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Dom za ljudska prava za Bosnu i Hercegovinu'') has displayed activity between March 1996 and 31 December 2003. It was a judicial body established under Annex 6 to the [[General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Dayton Peace Agreement]]).

===Entities===
The entities each have a Supreme Court. Each entity also has a number of lower courts. There are 10 cantonal courts in the Federation, plus a number of municipal courts. The Republika Srpska has five municipal courts.
