'''Brian Anthony Boitano''' (born October 22, 1963) is an American [[Figure skating|figure skater]] from [[Sunnyvale, California]]. He is the [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Olympic champion]], the 1986 and 1988 [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]], and the 1985-1988 [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. National Champion]]. He turned professional following the 1988 season. He returned to competition in 1993 and competed at the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], where he placed sixth.

==Personal life==
Brian Boitano was born in [[Mountain View, California]], and now lives in [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/18/DDID197KN3.DTL|title=Skater Brian Boitano is cooking up a storm|first=Janny|last=Hu|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> Boitano is a graduate of Marian A.

==Figure skating career==
===Early career===
Brian Boitano first made his mark on the international scene when he won the bronze medal at the 1978 [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships]], beating future rival [[Brian Orser]] for that medal.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith  |first=Beverley  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A Year in Figure Skating  |year=1997 |publisher=McClelland & Stewart  |location= |isbn=0-7710-2755-9  }}</ref>

In 1982 Boitano became the first American to land a [[Axel jump|triple axel]]. In 1987 he introduced his signature jump, the 'Tano triple [[lutz jump|lutz]]' in which the skater raises his left arm above his head. He attempted a quadruple jump throughout the 1986-87 season and at the 1988 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], but did not cleanly land the jump; he double-footed the landing on two occasions.

Boitano was known primarily as a jumper early in his career and he, along with several other skaters, helped push the technical envelope of men's skating. It was not until his failure to defend his World title in 1987 that he focused specifically on improving his artistry.

Boitano placed second at the 1984 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], earning himself a trip to the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. He placed 5th at the Olympics, setting the stage for his success over the next four years.

===World Champion===
Following the 1984 Olympics, several skaters emerged as likely medal hopes following the retirement of [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]].

Boitano won the 1985 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], the first of his four titles. At the first [[1985 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] of the post-Hamilton era in 1985, [[Alexander Fadeev (figure skater)|Alexander Fadeev]] won, with [[Brian Orser]] finishing 2nd and Boitano 3rd. He had injured tendons in his right ankle a few weeks before the 1986 U.S. Championships but went on to win his second national title.<ref name=si021786>{{cite news | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1064528/1/index.htm | title = Books Or Blades, There's No Doubting Thomas | first = E.M.| last = Swift |date = February 17, 1986 | publisher = [[Sports Illustrated]] | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}</ref> At the [[1986 World Figure Skating Championships|1986 World Championships]], Boitano took the title, while Fadeev had a disastrous free skate despite having been in an excellent position to win; Orser finished 2nd once again.

During the 1986-87 season, Boitano had introduced two new elements to his programs: the 'Tano triple [[lutz jump|lutz]] and a quadruple [[toe loop jump|toe loop]], although he never succeeded in landing a clean quadruple jump in competition. The 1987 World Championships were held in [[Cincinnati]], giving defending World champion Boitano a home-field advantage. The outcome of the event would set the tone for the 1988 Olympics. At Worlds, Boitano fell on his quadruple toe loop attempt and placed second.

After losing the world title to Orser at home, Boitano and his coach [[Linda Leaver]] decided that some changes needed to be made if Boitano was to become the Olympic champion.<ref name="passiontoskate">{{Cite book|last=Bezic  |first=Sandra  |authorlink=Sandra Bezic |coauthors=[[David Hayes (author)|Hayes, David]] |title=The Passion to Skate: An Intimate View of Figure Skating  |year=1998 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub  |location= |isbn=0-8362-6452-5  }}</ref> Boitano had always been good at the technical requirements ("The first mark"), but he was weak on the artistic ("the second mark"). He was a self-described "jumping robot." In order to help his growth as an artist, he hired choreographer [[Sandra Bezic]] to choreograph his programs for the 1987-1988 Olympic season.<ref name="passiontoskate" />

Bezic choreographed two programs that featured clean lines and accentuated the skating abilities of the 5' 11" Boitano.<ref name="passiontoskate" />  The short program was based on [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ballet ''Les Patineurs'' in which Boitano plays a cocky young man showing off his tricks, using movements dating back to the 19th century.<ref name="passiontoskate" /> In one famous moment, Boitano wipes ice shavings, also called snow, off his skate blade and tosses it over his shoulder after landing a triple axel combination. The free skating program was based on the film score, ''Napoleon'', detailing various phases of a soldier's life.<ref name="passiontoskate" />

Boitano debuted his new programs at 1987 [[Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]], held in the [[Saddledome]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada, the same venue in which he would compete against Brian Orser for the Olympic title three months later. Boitano's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. Although Orser won the competition, Boitano skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. Boitano, Leaver, and Bezic were so confident about the strength of Boitano's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put him a shoulder above Orser in technical merit.

The short program at the 1988 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] proved to be a highlight. Boitano received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark. His free skate was flawed.<ref name="passiontoskate" /> Due to delays, he did not skate until after midnight. Still, Boitano won the competition, and went into the Olympics as the national champion (U.S.), as did Orser (Canadian).

===1988 Olympics: Battle of the Brians===
{{Main|Battle of the Brians}}
Going into the Olympics, Boitano and [[Brian Orser]] each had won a World title and each had excellent, balanced repertoire, with Boitano being known as the slightly better technician and Orser as the better artist. Adding to the rivalry, Boitano and Orser were both performing military-themed programs. Boitano's was to the music of Napoleon.

The [[Battle of the Brians]] at the [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics]] was the highlight of Boitano's amateur career. Boitano and Orser were effectively tied going into the [[free skating]] portion of the event and whoever won that portion would win the event. [[Alexander Vladimirovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeev]] had won the [[compulsory figures]] section of the competition with Boitano second and Orser third. In the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]], Orser placed first and Boitano second. The [[free skating]] was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so Boitano's lead would not be enough to hold him in first place if he lost the free skate.

Boitano skated a clean, technically excellent long program, with eight triple jumps, two Axels, and a triple-triple combination. Orser made one small mistake on a jump and omitted his planned second triple axel. Boitano won the Battle in a 5-4 split. Boitano won the gold medal, wearing skates with American flag appliqu√©s that are now part of the collections of the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

Following the Olympics, both Orser and Boitano went to the World Championships, which Boitano won. Boitano turned professional soon after.

===Professional and return to amateur===
Following the Olympics, Boitano went on to dominate competitions in the professional ranks, winning 10 straight professional competitions, including 5 consecutive World Professional Championship titles and 4 consecutive wins at the Challenge of Champions. Boitano also appeared in ''[[Carmen on Ice]]'', for which he won an [[Emmy]]. However, Boitano wanted to return to amateur competition and make another run at the Olympics.

Boitano's lobby proved successful and in June 1993, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) introduced a clause, commonly known as the "Boitano rule," which allowed professionals to reinstate as "amateur" or "eligible" skaters. This had been the result of Boitano's active involvement during the early 1990s, which saw professionals being allowed in the Olympic Games in the sports of tennis and basketball.<ref>{{Cite news

Boitano competed at the 1994 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], led after the short program, but lost to [[Scott Davis (figure skater)|Scott Davis]] in the long program in a 6-3 split decision. Boitano was named to the Olympic team. Going into the Olympics as a medal favorite in a strong field, Boitano missed his triple axel combination during the short program for the first time in his career. This mistake proved extremely costly, and knocked Boitano out of medal contention. He skated a good long program and finished 6th.

Boitano returned to the professional ranks afterwards. He was inducted into the [[World Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] and the [[United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] in 1996.

==Celebrity and popular culture career==
===What Would Brian Boitano Do?===
{{Main|What Would Brian Boitano Do?}}
A [[caricature]] of Boitano as a [[superhero]] appears as a semi-recurring character in the [[cartoon]] series ''[[South Park]]''. The movie ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' (1999), features a musical number titled "[[What Would Brian Boitano Do?]]". Boitano also appears in a 1995 Christmas cartoon that was a prototype of ''South Park'', entitled [[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]], in which the boys are more excited to meet him than either [[Jesus Christ]] or [[Santa Claus]]. The name of the song is a parody of the popular slogan [[What Would Jesus Do?]].

===Food Network show===
On August 23, 2009, [[Food Network]] debuted a new series entitled ''[[What Would Brian Boitano Make?]]'', which borrows both its name and opening musical theme from the ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'' song. The show features Boitano preparing meals for his friends. The series has been picked up for a ten-episode second season.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Would Brian Boitano Make Picked Up for Another Season |url= http://www.eatmedaily.com/2009/11/what-would-brian-boitano-make-picked-up-for-another-season/ |work=EatMeDaily.com |date=November 9, 2009 }}</ref>
