'''Adalbert of Prague''' ([[Czech language|Czech]]: {{Audio|Cs-svaty_Vojtech.ogg|''Vojtěch''}}, {{lang-pl|Wojciech}}, c. 956 – April 23, 997), was a [[Czechs|Czech]] Roman Catholic saint, a [[Bishop of Prague]] and a [[missionary]] who was martyred in his efforts to convert the [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussians]]. He evangelized Poles and Hungarians. Adalbert was later made the [[patron saint]] of [[Bohemia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussia]].

==Life==
===Early years===
Adalbert (named ''Vojtěch'' at birth) was born into a noble Czech family of Prince [[Slavník]] and his wife [[Střezislava]] in [[Libice nad Cidlinou]], Bohemia. His father was a rich and independent ruler of the [[Zlicans|Zličan]] princedom that rivaled Prague (see [[Slavník's dynasty]]). Adalbert had five full brothers: [[Soběslav (d. 1004)|Soběslav]] (Slavnik's heir), Spytimír, Pobraslav, Pořej, Čáslav and a half-brother [[Radim Gaudentius|Radim (Gaudentius)]] from his father's liaison with another woman. Radim chose a clerical career as did Adalbert, and took the name Gaudentius. Adalbert was a well-educated man, having studied for about ten years (970-80) in [[Magdeburg]] under Saint [[Adalbert of Magdeburg]]. Upon the death of his mentor, he took the name Adalbert. Gifted and talented, he attended the Saint Adalbert Elementary School in Elmhurst. Soon, he became a well known graduate of the school.

===Religious acts===
In 980 Adalbert finished his studies at the Magdeburg school and returned to Prague, where he became a priest. In 981 his father, Prince Slavnik, and both his mentors died. In 982, still not yet 30 years old, Adalbert became the [[Bishop of Prague]].<ref>“Saint Adalbert of Prague”. Saints.SQPN.com. 1 May 2012. Web. {2012-9--20}. <http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-adalbert-of-prague</ref> Although Adalbert descended from a rich family and could afford comfort and luxury, he lived poorly of his own free will. He was noted for charity, austerity, and zealous service to the Church. His duty was difficult even in baptized Bohemia, as the pagan creed was deeply embedded in the peoples' minds. Adalbert complained of polygamy and idolatry, which still were not unusual among the Czechs.  He also strongly resented the participation of baptized Christians in the [[slavery|slave]] trade.

In 989 he resigned from his bishop's cloth and left Prague. He went to Rome and lived as a hermit in [[St. Alexis Benedictine]] [[monastery]]. Four years later, in 993, [[Pope John XV]] sent him back to Bohemia, and Adalbert became the bishop again. That time he founded a [[Brevnov Monastery|monastery in Břevnov]], near Prague, the first one in the Czech lands. Nonetheless, the nobility there continued to oppose his ministry. Also, according to [[Cosmas of Prague]]'s chronicle, high clerical office was a burden to Adalbert, and in 994 he offered it to [[Strachkvas]] who was a member of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] and [[Duke Boleslav]]'s brother. Strachkvas, nevertheless, refused.

In 995, the [[Slavniks]]' former rivalry with the Přemyslids (allied with the powerful Bohemian clan, the [[Vršovci]]s) resulted in the storming of the Slavnik town of [[Libice nad Cidlinou]] led by the Přemyslid [[Boleslaus II the Pious]]. During the struggle four (or five) of Adalbert's brothers were killed. Nonetheless, the Zličan princedom became part of the Přemyslids' estate.

After the tragedy he could not stay in Bohemia and escaped from Prague, despite the Pope's call for him to return to his episcopal see. Strachkvas was eventually appointed to be his successor. However, when he was going to assume the Bishop office in Prague, he suddenly died during the ceremony itself. Circumstances of his death are still unclear.

As for Adalbert, he went to [[Hungary]] and baptized [[Géza, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|Géza of Hungary]] and his son [[Stephen of Hungary|Stephen]] in the city of [[Esztergom]]. Then he went to Poland where he was cordially welcomed by Bolesław I the Brave. After the short visit Adalbert went to Prussia with a Christian mission.

===Mission and martyrdom in Prussia===
[[File:Adalb.jpg|thumb|The execution of St. Adalbert by the pagan [[Prussians]], [[Gniezno Doors]] panel]]
Adalbert of Prague had already in 977 entertained the idea of becoming a [[missionary]] in [[Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]]. After he had converted Hungary, he was sent by the Pope to convert the heathen [[Prussians]].<ref>Monks of Ramsgate. “Adalbert”. Book of Saints, 1921. Saints.SQPN.com. 30 April 2012. Web. {2012-9-20}. <http://saints.sqpn.com/book-of-saints-adalbert</ref>  [[Boleslaus I of Poland|Boleslaus the Brave]], duke of Poland (later king), sent [[soldiers]] with Adalbert. The bishop and his followers - including his half-brother Radim (Gaudentius) - entered Prussian territory and went along the [[Baltic Sea]] coast to [[Gdańsk]].

It was a standard procedure of Christian missionaries to try to chop down [[Sacred grove|sacred oak trees]], which they had done in many other places, including [[Saxony]]. Because the trees were worshipped and the spirits who were believed to inhabit the trees were feared for their powers, this was done to demonstrate to the non-Christians that no supernatural powers protected the trees from the Christians. (See: [[Iconoclasm]])

When they did not heed warnings to stay away from the sacred oak groves, Adalbert was [[martyr]]ed in April 997 on the Baltic Sea coast east of [[Truso]] (currently [[Elbląg]], Elbing), or near [[Tenkitten]] and [[Fischhausen]] (see external link map St. Albrecht) It is recorded that his body was bought back for its weight in [[gold]] by Boleslaus the Brave.

==Veneration==
[[File:Relikwiarz Swietego Wojciecha.JPG|thumb|upright|Silver coffin of St. Wojciech, Cathedral in [[Gniezno]]]]
A few years later Adalbert was [[canonization|canonized]] as '''Saint Adalbert of Prague.''' His life has been written about in ''[[Vita Sancti Adalberti]] Pragensis'' by various writers, the earliest being traced to imperial [[Aachen]] and [[Liège (city)|Liège/Lüttich]]'s bishop [[Notger von Lüttich]], although it was assumed for many years that the [[Rome|Roman]] monk [[John Canaparius]] wrote the first ''Vita'' in 999. Another famous biographer of Adalbert was Saint [[Bruno of Querfurt]] who wrote his hagiography in 1001–1004.

Notably, Bohemian rulers (i.e., Přemyslids) initially refused to ransom Saint Adalbert's body from the Prussians who murdered him, so it was purchased by Poles. This fact may be explained by Saint Adalbert's belonging to the Slavniks family; it highlights the strength of the two clans' conflict. Thus Saint Adalbert's bones were stored in Gniezno and helped Boleslaus the Brave to improve Poland's position in Europe.

[[File:Socha Svateho Vojtecha a Radima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|St.Vojtěch and his brother Gaudentius (Radim) monument in [[Libice nad Cidlinou|Libice]] (Czech Republic)]]
According to Bohemian accounts, in 1039 the Bohemian duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Břetislav I]] looted the bones of Saint Adalbert from Gniezno in a raid and moved them to Prague.  According to Polish accounts he took the wrong relics, those of St Gaudensius, while Saint Adalbert's relics were hidden by the Poles and remain in Gniezno. [[File:Schädelreliquie Adalbert von Prag.jpg|right|thumb]] In 1127 the decapitated head, which was not in the original purchase (according to ''Roczniki Polskie'') was found and moved to Gniezno. In 1928, one of the arms of Saint Adalbert, which Bolesław I had given to [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in the year 1000, was added to the bones preserved in Gniezno. Today Saint Adalbert has two elaborate shrines claiming to contain his remains, in the cathedrals of Prague and Gniezno, and which bones are authentic is not clear. For example, the saint has two skulls - one in Prague, a second in Gniezno (stolen in 1923).

The massive bronze [[Gniezno Doors]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]], of about 1175, are decorated with 18 [[relief]]s of scenes from the saint's life, the only [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] church doors in Europe to contain a cycle illustrating the life of a saint.

April 1997 was the thousandth anniversary of Saint Adalbert's martyrdom. It was commemorated in the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, Russia and other countries. Representatives of Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Evangelical churches pilgrimaged to Gniezno, to the saint's tomb. [[John Paul II]] visited Gniezno and held a ceremonial divine service in which heads of seven European states and about a million believers took part.

In [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], near [[Beregovoe]] village (former Tenkitten), where Adalbert's death hypothetically took place, a ten-meter cross was established.
