A '''drink''', or '''beverage''', is a kind of  [[liquid]] which is specifically prepared for [[human]] consumption. There are many types for '''drinks'''. They can be divided into various groups such as plain water, alcohol, non-alcoholic drinks, soft drinks (carbonated drinks), fruit or vegetable juices and hot drinks, such as hot chocolate. In addition to fulfilling a basic need, drinks form part of the [[culture]] of [[human society]].

==Alcohol==

An alcoholic beverage is a drink that contains [[ethanol]], commonly known as [[alcohol]] (although in [[chemistry]] the definition of "alcohol" includes many other compounds). [[Beer]] has been a part of human culture for 8,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology |last=Arnold |first=John P |year=2005 |edition=Reprint |publisher=BeerBooks.com}}</ref> In many countries, drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s in a local [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]] is a cultural tradition.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Drinking Life: A Memoir |last=Hamill |first=Pete |year=1994 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York|isbn= 978-0-316-34102-8}}</ref> Asian countries produce several varieties of alcoholic beverages (e.g. [[rice wine]], [[Tongba]] a millet brew).

==Non-alcoholic drinks==
{{Main|Non-alcoholic beverage}}
A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. This category includes [[low-alcohol beer]], non-alcoholic [[wine]], and [[apple cider]] if they contain less than 0.5% [[alcohol by volume]].

==Soft drinks==
{{Main|Soft drink}}
The term "soft drink" specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to "hard drink" and "drink". The term "drink" is neutral but often denotes alcoholic content. Beverages such as soda pop, [[sparkling water]], [[iced tea]], [[lemonade]], [[root beer]], [[fruit punch]], [[milk]], [[hot chocolate]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[milkshakes]], and [[tap water]] and energy drinks are all soft drinks.

==Fruit juice==
{{Main|Juice}}

[[Fruit]] juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are familiar breakfast drinks. [[Grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed and their juices mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Juices were probably the earliest drinks besides water.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Grape juice allowed to ferment produces [[wine]]. Orange juice and coconut water remain by far the most highly consumed juices.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.

==Vegetable juice==
Vegetable juice are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as [[carrot]]s, tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, [[celery]] and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]].

==Hot drinks==
