{{Main|History of Drexel University}}

Drexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist [[Anthony J. Drexel]] to provide educational opportunities in the “practical arts and sciences” for women and men of all backgrounds. Drexel became the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936, and in 1970 Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status, becoming Drexel University. Although there were many changes during its first century, the university's identity has been held constant as privately controlled, non-sectarian, coeducational center of higher learning, distinguished by a commitment to preparing both men and women for future success. Drexel's cornerstone of the career preparation, the cooperative education program, was introduced in 1919. The program became integral to the university's unique educational experience. Participating students alternate periods of classroom based study with periods of full-time [[Internship|practical work experience]] related to their academic and career interests.

From 1995 to 2009, the president of Drexel University, Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], led the institution towards significant change. President Papadakis oversaw Drexel's largest expansion ever, the endowment increased +471% to $540M, and total enrollment increased +102% to 18,466. The institution continued to climb in the rankings, became more selective, and obtained a more academically talented student body. During the expansion, Drexel was officially united with the former MCP Hahnemann University, creating the [[Drexel University College of Medicine]] in 2002; and in the fall of 2006, Drexel established its School of Law, which was fully accredited by [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/about/ABA_accreditation/ |title=Drexel University Earle Mack School of Law ABA Accreditation |accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>

In April 2009, Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], died of pneumonia. His successor is Mr. [[John Anderson Fry]], formerly the president of [[Franklin & Marshall College]] and the Executive Vice President of [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="fry" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fandm.edu/past-presidents/john-fry |title=Past Presidents: John Fry  |accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>

In July 2011, Drexel acquired [[The Academy of Natural Sciences]]. The agreement created an international powerhouse for discovery in the natural and environmental sciences.

==Campuses==
{{Main|Campus of Drexel University}}
Drexel University's campus is divided into three parts: the [[Drexel University Main Campus|University City Campus]], the Center City Hahnemann Campus including [[Hahnemann University Hospital]], and the [[Drexel University Queen Lane Campus|Queen Lane College of Medicine Campus]].

[[File:South Drexel Campus.jpg|thumb|250px|The southern portion of Drexel's main campus]]
[[Image:QueenLaneCampus.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Queen Lane Campus]]

===University City Main Campus===
The {{convert|77|acre|ha|sing=on}} University City Main Campus of Drexel University is located just west of the [[Schuylkill River]] in the [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] district of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It is Drexel's largest and oldest campus and contains its administrative offices and the main academic center for students. The northern residential portion of the main campus is located in the [[Powelton Village]] section of West Philadelphia. The two prominent performing stages at Drexel University are the Mandell Theater and the Main Auditorium. The Main Auditorium dates back to the founding of Drexel and construction of its main hall. It features over 1000 seats, and a [[pipe organ]] installed in 1928. The organ was purchased by [[Saturday Evening Post]] publisher [[Cyrus H. K. Curtis]] after he had donated a similar organ, the [[Curtis Organ]], to nearby University of Pennsylvania and it was suggested that he do the same for Drexel.<ref>[http://www.drexel.edu/univrel/new/alumnimagazine/fall_2004.pdf Drexel Legends and Traditions]</ref> The 424-seat Mandell Theater was built in 1973 and features a more performance-oriented stage, including a full [[fly system]], modern stage lighting facilities, stadium seating, and accommodations for wheelchairs. It is used for the semiannual spring musical, as well as various plays and many events.<ref>[http://www.ucityphila.org/cityguide/go/294 Mandell Theater at Drexel University]{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref>

===Center City Hahnemann Campus===
{{Main|Drexel University College of Medicine}}
The Center City Hahnemann Campus is in the middle of Philadelphia, straddling the Vine Street Expressway and centered on [[Hahnemann University Hospital]].

===The Academy of Natural Sciences===
In 2011, [[The Academy of Natural Sciences]] entered into an agreement to become a subsidiary of Drexel University.  Founded in 1812, the Academy of Natural Sciences is America's oldest natural history museum and is a world leader in biodiversity and environmental research.

===Drexel University Sacramento===
{{Main|Drexel University Sacramento}}
On 5 January 2009, Drexel University opened the Center for Graduate Studies in [[Sacramento, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sacramento.drexel.edu/about-drexel/|title=About Us Overview|publisher=Drexel University|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> {{As of|2011}}, the Sacramento Center offers an Ed.D. program in Educational Leadership and Management, and master degree programs in Business Administration, Finance, Higher Education, Human Resource Development, Public Health, and Interdepartmental Medical Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sacramento.drexel.edu/programs/|title=Graduate Programs in Sacramento|publisher=Drexel University|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> Drexel awards students at its Sacramento Center fellowships from a $10 million annual budget allocation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sacramento.drexel.edu/what-we-offer/regional-development-and-leadership/ |title=Regional Development and Leadership |publisher=Drexel University |accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>

As of January 2011, the Sacramento Center for Graduate Studies has an enrollment of 360 students.

==Student life==
[[File:Hinh2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stratton Hall as seen from the Creese Student Center]]

===Activities===
The university has a large variety of [[student organizations]], including [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[fraternities and sororities]], [[political]], and academic groups.

====Student Government====
The Undergraduate Student Government Association of Drexel University works with administrators to solve student problems and tries to promote communication between the students and the administration.

====Graduate Students Association====
As stated on their website - "Graduate Student Association advocates the interests and addresses concerns of graduate students at Drexel; strives to enhance graduate student life at the University in all aspects, from academic to campus security; and provides a formal means of communication between graduate students and the University community."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~dsogsa/ |title=Drexel University Graduate Students Association |accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>

====Campus Activities Board====
The Campus Activities Board (CAB) is an undergraduate student run event planning organization. CAB creates events for the '''undergraduate population''' since they are funded by the student activities fee (which is collected from only undergraduate students). To clarify, CAB is not funded by all of the student activities fee from each student, but only a portion of the fee. The student activity fee is divided to fund all organizations at Drexel. CAB is broken down into 5 committees - Special Events, Traditions, Marketing, Lectures and Diversity, and Performing and Fine Arts.

===Press and radio===

====Radio====
{{Main|WKDU}}
WKDU is Drexel's student-run FM radio station, with membership open to all undergraduate students. Its status as an 800-[[watt]] non-commercial station in a major market city has given it a wider audience and a higher profile than many other [[college radio]] stations.

====Television====
DUTV is Drexel's Philadelphia [[cable television]] station. The student operated station is part of the Paul F. Harron Studios at Drexel University. The purpose of DUTV is to provide "the people of Philadelphia with quality educational television, and providing Drexel students the opportunity to gain experience in television management and production."<ref name="DUTV">[http://dutv.drexel.edu/homepage/DUTV.html DUTV]</ref> The Programing includes an eclectic variety of shows from a bi-monthly news show, DNews, to old films, talk shows dealing with important current issues and music appreciation shows.<ref name="DUTV" />

====Publications====
Drexel has a number of publications to its name by both the student body and the university. ''[[The Triangle (newspaper)|The Triangle]]'' has been the university's newspaper since 1926. The yearbook was first published in 1911 and named the Lexerd in 1913.<ref name="Timeline">{{Cite web|date=29 August 2006 |title=Timeline of Drexel University |url= http://www.library.drexel.edu/archives/history/timeline.html |publisher=Drexel University Archives |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref> Prior to the publishing of a campus wide yearbook in 1911 ''The Hanseatic'' and ''The Eccentric'' were both published in 1896 as class books.<ref name="DUArch">{{Cite web|year=2008 |url=http://archives.library.drexel.edu/archives/31 |title=Early photographs of the Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry 1885-1936 |publisher=Drexel University Archives |accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref> Other publications include ''MAYA'', the undergraduate student literary and artistic magazine; ''D&M Magazine'', Design & Merchandising students crafted magazine; ''The Smart Set from Drexel University'', an online magazine founded in 2005; and ''The Drexelist'' a blog-style news source founded in 2010.

The Drexel Publishing Group serves as a medium for literary publishing on campus. The Drexel Publishing Group oversees ''ASK'' (The Journal of the College of Arts and Sciences at Drexel University), ''[[Painted Bride Quarterly]]'', a 36-year-old national literary magazine housed at Drexel; ''The 33rd'', an annual anthology of student and faculty writing at Drexel; ''DPG Online Magazine'', and ''Maya'', the undergraduate literary and artistic magazine. The Drexel Publishing Group also serves as a pedagogical organization by allowing students to intern and work on its publications.

===Housing===
[[Image:North Hall.JPG|right|300px|thumb|North Hall by architect [[Michael Graves]]]]
Drexel requires all non-commuting first and second year students to live in one of its ten residence halls, and second year students to live in "university approved housing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drexel.edu/dbs/universityHousing/assignmentPolicies/ |title=Drexel University Housing Policies}}</ref> Kelly Hall, Myers Hall, Towers Hall, and Calhoun Hall are traditional residence halls (shared bedroom, community bathrooms), while North Hall, Caneris Hall, Race Street Residence Hall, and Van Rensselaer Hall are suite style residence halls (shared bedrooms, private bathrooms, kitchens, and common area within the suite). Millennium Hall, Drexel's newest residence hall, is a modified suite (shared bedrooms, and segmented, private bathrooms in the hallway). Drexel also leases several floors of the University Crossings apartment complex for upper class students.

The Residential Living Office (RLO) at Drexel has developed a Residential Experience Engagement Model which is designed to support residents of all class levels.

*The First Year Experience: Calhoun, Kelly, Towers Halls
*Living Learning Communities: Myers Hall
*Pennoni Honors College: Millennium Hall
*The Sophomore Year Experience: Race Street Residence Halls
*For Students By Students (FSBS): North Hall
*The Upper Class Experience: Caneris Hall & University Crossings
*The Graduate Student Experience: Drexel Apartments (formerly Van Rensselaer Hall) and Stiles Memorial Hall

Portions of the Race Street Residence Hall formerly was reserved for students of the [[Pennoni Honors College]]. However, during the 2007 spring term, the Race Street Dormitory housed Kelly Hall residents, while Kelly Hall underwent renovation. It was recently announced that for 2010-2011 the Honors Living Learning Community will be moved to Millennium Hall and the Sophomore Year Experience moved into the Race Street Residence Hall. Van Rensselaer Hall will also be utilized by the Graduate Student Experience.

All residence halls except Caneris Hall, University Crossings, and Stiles Memorial Hall are located north of Arch Street between 34th Street and 32nd Street in the [[Powelton Village, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Powelton Village]] area.

===Greek life===
Twelve percent of Drexel's undergraduate population is a member of a social Greek-letter organization. There are currently 12 [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] (IFC) chapters, six [[National Panhellenic Conference|Panhellenic Council]] (PHC) chapters and eleven Multi-cultural Greek Council (MGC) chapters.<ref>http://www.drexel.edu/studentlife/fsl/chapters.htm</ref>

Three IFC Chapters have been awarded Top Chapters in 2008 by their respective national organizations; [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], and [[Alpha Chi Rho]].  In 2013, [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] was awarded the Top Chapter award by its national headquarters.

Each year, all social fraternities and sororities at Drexel compete in Greek Week. Greek Week actually consists of two weeks, the first week consisting of events such as Penny Wars and flag football and the second week consisting of activities such as talent show, chariot races and [[tug-of-war]].  [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] and [[Phi Mu]] have won Greek Week two years in a row.

The week after Greek Week the Dean's Cup is presented for the previous year. The Dean's Cup is the highest award for Drexel Greeks. The winners of the Dean's Cup are determined by the highest score on the Chapter Achievement Plan (CAP) which is the annual recognition process for Drexel Greeks. The Dean's Cup is reviewed by a selected committee of Student Life faculty. The Dean of Students awards the Dean's Cup, which is awarded to the top chapter in each council in the areas of academics, leadership, brother/sisterhood and service to the community.

==Student lore and traditions==

Tradition suggests that rubbing the toe of the [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] "Waterboy" [[statue]] located in the Main Building atrium can result in receiving good grades in exams. Although the rest of the bronze statue has developed a dark brown [[patina]] over the years, the toe has remained highly polished and shines like new.<ref name="dragon" />

In addition to its emphasis on technology Drexel has graduated several notable athletes such as [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) basketball players [[Michael Anderson (basketball)|Michael Anderson]] and [[Malik Rose]], and several notable business people such as [[Raj Gupta]], former President and [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Rohm and Haas]], and [[Kenneth C. Dahlberg]], former CEO of [[Science Applications International Corporation]] (SAIC).
