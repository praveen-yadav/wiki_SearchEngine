'''The [[Dominican Republic]]''' occupies the eastern two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]], in the [[Greater Antilles]].

==Pre-Spanish History==

The [[Taíno people]] called the island ''Quisqueya'' (mother of all lands) and ''Ayiti'' (land of high mountains). At the time of Columbus arrival in 1492, the island's territory consisted of five chiefdoms: Marién, Maguá, Maguana, [[Jaragua, Hispaniola|Jaragua]], and Higüey. These were ruled respectively by ''[[cacique]]s'' Guacanagarix, Guarionex, Caonabo, Bohechío, and Cayacoa.

===Arrival of the Spanish===
[[Christopher Columbus]] reached the island of Hispañola on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]], in December 1492. On Columbus's second voyage in 1493 the colony and Santo Domingo became the new capital, and remains the oldest continuously inhabited European city in the Americas.

===Sixteenth century: Taino decimation & African enslavement===
Hundreds of thousands Tainos living on the island were enslaved to work in gold mines. As a consequence of oppression, forced labor, hunger, disease, and mass killings, by 1535, only 60,000 were still alive.<ref name="Hartlyn1998">{{cite book |title=The Struggle for Democratic Politics in the Dominican Republic |last=Hartlyn |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill |isbn=0-8078-4707-0 |page=24 }}</ref> In 1501, the Spanish monarchs, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand I]] and [[Isabella of Castille|Isabella]], first granted permission to the colonists of the Caribbean to import African slaves, which began arriving to the island in 1503. These African importees have had the most dominant racial influence, and their rich and ancient culture has had an influence second only to that of Europe on the political and cultural character of the modern Dominican Republic. In 1510, the first sizable shipment, consisting of 250 [[Black Ladinos]], arrived in Hispaniola from [[Spain]]. Eight years later African-born slaves arrived in the [[West Indies]]. The Colony of "La Española" was organized as the [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo]] in 1511.  [[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite, and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Audiencia Real|Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their hides.

The first major slave revolt in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo during 1522, when slaves led an uprising in the sugar plantation of admiral Don [[Diego Colón]], son of [[Christopher Columbus]]. Many of these insurgents managed to escape to the mountains where they formed independent [[maroon (people)|maroon]] communities.

While sugar cane dramatically increased Spain's earnings on the island, large numbers of the newly imported slaves fled into the nearly impassable mountain ranges in the island's interior, joining the growing communities of ''cimarrónes''—literally, 'wild animals'. By the 1530s, ''[[maroon (people)|cimarrón]]'' bands had become so numerous that in rural areas the Spaniards could only safely travel outside their plantations in large armed groups. Beginning in the 1520s, the [[Caribbean Sea]] was raided by increasingly numerous French pirates. In 1541 Spain authorized the construction of Santo Domingo's fortified wall, and in 1560 decided to restrict sea travel to enormous, well-armed convoys. In another move, which would destroy [[Hispaniola]]'s sugar industry, in 1561 [[Havana]], more strategically located in relation to the [[Gulf Stream]], was selected as the designated stopping point for the merchant ''[[flota system|flotas]],'' which had a royal monopoly on commerce with the Americas. In 1564, the island's main inland cities [[Santiago de los Caballeros]] and [[Concepción de la Vega]] were destroyed by an earthquake. In the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas.

With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing,'' resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, African, and Taíno descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the sole source of livelihood for the island dwellers. In 1586, [[Sir Francis Drake]] captured the city of Santo Domingo, collecting a ransom for its return to Spanish rule.

In 1595 the Spanish, frustrated by the twenty-year rebellion of their Dutch subjects, closed their home ports to rebel shipping from the Netherlands cutting them off from the critical salt supplies necessary for their herring industry. The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren on the Spanish main.

===Seventeenth century: French encroachment===
In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island were carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe, and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of Santo Domingo.<ref>Knight, Franklin, ''The Caribbean: The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism'', 3rd ed. p.54 New York, Oxford University Press 1990</ref> This action, known as the ''Devastaciones de Osorio'', proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.<ref>''Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 352</ref>  Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops - many of the inhabitants fought, escaped to the jungle, or fled to the safety of passing Dutch ships. The settlements of La Yaguana, and Bayaja, on the west and north coasts respectively of modern day Haiti were burned, as were the settlements of Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata on the north coast and San Juan de la Maguana in the south western area of the modern day Dominican Republic. French and English [[buccaneer]]s took advantage of Spain's retreat into a corner of Hispaniola to settle the island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]], off the northwest coast of Hispaniola, in 1629. [[France]] established direct control in 1640, reorganizing it into an official colony and expanding to the north coast of Hispaniola itself, whose western end Spain ceded to France in 1697 under the [[Treaty of Ryswick (Haiti)|Treaty of Ryswick]]. In 1655, [[Oliver Cromwell]] dispatched a fleet, commanded by Admiral [[Sir William Penn]], to conquer Santo Domingo. After meeting heavy resistance, the English retreated, taking the island of [[Jamaica]] instead.

===Eighteenth century: Colonial decline & Haitian revolution===
The [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The population of Santo Domingo grew from about 6,000 in 1737 to approximately 125,000 in 1790. Of this number, about 40,000 were white landowners, about 25,000 were black or mulatto freedmen, and some 60,000 were slaves. However, it remained poor and neglected, particularly in contrast with its western, French neighbor [[Saint-Domingue]], which became the wealthiest colony in the New World and had half a million inhabitants.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm Dominican Republic - THE FIRST COLONY<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco.

With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Spain saw in the unrest an opportunity to seize all, or part, of the western third of the island in an alliance of convenience with the British and the rebellious slaves. But after the slaves and French reconciled, the Spanish were defeated by the forces of the black [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] General [[Toussaint Louverture]], and in 1795, France gained control of the whole island under the [[Peace of Basel|Treaties of Basel]].

==French colony 1795-1809==
In 1801, L'Ouverture arrived in Santo Domingo, proclaiming the abolition of slavery on behalf of the French Republic. Shortly afterwards, [[Napoleon]] dispatched an army which subdued the whole island and ruled it for a few months. Mulattos and blacks again rose up against these French in October 1802 and finally defeated them in November 1803. On 1 January 1804 the victors declared Saint-Domingue to be the independent republic of [[Haiti]]. Even after their defeat by the Haitians, a small French garrison remained in Santo Domingo. Slavery was reestablished and many of the émigré Spanish colonists returned. In 1805, after crowning himself Emperor, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] invaded, reaching Santo Domingo before retreating in the face of a French naval squadron. In their retreat through the [[Cibao]], the Haitians sacked the towns of Santiago and [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Moca]], slaughtering most of their residents and helping to lay the foundation for two centuries of animosity between the two countries.

The French held on to the eastern part of the island, until dealt a serious blow by the Spanish inhabitants of the island at the [[Battle of Palo Hincado]] on November 7, 1808. With help from the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]], the Spanish lay siege to the city of Santo Domingo. The French in the besieged city finally capitulated on July 9, 1809, initiating a twelve-year period of Spanish rule, known in Dominican history as "[[España Boba|the Foolish Spain]]."

==Haitian occupation 1821-1844==
{{main|Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo}}
The twenty-two-year Haitian occupation that followed is recalled by Dominicans as a period of brutal military rule, though the reality is more complex. It led to large-scale land expropriations and failed efforts to force production of export crops, impose military services, restrict the use of the Spanish language, and eliminate traditional customs such as [[cockfighting]]. It reinforced Dominicans' perceptions of themselves as different from Haitians in "language, race, religion and domestic customs."<ref>Moya Pons, Frank ''Between Slavery and Free Labor: The Spanish-speaking Caribbean in the 19th Century''. Baltimore; Johns Hopkins University Press 1985</ref> Yet, this was also a period that definitively ended slavery as an institution in the eastern part of the island.

Haiti's constitution forbade whites from owning land, and the major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Most emigrated to the Spanish colonies of [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], or to independent Gran Colombia, usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials, who acquired their lands. The Haitians, who associated the [[Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence, confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Santo Domingo’s university, the oldest in the Western Hemisphere, lacking students, teachers, and resources, closed down. In order to receive diplomatic recognition from [[France]], Haiti was forced to pay an indemnity of 150 million francs to the former French colonists, which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, and Haiti imposed heavy taxes on the eastern part of the island. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint.

Attempts to redistribute land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and newly emancipated slaves resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer's ''Code Rural''.<ref>''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of "scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch." (Hoetink, The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)</ref> In rural areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.

==Independence: 1st Period 1844-1861==
[[Image:Juan pablo duarte.jpg|frame|right|Juan Pablo Duarte y Diez]]

In July 16, 1838 [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] together with Pedro Alejandrino Pina, Juan Isidro Pérez, Felipe Alfau, Benito González, Félix María Ruiz, Juan Nepumoceno Ravelo and Jacinto de la Concha founded a secret society called ''[[La Trinitaria]]'' to win independence from Haiti. A short time later, they were joined by [[Ramón Matías Mella]], and [[Francisco del Rosario Sanchez]]. In 1843 they allied with a Haitian movement in overthrowing Boyer. Because they had revealed themselves as revolutionaries working for Dominican independence, the new Haitian president, [[Charles Riviere-Hérard]], exiled or imprisoned the leading ''Trinitarios'' (Trinitarians). At the same time, [[Buenaventura Báez]], an [[Azua Province|Azua]] mahogany exporter and deputy in the [[National Assembly of Haïti|Haitian National Assembly]], was negotiating with the French Consul-General for the establishment of a French protectorate. In an uprising timed to preempt Báez, on February 27, 1844, the Trinitarios declared independence from Haiti, backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle-rancher from [[El Seibo]] who commanded a private army of [[peon]]s who worked on his estates.

===First Republic===
The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844 . It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by [[Pedro Santana]] on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war, but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. During the first decade of independence, Haïti mounted five invasions to reconquer the eastern part of the island: in 1844, 1845, 1849, 1853 and 1855-56. Although each was repulsed, Santana used the ever-present threat of Haitian invasion as a justification for consolidating dictatorial powers. For the Dominican elite—mostly landowners, merchants and priests—the threat of re-conquest by more populous [[Haïti]] was sufficient to seek annexation by an outside power. Offering the deepwater harbor of [[Santa Bárbara de Samaná|Samaná]] bay as bait, over the next two decades, negotiations were made with Britain, France, the United States and Spain to declare a protectorate over the country.

Without adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character-with little commercial agriculture, the ''[[hacienda]]'' as the dominant social unit and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the [[Cibao Valley]], the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing [[tobacco]] for export, mainly to [[Germany]]. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to [[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]] and [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]].

Santana antagonized the [[Cibao]] farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value.  In 1848, he was forced to resign, and was succeeded by his vice-president, Manuel Jimenes. After returning to lead Dominican forces against a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo, deposing Jimenes. At his behest, Congress elected [[Buenaventura Báez]] as President, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853 Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing Báez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing the last Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Samaná Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling Báez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, Báez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for hard cash at immense profit to himself and his followers. The Cibaoan tobacco planters, who were ruined when inflation ensued, revolted, recalling Santana from exile to lead their rebellion. After a year of civil war, Santana seized Santo Domingo and installed himself as President.

==Spanish colony: 3rd period 1861-1865==
Pedro Santana inherited a bankrupt government on the brink of collapse. Having failed in his initial bids to secure annexation by the U.S. or France, Santana initiated negotiations with Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] and the Captain-General of Cuba to have the island reconverted into a Spanish colony. The [[American Civil War]] rendered the United States incapable of enforcing the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. In Spain, Prime Minister [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Leopoldo O'Donnell]] advocated renewed colonial expansion, waging a campaign in northern [[Morocco]] that conquered the city of [[Tetuan]]. In March 1861, Santana officially restored the Dominican Republic to Spain.

===War of Restoration===
This move was widely rejected and on August 16, 1863, a [[Dominican Restoration War|national war of restoration]] began in Santiago, where the rebels established a provisional government. Spanish troops reoccupied the town, but the rebels fled to the mountains along the ill-defined Haitian border. Haitian President [[Fabre Geffrard]] provided the Dominican rebels with sanctuary and arms, sending a detachment of his presidential guards (the ''[[Tirailleur]]s'') to fight alongside them. Santana initially was named Capitan-General of the new Spanish province, but it soon became obvious that Spanish authorities planned to deprive him of his power, leading him to resign in 1862. Condemned to death by the provisional government, Santana died under mysterious circumstances in 1864, and is widely believed to have committed suicide. Restrictions on trade, discrimination against the mulatto majority,  Spain intended to reimpose slavery, and an unpopular campaign by the new Spanish Archbishop against extramarital unions, which were widespread after decades of abandonment by the Catholic Church, all fed resentment of Spanish rule. Confined to the major towns, the Spanish army was unable to defeat the guerillas or contain the insurrection, and suffered heavy losses due to [[Yellow Fever]]. Spanish colonial authorities encouraged Queen Isabella II to abandon the island, seeing the occupation as a nonsensical waste of troops and money.

However, the rebels were in a state of political disarray, and proved unable to present a cohesive set of demands. The first president of the provisional government, [[José Antonio Salcedo|Pepillo Salcedo]] (allied with Báez) was deposed by General Gaspar Polanco in September 1864, who, in turn, was deposed by General Antonio Pimentel three months later. The rebels formalized their provisional rule by holding a national convention in February 1865, which enacted a new constitution, but the new government exerted little authority over the various regional guerilla ''[[caudillo]]s'', who were largely independent of one another. Unable to extract concessions from the disorganized rebels, when the American Civil War ended, in March 1865, Queen Isabella annulled the annexation and independence was restored, with the last Spanish troops departing by July.<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+do0017)</ref>

==Independence: 2nd Period 1865-1916==

===Second Republic===
By the time the Spanish departed, most of the main towns lay in ruins and the island was divided among several dozen ''caudillos''. José María Cabral controlled most of [[Barahona Province|Barahona]] and the southwest with the support of Báez's mahogany-exporting partners, while cattle rancher [[Cesáreo Guillermo]] assembled a coalition of former ''Santanista'' generals in the southeast, and [[Gregorio Luperón]] controlled the north coast. From the Spanish withdrawal to 1879, there were twenty-one changes of government and at least fifty military uprisings.<ref>[[Frank Moya Pons]], ''Dominican Republic: A National History'' Pg. 222 (Hispaniola Books: New Rochelle, N.Y., 1995)</ref>

In the course of these conflicts, two parties emerged. The Partido Rojo (Literally "Red Party") represented the southern cattle ranching [[latifundia]] and mahogany-exporting interests, as well as the artisans and laborers of Santo Domingo, and was dominated by Báez, who continued to seek annexation by a foreign power. The Partido Azul (literally "Blue Party"), led by Luperón, represented the tobacco farmers and merchants of the Cibao and Puerto Plata and was nationalist and liberal in orientation. During these wars, the small and corrupt national army was far outnumbered by militias organized and maintained by local ''caudillos'' who set themselves up as provincial governors. These militias were filled out by poor farmers or landless plantation workers impressed into service who usually took up banditry when not fighting in revolution.

[[File:President Baez with American Commissioners, 1871.jpg|thumb|left|Reception of American commissioners by President Báez, 1871.]]Within a month of the nationalist victory, Cabral, whose troops were the first to enter Santo Domingo, ousted Pimentel, but a few weeks later General Guillermo led a rebellion in support of Báez, forcing Cabral to resign and allowing Báez to retake the presidency in October. Báez was overthrown by the Cibao farmers under Luperón, leader of the Partido Azul, the following spring, but Luperón's allies turned on each other and Cabral reinstalled himself as President in a coup in 1867. After bringing several ''Azules'' ("Blues") into his cabinet the ''Rojos'' ("Reds") revolted, returning Báez to power. In 1869, Báez negotiated a [[The Annexation of Santo Domingo|treaty of annexation with the United States]].<ref>Ian Bell,''The Dominican Republic'' Pg. 59 (Westview Pres: Boulder, Co., 1981)</ref> Supported by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William Henry Seward, Sr.|William Seward]], who hoped to establish a [[United States Navy|Navy]] base at Samaná, in 1871 the treaty was defeated in the [[United States Senate]] through the efforts of [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] Senator [[Charles Sumner]].<ref>*Dennis Hidalgo, ''Charles Sumner and the Annexation of the Dominican Republic,'' Itinerario (Volume XXI, 2/1997): 51. (Published by the Centre for the History of European Expansion of Leiden University, The Netherlands).</ref>

In 1874, the ''Rojo'' governor of Puerto Plata, [[Ignacio María González (politician)|Ignacio Maria González Santín]], staged a coup in support of an ''Azul'' rebellion, but was deposed by the ''Azules'' two years later. In February 1876, [[Ulises Espaillat]], backed by Luperón, was named President, but ten months later troops loyal to Báez returned him to power. One year a new rebellion allowed González to seize power, only to be deposed by Cesáreo Guillermo in September 1878, who was in turn deposed by Luperón in December 1879. Ruling the country from his hometown of Puerto Plata, enjoying an economic boom due to increased tobacco exports to [[Germany]], Luperón enacted a new constitution setting a two-year presidential term limit and providing for direct elections, suspended the semi-formal system of bribes and initiated construction on the nation's first railroad, linking the town of [[Concepción de La Vega|La Vega]] with the port of [[Sánchez, Dominican Republic|Sánchez]] on Samaná Bay.

The [[Ten Years' War]] in [[Cuba]] brought Cuban sugar planters to the country in search of new lands and security from the insurrection that freed their slaves and destroyed their property. Most settled in the southeastern coastal plain, and, with assistance from Luperón’s government, built the nation's first mechanized sugar mills. They were later joined by Italians, Germans, Puerto Ricans and Americans in forming the nucleus of the Dominican sugar bourgeoisie, marrying into prominent families to solidify their social position. Disruptions in global production caused by the Ten Years' War, the American Civil War and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] allowed the Dominican Republic to become a major sugar exporter. Over the following two decades, sugar surpassed tobacco as the leading export, with the former fishing hamlets of [[San Pedro de Macorís]] and [[La Romana, Dominican Republic|La Romana]] transformed into thriving ports. To meet their need for better transportation, over 300 miles of private rail-lines were built by and serving the sugar plantations by 1897.<ref>Emilio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'' Pg. 32 (Westview Press: Boulder, San Francisco, Oxford, 1995)</ref> An 1884 slump in prices led to a wage freeze, and a subsequent labor shortage was filled by migrant workers from the [[Leeward Islands]]—the [[Virgin Islands]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Anguilla]], and [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]] (referred to by Dominicans as ''[[cocolo]]''s).<ref>''cocolo'' is a corruption of the name of one of the principal islands of origin, [[Tortola]]. (Teresita Martinez-Vergne, ''Nation and Citizenship in the Dominican Republic'' Pg. 86 (University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill, N.C., 2005))</ref> These English-speaking blacks were often victims of racism, but many remained in the country, finding work as [[stevedore]]s and in railroad construction and sugar refineries.

=== Ulises Heureaux and U.S. protectorate ===
Allying with the emerging sugar interests, the dictatorship of General [[Ulises Heureaux]], who was popularly known as Lilís, brought unprecedented stability to the island through iron-fisted rule that lasted almost two decades. The son of a [[Haiti]]an father and a mother from [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], Lilís was distinguished by his blackness from most Dominican political leaders, with the exception of Luperón. He served as President 1882–1883, 1887, and 1889–1899, wielding power through a series of puppet presidents when not occupying the office. Incorporating both ''[[Los Coludos|Rojos]]'' and ''[[Los Bolos|Azules]]'' into his government, he developed an extensive network of spies and informants to crush potential opposition. His government undertook a number of major infrastructure projects, including the electrification of Santo Domingo, the beginning of telephone and telegraph service, the construction of a bridge over the [[Ozama River]], and the completion of a single-track railroad linking Santiago and Puerto Plata, financed by the [[Amsterdam]]-based Westendorp Co.<ref>Teresita Martínez-Vergne, ''Nation & Citizen in the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 135</ref>

Lilís's dictatorship was dependent upon heavy borrowing from European and American banks to enrich himself, stabilize the existing debt, strengthen the bribe system, pay for the army, finance infrastructural development and help set up sugar mills. However, sugar prices underwent a steep decline in the last two decades of the 19th century. When the Westendorp Co. went bankrupt in 1893, he was forced to mortgage the nation's customs fees, the main source of government revenues, to a New York financial firm called the San Domingo Improvement Co. (SDIC), which took over its railroad contracts and the claims of its European bondholders in exchange for two loans, one of $1.2 million and the other of £2 million.<ref>Ian Bell, ''The Dominican Republic'' Pg. 86 (Westview Press: Boulder, Co., 1981)</ref> As the growing public debt made it impossible to maintain his political machine, Heureaux relied on secret loans from the SDIC, sugar planters and local merchants. In 1897, with his government virtually bankrupt, Lilís printed five million uninsured pesos, known as ''papeletas de Lilís'', ruining most Dominican merchants and inspiring a conspiracy that ended in his death. In 1899, when Lilís was assassinated by the Cibao tobacco merchants whom he had been begging for a loan, the national debt was over $35 million, fifteen times the annual budget.<ref>Emilio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'' Pg. 50  (Westview Press: Boulder, San Francisco, Oxford, 1995)</ref>

The six years after Lilís's death witnessed four revolutions and five different presidents.<ref>Howard Wiarda, ''Dominican Republic: A Nation in Transition'' Pg. 30 (Pall Mall Press: London, 1966)</ref> The Cibao politicians who had conspired against Heureaux—[[Juan Isidro Jimenes]], the nation's wealthiest tobacco planter, and General [[Horacio Vásquez]]—after being named President and Vice-President, quickly fell out over the division of spoils among their supporters, the ''Jimenistas'' and ''Horacistas''. Troops loyal to Vásquez overthrew Jimenes in 1903, but Vásquez was deposed by Jimenista General [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]], who seized power for himself. The Jimenistas toppled his government, but their leader, [[Carlos Felipe Morales|Carlos Morales]], refused to return power to Jimenes, allying with the Horacistas, and he soon faced a new revolt by his betrayed Jimenista allies.

With the nation on the brink of defaulting, France, Germany, [[Italy]] and the [[Netherlands]] sent warships to Santo Domingo to press the claims of their nationals. In order to preempt military intervention, United States president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] introduced the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would assume responsibility for ensuring that the nations of Latin America met their financial obligations. In January 1905, under this corollary, the United States assumed administration of the Dominican Republic's customs. Under the terms of this agreement, a Receiver-General, appointed by the U.S. President, kept 55% of total revenues to pay off foreign claimants, while remitting 45% to the Dominican government. After two years, the nation's external debt was reduced from $40 million to $17 million.<ref>Emilio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'' Pg. 53 (Westview Press: Boulder, San Francisco, Oxford, 1995)</ref> In 1907, this agreement was converted into a treaty, transferring control over customs receivership to the U.S. [[Bureau of Insular Affairs]] and providing a loan of $20 million from a New York bank as payment for outstanding claims, making the United States the Dominican Republic's only foreign creditor.<ref>Bruce Calder, ''The Impact of Intervention in the Dominican Republic, 1916-1924'' Pg. 24 (University of Texas Press: Austin, Texas, 1984)</ref>

[[File:The Guardia Republicana in Puerto Plata, c. 1910.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Guardia republicana'', set up by President Cáceres in 1907]]In 1906, Morales resigned, and Horacista vice-president [[Ramon Cáceres]] became President. After suppressing a rebellion in the northwest by Jimenista General [[Desiderio Arias]], his government brought political stability and renewed economic growth, aided by new American investment in sugar industry. However, his assassination in 1911, for which Morales and Arias were at least indirectly responsible, once again plunged the republic into chaos. For two months, executive power was held by a civilian junta dominated by the chief of the army, General [[Alfredo Victoria]]. The surplus of more than 4 million pesos left by Cáceres was quickly spent to suppress a series of insurrections.<ref>Frank Moya-Pons, ''Dominican Republic: A National History'' Pg. 306</ref> He forced Congress to elect his uncle, [[Eladio Victoria]], as President, but the latter was soon replaced by the neutral Archbishop [[Adolfo Nouel]]. After four months, Nouel resigned, and was succeeded by Horacista Congressman [[José Bordas Valdez]], who aligned with Arias and the Jimenistas to maintain power.  In 1913, Vásquez returned from exile in Puerto Rico to lead a new rebellion. In June 1914 U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] issued an ultimatum for the two sides to end hostilities and agree on a new president, or have the United States impose one. After the provisional presidency of [[Ramón Báez Machado]], Jimenes was elected in October, and soon faced new demands, including the appointment of an American director of public works and financial advisor and the creation of a new military force commanded by U.S. officers. The Dominican Congress rejected these demands and began impeachment proceedings against Jimenes. The United States occupied [[Haiti]] in July 1915, with the implicit threat that the Dominican Republic might be next. Jimenes's Minister of War [[Desiderio Arias]] staged a coup d'état in April 1916, providing a pretext for the United States to occupy the Dominican Republic.

==First United States occupation: 1916-1924==<!-- This section is linked from [[Calvin Coolidge]] -->
{{main|United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–1924)}}
[[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] landed in Santo Domingo on May 15, 1916. Prior to their landing, Jimenes resigned, refusing to exercise an office 'regained with foreign bullets'.<ref>Bruce Calder, ''The Impact of Intervention In The Dominican Republic, 1916-1924''
(University of Texas Press: Austin, TX 1984) Pg. 8</ref> On June 1, Marines occupied Monte Cristi and Puerto Plata, and, after a brief campaign, took Arias's stronghold Santiago by the beginning of July. The Dominican Congress elected Dr. [[Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal]] as President, but in November, after he refused to meet the U.S. demands, Wilson announced the imposition of a U.S. military government, with [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Harry Shepard Knapp]] as Military Governor. The American military government implemented many of the institutional reforms carried out in the United States during the [[Progressive Era]], including reorganization of the tax system, accounting and administration, expansion of primary education, the creation of a nation-wide police force to unify the country, and the construction of a national system of roads, including a highway linking Santiago to Santo Domingo.

[[File:Dominican Republic. Marines in action during the American protectorate. 1920s.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines in action during the occupation]]
Despite the reforms, virtually all Dominicans resented the loss of their sovereignty to foreigners, few of whom spoke Spanish or displayed much real concern for the nation's welfare, and the military government, unable to win the backing of any prominent Dominican political leaders, imposed strict censorship laws and imprisoned critics of the occupation. In 1920, U.S. authorities enacted a Land Registration Act, which broke up the ''terrenos comuneros'' and dispossessed thousands of peasants who lacked formal titles to the lands they occupied, while legalizing false titles held by the sugar companies. In the southeast, dispossessed peasants formed armed bands, called ''gavilleros'', waging a guerilla war that lasted the duration of the occupation, with most of the fighting in [[Hato Mayor Province|Hato Mayor]] and [[El Seibo]]. At any given time, the Marines faced eight to twelve gavilleros, each composed of several hundred followers. The guerrillas benefited from a superior knowledge of the terrain and the support of the local population, forcing the Marines to rely on increasingly brutal counterinsurgency methods. However, rivalries between various gavilleros often led them to fight against one another, and even cooperate with occupation authorities. In addition, cultural schisms between the ''campesinos'' (i.e. rural people, or peasants) and city dwellers prevented the guerillas from cooperating with the urban middle-class nationalist movement. In the San Juan valley, near the border with Haïti, followers of a [[Vodu]] faith healer named Liborio resisted the occupation and aided the Haitian ''cacos'' in their war against the Americans, until his death in 1922. The principal legacy of the occupation was the creation of a National Police Force, used by the Marines to help fight against the various guerillas, and later the main vehicle for the rise of [[Rafael Trujillo]].

In what was referred to as ''la danza de los millones'', with the destruction of European sugar-beet farms during [[World War I]] sugar prices rose to their highest level in history, from $5.50 in 1914 to $22.50 per pound in 1920. Dominican sugar exports increased from 122,642 tons in 1916 to 158,803 tons in 1920, earning a record $45.3 million.<ref>Bruce Calder, The Impact of Intervention, Pg. 93</ref> However, European beet sugar production quickly recovered, which, coupled with the growth of global sugar cane production, glutted the world market, causing prices to plummet to only $2.00 by the end of 1921. This crisis drove many of the local sugar planters into bankruptcy, allowing large U.S. conglomerates to dominate the sugar industry. By 1926, only twenty-one major estates remained, occupying an estimated {{convert|520,000|acre|km2}}. Of these, twelve U.S.-owned companies owned more than 81% of this total area.<ref>Bruce Calder, The Impact of Intervention, Pg. 93. The largest two corporations, the South Porto Rico Company and West Indies Sugar Corporation, owned 150,000 and 100,000 acres (600 and 400 km²) respectively.</ref> While the foreign planters who had built the sugar industry integrated into Dominican society, these corporations expatriated their profits to the United States. As prices declined, sugar estates increasingly relied on Haitian laborers. This was facilitated by the military government's introduction of regulated contract labor, the growth of sugar production in the southwest, near the Haitian border, and a series of strikes by ''cocolo'' cane cutters organized by the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].

In the 1920 United States presidential election [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Warren Harding]] criticized the occupation and promised eventual U.S. withdrawal. While Jimenes and Vásquez sought concessions from the United States, the collapse of sugar prices discredited the military government and gave rise to a new nationalist political organization, the Dominican National Union, led by Dr. Henríquez from exile in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba, which demanded unconditional withdrawal. They formed alliances with frustrated nationalists in Puerto Rico and Cuba, as well as critics of the occupation in the United States itself, most notably ''[[The Nation]]'' and the Haiti-San Domingo Independence Society. In May 1922, a Dominican lawyer, [[Francisco Peynado]], went to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and negotiated what became known as the Hughes-Peynado Plan. It stipulated immediate establishment of a provisional government pending elections, approval of all laws enacted by the U.S. military government, and the continuation of the 1907 treaty until all the Dominican Republic's foreign debts had been settled. On October 1, [[Juan Bautista Vicini]], the son of a wealthy Italian immigrant sugar planter, was named provisional president, and the process of U.S. withdrawal began.

==The rise and fall of Trujillo 1924–1965==

===Vásquez 1924-1927===
The occupation ended in 1924, with a democratically elected government under president Vásquez. The Vásquez administration brought great social and economic prosperity to the country and respected political and civil rights. Rising export commodity prices and government borrowing allowed the funding of public works projects and the expansion and modernization of Santo Domingo.<ref name=LoC>{{cite web |title=The Era of Trujillo |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/11.htm |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

Though considered to be a relatively principled man, Vásquez had risen amid many years of political infighting. In a move directed against his chief opponent Federico Velasquez, in 1927 Vásquez agreed to have his term extended from four to six years. The change was approved by the Dominican Congress, but was of debatable legality; "its enactment effectively invalidated the constitution of 1924 that Vásquez had previously sworn to uphold."<ref name=LoC/> Vásquez also removed the prohibition against presidential reelection, and postulated himself for another term in elections to be held in May 1930. However, his actions had by then led to doubts that the contest could be fair.<ref name=LoC/> Furthermore, these elections took place amid economic problems, as the [[Great Depression]] had dropped sugar prices to less than one dollar per pound.

In February, a revolution was proclaimed in Santiago by a lawyer named [[Rafael Estrella Ureña]]. When the commander of the Guardia Nacional Dominicana (the new designation of the armed force created under the Occupation), [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]], ordered his troops to remain in their barracks, the sick and aging Vásquez was forced into exile and Estrella proclaimed provisional president. In May, Trujillo was elected with 95% of the vote, having used the army to harass and intimidate electoral personnel and potential opponents. After his inauguration in August, at his request, the Dominican Congress proclaimed the beginning of the 'Era of Trujillo'.<ref name=LoC/>

===The Era of Trujillo 1927-1961===
Trujillo established absolute political control, while promoting economic development—from which mainly he and his supporters benefitted—and severe repression of domestic human rights.<ref>Johathan Hartlyn. ''The Trujillo Regime in the Dominican Republic''. In ''Sultanistic Regimes'', Johns Hopkins University Press</ref> Trujillo treated his political party, ''El Partido Dominicano'' (The Dominican Party), as a rubber-stamp for his decisions. The true source of his power was the ''[[National Guard (Dominican Republic)|Guardia Nacional]]''—larger, better armed, and more centrally controlled than any military force in the nation's history. By disbanding the regional militias, the Marines eliminated the main source of potential opposition, giving the Guard "a virtual monopoly on power".<ref>Emilio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 96</ref> By 1940, Dominican military spending was 21% of the national budget.<ref>Emilio Betances, ''State and Society in the Dominican Republic'', Pg. 97</ref> At the same time, he developed an elaborate system of espionage agencies. By the late 1950s, there were at least seven categories of intelligence agencies, spying on each other as well as the public. All citizens were required to carry identification cards and good-conduct passes from the secret police. Obsessed with adulation, Trujillo promoted an extravagant cult of personality. When a hurricane struck Santo Domingo in 1930, killing over 3,000 people, he rebuilt the city and renamed it ''Ciudad Trujillo'': "Trujillo City"; he also renamed the country's and the Caribbean's highest mountain, [[Pico Duarte]] (Duarte Peak), ''Pico Trujillo''. Over 1,800 statues of Trujillo were built, and all public works projects were required to have a plaque with the inscription 'Era of Trujillo, Benefactor of the Fatherland'.<ref>Eric Paul Roorda, ''The Dictator Next Door: The Good Neighbor Policy and the Dominican Republic, 1930-1945.-</ref>

As sugar estates turned to Haiti for seasonal migrant labor, increasing numbers settled in the Dominican Republic permanently. The census of 1920, conducted by the U.S. occupation government, gave a total of 28,258 Haitians living in the country; by 1935 there were 52,657.<ref>''Needed but unwanted: Haitian immigrants and their descendants in the Dominican Republic, Pg. 24'' (Catholic Institute For International Refugees, 2004)</ref>

In 1937, Trujillo ordered the massacre of 17,000 to 35,000 Haitians, the alleged justification being Haiti's support for Dominican exiles plotting to overthrow his regime. This event later became known as the [[Parsley Massacre]].<ref>Jan Knippers Black, ''Politics and development in an unsovereign state'' Pg. 27</ref> The massacre was met with international criticism.
The killing was the result of a new policy which Trujillo called the 'Dominicanisation of the frontier'. Place names along the border were changed from [[Haitian Creole|Creole]] and French to Spanish, the practice of [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] was outlawed, quotas were imposed on the percentage of foreign workers that companies could hire, and a law was passed preventing Haitian workers from remaining after the sugar harvest.

Although Trujillo sought to emulate [[Generalissimo]] [[Francisco Franco]], he welcomed [[Spanish Second Republic|Spanish Republican]] refugees following the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Dominican Republic took in many [[Jew]]s fleeing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] who had been refused entry by other countries. [http://www.sosua-villas.com/sosua/history-of-sosua The Jews settled in Sosua]. These decisions arose from a policy of ''blanquismo'', closely connected with anti-Haitian xenophobia, which sought to add more whites to the Dominican population by promoting immigration from Europe. As part of the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], in 1940, the [[U.S. State Department]] signed a treaty with Trujillo relinquishing control over the nation's customs. When the Japanese attacked [[Pearl Harbor]] Trujillo followed the United States in declaring war on the [[Axis powers]], even though he had openly professed admiration for Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]. During the [[Cold War]], he maintained close ties to the United States, declaring himself the world's 'Number One Anticommunist' and becoming the first Latin American President to sign a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with the United States.

Trujillo and his family established a near-monopoly over the national economy. By the time of his death, he had accumulated a fortune of around $800 million; he and his family owned 50–60 percent of the arable land, some {{convert|700,000|acre|km2}}, and Trujillo-owned businesses accounted for 80% of the commercial activity in the capital.<ref>Howard Wiarda ''The Dominican Republic: A Nation in Transition'', Pg. 40-41</ref> He exploited nationalist sentiment to purchase most of the nation's sugar plantations and refineries from U.S. corporations; operated monopolies on salt, rice, milk, cement, tobacco, coffee, and insurance; owned two large banks, several hotels, port facilities, an airline and shipping line; deducted 10% of all public employees' salaries (ostensibly for his party); and received a portion of prostitution revenues.<ref>Jared Diamond, Collapse, 'One Island, Two Peoples, Two Histories' (Penguin Books: New York and London, 2005) Pg. 337</ref> [[World War II]] brought increased demand for Dominican exports, and the 1940s and early 1950s witnessed economic growth and considerable expansion of the national infrastructure. During this period, the capital city was transformed from merely an administrative center to the national center of shipping and industry, although 'it was hardly coincidental that new roads often led to Trujillo's plantations and factories, and new harbors benefited Trujillo's shipping and export enterprises.'<ref>Jan Knippers Black, ''The Dominican Republic: politics and development in an unsovereign state.</ref>

Mismanagement and corruption resulted in major economic problems. By the end of the 1950s, the economy was deteriorating because of a combination of overspending on a festival to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the regime, overspending to purchase privately owned sugar mills and electricity plants, and a decision to make a major investment in state sugar production that proved economically unsuccessful. In 1956, Trujillo's agents in New York murdered Jesús María de Galíndez, a [[Basque people|Basque]] exile who had worked for Trujillo but who later denounced the Trujillo regime and caused public opinion in the United States to turn against Trujillo. In August 1960, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Dominican Republic as a result of Trujillo's complicity in an attempt to assassinate President [[Rómulo Betancourt]] of [[Venezuela]].

A group of Dominican dissidents assassinated Trujillo in a car chase on the way to his country villa near [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristóbal]] on May 30, 1961.

The sanctions remained in force after Trujillo's assassination. His son [[Ramfis Trujillo|Ramfis]] assumed de facto control, but was deposed by his two uncles after a dispute over potential liberalization of the regime. In November 1961, the Trujillo family was forced into exile, fleeing to France, and the heretofore puppet-president [[Joaquín Balaguer]] assumed effective power.

===The Post-Trujillo instability 1961-1965===
At the insistence of the United States, Balaguer was forced to share power with a seven-member Council of State, established on January 1, 1962, and including moderate members of the opposition. OAS sanctions were lifted January 4, and, after an attempted coup, Balaguer resigned and went into exile on January 16. The reorganized Council of State, under President [[Rafael Filiberto Bonnelly]] headed the Dominican government until elections could be held. These elections, in December 1962, were won by [[Juan Bosch]], a scholar and poet who had founded the opposition ''Partido Revolucionario Dominicano'' ([[Dominican Revolutionary Party]], or PRD) in exile, during the Trujillo years. His leftist policies, including land redistribution, nationalization of certain foreign holdings, and attempts to bring the military under civilian control, antagonized the military officer corps, the Catholic hierarchy, and the upper-class, who feared 'another Cuba'. In September 1963 Bosch was overthrown by a right-wing military coup led by Colonel [[Elías Wessin]] and was replaced by a three-man [[military junta]]. Bosch went into exile to Puerto Rico.  Afterwards a supposedly civilian triumvirate established a de facto dictatorship.

==Second United States Occupation 1965–1966==
{{main|United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1965–1966)}}

On April 16, 1965, when growing dissatisfaction generated another military rebellion on April 24, 1965 that demanded Bosch's restoration. The insurgents, reformist officers and civilian combatants loyal to Bosch commanded by Colonel [[Francisco Caamaño]], and who called themselves the Constitutionalists, staged a coup, seizing the national palace. Immediately, conservative military forces, led by Wessin and calling themselves Loyalists, struck back with tank assaults and aerial bombings against Santo Domingo.

On April 28, these anti-Bosch army elements requested U.S. military intervention and U.S. forces landed, ostensibly to protect U.S. citizens and to evacuate U.S. and other foreign nationals. U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], convinced of the defeat of the Loyalist forces and fearing the creation of "a second Cuba"<ref>Stephen G. Rabe, "The Johnson Doctrine", ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 36</ref> on America's doorstep, ordered U.S. forces to restore order. In what was initially known as [[Operation Power Pack]] ultimately 23,000 U.S. troops were ordered to the Dominican Republic.

Denied a military victory, the Constitutionalist rebels quickly had a Constitutionalist congress elect Caamaño president of the country. US officials countered by backing General Imbert. On May 7, Imbert was sworn in as president of the Government of National Reconstruction. The next step in the stabilization process, as envisioned by Washington and the OAS, was to arrange an agreement between President Caamaño and President Imbert to form a provisional government committed to early elections. However, Caamaño refused to meet with Imbert until several of the Loyalist officers, including Wessin y Wessin, were made to leave the country.

On 13 May General Imbert began Operation LIMPIEZA (Cleanup) and his forces were successful in eliminating pockets of rebel resistance outside Ciudad Nueva and silencing Radio Santo Domingo. Operation CLEANUP ended on 21 May.

[[File:Corridor of Santo Dominguo.gif|thumb|Safety corridor]]
By May 14 the Americans, in establishing a "safety corridor" connecting the San Isidro Air Base and the "Duarte" Bridge to the Embajador Hotel and United States Embassy in the center of Santo Domingo, had essentially sealed-off the Constitutionalist area of Santo Domingo. Road blocks were established and patrols ran continuously. Some 6,500 people from many nations were evacuated to safety. In addition, the US forces airlifted in large relief supplies for Dominican nationals.

By mid-May, a majority of the OAS voted for Operation PUSH AHEAD, the reduction of United States forces and their replacement by an Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF). Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) was formally established on May 23. The following troops were sent by each country: Brazil - 1,130, [[Honduras]] - 250, [[Paraguay]] - 184, [[Nicaragua]] - 160, [[Costa Rica]] - 21 military police, and [[El Salvador]] - 3 staff officers. The first contingent to arrive was a rifle company from Honduras which was soon backed by detachments from Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. Brazil provided the largest unit, a reinforced infantry battalion. Brazilian General [[Hugo Alvim]] assumed command of the OAS ground forces, and on 26 May the US forces began to withdraw.

The fighting continued until 31 August 1965 when a truce was declared. Most American troops left shortly afterwards as policing and peacekeeping operations were turned over to Brazilian troops, but some U.S. military presence remained until September 1966. A total of 44 American soldiers died, 27 in action. 172 were wounded in action. An estimated 6,000 to 10,000 Dominicans died, mostly civilians.<ref name="leather">[http://www.leatherneck.com/forums/showthread.php?t=15762 The US Intervention in the Dominican Republic, 1965<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Facing ongoing threats and attacks, including a particularly violent attack at the Hotel Matum in [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], Camaaño accepted an agreement imposed by the USA government. The Dominican Provisional President, [[García Godoy]], sent Colonel Caamaño as the Military Attaché to the Dominican Embassy to the UK.

==The Balaguer Era 1966-1996==

=== Balaguer's second Presidency 1966-1978 ===
In June 1966, Balaguer, leader of the Reformist Party (which later became the [[Social Christian Reformist Party]] (PRSC), was elected and then re-elected to office in May 1970 and May 1974, both times after the major opposition parties withdrew late in the campaign because of the high degree of violence by pro-government groups. On November 28, 1966 a constitution was created, signed, and put into use. The constitution stated that a president was elected to a four-year term. If there was a close election there would be a second round of voting to decide the winner. The voting age was eighteen, but married people under eighteen could also vote. Balaguer led the Dominican Republic through a thorough economic restructuring, based on opening the country to foreign investment while protecting state-owned industries and certain private interests. This distorted, dependent development model produced uneven results. For most of Balaguer's first nine years in office the country experienced high growth rates (e.g., an average [[GDP]] growth rate of 9.4 percent between 1970 and 1975), to the extent that people talked about the "Dominican miracle". Foreign, mostly U.S. investment, as well as foreign aid, flowed into the country; sugar, then the country's main export product, enjoyed good prices in the international market; and tourism grew tremendously.

However, this excellent macroeconomic performance was not accompanied by an equitable distribution of wealth. While a group of new millionaires flourished during Balaguer's administrations, the poor simply became poorer. Morever, the poor were commonly the target of state repression, and their socioeconomic claims were labeled 'communist' and dealt with accordingly by the state security apparatus.<ref>Roberto Cassa, ''Los doce años: Contrarevolución y desarrollismo'', 2nd ed. Santo Domingo: Editora Buho 1991</ref> In the May 1978 election, Balaguer was defeated in his bid for a fourth successive term by [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]] of the PRD. Subsequently, he ordered troops to storm the election centre and destroy ballot boxes, declaring himself the victor. U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] refused to recognize Balaguer's claim, and, faced with the loss of foreign aid, Balaguer stood down.

===Guzman / Blanco Interregnum 1978-1986===
Guzmán's inauguration on August 16 marked the country's first peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to another. By the late 1970s, economic expansion slowed considerably as sugar prices declined and oil prices rose. Rising inflation and unemployment diminished support for the government and helped trigger a wave of mass emigration from the Dominican Republic to New York, coming on the heels of the similar migration of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] in the preceding decades.

Elections were again held in 1982. [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]] of the Dominican Revolutionary Party defeated Bosch and a resurgent Balaguer.

===Balaguer's third Presidency 1986-1996===
Balaguer completed his return to power in 1986 when he won the Presidency again and remained in office for the next ten years. Elections in 1990 were marked by violence and suspected electoral fraud. The 1994 election too saw widespread pre-election violence, often aimed at intimidating members of the opposition. Balaguer won in 1994 but most observers felt the election had been stolen. Under pressure from the United States, Balaguer agreed to hold new elections in 1996. He himself would not run.

==Rise of Democracy 1996–present==
Since 1998 [[Freedom House]] has categorized the Dominican Republic as a free country.

===Fernández: First administration 1996-2000===
In 1996, U.S.-raised [[Leonel Fernández Reyna]] of the ''[[Dominican Liberation Party|Partido de la Liberación Dominicana]]'' (Dominican Liberaiton Party) of Bosch's secured more than 51% of the vote, through an alliance with Balaguer. The first item on the president's agenda was the partial sale of some state-owned enterprises. Fernández was praised for ending decades of isolationism and improving ties with other Caribbean countries, but he was criticized for not fighting corruption or alleviating the poverty that affects 60% of the population.

===Mejía's administration 2000-2004===
In May 2000 the center-left [[Hipólito Mejía]] of the PRD was elected president amid popular discontent over power outages in the recently privatized electric industry. His presidency saw major inflation and instability in 2003 of the peso because of the bankruptcy of three major commercial banks in the country due to the bad politics of the main managers. During his time left as president he took some actions to save most savers of the closed banks avoiding a major crisis, the relatively stable unit of currency fell from ~ 16 [[Dominican Peso]]s to 1 [[United States Dollar]] to ~ 60 DOP to 1 USD, and was in the 41s to a dollar when he left office in August 2004. In the May 2004 presidential elections he was defeated by former president [[Leonel Fernández]].

===Fernández: Second administration 2004-2012===
Fernández instituted austerity measures to deflate the peso and rescue the country from its economic crisis, and in the first half of 2006, the economy grew 11.7%. The peso is currently at the exchange rate of ~39 DOP to 1 USD.

Over the last three decades, [[remittances]] (''remesas'') from Dominicans living abroad, mainly in the United States, have become increasingly important to the economy. From 1990 to 2000, the Dominican population of the U.S. doubled in size, from 520,121 in 1990 to 1,041,910, two-thirds of whom were born in the Dominican Republic
itself. More than half of all [[Dominican Americans]] live in [[New York City]], with the largest concentration in the neighborhood of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in northern [[Manhattan]]. Over the past decade, the Dominican Republic has become the largest source of immigration to New York City, and today the [[New York metropolitan area|metropolitan area of New York]] has a larger Dominican population than any city except Santo Domingo.<ref>''The Newest New Yorkers: Immigrant New York in the New Millennium'' (New York City Department of City Planning, Population Division, 2004) Pg. 9</ref> Dominican communities have also developed in [[New Jersey]] (particularly [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]]), [[Miami]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]. In addition, tens of thousands of Dominicans and their descendants live in Puerto Rico. Many Dominicans arrive in Puerto Rico illegally by sea across the [[Mona Passage]], some staying and some moving on to the mainland U.S. (See [[Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico]].) Dominicans living abroad sent an estimated $3 billion in remittances to relatives at home, in 2006.<ref>[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2007/03/13/stories/2007031300300800.htm The Hindu Business Line : Dominican Republic: The business-pleasure tango<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1997, a new law took effect, allowing Dominicans living abroad to retain their citizenship and vote in Presidential elections. President Fernández, who grew up in New York, was the principal beneficiary of this law.

The Dominican Republic was involved in the [[Iraq War|US-led coalition in Iraq]], as part of the Spain-led Latin-American [[Plus Ultra Brigade]]. But in 2004, the nation pulled its 300 or so troops out of Iraq.

===Danilo Medina: 2012-Present===
Medina began his tenure with a series of controversial tax reforms so as to deal with the government's troublesome fiscal situation encountered by the new administration.
