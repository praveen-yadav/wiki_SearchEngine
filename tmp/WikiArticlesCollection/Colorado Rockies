The '''Colorado Rockies''' are a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].  They are currently members of the [[National League]] [[National League West|West Division]].  Their home venue is [[Coors Field]].  Their manager is [[Walt Weiss]].

The Colorado Rockies have won one National League championship (2007).  They mounted a spirited rally in the last month of the 2007 regular season, winning 21 of their final 22 games, and qualified for the [[2007 World Series|2007]] [[World Series]].  However, they lost to the [[American League]] champion [[Boston Red Sox]] four games to none.

==History==
{{main|History of the Colorado Rockies}}

Denver had long been a hotbed of [[minor league baseball]] and many in the area desired a major league team.  Following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]], an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and relocate them.  However, in 1991, as part of Major League Baseball's two-team expansion (they also added the [[Miami Marlins|Florida (now Miami) Marlins]]), an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and [[Michael I. Monus]] were granted a franchise; they took the name "Rockies" due to Denver's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]], which is reflected in their logo.  They began play in 1993, sharing [[Mile High Stadium]] with the [[National Football League]]'s [[Denver Broncos]] their first two seasons while [[Coors Field]] was constructed.  It was completed for the [[1995 Major League Baseball season]].

In 1993 they started play in the [[National League West|western division]] of the [[National League]].  Since that date, the Rockies have reached the MLB postseason three times, each time as the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team.  Twice (1995 and 2009) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.  In 2007 the Rockies advanced all the way to the [[World Series]], only to be swept by the [[Boston Red Sox]].

The Rockies play their home games at [[Coors Field]]. Their newest Spring Training home, [[Salt River Fields at Talking Stick]], opened in March 2011 and is shared with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].
