During his earlier years, Carolla played [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] [[American football|football]] for seven years; he later suggested that being involved in sports saved him from a chaotic home life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adamradio.wordpress.com/2006/10/11/adam-with-kurt-busch-shawn-merriman-and-mistress-melissa/ |title=Adam with Kurt Busch, Shawn Merriman and Mistress Melissa |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |date=October 11, 2006 |work=The Official Adam Carolla Show Blog }}</ref> During his senior year at North Hollywood High School, Carolla distinguished himself in football.

In 1994, Carolla volunteered his services as a boxing trainer to prepare [[Jimmy Kimmel]] for a bout being staged by [[KROQ-FM]]'s morning radio program ''[[Kevin and Bean]]''.<ref name="IMDB bio"/> Kimmel was a regular on the show as "Jimmy the Sports Guy" and he was set to fight another KROQ personality in a boxing exhibition which was being billed as the "Bleeda in Reseda."<ref name=JKbio>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Kimmel bio|url=http://jimmykimmel.net/jkbio.htm|publisher=[[Jimmy Kimmel]]|accessdate=March 13, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/668nJ29eB|archivedate=March 13, 2012| deadurl=no}}</ref> Carolla parlayed this opportunity into a long-running friendship and business partnership with Kimmel as well as a recurring role on ''Kevin and Bean'' as cranky woodshop teacher, Mr. Birchum.<ref>{{cite news|title=Infinity Launches FREE FM as Stern Replacement Strategy|url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=35329|accessdate=March 13, 2012|newspaper=[[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=October 26, 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/668nkNOuR|archivedate=March 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Loveline===
After being signed to the [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris Agency]] by [[Mark Itkin]],<ref>Adam Carolla at [[USC Marshall School of Business]], April 2012 http://adamcarolla.com/store/</ref> Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting the radio call-in show ''[[Loveline]]'' with physician [[Drew Pinsky]], a.k.a. "Dr. Drew", and [[Riki Rachtman]] in October 1995 after Pinsky had heard Carolla on ''Kevin and Bean''<ref name="IMDB bio"/> (Rachtman left the show the following year).<ref name="UMNDaily">{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/sites/default/files/paper-pdfs/1996/08/09/1996-08-09.pdf |title=Laying it on the Loveline |last=Cowan |first=Michael |date=August 9, 1996|accessdate=March 13, 2012|publisher=[[Minnesota Daily]] |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/668iyAWfi |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Loveline is broadcast on [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles and is syndicated nationwide on the [[Westwood One]] radio network.

While the format of the program was primarily a call-in show where listeners would ask questions about sex and relationships, Carolla would often spend much of the show ranting about various topics, from fart jokes to incessant radio weather and traffic reports. Carolla served as the louder, funnier side of the show in contrast to the reserved, thoughtful Pinsky. Carolla's character was described by one reviewer as "a toned-down version of [[Howard Stern]] minus the huge ego".<ref name="UMNDaily"/> On September 25, 2001 Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel both had filled in for Howard Stern's head writer Jackie Martling after Martling had left the show in March 2001. Carolla had mentioned in various interviews and on his podcast that he was offered the job to replace Jackie Martling but turned it down primarily due to Stern's show located in New York as well as his commitment to Loveline.

===The Adam Carolla Show===
{{Main|The Adam Carolla Show (radio)}}
In October 2005 Carolla was announced as the host of a new morning radio show on the  [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation|Infinity Broadcasting]] network.

==Television==

=== 1999 through 2004 ===
Carolla began his first original television series with ''[[The Man Show]]'', along with partner and close friend [[Jimmy Kimmel]], on [[Comedy Central]] from 1999 to 2003. He left ''The Man Show'' at the same time as Kimmel, after having been reportedly offered $50,000 per episode to stay on. Carolla has continued his work with Kimmel as a writer and guest on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. He also appeared on an episode of [[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]] around this time.

Carolla and partner [[Daniel Kellison]] are the heads of [[Jackhole Productions]]. The two created the television show ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for Comedy Central, which revived the Mr. Birchum character. (The show premiered in 2002 on Comedy Central and returned to MTV2 on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30, 2007. The show screened in Australia on SBS Television and The Comedy Channel between 2003 and 2008.)

=== 2005 through 2008 ===
From August 2005 to November 2005, Carolla hosted the talk show ''[[Too Late with Adam Carolla]]'' on Comedy Central.

Also in 2005, Carolla was featured in a home remodeling program called ''[[The Adam Carolla Project]]'' wherein he and a crew of old friends renovated his childhood home. The 13 episodes aired on the cable channel TLC (The Learning Channel) from October through December 2005. The house was then sold for 1.2 Million dollars.<ref name="sfgate.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/20/REG7IFO80R1.DTL|title=Adam Carolla selling TV series house|date=November 20, 2005|accessdate=February 21, 2008|last=Ryon|first=Ruth|work=San Francisco Chronicle| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080404164939/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/20/REG7IFO80R1.DTL| archivedate= 4 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epguides.com/AdamCarollaProject/ |title=The Adam Carolla Project |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |publisher=epguides.com | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080809124701/http://www.epguides.com/AdamCarollaProject/| archivedate= 9 August 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 2006, Carolla appeared on the special summer series ''[[Gameshow Marathon (US TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' as a celebrity panelist on the [[Match Game]] episode.

On the February 18, 2008 broadcast of his radio show, Carolla announced that he would be one of the contestants on the next season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. Later in the broadcast, it was revealed to Adam that his partner would be [[Julianne Hough]].<ref name="ew.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20178686,00.html?iid=top25-20080220-''Dancing+With+the+Stars''+announces+lineup|title=Dancing With The Stars announces lineup|date=February 18, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2008 |last=Bruno|first=Mike |publisher=EW.com}}</ref> He was voted off on the April 8, 2008 episode after his performance of the [[Paso Doble]], after incorporating a demonstration of unicycle riding in his dance routine.

"Ace in the Hole" was to star Carolla as a husband and father who works as a driving instructor.

On the February 13, 2010 episode of Carolla's CarCast podcast, he broke the news that The History Channel had picked up Top Gear US, which NBC had decided against in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/CarCastBlog/2010/02/13/adams-miura/ |title=Adam’s Miura &#124; CarCast |publisher=Adamcarolla.com |date=February 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref> On the March 26, 2010 episode of CarCast, Carolla said that he would not be co-hosting Top Gear US because of scheduling conflicts with his NBC sitcom project.

Carolla was also one of the contestants in [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 12)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]''. He was fired in Week 4, because Mr. Trump perceived that Carolla did not utilize Andretti's car background during a Buick presentation, even though it was clear that Andretti did not like public speaking.

=== The Car Show ===
Carolla's  [http://www.speedtv.com/programs/the-car-show/ "The Car Show"] debuted on Speed TV July 13, 2011. Appearing Wednesdays at 10&nbsp;pm Eastern, it featured Carolla as the host, along with [[Dan Neil]], [[John Salley]], and Matt Farah. It had a format similar to [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]], mixing car reviews, tests and humor. The show was initially met with largely positive reviews from car enthusiasts and comedy fans. Talk show host and comedian [[Jay Leno]] called The Car Show, "...a lot of fun."<ref>[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xk259q_the-tonight-show-with-jay-leno-adam-carolla-part-2_news "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Adam Carolla Part 2"] (video).

==Controversies==
Carolla has occasionally stirred up controversy due to [[Hasty generalization|sweeping generalizations]] about various groups, usually presented in a comedic light. For example  in a late-2003 ''[[Loveline]]'' episode, Carolla said that [[Hawaii]]ans are "dumb," "[[inbreeding|in-bred]]," "retarded" people who are among the "dumbest people we have." These comments were met with anger in Hawaii, and resulted in ''Loveline'''s cancellation on Hawaiian affiliate KPOI.<ref>Cataluna, Lee (December 23, 2003).[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Dec/23/ln/ln48alee.html "KPOI, listeners cry foul"], ''Honolulu Advertiser''.</ref>

On the April 4, 2010 episode of ''[[The Adam Carolla Show (podcast)|The Adam Carolla Show]]'', Carolla referred to Filipino boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]] as a "fucking idiot" and derided Pacquiao's home country of the Philippines, saying, "They got this and [[sex tourism|sex tours]], that's all they have over there. Get your shit together Philippines." The comments angered many Filipinos, and a spokesman for Filipino president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Arroyo]] called Carolla an "ignorant fool." Carolla subsequently apologized via Twitter.<ref name=pacquiao1>{{Cite news   | title = US comedian calls Pacquiao 'illiterate', bashes Pinoys | newspaper = ABS-CBN  | location =Manila, Philippines  | date = April 4, 2010  | url =http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/04/04/10/us-comedian-calls-pacquiao-illiterate-bashes-pinoys | accessdate =January 24, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110202175833/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/04/04/10/us-comedian-calls-pacquiao-illiterate-bashes-pinoys| archivedate= 2 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=pacquiao2>{{Cite news   |title = Adam Carolla Angers Philippines With Rant About Pacquiao, Sex Tourism |work=Huffington Post | date = April 5, 2010  | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/05/adam-carolla-angers-phili_n_525412.html | accessdate =January 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>Carolla, Adam.

In August 2011, Carolla attracted the ire of the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] after a podcast in which, referring to [[transgender]] people, he asked, "When did we start giving a shit about these people?"  The segment was in response to a proposed initiative to have the puppet characters Bert and Ernie, from the children's television show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', enter into a "gay marriage."  He went on to say that the [[LGBT]] moniker ought to be replaced with "YUCK," and that LGBT activists ought to "shut up," and that they are "ruining [his] life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperlined.org/external/Adam_Carolla_2011-08-11.html |title=Transcript of the August 11, 2011 Adam Carolla Show |publisher=Paperlined.org|date=August 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref> GLAAD also referred to previous offensive remarks by Carolla, including an assertion that, "all things being equal," heterosexual parents are better than homosexual parents.

In June 2012, Carolla became the target of charges of sexism due to his remarks during an interview published in the ''New York Post'':<ref>Larry Getlen.[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/the_man_man_NS5UgwY5j06KwJp4WY1OJL "The Man's Man"]. ''The NY Post''. June 16, 2012.</ref>

{{quotation |'''The lesson you learned from a sexual harassment seminar was “Don’t hire chicks.” Do you hate working with women?'''<br>
No. But they make you hire a certain number of chicks, and they’re always the least funny on the writing staff. The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor, I’m just gonna tell her, “Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because they’ll have to hire you, they can’t really fire you, and you don’t have to produce that much. It’ll be awesome.<br>
'''The “are women funny” debate has grown very contentious. You’re not worried about reactions to this?'''<br>
I don’t care. When you’re picking a basketball team, you’ll take the brother over the guy with the yarmulke. Why? Because you’re playing the odds. When it comes to comedy, of course there’s Sarah Silverman, Tina Fey, Kathy Griffin — super-funny chicks. But if you’re playing the odds? No. If Joy Behar or Sherri Shepherd was a dude, they’d be off TV. They’re not funny enough for dudes. What if Roseanne Barr was a dude? Think we’d know who she was? Honestly.}}

===Religious and political views===
Regarding his religious beliefs, Carolla has stated, "I am not agnostic. I am [[Atheism|atheist]]. I don’t think there is no God; I know there’s no God. I know there’s no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there’s no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won’t admit it because there’s another thing they know: they know they’re going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don’t have the courage to admit there’s no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out."<ref name="Atheism"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQMQxJKKjcU |title=Adam Carolla on  religion |work=Youtube |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref>

Regarding his political views, Carolla has stated, "I guess I would be [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], in the sense that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people." He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of traditionally [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] causes such as the legalization of marijuana and some [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] causes such as "...
