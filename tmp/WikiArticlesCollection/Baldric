A '''baldric''' (also '''baldrick''', '''bawdrick''', '''bauldrick''' as well as some other, mostly rare or obsolete, variations) is a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] worn over one [[shoulder]] that is typically used to carry a [[weapon]] (usually a [[sword]]) or other implement such as a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]] or [[drum]].<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/61/86/B0038600.html baldric. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Baldric Baldric - LoveToKnow 1911<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The word may also refer to any belt in general, but this usage is poetic and not considered standard. 

Baldrics have been used since ancient times, usually as part of military dress.  The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and allowing easy access to the object carried.  For example, the late 18th-century [[British Army]]'s distinctive "[[Red coat (British army)|Red coat]]" uniform pattern featured a pair of white baldrics crossed at the chest, with a soldier's [[bayonet]] sheath suspended from one and his [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]] suspended from the other.  Alternatively, and especially in modern times, the baldric may fill a ceremonial role rather than a practical one.

Many non-military or paramilitary organizations include baldrics as part of ceremonial dress.  The [[Knights of Columbus]] 4th Degree Color Corps uses a baldric as part of their uniform;<ref>[http://www.kofcsupplies.com/ccp0-catshow/4thdegreecolorcorps.html 4th Degree Color Corps<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.carr.org/~meripper/kofc/assembly/regalia.asp Knights of Columbus, Emblem, Jewels, and Regalia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> it supports a ceremonial sword.

The University of Illinois marching band, the Marching Illini, wore two baldrics as a part of their uniform until 2009, with one over each shoulder.  They crossed in the front and back and were buttoned onto the jacket beneath a cape and epaulets.

==Roman balteus==
During [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman times]] the '''balteus'''  (plural ''baltei'') was a type of baldric commonly used to suspend a [[sword]]. It was a belt generally worn over the shoulder, passing obliquely down to the side, typically made of leather, often ornamented with precious stones, metals or both.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Balteus.html |title=Baʹlteus from a Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |page=196 |author=William Smith |location=London |year=1875 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |publisher=John Murray }}</ref> There was also a similar belt worn by the Romans, particularly by soldiers, called a ''cintus'' (pl. ''cinti'') that fastened around the waist. The word ''accintus'' meaning a soldier (literally, "girt" as for battle) attests to this differing usage.

== The baldric in popular culture ==
The baldric appears in the literary canon. Britomart, in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s [[The Faerie Queen|Faerie Queene]], clothes herself in a borrowed armor "with brave bauldrick garnished" before embarking on her quest (Book III, canto iii).  Benedick, from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', says "But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldric all women shall pardon me." A baldric features prominently in Chapter 4 of [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. The yeoman in [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]] ''is described as wearing a "baldrick of bright green." The baldric of [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] plays a key part in the [[Aeneid]], leading Aeneas to kill Turnus. In ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Boromir]] is described: "On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees." In [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] Gawain returns from his battle with the Green Knight wearing the green girdle "obliquely, like a baldric, bound at his side,/ below his left shoulder, laced in a knot, in betokening the blame he had borne for his fault."

Some [[Klingon]]s wear baldrics in ''[[Star Trek]]''.  The character [[Worf]] does so in almost every one of his appearances through two series and four films.  In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Conundrum (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conundrum]]", Worf mistakenly believes that the baldric indicates his rank or authority, so he briefly assumes command of the Enterprise. 

A crossed pair of baldrics is often worn as part of uniform of [[Morris Dance]] sides; different colours of baldric help to distinguish different sides.

[[Baldrick]] is a character in the [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[Blackadder]] ''played by [[Tony Robinson]].
