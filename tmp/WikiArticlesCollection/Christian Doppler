'''Christian Andreas Doppler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|l|ər}}; 29 November 1803 &ndash; 17 March 1853) was an [[Austria]]n [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]].

==Life and work==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
Christian Doppler was raised in [[Salzburg, Austria]], the son of a stonemason. Doppler could not work in his father's business because of his generally weak physical condition. After completing high school Doppler studied philosophy in [[Salzburg]] and mathematics and physics at the ''k. k. Polytechnisches Institut'' (now [[Vienna University of Technology]]) where he worked as an assistant since 1829. In 1835 started to work at the ''Prague Polytechnic'' (now [[Czech Technical University]]), where he was appointed in 1841.

Only a year later, at the age of 38, Doppler gave a lecture to the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences and subsequently published his most notable work, "[[Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels]]" ''(On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens)''. There is a facsimile edition with an English translation by Alec Eden.<ref name="AlecEden">{{Cite book |last = Eden |first = Alec |title = The search for Christian Doppler |publisher = Springer-Verlag |location = Wien |year = 1992 |isbn = 0-387-82367-0 |postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In Doppler's time in [[Prague]] as a professor he published over 50 articles on mathematics, physics and astronomy. In 1847 he left Prague for the professorship of mathematics, physics, and mechanics at the [[Academy of Mines and Forests]] (its successor is the present day [[University of Miskolc]]) in [[Selmecbánya]] (then [[Kingdom of Hungary]], now Banská Štiavnica, [[Slovakia]]),<ref>http://www.ombkenet.hu/bkl/banyaszat/2003/bklbanyaszat2003_5_07.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.uni-miskolc.hu/public/index.php?page_id=640</ref> and in 1849 he moved to Vienna.<ref>http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3039.html</ref>

Doppler's research in [[Prague]] was interrupted by the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary incidents]] of March 1848, when he fled to [[Vienna]]. There he was appointed head of the Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1850. During his time there, Doppler, along with [[Franz Unger]], played an influential role in the development of young [[Gregor Mendel]], known as the founding father of [[genetics]], who was a student at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1851 to 1853.

Doppler died on 18 March 1853 at age 49 from a [[pulmonary disease]] in [[Venice]] (also at that time part of the Austrian Empire). His tomb is just inside the entrance of the Venetian island cemetery of [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Štoll | first = Ivan | authorlink = | title = Christian Doppler &mdash; Man, Work and Message | encyclopedia = The Phenomenon of Doppler | volume = | pages = 28 | publisher = The Czech National University | location = Prague | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

==Full name==
Some confusion exists about Doppler's full name. Doppler referred to himself as Christian Doppler. The records of his birth and baptism stated Christian ''Andreas'' Doppler. Forty years after Doppler's death the misnomer ''Johann'' Christian Doppler was introduced by the astronomer [[Julius Scheiner]]. Scheiner's mistake has since been copied by many.<ref name="AlecEden"/>
