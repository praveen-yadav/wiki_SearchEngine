'''Ambrose [[Traversari]], [[Camaldolese|O.S.B. Cam.]]''', also referred to as '''Ambrose of Camaldoli''' (1386 – October 20, 1439), was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[monk]] and [[theology|theologian]], who was a prime supporter of the [[papal]] cause in the 15th century. He is honored as a saint by the [[Camaldolese]] Order.

==Biography==
[[Traversari]] was born near [[Forlì]], at the village of [[Portico e San Benedetto|Portico di Romagna]] in 1386.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  At the age of fourteen he entered the [[Camaldolese]] Order in the Monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence|St. Mary of the Angels]] in [[Florence]], and rapidly became a leading theologian and [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenist]]. In his study of [[Greek literature]] his master was [[Manuel Chrysoloras|Emmanuel Chrysoloras]]. He worked primarily as a scholar until he became [[Prior]] General of the Order in 1431.

Ambrose emerged as a leading advocate of the [[primacy of the Roman Pontiff]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the [[Council of Florence|Council of Basel]] as legate of [[Pope Eugene IV]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and defended the primacy of the Roman Pontiff and adjured the council not to "rend asunder [[Jesus|Christ's]] seamless robe".{{sfn|Becket|1913}} He was next sent by the [[Pope]] to the Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to ask his aid in the pope's efforts to end this Council, which for five years had been encroaching on papal prerogatives. The Pope transferred the Council from [[Basel]] to [[Ferrara]] on 18 September 1437.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}

So strong was Ambrose's hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]. He likewise supported the pope at Ferrara and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} But in this Council, and later, in that of Florence, Ambrose, by his efforts and charity toward some poor Greek bishops, greatly helped to bring about a union of the two Churches, the decree for which, 6 July 1439, he was called on to draw up.

He died soon after.{{sfn|Becket|1913}} His [[calendar of saints|feastday]] is celebrated by the Camaldolese Order on November 20.

==Character==
According to the author of his biography in the Eleventh edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'': "Ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church. Thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest, in his relations with his brother humanists, such as [[Cosimo de' Medici]], he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of Greek theological authors".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Works==
His works include a treatise on the Holy [[Eucharist]], one on the [[Trinity (Christianity)#Eternal generation and procession|Procession of the Holy Spirit]], many lives of saints, as well as a history of his term as Prior General of the Camaldolese. He also translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Latin]] a life of St. [[John Chrysostom]] ([[Venice]], 1533); the Spiritual Wisdom of [[Joannes Moschus|John Moschus]]; ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of St. [[John Climacus]] (Venice, 1531), P.G., LXXXVIII.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}  Between 1424 and 1433 he worked on the translation of the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' by [[Diogenes Laërtius]], which came to be widely circulated in manuscript form and was published at [[Rome]] in 1472 (the first printed edition of the ''Lives''; the Greek text was printed only in 1533).{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} He also translated four books against the errors of the Greeks, by [[Manuel Kalekas]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] ([[Ingolstadt]], 1608), P.G., CLII, col. 13-661, a work known only through Ambrose's translation.

He also translated many homilies of St. John Chrysostom; the treatise of the [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] on the celestial hierarchy; [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil's]] treatise on [[virginity]]; thirty nine discourses of St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]], and many other works of the [[Fathers of the Church|Fathers]] and writers of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Church]]. [[Jean Mabillon|Dom Mabillon's]] ''Letters and Orations of St. Ambrose of Camaldoli'' was published at Florence, 1759.{{sfn|Becket|1913}}
