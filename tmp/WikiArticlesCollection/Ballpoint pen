A '''ballpoint pen''' (also ''[[British English|biro]]'',<ref name="About"/> and ''[[Philippine English|ball pen]]'') is a [[writing]] instrument which dispenses a [[viscosity|viscous]] [[ink]] from an internal reservoir through the rolling action of a [[ball (bearing)|metal ball]] at its point. This "''ball point''" may vary in diameter, and may be made of [[brass]], [[steel]], or [[tungsten carbide]].<ref>{{cite web| title = How does a ballpoint pen work? | work=Engineering | publisher=HowStuffWorks  | date=  1998–2007 | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question683.htm | accessdate = 16 November 2007 }}</ref>

Originally conceived and developed as a cleaner and reliable alternative to [[Quill pen|quill]] and [[fountain pen]]s, ballpoint pens are now the dominant writing instrument.<ref name="bpp encyc"/>
Millions are manufactured and sold every day, worldwide,<ref name="About"/> with low-cost and ubiquity assuring that there is always a ballpoint pen within reach.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>

This so-called "''invention that changed the way we write''"<ref name="intrigue"/> has also influenced the way art is made; some professional artists use ballpoints to create [[ballpoint pen artwork|fine artwork]].
A popular [[Bic Cristal|disposable model]] has gained recognition for its [[industrial design]] as part of the permanent collection at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]].<ref name="Bic Cristal in MoMA collection">[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=82141 Bic Cristal in MoMA collection]</ref> Designer ballpoints are also produced for the high-end market by pen manufacturers, and prized by collectors.

==History==
[[File:Ballpointpentip lessnoise.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tip of a ballpoint pen highly magnified]]

===Origins===
The concept of using a ''ball point'' within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century.
In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen. The ink clung to the ball, which spun as the pen was drawn across the paper.

The first [[patent]] for a ballpoint pen<ref>Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) "Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20" ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&nbsp;69–100, page 69</ref> was issued on 30 October 1888, to John J. Loud,<ref>Great Britain Patent No. 15630, 30 October 2008</ref> a leather [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]], who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write on his leather products, which then-common [[fountain pen]]s could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited<ref name="About"/> and the patent eventually lapsed.<ref name="1940s"/>
The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as we know them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.<ref name="bpp encyc"/>
Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available.<ref name="web"/>
Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>  If the ball socket were too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket were too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
Ink reservoirs pressurised by piston, spring, [[capillary action]], and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.<ref>Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) "Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20" ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&nbsp;69–100, page 80</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Webshark Ltd. - www.webshark.hu |url=http://www.herend.com/herald/012/eng/eletmod.htm |title=A porcelán-arany csoda |publisher=Herend |date= |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>

[[László Bíró]], a Hungarian newspaper editor frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
Bíró enlisted the help of his brother György, a chemist,<ref name="How ballpoints work"/> to develop viscous ink formulas for new ballpoint designs.<ref name="bpp encyc"/>

László's innovation successfully coupled ink-viscosity with a ball-socket mechanism which act compatibly to prevent ink from drying inside the reservoir while allowing controlled flow.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
Bíró filed a British patent on 15 June 1938.<ref name="About"/><ref>''The first complete specifications appear to be UK 498997, June 1938 and UK 512218, December 1938; his rather basic Hungarian patent 120037 was dated April 1938.'' Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) "Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20" ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&nbsp;69–100, page 80</ref>

In 1941 the Bíró brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany and moved to Argentina, where they formed ''Bíró Pens of Argentina'' and filed a new patent in 1943.<ref name="About"/> Their pen was sold in Argentina as the ''Birome'' ([[portmanteau]] of the names Bíró and Meyne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country.<ref name="About"/>
This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ball point pens for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircrew as the ''Biro''. Ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>

===Postwar proliferation===
Following World War II, many companies vied to commercially produce their own ballpoint pen design.
In post-war Argentina, success of the Birome ballpoint was limited, but in mid-1945 the ''Eversharp'' Co., a maker of [[mechanical pencil]]s, teamed up with [[Eberhard Faber]] Co. to license the rights from Birome for sales in the United States.<ref name="About"/><ref name="1940s"/>

During the same period, American entrepreneur [[Milton Reynolds]] came across a Birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.<ref name="About"/><ref name="1940s"/>
Recognizing commercial potential, he purchased several ballpoint samples, returned to the United States, and founded ''[[Milton Reynolds#The Reynolds International Pen Company|Reynolds International Pen Company]]''.
Reynolds bypassed the Birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an American patent, beating Eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the US market.<ref name="About"/><ref name="1940s"/>
Debuting at [[Gimbels]] department store in New York City on 29 October 1945,<ref name="1940s"/> for US$9.75 each,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} ''Reynolds Rocket'' became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen.<ref name="About"/><ref name="How ballpoints work"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Inventing the 20th century: 100 inventions that shaped the world|year=2002|publisher=NYU Press|author=Stephen Van Dulken|coauthors=Andrew Phillips|page=106}}</ref>
Reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen, with great success; Gimbel's sold many thousands of pens within one week.
In Britain, the Miles Martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945.<ref name="About"/>

Neither Reynolds' nor Eversharp's ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in America and, although ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946, consumer interest subsequently plunged due to market-saturation.<ref name="1940s"/>
By the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and Reynolds' company folded.<ref name="About"/>

[[Paper Mate]] pens, among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in Canada.<ref name="intrigue"/>
Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate would pioneer new ink formulas and advertise them as "banker-approved".<ref name="1940s"/>
In 1954 Parker Pens released ''The Jotter''—that company's first ballpoint—boasting additional features and technological advances which would also include the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens.<ref name="About"/>
In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars.<ref name="About"/>
In the 1960s, the failing Eversharp Co. sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.<ref name="About"/>

Marcel Bich also introduced a ballpoint pen to the American marketplace in the 1950s, licensed from Bíró and based on the Argentine designs.<ref name="bpp encyc"/><ref name="Phaidon"/>
Bich shortened his name to Bic in 1953, becoming the ballpoint brand now recognised globally.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
Bic pens struggled until the company launched its "Writes The First Time, Every Time!" advertising campaign in the 1960s.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
Competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
[[Image:4 Bic Cristal pens and caps.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Bic Cristal]] ballpoint pens shown in four basic ink colours.]]

==Types of ballpoint pens==
Ballpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models.
Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced.
Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials.
The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,<ref name="bpp encyc"/> which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.

[[Rollerball pen]]s employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks.
Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface.
Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to ''smearing''—posing problems to left-handed people—and ''running'', should the writing surface become wet.

Because of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the "Fisher [[Space Pen]]."
Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised ink reservoir<ref name="How ballpoints work"/> which forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage,<ref name="How ballpoints work"/> thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacepen.com/about-us.aspx |title=Fisher Space Pen - About Us |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>

Ballpoint pens with "erasable ink" were pioneered by the [[Paper Mate]] pen company.<ref name="Erasable"/>
The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to [[rubber cement]] glue, allowing the ink it to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent.<ref name="Erasable"/>
Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning they may also write upside-down.
Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.<ref name="Erasable"/>

The inexpensive, disposable [[Bic Cristal]] (also simply ''Bic pen'' or ''Biro'') is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world.<ref name="Phaidon">''Phaidon Design Classics- Volume 2'', 2006 Phaidon Press Ltd. ISBN 0-7148-4399-7</ref>

Ballpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses, such as hotels, as a form of advertising—printed with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.<ref name="bpp encyc"/>

==As art medium==
{{Main|Ballpoint pen artwork}}
Ballpoint pens have proven to be a versatile [[art medium]] for professional artists as well as amateur [[doodle]]rs.<ref name="NYT" /> Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply.<ref name="Oddity" />
Some artists use them within [[mixed-media]] works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.<ref name="Tricks" />

Effects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved.<ref name="Weekender" />
Traditional [[pen|pen-and-ink]] techniques such as [[stipple|stippling]] and [[cross-hatching]] can be used to create half-tones<ref name="Mylne" /> or the illusion of form and volume.<ref name="Art of Sketching" />
For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush.<ref name="Japan Times" />
Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork<ref name="Tokyo Journal" /> and photography,<ref name="Telegraph" /> causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist [[Lennie Mace]] refers to as the ''Wow Factor''.<ref name="Japan Times" /><ref name="Tokyo Journal" />

Famous 20th Century artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], among others, have utilised ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers.<ref name="Warhol BPP" /> Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st Century, with [[contemporary]] artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination and innovation. Korean-American artist [[Il Lee]] has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s.<ref name="NYT" />
Since the 1980s, [[Lennie Mace]] creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim.<ref name="Gekkan" /> The artist coined terms such as ''PENtings'' and ''Media Graffiti'' to describe his varied output.<ref name="Japan Times" />
More recently, British artist [[James Mylne (artist)|James Mylne]] has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color.<ref name="Telegraph" />
In the mid-2000s (decade) [[Juan Francisco Casas]] generated Internet attention for a series of large-scale, [[photorealism|photo-realistic]] ballpoint duplications of his own [[snapshot (photography)|snapshots]] of friends, utilising only blue pens.<ref name="Casas" />
[[File:Lennie Mace "Uchuu Neko Parade" 2005 Tokyo, ballpoint "Penting" 130x92cm.jpg|thumb|300px|Ballpoint "''PENting''" by [[Lennie Mace]], '''Uchuu Neko Parade''' (2005) ballpoint pen and hardware on paper.]]

Using ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations.
Color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists.<ref name="Care" />
Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased.<ref name="Japan Times" />
Additionally, "blobbing" of ink on the drawing surface and "skipping" of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes.<ref name="Tricks" />
Although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.<ref name="Care" />

==Manufacturing==
Although designs and construction vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal.<ref name="bpp encyc"/>
Standard components include the freely-rotating ''ball point'' itself (distributing the ink), a ''socket'' holding the ball in place, and a self-contained ''ink reservoir'' supplying ink to the ball.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
In modern pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/> Brass, steel or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points,<ref name="How ballpoints work"/> then housed in a brass socket.<ref name="Incredible Pen"/>

The function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale.The ball point delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a ''buffer'' between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>

The common ballpoint pen is a product of [[mass-production]], with components produced separately on assembly-lines.<ref name="Incredible Pen"/>
Basic steps in the manufacturing process include (production) of ink formulas, moulding of metal and plastic components, and assembly.<ref name="bpp encyc"/>
Marcel Bich was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens.<ref name="How ballpoints work"/>
