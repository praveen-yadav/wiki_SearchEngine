'''Coprophagia''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|p|.|r|ə|.|ˈ|f|eɪ|.|dʒ|i|.|ə}}<ref>''Coprophagia.'' (2012). Dictionary.com September 2, 2012, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprophagia link]</ref> or coprophagy is the consumption of [[feces]].  The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''copros'', "feces" and φαγεῖν ''phagein'', "to eat".  Many [[animal]] [[species]] eat feces as a normal behavior; other species may [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|not normally]] consume feces but do so under unusual conditions. Coprophagy refers to many kinds of feces eating including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics),of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or its own (autocoprophagy), those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Hirakawa |first1=H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bsc/mam/2001/00000031/00000001/art00005}}</ref>

==In animals==

===Invertebrates===

[[Image:Physiphora alceae female.jpg|thumb|A female fly feeding on feces]]
Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]] ([[herbivore]]s' [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive systems]] are especially inefficient).  A notable feces-eating insect is the [[dung-beetle]] and the most common is the [[fly]].

[[Termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship (e.g. with the protozoan ''[[Mixotricha paradoxa]]'') that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet via the protists. It has also been proposed that hormones are passed to offspring in this way.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Vertebrates===
[[Pig]]s sometimes eat the feces of herbivores that leave a significant amount of semi-digested matter, including their own. In some cultures, it was common for poor families to collect horse feces to feed their pigs. However, allowing domestic pigs to consume feces contributes to the risk of parasite infection.  The [[pig toilet]] is an ancient method of feeding pigs on garbage and human [[feces]], and is used in [[China]].

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]] due to the high amount of protein and low cost of the feed compared to other sources of protein. It has been reported that this process is made safe in regards to bacteria loading by heating the chicken litter to {{convert|160|F|C}} prior to consumption. There are, however, concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.<ref>[http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/18835/fda-urged-to-ban-feeding-chicken-litter-to-cattle FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle], 2009-11-02, L.A. Times</ref> Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.

[[Capybara]], [[rabbit]]s, [[hamster]]s and some other related species are [[hindgut fermentation|hindgut fermenters]] which digest cellulose by microbial fermentation.  In addition, they extract further nutrition from grass by ingesting their feces meaning their food passes through the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] a second time. Soft [[fecal pellet]]s of partially digested food are [[excretion|excreted]] and generally consumed immediately. Consuming these [[cecotrope]]s (or ''night feces'' produced in the [[cecum]]), is important for obtaining [[vitamin B12]], which intestinal bacteria produce from [[Cobalt]] salts. Vitamin B12 must then be re-introduced to the digestive system since only the stomach (and not the intestines) is capable of absorbing vitamin B12. They also produce normal [[feces|droppings]], which are not eaten.

The young of [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|pandas]], [[koala]]s, and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found on their ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature&nbsp;— Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref> When they are born, their [[intestine]]s do not contain these bacteria (they are sterile).  Without them, they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

[[Gorilla]]s eat their own feces and the feces of other gorillas. Similar behavior has also been observed among [[chimpanzee]]s.  Such behavior may serve to improve absorption of vitamins or of nutritive elements made available from the re-ingestion of seeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.nycep.org/rothman/6PWUnutr.pdf |title=Nutritional Aspects of the Diet of Wild Gorillas |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref>

Hamsters, [[guinea pigs]] and [[chinchillas]] eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by bacteria in the gut. [[Ape]]s have been observed eating [[horse]] feces for the [[salt]] content. [[Monkey]]s have been observed eating elephant feces. Coprophagia has also been observed in the [[naked mole rat]].

Mother [[cat]]s are known to eat the feces of their newborn [[kitten]]s during the earliest phase after birth, presumably to eliminate cues to potential predators and to keep the den clean.

Both domesticated and wild mammals are known to consume feces. In the wild they either bury or eat waste to protect their trail from predators. In species of cats, the dominant feline openly displays feces. In domesticated mammals, choosing not to offend the dominant owner, they eat or more prominently bury waste.

==In plants==
Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants of the genus ''[[Nepenthes]]'', obtain nourishment from the feces of [[commensalism|commensal]] animals.

==In humans==

===In medicine===

[[Fecal bacteriotherapy]] is when feces from a close relative or spouse are given to patients suffering from intractable [[diarrhea]] caused by ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''. The objective is to repopulate the intestines with the normal [[gut flora]] (intestinal [[bacteria]]) which kill the clostridium. The healthy stool is administered by [[nasogastric tube]], [[enema]], or in a [[capsule (pharmacy)|capsule]].

Consuming other [[human feces|people's feces]] carries the risk of contracting diseases and bacteria spread such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', [[Hepatitis A]], [[Hepatitis E]], [[pneumonia]], [[polio]], and [[influenza]]. Coprophagia also carries a risk of contracting [[intestinal parasite]]s.

Lewin reported that "... consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the [[antibiotic]] [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was confirmed by [[Afrika Korps|German soldiers]] in [[Africa]] during [[World War II]]".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}</ref>

The introduction of foreign bacteria into the human [[gastrointestinal tract]] via infusion of fecal enemas is an established medical practice in cases of ulcerative colitis, especially where the patient's own intestinal flora has been significantly depleted by prior use of antibiotics.<ref>[http://www.journals.lww.com/jcge/Abstract/2003/07000/Treatment_of_Ulcerative_Colitis_Using_Fecal.12.aspx Treatment of Ulcerative Colitis Using Fecal Bacteriotherapy.]</ref>

Coprophagia has been observed in a small number of patients with [[schizophrenia]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Harada KI, Yamamoto K, Saito T.| title = Effective treatment of coprophagia in a patient with schizophrenia with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug perospirone | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | page = 113 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-941487  | pmid = 16721701 }}</ref> [[Major depressive disorder|depression]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Wise, T.N., and R.L.

===In sex===
Some human [[Coprophilia|coprophiles]] engage in coprophagia as a sexual fetish. Until 1995, the only documented cases of coprophagia in humans were those with schizophrenia or other mental illness, but it has now been shown to occur among mentally healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wise TN, Goldberg RL |title=Escalation of a fetish: Coprophagia in a nonpsychotic adult of normal intelligence |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=272–75 |year=1995 |doi=10.1080/00926239508414647 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00926239508414647 |pmid=8789509}}</ref> Psychiatrists using the classification system of the [[DSM-IV]] would consider this a symptom of the [[paraphilia]] called coprophilia - "if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning". Coprophagia is also depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').<ref name="Holmes">{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |pages= ''p''. 244}}</ref>

===In literature===

* ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'' a novel by the [[Marquis de Sade]] written in 1785, is replete with detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.<ref>le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage</ref>
* [[Samuel R. Delany]]'s novel ''[[Hogg (novel)|Hogg]]'', written in 1969, is also replete with detailed descriptions of erotic coprophagia.

It is in turn a citation of the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], which often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοϕάγος'').<ref>Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 and Book 3 chap. 25</ref> In one dialogue, Rabelais speaks of coprophagia as a [[Christian]] gesture, saying that monks ''swallow the shit of the world, that is the sins'', and for this they are ostracized by society.<ref>Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 quote: "ilz mangent la merde du monde, c'est à dire, les pechez"</ref>
* ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' a novel by [[Iain M Banks]], contains depictions of a tribe known as the Eaters, who repeatedly engage in coprophagia.
* ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' a comic-absurdist play by [[Alfred Jarry]], contains numerous references to coprophagy/[[scatology]].<ref>Ubu Roi</ref>
* ''Cows'' a 1998 horror-satire by Matthew Stokoe, contains a very detailed, extreme sequence of a boy forcing his mother to eat his feces (and eating some himself).

===In film===

* The third amongst the four acts of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1975 film ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a loose adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's aforementioned ''The 120 Days of Sodom'', is concerned with coprophagia.

* ''[[August Underground]]''; a woman held captive by a pair of serial killers is degraded by being forced to eat her own excrement.
* ''[[The Green Elephant]]''; during a [[psychotic break]], one prisoner consumes his own feces.
* ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]''; a [[mad scientist]] captures three tourists and surgically connects them mouth to anus, so that two of them are "fed" by the bowel movements of the "segment" whose buttocks their mouth has been attached to.
* ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)]]''; in the sequel to the above, a man copycats the scientist's experiment, but with nearly a dozen victims.
* ''[[Unspeakable (2000 film)|Unspeakable]]''; when a catatonic woman defecates, a man smears it on her vagina, then performs [[cunnilingus]] on her.

* ''[[The Angel's Melancholy]]''; a man defecates on a woman, rubs it on her and on his arm.
* ''[[The Acid House (film)|The Acid House]]''; in an adaptation from Irvine Welsh's collection of short stories of the same name, specifically 'The Granton Star Cause', the parent's of the protagonist engage in [[sadomasochism]] and as a 'punishment' the father has to consume his wife's excrement.
* ''[[I Declare War]]''; there is a dare between two of the boys.

===In TV series===

* ''[[Tsst]]''; in the seventh episode of the tenth season of ''[[South Park]]'', the American animated [[TV series]], a nanny ([[Jo Frost]] from the [[reality TV]] program ''[[Supernanny]]''), ends up in a [[psychiatric hospital]], chanting "It's from Hell!", while eating her own feces after her attempt to help [[Cartman]]'s mom with his son's behavior problems.
* ''[[HumancentiPad]]''; in the first episode of the fifteenth season of ''South Park'', [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is kidnapped and forced to become part of a "revolutionary new product" for which he and two others were kidnapped tor, the "HUMANCENTiPAD", consisting of the three kidnapped subjects on all fours sewn together mouth to anus (the storyline is based on ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede]]''). Due to this, each human after the first must eat the previous human's feces, which is eventually used to power an [[iPad]].
* ''[[Brian & Stewie]]''; in the seventeenth episode in the eighth season of ''[[Family Guy]]'',  [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] become trapped in a bank vault. When the vault's door closes,  Stewie is frightened and defecates into his diaper. He soon gets a diaper rash because of this, and suggests that Brian (a dog) "eat his poo", which Brian eventually does.
* ''[[T.: The Terrestrial]]''; in the sixteenth episode of the seventh season of ''[[Futurama]]'', [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] becomes stranded on the planet Omicron Persei 8. In a parody of ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]'', Jrrr (son of Lrrr, the planet's ruler) finds Fry and leaves a trail of his feces (which resemble [[Skittles (confectionery)|Skittles]]) for Fry to follow, which Fry eats, calling it "Feces Pieces", much like Elliot leaving a trail of [[Reese's Pieces]] for E.T.
