'''Amino acids''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|iː|n|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|aɪ|n|oʊ}}, or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ɪ|n|oʊ}}) are [[biology|biologically]] important [[organic compound]]s composed of [[amine]] (-NH<sub>2</sub>) and [[carboxylic acid]] (-COOH) [[functional group]]s, along with a [[side chain|side-chain]] specific to each amino [[acid]]. The key elements of an amino acid are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], though other elements are found in the side-chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known<ref>{{cite journal |title= New Naturally Occurring Amino Acids |first1= Ingrid |last1= Wagner |first2= Hans |last2= Musso |doi= 10.1002/anie.198308161 |journal= Angew.

Structurally they can be classified according to the functional groups' locations as [[Alpha and beta carbon|alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-)]] amino acids; other categories relate to [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[pH]] level, and side chain group type ([[aliphatic]], [[acyclic]], [[aromatic]], containing hydroxyl or [[sulfur]], etc.) In the form of [[protein]]s, amino acids comprise the second largest component (after [[water]]) of human [[muscle]]s, [[cell (biology)|cells]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W0073E/w0073e04.htm#P1625_217364 Human nutrition in the developing world] – [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], ch.8</ref> Outside proteins, amino acids perform critical roles in processes such as [[neurotransmitter]] transport and [[biosynthesis]].

Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids also play critical non-protein roles within the body. For example: in the [[human brain]], glutamate (standard [[glutamic acid]]) and [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]] ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are respectively the main [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters]];<ref name="pmid12467378">{{cite journal | author = Petroff OA | title = GABA and glutamate in the human brain | journal = Neuroscientist | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 562–573 | year = 2002 | month = December | pmid = 12467378 | doi = 10.1177/1073858402238515| url = http://nro.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12467378 }}</ref> [[hydroxyproline]] (a major component of the [[connective tissue]] [[collagen]]) is synthesised from [[proline]]; the standard amino acid [[glycine]] is used to synthesise porphyrins used in [[red blood cell]]s; and the non-standard [[carnitine]] is used in [[lipid|lipid transport]].

9 of the 20 standard amino acids are called [[essential amino acid|"essential"]] for humans because they cannot be created from other [[chemical compound|compounds]] by the human body, and so must be taken in as food. Others may be [[Essential amino acid#Essentiality vs. conditional essentiality in humans|conditionally essential]] for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between [[species]].<ref>For example, [[ruminant]]s such as [[cow]]s obtain a number of amino acids via [[microbe]]s in the [[reticulorumen|first two stomach chambers]].</ref>

Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in [[nutrition]] and are commonly used in [[nutritional supplement]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, and [[food technology]]. Industrial uses include the production of [[drugs]], [[biodegradable plastic]]s and [[asymmetric catalysis|chiral catalysts]].

==History==
The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] and [[Pierre Jean Robiquet]] isolated a compound in [[asparagus]] that was subsequently named [[asparagine]], the first amino acid to be discovered.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The discovery of a new plant principle in Asparagus sativus |author=Vauquelin LN, Robiquet PJ |journal=Annales de Chimie |year=1806 |volume=57 |pages=88–93}}</ref><ref name=Anfinsen>{{Cite book|title=Advances in Protein Chemistry |author=Anfinsen CB, Edsall JT, Richards FM |year=1972 |pages=99, 103 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-12-034226-6}}</ref> [[Cystine]] was discovered in 1810,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=On cystic oxide, a new species of urinary calculus |author=Wollaston WH |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=1810 |volume=100|issue=0 |pages=223–30 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1810.0015}}</ref> although its monomer, [[cysteine]], remained undiscovered until 1884.<ref name=Anfinsen/><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Über cystin und cystein |author=Baumann E |journal=Z Physiol Chemie |year=1884 |volume=8 |issue=4|pages=299–305 | url=http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit16533 | accessdate=28 March 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110314075450/http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/library/data/lit16533| archivedate= 14 March 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Glycine]] and [[leucine]] were discovered in 1820.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sur la conversion des matières animales en nouvelles substances par le moyen de l'acide sulfurique |author=Braconnot HM |journal=Annales de Chimie et Physique |series=Série 2 |year=1820 |volume=13 |pages=113–25}}</ref> Usage of the term ''amino acid'' in the English language is from 1898.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=amino | publisher = www.etymonline.com | title = etymonline.com entry for ''amino'' | accessdate = 19 July 2010}}</ref> Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid [[hydrolysis]].

In the structure shown at the top of the page, '''R''' represents a [[side-chain]] specific to each amino acid. The [[carbon]] atom next to the [[carboxyl group]] is called the [[alpha carbon|α–carbon]] and amino acids with a side-chain bonded to this carbon are referred to as ''alpha amino acids''. These are the most common form found in nature. In the alpha amino acids, the α–carbon is a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] carbon atom, with the exception of [[glycine]].<ref name="Creighton">{{Cite book|last=Creighton |first=Thomas H. |title=Proteins: structures and molecular properties |publisher=W.

Amino acids are usually classified by the [[chemical property|properties]] of their side-chain into four groups.

Of the standard α-amino acids, all but [[glycine]] can exist in either of two [[enantiomers]], called <small>L</small> or <small>D</small> amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (''see also [[Chirality (chemistry)|Chirality]]'').

In alternative fashion, the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules|''(S)'' and ''(R)'' designators]] are used to indicate the absolute [[stereochemistry]].

It is also shown in the ionized form, after the carboxyl group has lost a hydrogen atom, which introduces a negative charge, and the amino group has gained a hydrogen, which introduces a positive charge.| An amino acid in its (1) un-ionized and (2) zwitterionic forms]]

===Zwitterions===
The amine and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow them to have [[Amphoterism|amphiprotic]] properties.<ref name="Creighton" /> Carboxylic acid groups (−CO<sub>2</sub>H) can be deprotonated to become negative carboxylates (−CO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> ), and α-amino groups (NH<sub>2</sub>−) can be protonated to become positive α-ammonium groups (<sup>+</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>−). At pH values greater than the [[pKa]] of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above), the negative carboxylate ion predominates. At pH values lower than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4), the nitrogen is predominantly protonated as a positively charged α-ammonium group. Thus, at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, the predominant form adopted by α-amino acids contains a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge. This molecular state is known as a [[zwitterion]], from the German '''Zwitter''' meaning ''hermaphrodite'' or ''hybrid''.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Simmons, William J.; Gerhard Meisenberg |title=Principles of medical biochemistry |publisher=Mosby Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |isbn=0-323-02942-6 |oclc= |page=19}}</ref> Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge −1). The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the right) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup>). Amino acids also exist as zwitterions in the solid phase, and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.

===Isoelectric point===
At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in [[dynamic equilibrium]] with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Fennema OR |title=Food Chemistry 3rd Ed |publisher=CRC Press |location= |pages=327–8 |isbn=0-8247-9691-8 |oclc= }}</ref> This pH is known as the [[isoelectric point]] pI, so pI = ½(pKa<sub>1</sub> + pKa<sub>2</sub>). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side-chains, the pKa of the side-chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side-chains, pI = ½(pKa<sub>1</sub> + pKa<sub>R</sub>), where pKa<sub>R</sub> is the side-chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side-chain with pKa<sub>R</sub> = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side-chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side-chains, pI = ½(pKa<sub>R</sub> + pKa<sub>2</sub>). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isolectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side-chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.

==Occurrence and functions in biochemistry==

===Standard amino acids===
{{See also|Protein primary structure|Posttranslational modification}}

Amino acids are the structural units (monomers) that make up proteins. They join together to form short [[polymer]] chains called [[peptide]]s or longer chains called either [[polypeptides]] or [[protein]]s. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins is called ''[[translation (biology)|translation]]'' and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a [[ribozyme]] that is called a [[ribosome]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Rodnina MV, Beringer M, Wintermeyer W |title=How ribosomes make peptide bonds |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=20–6 |year=2007 |month=January |pmid=17157507 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2006.11.007}}</ref> The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the [[genetic code]] from an [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] template, which is a [[RNA]] copy of one of the organism's [[gene]]s.

Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called [[proteinogenic]] or natural amino acids.<ref name="Creighton" /> Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal [[genetic code]]. The remaining 2, [[selenocysteine]] and [[pyrrolysine]], are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. [[Selenocysteine]] is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a [[SECIS element]], which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a [[stop codon]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Driscoll DM, Copeland PR |title=Mechanism and regulation of selenoprotein synthesis |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=23 |issue= 1|pages=17–40 |year=2003 |pmid=12524431 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.23.011702.073318}}</ref> [[Pyrrolysine]] is used by some [[methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in enzymes that they use to produce [[methane]].

Aside from the 22 standard amino acids, there are many other amino acids that are called ''non-proteinogenic'' or ''non-standard''. Those either are not found in proteins (for example [[carnitine]], [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]), or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, [[hydroxyproline]] and [[selenomethionine]]).

Non-standard amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by [[post-translational modification]], which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein; for example, the [[carboxylation]] of [[glutamate]] allows for better binding of [[calcium in biology|calcium cations]],<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Vermeer C |title=Gamma-carboxyglutamate-containing proteins and the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase |journal=The Biochemical Journal |volume=266 |issue=3 |pages=625–36 |year=1990 |month=March |pmid=2183788 |pmc=1131186}}</ref> and the [[hydroxylation]] of [[proline]] is critical for maintaining [[collagen|connective tissues]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Bhattacharjee A, Bansal M |title=Collagen structure: the Madras triple helix and the current scenario |journal=IUBMB Life |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=161–72 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=16036578 |doi=10.1080/15216540500090710}}</ref> Another example is the formation of [[hypusine]] in the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|translation initiation factor]] [[EIF5A]], through modification of a lysine residue.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Park MH |title=The post-translational synthesis of a polyamine-derived amino acid, hypusine, in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) |journal=Journal of Biochemistry |volume=139 |issue=2 |pages=161–9 |year=2006 |month=February |pmid=16452303 |pmc=2494880 |doi=10.1093/jb/mvj034}}</ref> Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a [[phospholipid]] membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Blenis J, Resh MD |title=Subcellular localization specified by protein acylation and phosphorylation |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=984–9 |year=1993 |month=December |pmid=8129952 |doi=10.1016/0955-0674(93)90081-Z}}</ref>

===Non-protein functions===
{{further|Amino acid neurotransmitter}}

In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as [[metabolic intermediate]]s, such as in the biosynthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-amino-butyric acid]] (GABA). Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:

These include [[nucleophilic addition]], [[amide|amide bond]] formation and [[Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution|imine formation]] for the amine group and [[esterification]], [[amide|amide bond]] formation and [[decarboxylation]] for the carboxylic acid group.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Elmore, Donald Trevor; Barrett, G.

The multiple side-chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Gutteridge A, Thornton JM |title=Understanding nature's catalytic toolkit |journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=622–9 |year=2005 |month=November |pmid=16214343 |doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2005.09.006}}</ref> The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side-chains and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.

===Chemical synthesis===
{{Main|Peptide synthesis}}
Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids. One of the oldest methods begins with the [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation|bromination]] at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with [[ammonia]] then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McMurry |first=John |title=Organic chemistry |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, CA, USA |year=1996 |page=1064 |isbn=0-534-23832-7}}</ref> In alternative fashion, the [[Strecker amino acid synthesis]] involves the treatment of an aldehyde with [[potassium cyanide]] and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate.

At the current time, the most-adopted method is an [[automated]] synthesis on a solid support (e.g., [[polystyrene]] beads), using [[protecting group]]s (e.g., [[Fmoc chloride|Fmoc]] and [[Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate|t-Boc]]) and activating groups (e.g., [[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide|DCC]] and [[diisopropylcarbodiimide|DIC]]).

===Peptide bond formation===
{{Details|Peptide bond}}
[[File:Peptidformationball.svg|thumbnail|right|400px|The condensation of two amino acids to form a ''[[dipeptide]]'' through a ''[[peptide bond]]''|alt=Two amino acids are shown next to each other. One loses a hydrogen and oxygen from its carboxyl group (COOH) and the other loses a hydrogen from its amino group (NH2). This reaction produces a molecule of water (H2O) and two amino acids joined by a peptide bond (-CO-NH-). The two joined amino acids are called a dipeptide.]]

As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This [[polymerization]] of amino acids is what creates proteins. This [[condensation reaction]] yields the newly formed [[peptide bond]] and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a [[transfer RNA]] molecule through an [[ester]] bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent reaction carried out by an [[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Ibba M, Söll D |title=The renaissance of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=382–7 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11375928 |pmc=1083889 |doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kve095 |doi_brokendate=2010-02-18 |url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v2/n5/full/embor420.html}}</ref> This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the [[ribosome]], which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Lengyel P, Söll D |title=Mechanism of protein biosynthesis |journal=Bacteriological Reviews |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=264–301 |year=1969 |month=June |pmid=4896351 |pmc=378322 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=4896351}}</ref> As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving towards their C-terminus.

However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide [[glutathione]] is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Wu G, Fang YZ, Yang S, Lupton JR, Turner ND |title=Glutathione metabolism and its implications for health |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=489–92 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=14988435 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=14988435}}</ref> In the first step [[gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase]] condenses [[cysteine]] and [[glutamic acid]] through a peptide bond formed between the side-chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side-chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with [[glycine]] by [[glutathione synthetase]] to form glutathione.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Meister A |title=Glutathione metabolism and its selective modification |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=263 |issue=33 |pages=17205–8 |year=1988 |month=November |pmid=3053703 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=3053703}}</ref>

In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in [[peptide synthesis|solid-phase peptide synthesis]] uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Louis A. |last1=Carpino |year=1992 |title=1-Hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole.

===Biosynthesis===
In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of [[glutamate]], formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses [[transaminase]]s to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Jones, Russell Celyn; Buchanan, Bob B.; Gruissem, Wilhelm |title=Biochemistry & molecular biology of plants |publisher=American Society of Plant Physiologists |location=Rockville, Md |year=2000 |pages=371–2 |isbn=0-943088-39-9}}</ref> Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.

Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, [[homocysteine]] is formed through the [[transsulfuration pathway]] or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite [[S-adenosyl methionine]],<ref name="Brosnan">{{Cite journal|author=Brosnan JT, Brosnan ME |title=The sulfur-containing amino acids: an overview |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=136 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1636S–1640S |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16702333 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16702333}}</ref> while [[hydroxyproline]] is made by a [[posttranslational modification]] of [[proline]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Kivirikko KI, Pihlajaniemi T |title=Collagen hydroxylases and the protein disulfide isomerase subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylases |journal=Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology |volume=72 |issue= |pages=325–98 |year=1998 |pmid=9559057}}</ref>

[[Microorganism]]s and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make [[2-aminoisobutyric acid]] and [[lanthionine]], which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic [[lantibiotics]] such as [[alamethicin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Whitmore L, Wallace BA |title=Analysis of peptaibol sequence composition: implications for in vivo synthesis and channel formation |journal=European Biophysics Journal |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=233–7 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=14534753 |doi=10.1007/s00249-003-0348-1}}</ref> While in plants, [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone [[ethylene#Ethylene as a plant hormone|ethylene]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Alexander L, Grierson D |title=Ethylene biosynthesis and action in tomato: a model for climacteric fruit ripening |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=53 |issue=377 |pages=2039–55 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12324528 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erf072}}</ref>

===Catabolism===
[[File:Amino acid catabolism revised.png|thumb|300px|Catabolism of proteinogenic amino acids. Amino acids can be classified according to the properties of their main products as either of the following:<ref>Stipanuk, M. H. (2006). Biochemical, physiological, & molecular aspects of human nutrition (2 ed.): Saunders Elsevier.</ref>
<br>* ''Glucogenic'', with the products having the ability to form [[glucose]] by [[gluconeogenesis]]
<br>* ''Ketogenic'', with the products not having the ability to form glucose. These products may still be used for [[ketogenesis]] or [[lipid synthesis]].
<br>* Amino acids catabolized into both glucogenic and ketogenic products.]]
Degradation of an amino acid often involves [[deamination]] by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the [[urea cycle]] and is excreted in the form of [[urea]]. However, amino acid degradation can produce [[uric acid]] or ammonia instead. For example, [[serine dehydratase]] converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Stryer, Lubert; Berg, Jeremy Mark; Tymoczko, John L. |title=Biochemistry |publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2002 |pages=639–49 |isbn=0-7167-4684-0}}</ref> After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering [[glycolysis]] or the [[citric acid cycle]], as detailed in image at right.

==Physicochemical properties of amino acids==
The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, [[hydrophile|hydrophilicity]] or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], size, and functional groups.<ref name="Creighton" /> These properties are important for [[protein structure]] and [[protein–protein interaction]]s. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side-chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. The [[integral membrane protein]]s tend to have outer rings of exposed [[hydrophobic]] amino acids that anchor them into the [[lipid bilayer]]. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some [[peripheral membrane protein]]s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like [[lysine]] and [[arginine]]. There are different [[hydrophobicity scale]]s of amino acid residues.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Dan W. |last1=Urry |title=The change in Gibbs free energy for hydrophobic association: Derivation and evaluation by means of inverse temperature transitions |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=399 |issue=1–3 |pages=177–83 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(04)01565-9}}</ref>

Some amino acids have special properties such as [[cysteine]], that can form covalent [[disulfide bond]]s to other cysteine residues, [[proline]] that forms [[cyclic compound|a cycle]] to the polypeptide backbone, and [[glycine]] that is more flexible than other amino acids.

Many proteins undergo a range of [[posttranslational modification]]s, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic [[lipoprotein]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Magee T, Seabra MC |title=Fatty acylation and prenylation of proteins: what's hot in fat |journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=190–6 |year=2005 |month=April |pmid=15780596 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2005.02.003}}</ref> or hydrophilic [[glycoprotein]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Pilobello KT, Mahal LK |title=Deciphering the glycocode: the complexity and analytical challenge of glycomics |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=300–5 |year=2007 |month=June |pmid=17500024 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2007.05.002}}</ref> These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid [[palmitic acid]] to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Smotrys JE, Linder ME |title=Palmitoylation of intracellular signaling proteins: regulation and function |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |volume=73 |issue= 1|pages=559–87 |year=2004 |pmid=15189153 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073954}}</ref>

Bortezomib is [[pyrazinoic acid|Pyz]]-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is [[Carboxybenzyl|Z]]-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure, [[photo-reactive amino acid analog]]s are available.
