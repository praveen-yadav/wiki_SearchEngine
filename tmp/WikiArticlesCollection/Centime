'''Centime''' (from Latin ''centesimus'') is [[French language|French]] for "[[Cent (currency)|cent]]", and is used in English as the name of the fraction [[currency]] in several [[Francophone]] [[country|countries]] (including [[Switzerland]], [[Algeria]], [[Belgium]], [[Morocco]] and [[France]]).

In France the usage of ''centime'' goes back to the introduction of the [[decimal currency|decimal monetary system]] under [[Napoleon]]. This system aimed at replacing non-decimal fractions of older coins. A five-centime coin was known as a ''sou'', i.e. a [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] or [[shilling]].

Conversely in [[francophone]] [[Canada]], one hundredth of a [[Canadian dollar]] is informally called a ''[[Penny (Canadian coin)|sou]]'' (penny), though ''cent'' is official in both English and French.

==Subdivision of euro: cent or centime?==
In the European community ''cent'' is the official name for one hundredth of a [[euro]]. However, in French-speaking countries the word ''centime '' is the preferred term. Indeed, the [[Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Belgium)|Superior Council of the French language]] of Belgium recommended in 2001 the use of ''centime'', since ''cent'' is also the French word for "hundred". An analogous decision was published in the ''[[Journal officiel]]'' in France (December 2, 1997).

In Morocco, [[dirham]]s are divided into 100 ''centime''s and one may find prices in the country quoted in ''centime''s rather than in dirhams. Sometimes ''centime''s are known as francs or in [[Spanish Morocco|former Spanish areas]], [[pesetas]].
