'''Casuistry''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|ʒ|uː|ɨ|s|t|r|i}}, or [[case-based reasoning]], is a method in [[applied ethics]] and [[jurisprudence]], often characterised as a critique of [[principle]]- or rule-based reasoning.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-35 "Casuistry", ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'']. University of Virginia Library. Online.</ref> The word "casuistry" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''casus'' (meaning "case").

Casuistry is reasoning used to resolve moral problems by extracting or extending theoretical rules from particular instances and applying these rules to new instances. The term is also commonly used as a pejorative to criticize the use of clever but unsound reasoning (alleging implicitly the inconsistent&mdash;or outright specious&mdash;misapplication of rule to instance), especially in relation to moral questions (see [[sophistry]]).

The agreed meaning of "casuistry" is in flux. The term can be used either to describe a presumably acceptable form of reasoning or a form of reasoning that is inherently unsound and deceptive. Most or all [[Specialized dictionary|philosophical dictionaries]] list the neutral sense as the first or only definition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Runes|first=Dagobert D.|title=Dictionary of Philsophy|url=http://www.ditext.com/runes/c.html|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy Pages|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/c.htm#casu|work=Casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Philosophy-Dictionary.org|url=http://www.philosophy-dictionary.org/casuistry|work=casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> On the other hand, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that the word "[o]ften (and perhaps originally) applied to a quibbling or evasive way of dealing with difficult cases of duty." Its textual references, except for certain technical usages, are consistently pejorative ("Casuistry‥destroys by Distinctions and Exceptions, all Morality, and effaces the essential Difference between Right and Wrong").<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com+28642?redirectedFrom=casuistry#eid|work="Casuistry"|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> Most online dictionaries list a pejorative meaning as the primary definition before a neutral one,<ref>{{cite web|title=American Heritage Dictionary|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=casuistry|work=Casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/casuistry|work=Casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CollinsLanguage.com|url=http://www.collinslanguage.com/results.aspx?context=3&reversed=False&action=define&homonym=0&text=casuistry|work=Casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> though Merriam-Webster lists the neutral one first.<ref>{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/casuistry|work=casuistry|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref>

==Examples==
While a principle-based approach might claim that [[lie|lying]] is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, depending upon the details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude that a person is wrong to lie in legal [[testimony]] under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. ([[Thomas Sanchez]] and others thus theorized a [[doctrine of mental reservation]], which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.

Typically, casuistic reasoning begins with a clear-cut [[paradigm]]atic case. In legal reasoning, for example, this might be a [[precedent]] case, such as premeditated murder. From it, the casuist would ask how closely the given case currently under consideration matches the paradigmatic case. Cases like the paradigmatic case ought to be treated likewise; cases unlike the paradigm ought to be treated differently. Thus, a man is properly charged with premeditated murder if the circumstances surrounding his case closely resemble the exemplar premeditated murder case. The less a given case is like the paradigm, the weaker the justification is for treating that case ''like'' the paradigmatic case.

==Meanings==
Casuistry is a ''method'' of case reasoning especially useful in treating cases that involve moral dilemmas. It is also a branch of [[applied ethics]]. Casuistry is the basis of [[case law]] in [[common law]], and the standard form of reasoning applied in common law.

==Casuist morality==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}

Casuistry takes a relentlessly practical approach to morality. Rather than using theories as starting points, casuistry begins with an examination of cases. By drawing parallels between [[paradigm]]s, or so-called "pure cases", and the case at hand, a casuist tries to determine a moral response appropriate to a particular case.

Casuistry has been described as "theory modest" (Arras, see below). One of the strengths of casuistry is that it does not begin with, nor does it overemphasize, theoretical issues. It does not require practitioners to agree about ethical theories or evaluations before making policy. Instead, they can agree that certain [[paradigm]]s should be treated in certain ways, and then agree on the similarities, the so-called warrants between a paradigm and the case at hand.

Since most people, and most cultures, substantially agree about most pure ethical situations, casuistry often creates ethical arguments that can persuade people of different ethnic, religious and philosophical beliefs to treat particular cases in the same ways. For this reason, casuistry is widely considered to be the basis for the [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and its derivatives.

Casuistry is prone to abuses wherever the analogies between cases [[False analogy|are false]].

==History==
The history of casuistry begins in Sumer with the [[Code of Ur-Nammu|the Code of Ur-Nammu]], the world's oldest extant law code. Written during the [[Ur III|Sumerian Renaissance]] either by King [[Ur-Nammu]] himself or by his successor, [[Shulgi|Šulgi]], the [[Sumerian Language]] Code has a basic "IF X, THEN Y" structure at its core, thus beginning the enduring tradition of case-based reasoning in most legal traditions that continues to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anciet Practices: Code of Ur-Nammu|url=http://hermeneutical.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/ur-nammu/|publisher=Wordpress Foundation}}</ref>

Western casuistry dates from [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), yet the zenith of casuistry was from 1550 to 1650, when the [[Society of Jesus]] used case-based reasoning, particularly in administering the [[Sacrament of Penance]] (or "confession").<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Franklin |title=The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2001 |pages=83–88}}</ref> The term ''casuistry'' quickly became pejorative with [[Blaise Pascal]]'s attack on the misuse of casuistry. In ''[[Provincial Letters]]'' (1656–7)<ref>{{cite book |first=Blaise |last=Pascal |title=The Provincial Letters of Blaise Pascal |others=M'Crie, Thomas (trans.) |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |year=1898 |origyear=1657 |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/ |series=eBooks@Adelaide}}</ref> he scolded the Jesuits for using casuistic reasoning in confession to placate wealthy Church donors, while punishing poor penitents. Pascal charged that aristocratic penitents could confess their sins one day, re-commit the sin the next day, generously donate the following day, then return to re-confess their sins and only receive the lightest punishment; Pascal's criticisms darkened casuistry's reputation.

It was not until publication of ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'' (1988), by Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]],<ref>Albert Jonsen and [[Stephen Toulmin]], ''The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning'', Berkeley, U. California Press (1990, ISBN 0-520-06960-9).</ref> that a revival of casuistry occurred. They argue that the abuse of casuistry is the problem, not casuistry ''per se'' (itself an example of casuistic reasoning). Properly used, casuistry is powerful reasoning. Jonsen and Toulmin offer casuistry in dissolving the contradictory tenets of [[moral absolutism]] and the common secular [[moral relativism]]: "the form of reasoning constitutive of classical casuistry is rhetorical reasoning".<ref>Jonsen, 1991, p. 297.</ref> Moreover, the ethical philosophies of [[Utilitarianism]] (especially [[preference utilitarianism]]) and [[Pragmatism]] commonly are identified as greatly employing casuistic reasoning.

==Casuistry in early modern times==
The casuistic method was popular among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] thinkers in the early modern period, and not only among the [[Jesuits]], as it is commonly thought. Famous casuistic authors include [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza]], whose ''Summula casuum conscientiae'' (1627) enjoyed a great success, [[Thomas Sanchez]], [[Vincenzo Filliucci]] (Jesuit and [[Apostolic Penitentiary|penitentiary]] at [[St Peter]]'s), [[Antonino Diana]], [[Paul Laymann]] (''Theologia Moralis'', 1625), [[John Azor]] (''Institutiones Morales'', 1600), [[Etienne Bauny]], [[Louis Cellot]], [[Valerius Reginaldus]], [[Hermann Busembaum]] (d. 1668), etc. One of the main theses of casuists was the necessity to adapt the rigorous morals of the [[Church Fathers|Early Fathers]] of [[Christianity]] to modern morals, which led in some extreme cases to justify what [[Innocent XI]] later called "laxist moral" (i.e. justification of [[usury]], [[homicide]], [[regicide]], [[lie|lying]] through "[[Doctrine of mental reservation|mental reservation]]", [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality|adultery and loss of virginity before marriage]], etc.—all due cases registered by [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] in the ''[[Provincial Letters]]'').

The progress of casuistry was interrupted toward the middle of the 17th century by the controversy which arose concerning the [[Catholic probabilism|doctrine of probabilism]], which stipulated that one could choose to follow a "probable opinion", that is, supported by a theologian or another, even if it contradicted a more probable opinion or a quotation from one of the [[Fathers of the Church]].<ref>Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', p. 74–6, 83.</ref> The controversy divided Catholic theologians into two camps, Rigorists and Laxists.

Casuistry was much mistrusted by early [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant theologians]], because it justified many of the abuses that they sought to reform. It was famously attacked by the Catholic and [[Jansenist]] philosopher [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], during the [[formulary controversy]] against the Jesuits, in his [[Lettres provinciales|Provincial Letters]] as the use of [[rhetorics]] to justify moral laxity, which became identified by the public with [[Jesuitism]]; hence the everyday use of the term to mean complex and [[sophist]]ic reasoning to justify moral laxity.<ref>170 "Casuistry..destroys, by distinctions and exceptions, all morality, and effaces the essential difference between right and wrong." Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, ''Letters on the Spirit of Patriotism 1736'' (pub. 1749), quoted in Oxford English Dictionary, 1989 ed.</ref> By the mid-18th century, "casuistry" had become a synonym for moral laxity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In 1679 [[Pope Innocent&nbsp;XI]] publicly condemned sixty-five of the more radical propositions (''stricti mentalis''), taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, [[Francisco Suarez|Suarez]] and other casuists as ''propositiones laxorum moralistarum'' and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of [[excommunication]].<ref>Kelly, J.N.D., The Oxford History of the Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. ISBN 0-19-282085-0 (p. 287).</ref> Despite this papal condemnation, both Catholicism and Protestantism permit the use of ambiguous and equivocal statements in specific circumstances.<ref>J.-P. Cavaillé, ''[http://dossiersgrihl.revues.org/document281.html Ruser sans mentir, de la casuistique aux sciences sociales: le recours à l’équivocité, entre efficacité pragmatique et souci éthique]'', in [[Serge Latouche]], P.-J.

Une perspective anthropologique et psychanalytique'', Actes du colloque international «La raison rusée», Louvain la Neuve, mars 2001, Paris, La Découverte, 2004, pp. 93–118 {{Fr icon}}.</ref>

[[Alphonsus Maria de Liguori]] (d.&nbsp;1787), founder of the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer]], then brought some attention back to casuistry by publishing again Hermann Busembaum's ''Medulla Theologiae Moralis''; the last edition published in 1785 and receiving the approbation of the [[Holy See]] in 1803.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Busembaum's ''Medulla'' had been burnt in Toulouse in 1757 because of its justification of [[regicide]], deemed particularly scandalous after [[Robert-François Damiens|Damiens]]' assassination attempt against [[Louis XV]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Casuistry in modern times==
[[George Edward Moore|G.&nbsp;E. Moore]] dealt with casuistry in chapter 1.4 of his ''[[Principia Ethica]]'', in which he claims that "the defects of casuistry are not defects of principle; no objection can be taken to its aim and object. It has failed only because it is far too difficult a subject to be treated adequately in our present state of knowledge". Furthermore, he asserted that "casuistry is the goal of ethical investigation. It cannot be safely attempted at the beginning of our studies, but only at the end".<ref>{{cite book

Since the 1960s, [[applied ethics]] has revived the ideas of casuistry in applying ethical reasoning to particular cases in [[law]], [[bioethics]], and [[business ethics]], so the reputation of casuistry is somewhat rehabilitated.
