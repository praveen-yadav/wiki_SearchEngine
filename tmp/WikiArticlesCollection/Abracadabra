{{About|an incantational word}}
'''''Abracadabra'''''  is an [[incantation]] used as a [[magic word]] in [[stage magic]] tricks, and historically was believed to have healing powers when inscribed on an [[amulet]]. The word is thought to have{{weasel inline|date=September 2013}} its origin in the [[Aramaic language]], but numerous conflicting folk etymologies are associated with it. 
Many{{weasel inline|date=September 2013}} consider that the word “Abracadabra” is actually a Hebrew phrase meaning “I create (A’bra) what (ca) I speak (dab’ra).” "[A]bracadabra comprises the abbreviated forms of the Hebrew words ''Ab'' (Father), ''Ben'' (Son) and ''Ruach A Cadsch'' (Holy Spirit), though an alternative derivation relates the word to Abraxas, a god with snakes for feet who was worshipped in Alexandria in pre-Christian times." (''Dictionary of Superstitions'',David Pickering,Cassell Wellington House, 1995,1).

==History==
The first known mention of the word was in the third century AD in a book called ''Liber Medicinalis'' (sometimes known as  ''De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima'') by [[Serenus Sammonicus|Quintus Serenus Sammonicus]],<ref name="Vollmer">Vollmer, Friedrich. ''Quinti Sereni Liber Medicinalis''. Leipzig: Teubner, 1916, chap.

The power of the amulet, he explained, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Alexander Severus]], were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.<ref name="Vollmer" />{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

It was used as a [[magical formula]] by the [[Gnostic]]s of the sect of [[Basilides]] in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abracadabra}}</ref> It is found on [[Abraxas stones]] which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.

The Puritan minister [[Increase Mather]] dismissed the word as bereft of power. [[Daniel Defoe]] also wrote dismissively about Londoners who posted the word on their doorways to ward off sickness during the [[Great Plague of London]].<ref>Daniel Defoe.

The word is now commonly used as an [[incantation]] by stage magicians. It is also applied [[contempt]]uously to a conception or hypothesis which purports to be a simple solution of apparently insoluble phenomena.

===In games===
In the [[Nintendo]]/[[GameFreak]] video game franchise [[Pokémon]], there are three creatures in the same evolutionary chain named [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam]] (the third of which is also an alleged magic word used by stage magicians).

===In literature===
The incantation ''[[List of spells in Harry Potter#Avada Kedavra .28Killing_Curse.29|Avada Kedavra]]'' is known as the [[Killing Curse]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novel series. During an audience interview at the [[Edinburgh Book Festival]] on 15 April 2004, series author [[J. K. Rowling]] had this to say about the fictional Killing Curse's etymology: "Does anyone know where avada kedavra came from? It is an ancient spell in Aramaic, and it is the original of abracadabra, which means 'let the thing be destroyed.' Originally, it was used to cure illness and the 'thing' was the illness, but I decided to make it the 'thing' as in the person standing in front of me. I take a lot of liberties with things like that. I twist them round and make them mine.

However, the actual meaning of Abracadabra is not hidden from those who have a little idea about Semitic languages. Abra is basically a form of word with suffix A- indicating a command. Bara is a verb meaning to make. Genesis starts with the same verb Bareshet Bara Elohim. Where Bara means to make (a verbal form). Hibra which is Hithpael means to make fat. So therefore ABRA means "Make!" which is a command. Ka is an adjective that means "like". For example Ka David "Like David". Navi Ka Moshe "Prophet like Moses". Malach ka Sholomo "King like Solomon". In Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic, Ka joins the verb or noun it precedes. DABARA is again a verb that means "to speak". Whereas Dabra is a higher form of verb where person that spoke or did it (like first/second/third) is not signified. Book of Prophet Jeremiah starts with Davarem Yaramiah meaning (words of Jeremiah). Dever means word and Devrem means words (plural form). Verb Debra means to speak or to say. So Kadabra means "Like (it is) said". There for Abracadabra or Avra ka Davra (Abra kadabra) means Make what has been said! It is expression of divinity and one of the attributes of a deity who is capable of commanding the Spirits or Angels to make what he has uttered. In Islam, word KUN (meaning "be it" or "become") has same logic behind it. Abra ka Dabra is a magical formula that was always used by the Alchemists and Kabbalists to invoke and command the spirits of different orders after subduing them.
