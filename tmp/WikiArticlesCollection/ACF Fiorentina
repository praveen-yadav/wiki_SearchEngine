'''ACF Fiorentina''',<ref name="fiorentina_society" /><ref name="fiorentina_society_legacalcio" /> commonly referred to as simply '''Fiorentina''', is a professional [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] club from [[Florence]], Tuscany. Founded by a merger in 1926 (refounded in 2002 following bankruptcy), Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more Serie A seasons.

Fiorentina have won two [[List of Italian football champions|Italian Championships]], in [[Serie A 1955–56|1955–56]] and again in [[Serie A 1968–69|1968–69]], as well as winning six [[Coppa Italia]] trophies and one [[Italian Super Cup]]. On the [[UEFA|European stage]], Fiorentina won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960–61]] and lost the final one year later. They finished runners-up in the [[1956–57 European Cup]], losing against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and also came close to winning the [[UEFA Cup]], finishing as runners-up in the [[1989–90 UEFA Cup|1989–90]] season.

Since 1931, the club have played at the [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]], which currently has a capacity of 47,282. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname ''Viola'', a reference to their distinctive purple colours.

==History==
{{details|History of ACF Fiorentina}}

===Foundation to World War II===
'''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina''' was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and [[National Fascist Party]] member Luigi Ridolfi,<ref name="Martin">{{cite book | last = Martin | first = Simon| title =Football and Fascism: The National Game Under Mussolini| publisher = Berg Publishers| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LSOmTCa8g50C&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=fiorentina+Luigi+Ridolfi+fascist&source=web&ots=-TY6RPJtWP&sig=plBjFJCYajFpO1RG3DF128PVB7E&hl=en| isbn = 1-85973-705-6}}</ref> who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs, [[C.S. Firenze|CS Firenze]] and [[P.G. Libertas|PG Libertas]]. The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant [[Italian Football Championship]] sides of the time from [[Northern Italy|Northwest Italy]]. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of ''[[Calcio Fiorentino]]'', an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the [[Medici]] family.<ref name="Martin"/>

After a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, Fiorentina reached the Serie A in 1931. That same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named Giovanni Berta, after a prominent fascist, but now known as ''[[Stadio Artemio Franchi (Florence)|Stadio Artemio Franchi]]''. At the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. In order to be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the [[Uruguay]]an [[Pedro Petrone]], nicknamed ''el Artillero''. Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941 they won their first [[Coppa Italia]], but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles.

===First ''scudetto'' and '50–'60s===
[[File:Fiorentina scudetto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The first Italian champion Fiorentina]]
In 1950, Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. The team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper [[Giuliano Sarti]], [[Sergio Cervato]], Francesco Rosella, [[Guido Gratton]], [[Giuseppe Chiappella]] and Aldo Scaramucci but above all, the attacking duo of Brazilian [[Júlio Botelho|Julinho]] and Argentinian [[Miguel Montuori]]. This team won Fiorentina's first ''[[scudetto]]'' (Italian championship) in [[1955–56 Serie A|1955–56]], 12 points ahead of second-place [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of  [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]]'s [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].
Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the [[1960–61 Serie A|1960–61]] season the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first [[Cup Winners' Cup]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

After several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from fourth to sixth place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the [[Mitropa Cup]] in 1966.

===Second ''scudetto'' and '70s===
[[File:Antognoni.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Giancarlo Antognoni]], former captain of Fiorentina]]
While the 1960s did result in some trophies and good [[Serie A]] finishes for Fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. The [[1968–69 Serie A|1968–69 season]] started with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] as frontrunners, but on match day 7, they lost to [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and were overtaken by [[Gigi Riva]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]]. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the [[Serie A]], but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against [[A.S. Varese 1910|Varese]], leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari, and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in [[Turin]] on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the [[Soviet Union]] against [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in [[Glasgow]] to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

''Viola'' players began the 1970s decade with ''Scudetto'' sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a fifth place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The ''Viola'' did win the [[Anglo-Italian League Cup]] in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all [[Giancarlo Antognoni]], who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans. The young average age of the players led to the team being called ''Fiorentina Ye-Ye''.

===Pontello era===
[[File:Fiorentina-Circle-Logo.png|thumb|left|125px|The new team logo of the period]]
In 1980, Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, who came from a rich house-building family. He quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as [[Francesco Graziani]] and [[Eraldo Pecci]] from [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]; [[Daniel Bertoni]] from [[Sevilla FC]]; [[Daniele Massaro]] from [[A.C. Monza Brianza 1912|Monza]]; and a young [[Pietro Vierchowod]] from [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]]. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in [[1981–82 Serie A|1982]], Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season when Fiorentina were denied a goal against [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.

The following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, ''El Puntero'' [[Ramón Díaz]] and, most significantly, the young [[Roberto Baggio]].

In 1990, Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] final, where they again faced Juventus. The Turin team won the trophy, but Fiorentina's ''[[tifosi]]'' once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in [[Avellino]] (Fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with a lot of Juventus' fans, and emerging star Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final. Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in [[Florence]]'s streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker [[Mario Cecchi Gori]].

===Cecchi Gori era: from Champions League to bankruptcy===
[[File:Gabriel batistuta.jpg|thumb|175x175px|
[[Gabriel Batistuta]], the most prominent Fiorentina player of the 1990s]]
The first season under Cecchi Gori's ownership was one of stabilization, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like [[Brian Laudrup]], [[Stefan Effenberg]], [[Francesco Baiano]] and, most importantly, [[Gabriel Batistuta]], who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, [[Vittorio Cecchi Gori|Vittorio]]. Despite a good start to the season, Cecchi Gori fired the coach, [[Luigi Radice]], after a defeat against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]],<ref>[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/gennaio/04/Fiorentina_caduta_sugli_allori_co_0_9301043372.shtml From Corriere della Sera of 5 January 1993]</ref> and replaced him with [[Aldo Agroppi]]. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.

[[Claudio Ranieri]] was brought in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year, Fiorentina dominated [[Serie B]], Italy's second division. Upon their return to [[Serie A]], Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent [[Rui Costa]] from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and the new world champion Brazilian defender [[Márcio Roberto dos Santos|Márcio Santos]]. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. The ''Viola'' finished the season in 10th place.

The following season, Cecchi Gori bought other important players, namely [[Stefan Schwarz]]. The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia against Atalanta and finishing joint-third in Serie A. In the summer, Fiorentina became the first non-national champions to win the [[Supercoppa Italiana]], defeating [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] 2–1 at the [[San Siro]].

Fiorentina's 1995–96 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the [[Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-final by beating [[Gloria Bistrita]], [[Sparta Prague]], and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, [[FC Barcelona]] (Away 1–1, Home 0–2). The season's main signings were [[Luís Oliveira]] and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]], the latter of whom suffered a lot of injuries.

At the end of the season, Ranieri left Fiorentina for [[Valencia CF]] in Spain and Cecchi Gori appointed [[Alberto Malesani]]. Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by [[Giovanni Trapattoni]]. With Trapattoni's expert guidance and Batistuta's goals, Fiorentina challenged for the title in [[1998–99 Serie A|1998–99]] but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. The following year was disappointing in Serie A, but ''Viola'' played some historical matches in the Champions League, beating [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1–0 at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2–0 in Florence. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.

At the end of the season, Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by [[Turkey|Turkish]] coach [[Fatih Terim]]. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01]] and stayed in the top half of Serie A, despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of [[Roberto Mancini]]. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.

The year 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around USD 50 million. The club's owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02]] season and went into judicially controlled administration in June 2002. This form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the [[2002–03 Serie A|2002–03]] season, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.

===The 2000s: Della Valle era===
The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as '''Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola''' with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner and the club was admitted into [[Serie C2]], the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was [[Angelo Di Livio]], whose commitment to club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker [[Christian Riganò]], the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to [[Serie C1]]. Due to the bizarre ''[[Calcio_Catania#Decline_and_revival|Caso Catania]]'' (Catania Case), however, the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into [[Serie B]], something that was only made possible by the [[Italian Football Federation]]'s decision to resolve the [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for "sports merits."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2003/h/sezioni/sport/calcio/calciomercato/ventiquattro/ventiquattro/ventiquattro.html |publisher=La Repubblica |language=Italian |title=Serie B a 24 squadre. C'è anche la Fiorentina |date=20 August 2003 |accessdate=4 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501051624/http://www.repubblica.it/2003/h/sezioni/sport/calcio/calciomercato/ventiquattro/ventiquattro/ventiquattro.html| archivedate= 1 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as '''ACF Fiorentina'''. The club finished the [[2003–04 Serie B|2003–04]] season in sixth place and won the [[Playoffs#Association football|playoff]] against [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] to return to top-flight football.

[[File:Cesare Prandelli.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Cesare Prandelli]], the club's longest-serving manager (2005–2010)]]

In their first season back in Serie A, however, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season on head-to-head record against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. In 2005, Della Valle decided to appoint [[Pantaleo Corvino]] as new sports director, followed by the appointment of [[Cesare Prandelli]] as head coach in [[2005–06 Serie A|the following season]]. The club made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably [[Luca Toni]] and [[Sébastien Frey]]. This drastic move earned them a fourth place finish with 74 points and a Champions League qualifying round ticket. Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since [[Antonio Valentin Angelillo]] in the [[1958–59 Serie A|1958–59]] season, for which he was awarded the [[European Golden Boot]]. On 14 July 2006, however, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the [[2006 Serie A scandal|2006 Serie A match fixing scandal]] and given a 12-point penalty. The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the 2006–07 season. The team's [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] place was also rescinded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5164194.stm|author=BBC|title=Italian trio relegated to Serie B | date=14 July 2006 | accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref> After the start of the season, Fiorentina's penalization was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts. In spite of this penalty, they managed to secure a place in the UEFA Cup.

Despite Toni's departure to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Fiorentina had a strong start to the [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08]] season and were tipped by Italian national team coach [[Marcello Lippi]], among others, as a surprise challenger for the ''[[Scudetto]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=472919|publisher=Goal.com|title=Lippi Tips Fiorentina For Surprise Scudetto Challenge|date=11 November 2007}}</ref> and although this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, the ''Viola'' managed to qualify for the Champions League. In Europe, the club reached the semi-final of the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where they were ultimately defeated by [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] on penalties. The [[2008–09 Serie A|2008–09 season]] continued this success, a fourth place finish assuring Fiorentina's spot in 2010's Champions League playoffs. Their European campaign was also similar to that of the previous run, relegated to the [[2008–09 UEFA Cup]] and were eliminated by [[AFC Ajax]] in the end.

In the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]], Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. In Europe, the team proved to be a surprise dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against [[Olympique Lyonnais]], they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] home and away). The ''Viola'' qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to the [[away goals rule]]. This was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by [[Tom Henning Øvrebø]], who allowed a clearly-offside goal for Bayern in the first leg. Bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the final. The incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Despite a good European run and reaching the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia, Fiorentina failed to qualify for Europe.

During this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as Chairman of Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentina's Vice-President until a permanent position could be filled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Fiorentina/24-09-2009/della-valle-si-dimesso--501388850534.shtml|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|title=Fiorentina senza presidente Della Valle si è dimesso|date=24 September 2009 |language=Italian}}</ref>

===The 2010s: Post-Prandelli Era===
In June 2010, the ''Viola'' bid farewell to long-time manager Prandelli (by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history), who was departing to coach the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]]. [[Calcio Catania|Catania]]'s young [[Siniša Mihajlović]] was appointed to replace him. Come the [[2010–11 Serie A|2010–11]] Serie A, despite not having the distraction of a European competition, Fiorentina spent the early weeks of the season in last place. This season was plagued with a widespread injury problems that saw most of the starting XI sidelined for significant portions of the year, particularly first-choice goalkeeper [[Sébastien Frey]], who ended his season early, and star man [[Stevan Jovetić]], who missed the season entirely. The team's form later improved and the ''Viola'' finished ninth.

In spite of pressures, Mihajlović remained at the helm for the [[2011–12 Serie A|2011–12 season]]. At this point pillars from the Prandelli era were allowed to leave, including [[Adrian Mutu]] and Sébastien Frey. With these apparent signs of decline, coupled with mediocre performances in the league, pressures were again mounting, as the club looked no closer of achieving the immediate post-Prandelli objective of returning to Europe. Following a 1–0 defeat to [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]] in November, Mihajlović was sacked and replaced by [[Delio Rossi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/07/sport/football/football-fiorentina-mihajlovic/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|title=Mihajlovic sacked as Fiorentina coach|date=7 November 2011}}</ref>

Supporters warmed to Rossi, but after a brief period of improvements, the ''Viola'' was again dragged down to battle the relegation dogfights. By early 2012, the team had also lost striker [[Alberto Gilardino]] and sporting director [[Pantaleo Corvino]]—the latter was sacked following a 0–5 home defeat to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. With top player [[Riccardo Montolivo]] set to leave on a Bosman in the summer, Fiorentina steadily moved away from their 2009 side. Despite poor records, their bid for survival was kept alive by a number of upset victories away from home, particularly at [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]—the latter was significant as it allowed Juventus to leapfrog Milan to the top of the table, where they remained for the remainder of the season. The lowest point of the campaign was the home game against [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]: trailing 0–2 within half an hour, manager Rossi decided to substitute midfielder [[Adem Ljajić]] early. The latter sarcastically applauded him in frustration, but Rossi retaliated by physical assault. Montolivo's second-half brace salvaged a point by making it 2–2, and the team was faced with needing one point to avoid the drop with only two matches to go. Despite the obvious crisis that would have resulted in firing a manager at this delicate stage, the club was forced to sack Rossi following the Ljajić incident.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17933945|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Fiorentina boss Delio Rossi sacked for attacking player|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> In the next match away at [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]] (who were also battling relegation), Fiorentina secured survival under caretaker manager [[Vincenzo Guerini]] by winning it 1–0 courtesy of a lone [[Alessio Cerci]] goal. They finished thirteenth.

====2012–13 season====

[[File:Vincenzo montella (1).JPG|thumb|160px|left|Current manager [[Vincenzo Montella]]]]

To engineer a resurrection, the Della Valle family invested heavily in the summer of 2012. Sporting director [[Daniele Prade]], appointed earlier as Corvino's successor, staged a major overhaul of the team's roster. Arrivals of particular note were new coach [[Vincenzo Montella]], goalkeeper [[Emiliano Viviano]], and a quartet of playmakers: [[Matías Fernández]], [[Borja Valero]], [[Alberto Aquilani]], and [[David Pizarro]]. The scale of the turnaround was so large that 17 out of the 26 senior players were new players, 9 of which are among the starting XI. By the end of the transfer window, only two players, Jovetić and [[Manuel Pasqual]], remained from the Champions League class of 2009.

The effects were immediate, as the Florentine side raced out of the gates, finishing the calendar year in joint third place. The January transfer window saw them secure the services of [[Villarreal CF]] striker [[Giuseppe Rossi]], the third Villarreal player signed during the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/seriea/story/giuseppe-rossi-completes-transfer-move-to-fiorentina-from-villarreal-010413|publisher=FOX Sports|title=Rossi completes move to Fiorentina|date=4 January 2012}}</ref> They finished the season in fourth place, agonizingly close to the final Champions League spot, which was won on the final day by Milan. La Viola will however compete in the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]], and have high hopes for improving on their impressive maiden season under Vincenzo Montella.

====2013–14 season====
So far during the summer of 2013 Fiorentina have continued strengthening the squad, adding former Spanish international [[Joaquín Sánchez|Joaquín]] from [[Málaga CF|Málaga]], as well as [[Marcos Alonso Mendoza|Marcos Alonso]], another Spaniard, from English Championship club [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. La Viola also added [[Oleksandr Pavlovych Yakovenko|Oleksandr Yakovenko]] from Belgian club [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], [[Marko Bakić]] from [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] and [[Gustavo Munúa]] from [[Levante UD|Levante]]. Returning from loans are [[Mattia Cassani]], [[Juan Manuel Vargas]], and [[Rubén Olivera]]. Fiorentina also signed star striker [[Mario Gómez]] from [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] for €20 million, while losing [[Stevan Jovetić]] to Premier League club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. [[Luca Toni]] also left the club, for Serie A newcomers [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]]. [[Haris Seferović]] was sold to [[Real Sociedad]] in [[La Liga]]. 

Fiorentina will start their Europa League campaign in the play-off round, having finished 4th in Serie A the previous season.

===Badge===
[[File:Fleur de lis of Florence.svg|thumb|100px|The badge used by Florentia Viola]]
The official emblem of the city of [[Florence]], a red [[fleur-de-lis]] on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.

Over the course of the club's history, they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated Florence's fleur-de-lis in some way.<ref name="logo">{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofilnew.php?ID=3001|publisher=Weltfussballarchiv.com|title=ACF Fiorentina|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylized fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about twenty years, had been a white [[lozenge]] with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the ''[[scudetto]]''.

The logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting of one-half of the city of Florence's emblem and one-half of the letter "F", for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a [[halberd]] than a fleur-de-lis.<ref name="logo"/>

Today's logo is a kite shaped double [[lozenge]] bordered in gold. The outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters "AC" in white and the letter "F" in red, standing for the club's name. The inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of Florence.<ref name="logo">{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofil.php?ID=3001&lang=en|publisher=Weltfussballarchiv.com|title=ACF Fiorentina|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. Florence's ''[[comune]]'' instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylized coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of €2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.

===Kit and colours===
When Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/048/017/stemma.html|publisher=Comuni-Italiani|title=Stemma Comune di Firenze|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname ''La Viola'' ("The Purple (team)"). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070222090943AAkaMg8|publisher=Yahoo.it|title=Perchè a Firenze hanno una maglia color viola, che in tutta Italia è il colore del lutto?|date=24 June 2007}}</ref>

The away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first one in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two [[lily|lilies]] on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the [[Coppa Italia]], in 2000–01.
