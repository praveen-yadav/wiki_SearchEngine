'''Ambiorix''' was, together with [[Cativolcus]], prince of the [[Eburones]], leader of a [[Belgae|Belgic]] tribe of north-eastern [[Gaul]] ([[Gallia Belgica]]), where modern [[Belgium]] is located. In the 19th century Ambiorix became a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Folk hero|national hero]] because of his [[Resistance movement|resistance]] against [[Julius Caesar]], as written in Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''.<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Smith | first = William | authorlink = William Smith (lexicographer) | title = Ambiorix | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 138–139 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0147.html}}</ref>

==Early history==

In 57 BC Julius Caesar conquered [[Gaul]] and also [[Belgica]] (Belgium, modern-day Northern France, Luxembourg, part of present-day Netherlands below the [[Rhine]] River; and the north-western portion of North Rhine-Westfalia, Germany.) There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other regularly. The [[Eburones]] were ruled by Ambiorix and [[Catuvolcus]]. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food and thereby the local tribes were forced to give up part of their [[harvest]], which had not been good that year. Understandably the [[starving]] Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that [[Military camp|camps]] be built near the Eburones' villages. Each [[centurion]] was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[soldiers]]. This created resentment among the Eburones. 

Although [[Julius Caesar]] had freed him from paying tribute to the [[Atuatuci]], Ambiorix joined [[Catuvolcus]] in the winter of 54 BC in an uprising against the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] forces under [[Quintus Titurius Sabinus]] and [[Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta]].

==Resisting the Romans==
{{Main|Ambiorix's revolt}}

Because a drought had disrupted his grain supply, Caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious Belgic tribes. Roman troops, led by Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta were wintering among the Eburones when they are attacked by the Eburones, led by Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Ambiorix deceived the Romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as large Germanic force was preparing to cross the Rhine. Trusting Ambiorix, Sabinus and Cotta's troops leave the next morning. A short distance from their camp, the Roman troops were ambushed by the Eburones and massacred.

Elsewhere, another Roman force under Quintus Tullius Cicero, brother of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Marcus]], were wintering amongst the Nervii. Leading a coalition of rebellious Belgic tribes, Ambiorix surrounded Cicero's camp. After a long while, a Roman messenger was finally able to slip through the Belgic lines and get word of the uprising to Caesar. Mobilizing his legions, Caesar immediately marched to Cicero's aid. As they approached the besieged Roman camp, the Belgae moved to engage Caesar's troops. Vastly outnumbered, Caeser ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the Belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the Romans. Caesar's forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the Belgae to flight. Later, Caesar’s troops entered Cicero's camp to find most of the men wounded.

Meanwhile, Indutiomarus, a leader of the Treveri, began to harass the camp of Labienus on a daily basis, eventually provoking Labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill Indutiomarus. They do so, and rout the remnants of the late Indutiomarus's army. Caesar personally remained in Gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed Gallic threat.

==Caesar's revenge==

When the Roman [[Roman senate|Senate]] heard what happened, Caesar swore to put down all the Belgic tribes. It was very important that the other Roman provinces know that the almighty Roman republic couldn't be beaten so easily. After all, Ambiorix had killed a whole Roman [[Roman legion#Imperial legion|legion]] and five [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]]. A Belgic attack on [[Quintus Cicero]] (brother of the [[Cicero|orator]]), then stationed with a legion in the [[Nervii]]'s territory, failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar.  The Roman campaigns against the [[Belgae]] took a few years, but eventually the Belgae were no match against 50,000 trained Roman soldiers. The tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones were history from that point. According to the writer [[Florus]], Ambiorix and his men managed to cross the [[Rhine]] and disappear without a trace.<ref>[[Florus]], iii. 10. § 8</ref>

==Legacy==

Caesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls: "[[De Bello Gallico]]". In this text he also wrote the famous line: "Of these [three regions], the Belgae are the bravest." ("...&nbsp;Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae&nbsp;...").  

Ambiorix remained forgotten until the 19th century. When Belgium became independent in 1830 the national government started searching through their historical archives for persons who could serve as [[national heroes]]. In Caesar's "De Bello Gallico" they discovered Ambiorix and his deeds. In 1841 the Belgian [[poet]] Joannes Nolet de Brauwere Van Steeland wrote a [[lyric poetry|lyric]]al [[epic poetry|epic]] about Ambiorix and on September 5, 1866 a [[statue]] of Ambiorix was erected on the Great Market of [[Tongeren]] in [[Belgium]], as referenced by Caesar as [[Atuatuca]], meaning  ''Atuatuca Tongorum'', the Latin name of modern-day Tongeren.

Nowadays Ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in [[Belgium|Belgian]] history. Many companies, bars and [[friterie| fry stands]] have named themselves after him and in many Belgian [[comics]] such as [[Suske en Wiske]] and [[Jommeke]] he plays a guest role. There was also a short lived comic called ''Ambionix'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Ambionix official home page |url=http://www.wimswerts.be/htmlmap/ambionix.html}}</ref> which features a scientist teleporting a [[Belgae]] chief, loosely based on Ambiorix, to modern-day Belgium.

In the French comic [[Asterix]] in the album [[Asterix in Belgium]], [[Asterix]], [[Obelix]], [[Dogmatix]] and [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Vitalstatistix|Vitalstatistix]] go to Belgium because they are angry with Caesar about his remark that the Belgians are the bravest of all the Gauls.
