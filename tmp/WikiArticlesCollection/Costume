==Major categories==

===Theatrical costume===

One of the more prominent places people see costumes is in [[theatre]], [[film]] and on [[television]]. In combination with other aspects, theatrical costumes can help actors portray characters' age, gender role, profession, social class, personality, ethnicity, and even information about the historical period/era, geographic location and time of day, as well as the season or weather of the theatrical performance. Often, stylized theatrical costumes can exaggerate some aspect of a character; for example [[Harlequin]] and [[Trousers|Pantaloon]] in the [[Commedia dell'arte]].

===National costume===
[[National costume]] or regional costume expresses local (or [[exile]]d) [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and emphasises a culture's unique attributes.  It is often a source of national pride.  Examples of such are a [[Scotland|Scotsman]] in a [[kilt]] or a [[Japan]]ese person in a [[kimono]].

===Holidays and festivals===

The wearing of costumes has become an important part of such [[holidays]] and [[festivals]] as [[Mardi Gras]] and [[Halloween]] (see [[Halloween costume]] for more information), and (to a lesser extent) people may also wear costumes in conjunction with other [[religious holiday|holiday]]s, such as [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]. Mardi Gras costumes usually take the form of [[jester]]s and other fantasy characters, while Halloween costumes traditionally take the form of [[supernatural]] creatures such as [[ghosts]], [[vampires]], pop culture icons and [[angels]]. In modern timess Halloween costumes sometimes also include fashion show type costumes. Christmas and Easter costumes typically portray mythical characters such as [[Santa Claus]] (by donning a [[santa suit]] and [[beard]]) or the [[Easter Bunny]] by putting on an [[animal costume]]. Costumes may serve to portray various other characters during secular holidays, such as an [[Uncle Sam]] costume worn on the [[Independence Day (US)|Independence day]] for example.

In [[Judaism]], a common practice is to dress up on [[Purim]]. The Jews celebrate the change of their destiny. They were delivered from being the victims of an evil decree against them and were instead allowed by the King to destroy their enemies. A quote from the [[Book of Esther]], which says: "On the contrary" ([[hebrew]]: ונהפוך הוא ) is the reason that wearing a costume has become so popular among the Jews on this holiday.

===Children===
Costumes also serve as an avenue for children to explore and roleplay.  Children can dress up in various forms; for example characters from history or fiction like pirates, [[princesses]] or cowboys, common jobs like nurses or police officers, or animals such as those seen in zoos or farms.

===Mascots===
Another very popular situation where costumes are employed are for sporting events, where people dressed as their team's representative [[mascot]] help the club or team rally round their team's cause. Animal costumes which are visually very similar to mascot costumes are also popular among the members of the [[furry fandom]] where they are referred to as [[fursuit]]s that match ones animal persona, or fursona.
