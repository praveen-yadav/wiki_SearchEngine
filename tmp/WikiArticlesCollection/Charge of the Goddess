The '''Charge of the Goddess''' is a traditional inspirational text often used in the [[neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]].  It is usually spoken by the High Priestess after the ritual of [[Drawing down the Moon (ritual)|Drawing Down the Moon]]. The Charge is the promise of the Goddess (embodied by the High Priestess) to all witches that she will teach and guide them. It has been called "perhaps the most important single theological document in the neo-Pagan movement".<ref>Shelley Rabinovich and James Lewis. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft  and Neo-Paganism'', p. 41. New York: Citadel Books, 2004</ref> 

Several versions exist, though they all have the same basic premise, that of a set of instructions given by the Great Goddess to her worshippers. The most well known version is that written by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]],<ref name="Orpheus">{{Cite news

It has been shown that Gerald Gardner's book collection which was acquired by [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] included a copy of Crowley's [[The Blue Equinox]] which includes all of the Crowley quotations in the Charge of the Goddess. 

There is also a poetic paraphrased version written by High Priestess [[Doreen Valiente]] in the mid-1950s, which is contained within the traditional [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] [[Book of Shadows]].

Several different versions of a Wiccan ''[[Charge of the God]]'' have since been created to mirror and accompany the ''Charge of the Goddess''.

The Charge of the Goddess is recited during most rituals where the priestess is expected to represent, and/or embody, the [[Goddess]] within the sacred circle.

== Themes ==
[[File:Isis Musei Capitolini MC744.jpg|thumb|The goddess [[Isis]], holding a [[sistrum]] and [[oinochoe]].]]
The opening paragraph names a collection of goddesses, some derived from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology]], others from [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] or [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] [[legend]]s, affirming a belief that these various figures represent a single [[Mother goddess|Great Mother]]:
:''Listen to the words of the Great Mother; she who of old was also called among men [[Artemis]], [[`Ashtart|Astarte]], [[Athene]], [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], [[Melusine]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Cerridwen]], [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Dana]], [[Arianrhod]], [[Isis]], [[Brigid|Bride]], and by many other names.''

This theme echoes the ancient Roman belief that the [[Goddess]] [[Isis]] was known by ten thousand names and also that the Goddess still worshipped today by Wiccans and other neopagans is known under many guises but is one universal divinity.

The second paragraph is largely derived and paraphrased from the words that Aradia, the messianic daughter of [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], speaks to her followers in [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s 1899 book ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', London: David Nutt; various reprints. The third paragraph is largely written by [[Doreen Valiente]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} with some phrases adapted from ''[[The Book of the Law]]'' and ''[[The Gnostic Mass]]'' by [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref name="Orpheus" />

The charge affirms that ''all'' acts of love and pleasure are sacred to the Goddess.
<blockquote>Let my worship be within the heart that rejoices,
for behold, all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals.
Therefore, let there be beauty and strength,
power and compassion, honor and humility,
mirth and reverence within you.</blockquote>

=== Ancient Precedents ===
In book eleven, chapter 47 of [[Apuleius]]'s ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', [[Isis]] delivers what Ceisiwr Serith calls "essentially a charge of a goddess".<ref>{{Cite web

The Charge of the Goddess is also known under the title ''Leviter Veslis''.  This has been identified by the historian [[Ronald Hutton]], cited in an article by Roger Dearnsley "The Influence of Aleister Crowley on ''Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical'', as a piece of medieval ecclesiastical Latin used to mean "lifting the veil." <ref>[http://www.geocities.ws/nu_isis/leviter.html  Frater T.S. "Levity's Vestments: A Study in Creative Plagiarism"]</ref>

=== Origins of Wiccan Charge ===
The earliest known Wiccan version is found in a document dating from the late 1940s, Gereald Gardner's ritual notebook titled ''Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical'' (formerly in the collection of Ripley's International, Toronto). This version draws extensively from [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' and other modern sources,<ref name="serith1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceisiwrserith.com/wicca/charge.htm|first=Ceisiwr|last= Serith|title=The Sources of the Charge of the Goddess|accessdate =23 October 2007}}</ref> particularly from the works of [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref name="Orpheus" /> The oldest identifiable source is the 17th century ''Centrum Naturae Concentratum'' of [[Ali Puli|Alipili]] (or Ali Puli).<ref name="serith1" />

It is believed to have been compiled by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]<ref name="serith1"/> or possibly another member of the [[New Forest coven]].<ref name="HeseltonCauldron">{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |pages=300–1 |location=Milverton, Somerset |publisher=Capall Bann}}</ref> [[Doreen Valiente]], a student of Gardner, took his version from his ''[[Book of Shadows]]'' and adapted it into [[poetry|verse]], and later into another [[prose]] version. Gardner intended his version to be a theological statement justifying the Gardnerian sequence of initiations. 

Valiente felt that the influence of Crowley on the Charge was too obvious, and she did not want the Craft associated with Crowley. Gardner invited her to rewrite the Charge. She proceeded to do, her first version being into verse.<ref name="James Lewis p. 41">Shelley Rabinovich and James Lewis. ''Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism'', p. 41. New York: Citadel Books, 2004</ref> 

The initial verse version by [[Doreen Valiente]] consisted of eight verses, the second of which was :

:''Bow before My spirit bright''
:''Aphrodite, Arianrhod''
:''Lover of the Hornéd God''
:''Queen of witchery and night''<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 61</ref>

Valiente was unhappy with this version, saying that "people seemed to have some difficulty with this, because of the various goddess-names which they found hard to pronounce",<ref>''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 62</ref> and so she rewrote it as a prose version, much of which differs from her initial version, and is more akin to Gardner's version. This prose version has since been modified and reproduced widely by other authors. Like the Charge found in [[Freemasonry]], where the charge is a set of instructions read to a candidate standing in a temple, the Charge of the Goddess was intended to be read immediately before an initiation.<ref name="James Lewis p. 41"/>
