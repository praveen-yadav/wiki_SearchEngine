The '''Cleveland Indians''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. They are in the [[American League Central|Central Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]]. Since {{Baseball Year|1994}}, they have played in what is now [[Progressive Field]]. The team's [[spring training]] facility is at [[Goodyear Ballpark]] in [[Goodyear, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Indians a step closer to taking Spring Training to Arizona |url=http://www.wkyc.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=68744 |work= |publisher=WKYC News |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2008-06-20 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref> Since their establishment as a Major League franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two [[World Series]] championships, in [[1920 World Series|1920]] and [[1948 World Series|1948]].

The "Indians" name originates from a request by the club owner to decide on a new name, following the 1914 season. In reference to the Boston Braves (now the [[Atlanta Braves]]), the media chose "the Indians". Common [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknames]] for the Indians include the "Tribe" and the "Wahoos", the latter being a reference to their logo, [[Chief Wahoo]].  The mascot is called Slider.

The Cleveland team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) was officially a minor league. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901]]. Originally called the Cleveland Bluebirds, the team played in [[League Park]] until moving permanently to [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]] in [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. At the end of the 2013 season, they had a regular season franchise record of 8,930–8,611 (.509). The Indians have won seven AL Central titles, the most in the division.

''"In 1857 baseball games were a daily spectacle in Cleveland's Public Squares. City authorities tried to find an ordinance forbidding it, to the joy of the crowd, they were unsuccessful. - Harold Seymour"'' <ref>[[#Harold60|Harold 1960]]: 4</ref>

;1865–1868 Forest Citys of Cleveland ''(Minor League)''
;1869–1872 Forest Citys of Cleveland
[[File:Forest Citys.jpg|thumb|Forest City Baseball Club.]]

From 1865 to 1868 Forest Citys was an amateur ball club. During the [[1869 in baseball|1869]] season, Cleveland was among several cities which established professional baseball teams following the success of the 1869 [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], the first fully professional team. In the newspapers before and after 1870, the team was often called the [[Cleveland Forest Citys|Forest Citys]], in the same generic way that the team from Chicago was sometimes called The Chicagos.

In [[1871 in baseball|1871]] the Forest Citys joined the new [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NA), the first professional league. Ultimately, two of the league's western clubs went out of business during the first season and the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire|Chicago Fire]] left that city's [[Chicago Cubs|White Stockings]] impoverished, unable to field a team again until [[1874 in baseball|1874]]. Cleveland was thus the NA's westernmost outpost in [[1872 in baseball|1872]], the year the club folded. Cleveland played their full schedule to July 19 followed by two games versus Boston in mid-August and disbanded at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1872 Cleveland Forest Citys |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1872/TCL101872.htm |publisher=retrosheet.org}}</ref>

;1879–1881 Cleveland Forest Citys
;1882–1884 Cleveland Blues

In [[1876 in baseball|1876]], the [[National League]] (NL) supplanted the NA as the major professional league. Cleveland were not among its charter members, but by [[1879 in baseball|1879]] the league was looking for new entries and the city gained an NL team. The Cleveland Forest Citys baseball team was then re-created. The National League required distinct colors for the 1882 season, so the Cleveland Forest Citys became the [[Cleveland Blues (NL)|Cleveland Blues]]. They then had a mediocre record for six seasons and were ruined by a trade war with the [[Union Association]] (UA) in [[1884 in baseball|1884]], when its three best players ([[Fred Dunlap]], [[Jack Glasscock]], and [[Jim McCormick (pitcher)|Jim McCormick]]) jumped to the UA after being offered higher salaries. Cleveland Blues merged with the St. Louis Maroons UA team in [[1885 in baseball|1885]].

;1887–1899 Cleveland Spiders — nickname "Blues"

Cleveland went without major league baseball for two seasons until gaining a team in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (AA) in [[1887 in baseball|1887]]. After the AA's [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Allegheny club]] jumped to the NL Cleveland followed suit in [[1889 in baseball|1889]], as the AA began to crumble. The Cleveland ball club, named the [[Cleveland Spiders|Spiders]] (supposedly inspired by their "skinny and spindly" players) slowly became a power in the league.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Schneider  | first = Russell  | authorlink =  | coauthors =

  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC  | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref> The next year the Spiders moved into [[League Park]], which would serve as the home of Cleveland professional baseball for the next 55 years. Led by native Ohioan [[Cy Young]], the Spiders became a contender in the mid-1890s, when they played in the [[Temple Cup]] Series (that era's World Series) twice, winning it in [[1895 in baseball|1895]]. The team began to fade after this success, and was dealt a severe blow under the ownership of the [[Robison Field|Robison brothers]].

Prior to the {{by|1899}} season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]], thus owning two clubs at the same time. The Browns were renamed the "Perfectos", and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Cy Young, [[Jesse Burkett]] and [[Bobby Wallace (baseball)|Bobby Wallace]].

The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and {{by|1900}}. The Spiders were left with essentially a minor league lineup, and began to lose games at a record pace. Drawing almost no fans at home, they ended up playing most of their season on the road, and became known as "The Wanderers."<ref>{{cite book  | last = Hittner  | first = Arthur  | authorlink = | title = Honus Wagner: The Life of Baseball's Flying Dutchman  | publisher = McFarland & Company  | series =  | year = 2003  | doi =  | isbn = 0-7864-1811-7 }}</ref> The team ended the season in 12th place, 84 games out of first place, with an all-time worst record of 20 wins and 134 losses (.130 winning percentage).<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016661.html Bob Diskin, Special to ESPN.com, ''A pitcher worthy of a trophy'']</ref>  Following the 1899 season, the National League disbanded four teams, including the Cleveland franchise. The disastrous 1899 season would actually be a step toward a new future for Cleveland fans the next year.

;1890, Cleveland Infants — nickname "Babes"

The Cleveland Infants were in the [[Players' League]]. The League was well-attended, at least in some cities, but was underfunded and its owners lacked the confidence to continue beyond the one season. There were eight teams who were star-studded; the Boston franchise won the championship. The Cleveland Infants finished with 55 wins and 75 losses.  Their home games were played at [[Brotherhood Park]].<ref>[http://www.projectballpark.org/history/pl/brotherhood.html Project Ballpark]</ref>

==Franchise history==
{{main|History of the Cleveland Indians}}

===1894–1935: Beginning to middle===
The '''Grand Rapids Rustlers''' were founded in Michigan in 1894 and were in the Western League.  In 1900 the team moved to Cleveland and was named the '''Cleveland Lake Shores'''. Around the same time [[Ban Johnson]] changed the name of his minor league (Western League) to the American League.  In 1900 the American League was still considered a minor league.  In 1901 team was renamed the '''Cleveland Bluebirds''' when the American League broke with the National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League.  The Cleveland franchise was among its eight charter members.

[[File:Nap Lajoie 1913.jpg|left|thumb|[[Nap Lajoie]], who won the 1903 American League Batting Championship with the Indians, was the team's namesake from 1903-1915, and an [[MLB Hall of Fame]]r.]]
<!--no mention of "Bronchos"?-->
The new team was owned by coal magnate [[Charles Somers]] and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy industrialist and also co-owner of the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]], lent money to other team owners, including [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]]'s [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]], to keep them and the new league afloat. Players didn't think the name "Bluebirds" was suitable for a baseball team.<ref name="TBT">{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}</ref> Writers frequently shortened it to '''Cleveland Blues''' due to the players' all-blue uniforms,<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001  | location = | page =11  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id=

The Bluebirds suffered from financial problems in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider moving to either [[Pittsburgh]] or [[Cincinnati]]. Relief came in 1902 as a result of the conflict between the National and American Leagues.  In 1901, [[Nap Lajoie|Napoleon "Nap" Lajoie]], the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]' star second baseman, jumped to the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year—one of the highest-profile players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]]. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement between the warring leagues.  However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania.<ref name="TBT"/> Mack, partly to thank Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to the then-moribund Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years.<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001  | location = | pages =12–13  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id= | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref>  Due to the injunction, however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played against the A's in Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite book | last =Seymour | first = Harold | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Baseball | publisher = Oxford University Press, US | year =1960 | location = | pages =214–215 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=zQO-WWL1v1AC | doi = | id = | isbn =0-19-500100-1}}</ref>  Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 10,000 fans to League Park.  Soon afterward, he was named team captain, and in 1903 the team was renamed the '''Cleveland Naps''' after a newspaper conducted a write-in contest.<ref name="TBT"/>

Lajoie was named manager in {{MLBy|1905}}, and the team's fortunes improved somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908.<ref name=1908AL>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1908.shtml |title=1908 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-19 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}</ref>  However, the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season as manager but remained on as a player.<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =319 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref>

[[File:1909 Cleveland Naps.jpg|thumb|right|[[1909 Cleveland Naps season|1909 Cleveland Naps]]]]
After that, the team began to unravel, leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. [[Cy Young]], who returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining years<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =413 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref> and [[Addie Joss]] died from tubercular meningitis prior to the [[1911 Major League Baseball season|1911]] season.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Obituary, Pitcher Joss Dead: Ill Only Few Days |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B03E6DD1031E233A25756C1A9629C946096D6CF&oref=slogin |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=April 15, 1911 |accessdate=2008-06-20 | format=PDF}}</ref>

Despite a strong lineup anchored by the potent Lajoie and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]], poor pitching kept the team below third place for most of the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as the Napkins, "because they fold up so easily". In 1912 the team's name was changed to "Cleveland Molly McGuires" after the coal miners who were trying to establish a union and were regarded as "heroes". The name lasted only three years. The team hit bottom in 1914 and 1915, finishing in the cellar both years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1914.shtml |title=1914 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1915.shtml |title=1915 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}</ref>

1915 brought significant changes to the team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old was no longer a top hitter in the league, batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud with manager [[Joe Birmingham]], the team sold Lajoie back to the A's.<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =321 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref>

With Lajoie gone, the Molly McGuires now needed a new nickname. Somers asked the local newspapers to come up with a new name, and based on their input, the team was renamed the '''Cleveland Indians'''.<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =23 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref>  Legend has it that the team honored [[Louis Sockalexis]] when it assumed its current name in 1915. Sockalexis, a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], had played in Cleveland 1897–99. Research indicates that this legend is mostly untrue, and that the new name was a play on the name of the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]], then known as the "Miracle Braves" after going from last place on July 4 to a sweep in the [[1914 World Series]]. Proponents of the name acknowledged that the [[Cleveland Spiders]] of the [[National League]] had sometimes been informally called the "Indians" during Sockalexis' short career there, a fact which merely reinforced the new name.<ref name=Pluto>{{cite book

At the same time, Somers' business ventures began to fail, leaving him deeply in debt.

By [[1916 Major League Baseball season|1916]], Somers was at the end of his tether, and sold the team to a syndicate headed by Chicago railroad contractor James C. "Jack" Dunn.<ref name=Somers/>  Manager Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, [[Stan Coveleski]] and [[Jim Bagby, Sr.|Jim Bagby]] and traded for center fielder [[Tris Speaker]], who was engaged in a salary dispute with the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =23–24 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id =  | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref>  All three would ultimately become key players in bringing a championship to Cleveland.

Speaker took over the reins as [[player-manager]] in {{MLBy|1919}}, and would lead the team to a championship in 1920. On August 16, the Indians were playing the [[1920 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York. Shortstop [[Ray Chapman]], who often crowded the plate, was batting against [[Carl Mays]], who had an unusual underhand delivery. It was also late in the afternoon and the infield would have been in shadow with the center field area (the batters' background) bathed in sunlight. As well, at the time, "part of every pitcher's job was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, tobacco juice; it was deliberately scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, even spiked. The result was a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard to see."<ref>{{cite book|last=Ward|first=Geoffrey C. |coauthors=Burns, Ken|title=Baseball: An Illustrated History|publisher=Knopf |year=1996|page=153|isbn=0-679-76541-7}}</ref>

In any case, Chapman did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch came his way. The pitch hit Chapman in the head, fracturing his skull. Chapman died the next day, becoming the only player to sustain a fatal injury from a pitched ball.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/08.17.html Report of Chapman's Death, New York Times, 8/18/1920]</ref>  The Indians, who at the time were locked in a tight three-way pennant race with the Yankees and [[1920 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Standings - Monday, Aug 16, 1920 |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=1920-08-16 | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> were not slowed down by the death of their teammate.

In September 1920, the [[Black Sox Scandal]] came to a boil. With just a few games left in the season, and Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck for first place at 94–54 and 95–56 respectively,<ref>{{cite web |title=CLE 1920 Cleveland Indians Schedule |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&t=CLE |work=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1920 Chicago White Sox Schedule |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&t=CHA |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> the Chicago owner suspended eight players. The White Sox lost two of three in their final series, while Cleveland won four and lost 2 in their final two series. Cleveland finished two games ahead of Chicago and three games ahead of the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's .388 hitting, Jim Bagby's 30 victories and solid performances from [[Steve O'Neill]] and Stan Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the [[1920 Brooklyn Robins season|Brooklyn Robins]] 5–2 in the [[1920 World Series|World Series]] for their first title, winning four games in a row after the Robins took a 2–1 Series lead. The Series included three memorable "firsts", all of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the home team. In the first inning, right fielder [[Elmer Smith (20th century outfielder)|Elmer Smith]] hit the first Series grand slam. In the fourth inning, [[Jim Bagby, Sr.|Jim Bagby]] hit the first Series home run by a pitcher. And in the top of the fifth inning, second baseman [[Bill Wambsganss]] executed the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple play in World Series history, in fact the only Series triple play of any kind.

The team would not reach the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. Speaker and Coveleski were aging and the Yankees were rising with a new weapon: [[Babe Ruth]] and the home run. They managed two second-place finishes but spent much of the decade in the cellar. In 1927 Dunn's widow, Mrs. George Pross (Dunn had died in 1922), sold the team to a syndicate headed by [[Alva Bradley]].

The Indians were a middling team by the 1930s, finishing third or fourth most years. {{Baseball Year|1936}} brought Cleveland a new superstar in 17-year old pitcher [[Bob Feller]], who came from [[Iowa]] with a dominating [[fastball]]. That season, Feller set a record with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the league in strikeouts from 1938–1941.

On August 20, 1938, Indians catchers [[Hank Helf]] and [[Frank Pytlak]] set the "all-time altitude mark" by catching baseballs dropped from the 708-foot [[Terminal Tower]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119227/index.htm |date=March 11, 1985 |title=When Baseballs Fell from On High, Henry Helf Rose to the Occasion |author=Bruce Anderson |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=October 20, 2013}}</ref>

By {{MLBy|1940}}, Feller, along with [[Ken Keltner]], [[Mel Harder]] and [[Lou Boudreau]] led the Indians to within one game of the pennant. However, the team was wracked with dissension, with some players (including Feller and Mel Harder going so far as to request that Bradley fire manager [[Ossie Vitt]]. Reporters lampooned them as the Cleveland Crybabies.<ref>{{cite web |author=C.

The [[1940 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] won the pennant and Giebell never won another major league game.<ref>{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=DeMaio Brewer |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A National Treasure Calls Wilkes "Home"  |url=http://www.therecordofwilkes.com/rec20000621/index.htm |work=The Record of Wilkes, N.C. |publisher= |date=2000-06-21 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}</ref>

Cleveland entered [[1941 Major League Baseball season|1941]] with a young team and a new manager; [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] had replaced the despised Vitt; but the team regressed, finishing in fourth. Cleveland would soon be depleted of two stars. [[Hal Trosky]] retired in 1941 due to migraine headaches<ref>{{cite news |first=Leighton |last=Housh |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hal Trosky, Norway, 1965  |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19650404/SPORTS11/50710015 |work=Des Moines Register |publisher= |date=04-04-1965 |accessdate=2008-06-27 }}</ref> and Bob Feller enlisted in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] two days after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]].

===1946–49: The Bill Veeck years===
In {{Baseball Year|1946}}, [[Bill Veeck]] formed an investment group that purchased the Cleveland Indians from Bradley's group for a reported $1.6 million.<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell

A former owner of a minor league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought to Cleveland a gift for promotion. At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced<ref>{{cite news |title=Baseball's Clown Prince Dies |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/10/30/archive/main68511.shtml |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> [[Max Patkin]], the "Clown Prince of Baseball" as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box was the sort of promotional stunt that delighted fans but infuriated the American League front office.

Recognizing that he had acquired a solid team, Veeck soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless League Park to take up full-time residence in massive [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]].<ref name=Borsvold>{{cite book | last =Borsvold | first = David  | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = The Cleveland Indians: Cleveland Press Years, 1920–1982 | publisher = Arcadia Publishing  | year = 2003 | location = | pages =37–38  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=v0hgrNuScVMC&pg=PA37&dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7385-2325-9}}</ref> The Indians had briefly moved from League Park to Municipal Stadium in mid-1932, but moved back to League Park due to complaints about the cavernous environment.  From 1936 onward, however, the Indians began playing an increasing number of games at Municipal, until by 1940 they played most of their home slate there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowry|first=Phillip|title=Green Cathedrals|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company|location=New York City|isbn=0-8027-1562-1}}</ref> League Park was demolished in 1951, although a portion of the original ticket booth remains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070806&content_id=2133242&vkey=cle_gameface&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle |title= League Park may glisten once again|accessdate=2008-06-28 |work= |publisher=Cleveland Indians.com |date= }}</ref>

[[File:OldClevelandIndiansLogo.jpg|right|thumb|The Cleveland Indians logo from 1946-1950]]

Making the most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence moved as much as {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season.  The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game.  On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the [[1948 World Series|World Series]] against the [[Atlanta Braves#History|Boston Braves]] drew over 84,000. The record stood until the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] drew a crowd in excess of 92,500 to watch Game 5 of the [[1959 World Series]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] against the [[Chicago White Sox]].

Under Veeck's leadership, one of Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the [[Baseball color line|color barrier]] in the [[American League]] by signing [[Larry Doby]], formerly a player for the Negro League's [[Newark Eagles]] in {{By|1947}}, eleven weeks after [[Jackie Robinson]] signed with the [[Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]].<ref name=Borsvold/>  Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season. A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League twice in homers.

In 1948, needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant race, Veeck turned to the [[Negro League]] again and signed pitching great [[Satchel Paige]] amid much controversy.<ref name=Borsvold/>  Barred from Major League Baseball during his prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed by many as another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black pitcher. Paige ended the year with a 6–1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two shutouts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CLE/1948.shtml |title= Satchel Paige 1948 Statistics|accessdate=2008-06-28 |work=|publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= }}</ref>

In {{MLBy|1948}}, veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and [[Joe Gordon]] had career offensive seasons, while newcomers Doby and [[Gene Bearden]] also had standout seasons. The team went down to the wire with the [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], winning a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, to go to the [[1948 World Series|World Series]]. In the series, the Indians defeated the [[Atlanta Braves#History|Boston Braves]] four games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP Award]].

The Indians would appear in a film the following [[1949 in film|year]] titled ''[[The Kid From Cleveland]]'', in which Veeck had an interest.<ref name=Borsvold/>  The film portrayed the team helping out a "troubled teenaged fan"<ref>{{cite web |title=The Kid from Cleveland |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041545/ |publisher=IMDB.com | accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> and featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards the end of the season.<ref name=Borsvold/>  That season, Cleveland again contended before falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically eliminated from the pennant race.<ref name=Borsvold/>

Later in 1949, Veeck's first wife (who had a half-stake in Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the team<ref>{{cite book | last =Ribowsky | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Don't Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball  | publisher = De Capo Press  | year = 2000  | location =  | page =286  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LT2pirW9nSYC&pg=RA1-PA286&dq= | doi =  | id = | isbn = 0-306-80963-X}}</ref> to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan.

===The 1950s: Near misses===
Ryan was forced out in {{MLBy|1953}} in favor of Myron Wilson, who in turn gave way to William Daley in {{MLBy|1956}}.  Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team composed of Feller, Doby, [[Minnie Miñoso]], [[Luke Easter (baseball)|Luke Easter]], [[Bobby Ávila]], [[Al Rosen]], [[Early Wynn]], [[Bob Lemon]], and [[Mike Garcia (AL pitcher)|Mike Garcia]] continued to contend through the early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, in [[1954 Major League Baseball season|1954]], finishing second to the [[1954 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] five times.

The winningest season in franchise history came in 1954, when the [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] finished the season with a record of 111-43 (.721). That mark set an American League record for wins which stood for 44 years until the [[1998 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] won 114 games in [[1998 Major League Baseball season|1998]] (a 162-game regular season). The Indians 1954 winning percentage of .721 is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the [[1954 World Series|World Series]] to face the [[1954 New York Giants (MLB) season|New York Giants]]. The team could not bring home the title, however, ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The series was notable for [[Willie Mays]]' [[The Catch (baseball)|over-the-shoulder catch]] off the bat of [[Vic Wertz]] in Game 1.

===1960–1993: The 30-year slump===
From 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place finish (in 1968) and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974 to 1976, 1990, and 1992) but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of the standings.

====Frank Lane becomes general manager====
The Indians hired general manager [[Frank Lane]], known as "Trader" Lane, away from the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in [[1957 Major League Baseball season|1957]]. Lane over the years had gained a reputation as a GM who loved to make deals.  With the White Sox, Lane had made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years.<ref name=Cards>{{cite book | last =Eisenbath  | first = Mike  | authorlink =  | coauthors =Stan Musial  | title = The Cardinals Encyclopedia | publisher = Temple University Press  | year = 1999  | location =  | pages =  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=hymGG28xYcoC&pg=PA410&lpg=PA410&dq=  | doi =  | id = | isbn = 1-56639-703-0}}</ref>  In a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away [[Red Schoendienst]] and [[Harvey Haddix]].<ref name=Cards/>  Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals he regretted were the ones that he didn't make.<ref>{{cite book
| last =Schneider | first = Russell  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Tales from the Tribe Dugout | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2002 | location = | pages = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCNvizFvLy0C&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-303-6}}</ref>

One of Lane's early trades in Cleveland was to send [[Roger Maris]] to the [[History of the Kansas City Athletics|Kansas City Athletics]] in the middle of [[1958 Major League Baseball season|1958]]. Indians executive [[Hank Greenberg]] was not happy about the trade<ref name=Maris>{{cite book  | last =Rosenfeld  | first = Harvey  | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = Still a Legend: The Story of Roger Maris | publisher = iUniverse | year = 2002 | location = | pages = | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=LIQLHXQrAssC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq= | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-595-24615-X}}</ref> and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane.<ref name=Maris/>  After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and he received good ballplayers in exchange.<ref name=Maris/>

After the Maris trade, Lane acquired 25-year old [[Norm Cash]] from the White Sox for [[Minnie Miñoso]] and then traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians; Cash went on to hit over 350 home runs for the Tigers. The Indians received [[Steve Demeter]] in the deal, who would have only five at-bats for Cleveland.<ref>{{cite news | last = Dow  | first = Bill | title = Former Tiger Norm Cash  | work = Baseball Digest  | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_60/ai_76928886  | month = September | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}</ref>

====Curse of Rocky Colavito====
In 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite<ref name=Colavito>{{cite book | last =Borsvold | first = David | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Cleveland Indians: Cleveland Press Years, 1920–1982  | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | year =1960 | location = | page =81  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=v0hgrNuScVMC&pg=PA81&dq=%2B%22colavito%22+%2Bfan+%2Bfavorite | doi = | id = | isbn =0-7385-2325-9 }}</ref> [[Rocky Colavito]] to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for [[Harvey Kuenn]] just before Opening Day in {{MLBy|1960}}.

It was a blockbuster trade that swapped the {{MLBy|1959}} AL home run co-champion (Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in {{MLBy|1965}}. Kuenn, on the other hand, would play only one season for the Indians before departing for [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]] in a trade for an aging [[Johnny Antonelli]] and [[Willie Kirkland]]. ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' columnist [[Terry Pluto]] documented the decades of woe that followed the trade in his book ''[[The Curse of Rocky Colavito]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first= Steve|last= Gietschier |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= The Curse of Rocky Colavito: A Loving Look at a Thirty-Year Slump. - book reviews |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n17_v217/ai_15355261 |work= The Sporting News|publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=1994-09-25 |accessdate=2008-06-10 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>  Despite being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with Lane.<ref name = Curse>{{cite news |first= Stan|last= Grossfeld |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= Colavito Always Straight Shooter |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2007/10/12/colavito_always_straight_shooter/ |work= The Boston Globe|publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2008-06-29 |language= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= }}</ref>

Lane also engineered a unique trade of managers in mid-season 1960, sending [[Joe Gordon]] to the Tigers in exchange for [[Jimmy Dykes]]. Lane left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued. In 1965, the Indians traded pitcher [[Tommy John]], who would go on to win 288 games in his career, and 1966 Rookie of the Year [[Tommy Agee]] to the White Sox to get Colavito back.<ref name = Curse/>

====1969 Move to the East Division====
The 1970s were not much better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, including [[Graig Nettles]], [[Dennis Eckersley]], [[Buddy Bell]] and 1971 Rookie of the Year [[Chris Chambliss]],<ref>{{cite book | last =Riess | first = Steven  | title = Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball Clubs: Volume 1 | publisher = Univ of South Carolina Press | year = 2006 | location = | page =1067 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ZCcJVZyl5oYC | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-313-32993-1}}</ref> for a number of players who made no impact.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 10-best Yankee Trades of All Time |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=list/bestyankeetrades |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2004-03-01}}</ref>

Constant ownership changes did not help the Indians. In 1963, Daley's syndicate sold the team to a group headed by general manager [[Gabe Paul]].<ref name="TBT"/>  Three years later, Paul sold the Indians to [[Vernon Stouffer]],<ref>{{cite news |author=Murray Chass |title=BASEBALL; Demise and Pall Of the Indians |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D91130F931A35754C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=1991-07-02 |accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> of the [[Stouffer's]] frozen-food empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially strong owner, Stouffer had some non-baseball related financial setbacks and, consequently, the team was cash-poor.  In order to solve some financial problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games in [[New Orleans]] with a view to a possible move there.<ref name=Mileti>{{cite news |author=Ron Fimrite |title=Circle The Wagons, Indian Uprising! |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1086136/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1972-05-29 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>  After rejecting an offer from [[George Steinbrenner]] and former Indian [[Al Rosen]], Stouffer sold the team in 1972 to a group led by [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Cleveland Barons (1937–1973)|Cleveland Barons]] owner [[Nick Mileti]].<ref name=Mileti/>  Steinbrenner went on to buy the New York Yankees in 1973.<ref>{{cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =352  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1}}</ref>

Only five years later, Mileti's group sold the team for $11 million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Steve O'Neill and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul.<ref>{{cite news |author=Richard Goldstein |title=Gabe Paul, Ex-Yankee Official, Dies at 88 |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E5DC1F3FF93BA15757C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=1998-04-28 |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>  O'Neill's death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. His son, Patrick O'Neill, did not find a buyer until real estate magnates [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard]] and David Jacobs purchased the team in 1986.

The team was unable to move out of the cellar, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One highlight was the acquisition of [[Gaylord Perry]] in {{MLBy|1972}}. The Indians traded fireballer [[Sam McDowell|"Sudden Sam" McDowell]] for Perry, who became the first Indian pitcher to win the [[Cy Young Award]]. In {{MLBy|1975}}, Cleveland broke another color barrier with the hiring of [[Frank Robinson]] as Major League Baseball's first African American manager. Robinson served as player-manager and would provide a franchise highlight when he hit a pinch hit home run on Opening Day. But the high profile signing of [[Wayne Garland]], a 20-game winner in [[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore]], proved to be a disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and went 28–48 over five years.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | title = More Tales From the Tribe Dugout | publisher = Sports Publishing, LLC | series = | year = 2005  | url= http://books.google.com/?id=2UHG0hiDunkC  | doi = | isbn = 1-58261-680-9 }}</ref> The team failed to improve with Robinson as manager and he was fired in {{MLBy|1977}}. In 1977, pitcher [[Dennis Eckersley]] threw a no-hitter against the [[1977 California Angels season|California Angels]]. The next season, he would be dealt to the [[Boston Red Sox]] where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 17 in 1979.

The 1970s also featured the infamous [[Ten Cent Beer Night]] at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a [[1974 Major League Baseball season|1974]] game against the [[1974 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the Indians.<ref>{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Paul | title = The night beer and violence bubbled over in Cleveland | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=beernight/080604&sportCat=mlb | date=2008-06-04 |accessdate = 2009-02-17 }}</ref>

There were more bright spots in the 1980s. In May 1981, [[Len Barker]] threw a [[perfect game]] against the [[1981 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], joining Addie Joss as the only other Indian pitcher to do so.<ref name=Barker>{{cite web |author= Anthony Castrovince |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060514&content_id=1453617&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle |title=Barker's special night remains vivid |date=2006-05-15 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=MLB.com}}</ref>  [[Joe Charboneau|"Super Joe" Charbonneau]] won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|American League Rookie of the Year]] award.

Eventually, the Indians traded Barker to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Brett Butler (baseball)|Brett Butler]] and [[Brook Jacoby]],<ref name=Barker/> who would become mainstays of the team for the remainder of the decade. Butler and Jacoby were joined by [[Joe Carter]], [[Mel Hall]], [[Julio Franco]] and [[Cory Snyder]], which brought new hope to fans in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ron Fimrite  |title=Pow!

Cleveland's struggles over the 30-year span were highlighted in the 1989 film ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', which comically depicted a hapless Cleveland ball club going from worst to first by the end of the film.

====Organizational turnaround====

Throughout the 1980s, the Indians' owners had pushed for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years in the 1940s and 1950s. However, during the lean years even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment.

Finally, in May 1990, [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] voters passed an [[Pigovian tax|excise tax]] on sales of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax proceeds would be used to finance the building of the [[Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex]] which would include [[Jacobs Field]] and [[Quicken Loans Arena|Gund Arena]] for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] basketball team.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jennifer Stoffel |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC1F31F930A25755C0A966958260 |title=New Sports Complex for Cleveland |date=1990-06-13 |accessdate=2008-07-01 |work=New York Times}}</ref>  The team had new ownership and a new stadium on the way. They now needed a winning team.

The team's fortunes started to turn in {{By|1989}}, ironically with a very unpopular trade. The team sent power-hitting outfielder [[Joe Carter]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] for two unproven players, [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]] and [[Carlos Baerga]]. Alomar made an immediate impact, not only being elected to the [[1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]] but also winning Cleveland's fourth [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]. Baerga would become a three-time All-Star with consistent offensive production.

Indians general manager [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] made a number of moves that would finally bring success to the team. In {{MLBy|1991}}, he hired former Indian [[Mike Hargrove]] to manage and traded catcher [[Eddie Taubensee]] to the [[Houston Astros]] who, with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with [[Kenny Lofton]]. Lofton finished second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a .285 average and 66 [[stolen bases]].

The Indians were named "Organization of the Year" by Baseball America<ref>{{cite web |title=The Official Site of The Cleveland Indians: History: Indians History |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/cle/history/cle_history_overview.jsp?story=5 |publisher=Major League Baseball, Cleveland Indians |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> in 1992, in response to the appearance of offensive bright spots and an improving [[Farm team|farm system]].

The team suffered a tragedy during spring training of {{MLBy|1993}}, when a boat carrying pitchers [[Steve Olin]], [[Tim Crews]], and [[Bob Ojeda]] crashed into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, and Ojeda was seriously injured. (Ojeda missed most of the season, and would retire the following year).<ref>{{cite web |author=Jayson Stark |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1527339&type=columnist |title=Ten years later, the pain is still there |date=2003-03-21 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=ESPN.com}}</ref>

By the end of the 1993 season, the team was in transition, leaving Cleveland Stadium and fielding a talented nucleus of young players. Many of those players came from the Indians' new [[AAA (baseball)|AAA]] farm team, the [[Charlotte Knights]], who won the [[International League]] title that year.

===1994–2000: New beginnings===

====1994: Jacobs Field opens====
{{main|1994 Cleveland Indians season}}

[[File:Progressive Field.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Progressive Field]] (formerly Jacobs Field)]]
Indians General Manager [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] and team owner [[Richard Jacobs (businessman)|Richard Jacobs]] managed to turn the team's fortunes around. The Indians opened [[Progressive Field|Jacobs Field]] in [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]] with the aim of improving on the prior season's sixth-place finish. The Indians were only one game behind the division-leading [[1994 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] on August 12 when a [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|players strike]] wiped out the rest of the season.

====1995 season: first Pennant since 1954====
{{main|1995 Cleveland Indians season}}

Having contended for the division in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland sprinted to a 100–44 record (18 games were lost to player/owner negotiations) in 1995 winning its first ever divisional title. Veterans [[Dennis Martínez]], [[Orel Hershiser]] and [[Eddie Murray]] combined with a young core of players including [[Albert Belle]], [[Jim Thome]], [[Manny Ramírez]] and [[Charles Nagy]] to lead the league in team batting average as well as team ERA.

After defeating the [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in the [[1995 American League Division Series|Division Series]] and the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] in the [[1995 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], Cleveland clinched a [[World Series]] berth, for the first time since 1954. The [[1995 World Series|World Series]] ended in disappointment with the Indians falling in six games to the [[1995 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]].

====1996====
{{main|1996 Cleveland Indians season}}

The Indians repeated as AL Central champions in [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1996]], but lost to the [[1996 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[1996 American League Division Series|Division Series]]. Notably in 1996, tickets for every home game for the Indians sold out before opening day.

====1997: Two outs away====
{{main|1997 Cleveland Indians season}}

In [[1997 Major League Baseball season|1997]] Cleveland started slow but finished with an 86–75 record. Taking their third consecutive AL Central title, the Indians defeated the [[1997 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[1997 American League Division Series|Division Series]], 3–2. After defeating the [[1997 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[1997 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], Cleveland went on to face the [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] which featured the coldest game in World Series history. With the series tied after Game Six, the Indians went into the ninth inning of Game Seven with a 2–1 lead, but closer [[José Mesa]] allowed the Marlins to tie the game. In the eleventh inning, [[Edgar Rentería]] drove in the winning run giving the Marlins their first championship.  Cleveland became the first team to lose the World Series after carrying the lead into the ninth inning of the seventh game.

====1998–2001====
In [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|1998]], the Indians made the playoffs for the fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card [[1998 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] 3-1 in the [[1998 American League Division Series|Division Series]], Cleveland lost the [[1998 American League Championship Series|1998 ALCS]] in six games to the [[1998 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], who had come into the playoffs with a then-AL record 114 wins in the regular season.<ref>{{cite news |title=No work Yankees |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/1998/postseason/news/1998/10/14/series_yankees/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=1998-10-15 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

For the [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|1999]] season, Cleveland added relief pitcher [[Ricardo Rincón]] and second baseman [[Roberto Alomar]], brother of catcher Sandy Alomar, Jr,<ref>{{cite news |first=Ros|last=Newhan |title=Early Returns Favor Braves|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/sports/sp-48911 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1998-11-29 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> and won the Central Division title for the fifth consecutive year. The team scored 1,009 runs, becoming the first (and to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox to score more than 1,000 runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not make it past the first round, losing the [[1999 American League Division Series|Division Series]] to the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]], despite taking a 2-0 lead in the series. In game three, Indians starter Dave Burba went down with an injury in the 4th inning.<ref name=Burba>{{cite news |first=Joe|last=Lapointe |title=1999 PLAYOFFS: DIVISION SERIES; Red Sox Find Answers, Raising More Questions |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E6D91F31F933A25753C1A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=[[New York Times]] |date=1999-10-10 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>  Four pitchers, including presumed game four starter [[Jaret Wright]], surrendered nine runs in relief.

In [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]], the [[2000 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] had a 44–42 start, but caught fire after the All Star break and went 46–30 the rest of the way to finish 90–72. The team had one of the league's best offenses that year and a defense that yielded three gold gloves. However, they ended up five games behind the [[2000 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the Central division and missed the wild card by one game to the [[2000 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]]. Mid-season trades brought [[Bob Wickman]] and [[Jake Westbrook]] to Cleveland.  After the season and free agent outfielder [[Manny Ramírez]] departed for the [[Boston Red Sox]].

In 2000, [[Larry Dolan]] bought the Indians for $320 million from Richard Jacobs, who, along with his late brother David, had paid $45 million for the club in 1986. The sale set a record at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cleveland Indians sold to Dolan|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/-cleveland-indians-sold-dolan/story.aspx?guid=%7B30D9D583-27E3-4DC4-88E4-46E59CB9252B%7D|work=CBS Marketwatch |date=1999-11-04 |accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>

[[File:Jim Thome 2008.jpg|right|thumb|225px|[[Jim Thome]] (shown as a member of the [[Chicago White Sox]]), the all time Indians home run leader]]
[[2001 Cleveland Indians season|2001]] saw a return to the playoffs. After the departures of Ramírez and [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]], the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] [[Juan González (baseball)|Juan González]], who helped the team win the Central division with a 91–71 record.  One of the highlights came on August 5, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14–2 deficit in the seventh inning to defeat the [[2001 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] 15–14 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won a MLB record-tying 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager [[Charlie Manuel]] had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly out of reach.

Seattle and Cleveland met in the [[2001 American League Division Series|first round of the playoffs]], however the Mariners won the series 3-2. In the 2001-02 offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant, [[Mark Shapiro (sports executive)|Mark Shapiro]], took the reins.

===2002–2010: The Shapiro/Wedge years===

====First "rebuilding of the team"====
Shapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent. He traded [[Roberto Alomar]] to the [[New York Mets]] for a package that included outfielder [[Matt Lawton]] and prospects [[Alex Escobar]] and [[Billy Traber]]. When the team fell out of contention in mid-{{MLBy|2002}}, Shapiro fired manager [[Charlie Manuel]] and traded pitching ace [[Bartolo Colón]] for prospects [[Brandon Phillips]], [[Cliff Lee]], and [[Grady Sizemore]]; acquired [[Travis Hafner]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]] for [[Ryan Drese]] and [[Einar Díaz]]; and picked up [[Coco Crisp]] from the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for aging starter [[Chuck Finley]]. [[Jim Thome]] left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract.

Young Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and {{MLBy|2003}} under new manager [[Eric Wedge]]. They posted strong offensive numbers in {{MLBy|2004}}, but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 22–0 victory over the [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240831110 |title=Vizquel's six hits tie AL record |accessdate=2008-06-08 |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-08-31}}</ref>

In early {{MLBy|2005}}, the offense got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the [[2005 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] caught fire in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central Division down to 1.5 games. However, the season came to an end as the Indians went on to lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, missing the playoffs by only two games. Shapiro was named [[The Sporting News Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] in 2005.<ref name="cleveland.com">http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1194342071241541.xml&coll=2</ref> [[2006 Major League Baseball season|The next season]], the club made several roster changes, while retaining its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted by the acquisition of top prospect [[Andy Marté]] from the [[Boston Red Sox]].  The Indians had a solid offensive season, led by career years from [[Travis Hafner]] and [[Grady Sizemore]]. Hafner, despite missing the last month of the season, tied the single season grand slam record of six, which was set in {{MLBy|1987}} by [[Don Mattingly]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E2DC173EF937A2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=BASEBALL; Hafner's 6th Grand Slam Ties Mattingly |date=2006-08-14|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> Despite the solid offensive performance, the bullpen struggled with 23 blown saves (a Major League worst), and the Indians finished a disappointing fourth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/mlb031/11405274/detail.html|title=Cleveland Indians 2007 Preview|last=Ruddick|first=Chris|date=2007-03-27|publisher=News Net 5|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>

In {{MLBy|2007}}, Shapiro signed veteran help for the bullpen and outfield in the offseason. Veterans [[Aaron Fultz]], and [[Joe Borowski (baseball)|Joe Borowski]] joined [[Rafael Betancourt]] in the Indians bullpen.<ref name="MLB2007">{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070328&content_id=1864413&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle|title=Indians Opening Day outlook|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony |date=2007-03-30|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> The Indians improved significantly over the prior year and went into the All-Star break in second place.

[[File:We Win!.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Indians fans celebrate as the team clinches the 2007 division title]]

The Indians began their playoff run by defeating the [[2007 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[2007 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] three games to one. This series will be most remembered for the swarm of bugs that overtook the field in the later innings of Game Two. They also jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead over the [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]. The season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance to the [[2007 World Series]].<ref name="WP2007"/>

Despite the loss, Cleveland players took home a number of awards. [[Grady Sizemore]], who had a .995 [[fielding percentage]] and only two errors in 405 chances, won the [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove award]], Cleveland's first since 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071106&content_id=2293684&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle|title=Sizemore earns first Gold Glove Award|last=Castrovince|first=Anthony|date=2007-11-06|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> Indians Pitcher [[CC Sabathia]] won the second [[Cy Young Award]] in team history with a 19–7 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 241 [[innings pitched]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3108321|title=Sabathia only second Indians pitcher to win Cy Young|date=2007-11-14|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Eric Wedge was awarded the first [[Manager of the Year Award]] in team history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2007/11/14/baseball-managers.html?ref=rss|title=Wedge, Melvin voted baseball's top managers|date=2007-11-14|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> Shapiro was named to his second [[The Sporting News Executive of the Year Award|Executive of the Year]] in 2007.<ref name="cleveland.com"/>

====Second "rebuilding of the team"====
The [[2008 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] struggled during the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]].  Injuries to sluggers [[Travis Hafner]] and [[Victor Martinez (baseball)|Victor Martinez]], as well as starting pitchers [[Jake Westbrook]] and [[Fausto Carmona]] led to a poor start.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/indians/2008-12-23-indiansreport_N.htm|title=Indians have closer in fold, but infield in flux|last=Antonen|first=Mel|date=2008-12-25|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  The Indians, falling to last place for a short time in June and July, traded [[CC Sabathia]] to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] for prospects Matt LaPorta, Rob Bryson, and Michael Brantley.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/sports/baseball/08brewers.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/B/Baseball|title=Looking to Postseason, Brewers Trade for Sabathia |last=Curry|first=Jack|date=2008-07-08|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> and traded starting third basemen, Casey Blake, for catching prospect Carlos Santana.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?pos=C&sid=milb&t=p_pbp&pid=467793}}</ref>  Pitcher [[Cliff Lee]] went 22-3 with an ERA of 2.54 and earned the AL Cy Young Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/11/13/sports/BBA-AL-Cy-Young.php?page=1|title=Cleveland lefty Cliff Lee wins AL Cy Young Award|date=2009-11-13|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> [[Grady Sizemore]] had a career year, winning a [[Gold Glove]] and [[Silver Slugger]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081113&content_id=3678011&vkey=news_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle|title=Sizemore adds Silver Slugger to list|last=Beck|first=Jason|date=2008-11-13|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2009-03-20}}</ref> and the Indians finished with a record of 81-81.

Prospects for the [[2009 Major League Baseball season|season]] dimmed early when the [[2009 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]] ended May with a record of 22-30. Shapiro made multiple trades: [[Cliff Lee]] and [[Ben Francisco]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for prospects [[Jason Knapp]], [[Carlos Carrasco (baseball)|Carlos Carrasco]], [[Jason Donald (baseball)|Jason Donald]] and [[Lou Marson]]; [[Víctor Martínez (baseball)|Victor Martinez]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for prospects [[Bryan Price]], [[Nick Hagadone]] and [[Justin Masterson]]; [[Ryan Garko]] to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Scott Barnes (baseball)|Scott Barnes]]; and [[Kelly Shoppach]] to the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for [[Mitch Talbot]]. The Indians finished the season tied for fourth in their division, with a record of 65-97.

This marked the Indians' first time in postseason play since 2007.  The 2013 season ended for the Indians on October 2, losing 4-0 to the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2013 American League Wild Card Game|2013 AL Wild Card Game]].

==Rivalries==
{{main|Ohio Cup}}

===Interleague===
[[File:OhioCupLogo.jpg|thumb|150px|The Ohio Cup logo]]

The '''[[Ohio Cup]]''' was an annual [[spring training|pre-season]] [[baseball]] game, which pitted the [[Ohio]] rivals Cleveland Indians and [[Cincinnati Reds]].

In its first series it was a single-game cup, played each year at minor-league [[Cooper Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and was staged just days before the start of each new [[Major League Baseball]] season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, in 1989 to 1996, with the Indians winning six of them. It stopped because [[interleague play]] started in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.

In 1997 and after, the two teams competed annually in the regular-season Battle of Ohio/Buckeye Series.  In 2008 the Ohio Cup restarted.  The Indians lead the interleague series 42-39.  The two clubs have played six games against each other every season through 2012, featuring a three game series in each city.  Beginning in 2013, the Indians and Reds will only play four games against each other, two in each city.

The Indians also have had an on-and-off rivalry with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], as the two teams have played an annual three game series during interleague play in June from 1997-2001, and again from 2009-12.  This rivalry stems from the close proximity of the two cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry from the two cities' [[National Football League|NFL]] teams ([[Cleveland Browns|Browns]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]).  Beginning in 2013, the Indians and Pirates will only play each other every third season (when the AL Central plays the NL Central), as MLB assigned each team one "permanent rival."  The Indians' assigned rival is the Reds.

===Divisional===
As the Indians play 19 games every year with their A.L. Central competitors, several rivalries have developed.

The Indians have a rivalry with the [[Detroit Tigers]] due to the fact that the two cities are fairly close to each other, the teams have been battling for the A.L. Central championship in recent years, and has some carryover elements from the [[Ohio State-Michigan rivalry]].

The Indians have had an on and off rivalry with the [[Chicago White Sox]] since the 1959 season (when the Sox slipped past the Tribe to win the A.L. pennant), and has intensified since both clubs moved to the A.L. Central.  Probably the most infamous moment in the White Sox rivalry was in 1994 when the White Sox confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s corked bat, and the ensuing attempt by Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] to crawl through the Comiskey Park (now [[U.S. Cellular Field]]) clubhouse ceiling to retrieve it. Belle later moved to the White Sox in 1997, making the rivalry even more intense.

The Indians also have a divisional rivalry with the [[Kansas City Royals]], mainly due to numerous bench clearing brawls in the recent past.  The rivalry has intensified when Indians closer [[Chris Perez (baseball)|Chris Perez]] used [[WWE]] star [[John Cena]]'s signature "You can't see me" hand gesture towards KC outfielder [[Jarrod Dyson]] after striking him out in a game on May 28, 2012.

==Uniforms==
:''See also: [[Major League Baseball#MLB uniforms]] (including image of baseball-cap logos of the 30 MLB franchises)''
The Indians' home uniform is white with navy piping around each sleeve. Across the front of the jersey in script font is the word "Indians" in red with a navy outline. The jersey has the Chief Wahoo logo on the left sleeve. The home cap is navy blue with a red bill and features the Chief Wahoo logo on the front.

The road uniform is gray, with "Cleveland" in navy blue block letters trimmed in red is across the front of the jersey, navy blue piping around the sleeves, and the Chief Wahoo logo located on the left sleeve. The road cap is navy blue with a red block "C" on the front.

The alternate home uniform is cream colored with "Indians" across the front in red block lettering with a dark navy blue outline. The Chief Wahoo logo is located on the left sleeve. This jersey is the only Indians jersey to not have the players' names on the back. The alternate home cap is red with a navy blue block "C" on the front. This uniform is worn during weekend and holiday home games.

The alternate road jersey is navy blue with white piping around each sleeve. Script "Indians" is located across the front of the jersey in the same fashion as the home uniform (red lettering with a white outline); the Chief Wahoo logo is on the left sleeve.

==Fan support==

===The Drummer===
[[File:John Adams drummer.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[John Adams (drummer)|John Adams]] - who (along with his drum) has been an iconic fixture at Indians home games for 40 years.]]
{{main|John Adams (drummer)}}
John Adams, known by baseball fans as "The Drummer", has played a [[bass drum]] at nearly every home game since 1973. He is the only fan for whom the team has dedicated a [[bobble head]] day.<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Bare |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=No new-school drummer boy |url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060717&content_id=1561217&vkey=cle_gameface&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle |work=[[MLB.com]] |publisher= |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2009-06-08 }}</ref> Adams originally paid for his tickets (one for himself, and one for his drum), but recently the Indians have paid for his seats in honor of the contributions he has made to the ballpark atmosphere. He has been featured in an interview segment in a [[1997 in baseball|1997]] episode of ''[[This Week In Baseball]]''.

===Sellout streak===
Between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001, the Indians sold out 455 consecutive home games, drawing a total of 19,324,248 fans to [[Progressive Field|Jacobs Field]]. The demand for tickets was so great that all 81 home games were sold out before [[Opening Day]] on at least three separate occasions. The sellout streak set a Major League Baseball record; this was broken by the [[Boston Red Sox]] on September 8, 2008, though Boston's [[Fenway Park]] is considerably smaller than Progressive Field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080908&content_id=3440276&vkey=pr_bos&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos |title=Red Sox fans break MLB record for most consecutive sellouts |accessdate=February 9, 2009 |date=September 8, 2008 |publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P.}}</ref> One night after the streak ended, the Indians then honored the fans by retiring the number 455.

==Nickname and logo controversy==
{{further2|[[Native American mascot controversy]]}}
The club nickname and its cartoon logo [[Native American mascot controversy|have been criticized]] for perpetuating Native American stereotypes. In 1997 and 1998, protesters were arrested after effigies were burned. Charges were dismissed in the 1997 case, and were not filed in the 1998 case. Protesters arrested in the 1998 incident subsequently fought and lost a lawsuit alleging that their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights had been violated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courttv.com/archive/verdicts/bellecourt.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012183735/http://courttv.com/archive/verdicts/bellecourt.html |archivedate=2007-10-12 |title=court TV becomes truTV |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1997/cleveland1106.html |title=Workers World Nov. 6, 1997: Native leaders arrested during World Series |publisher=Workers.org |date=1997-11-06 |accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref><ref name=OSSC>{{cite court
