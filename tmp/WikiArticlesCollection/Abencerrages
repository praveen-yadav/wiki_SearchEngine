The '''Abencerrages''' (from the Arabic for "Saddler's Son"),<ref name="CBD">[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 3</ref> were a family or faction that is said to have held a prominent position in the [[Moorish]] [[kingdom of Granada]] in the 15th century.

The name appears to have been derived from Yussuf ben-Serragh, the head of the tribe in the time of [[Mohammed VII of Granada, al-Mustain]], who did that sovereign good service in his struggles to retain the crown of which he was three times deprived.

Little is known of the family with certainty; the [[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]] records that they arrived in Spain in the 8th century<ref name="CBD" /> but the name is familiar from the romance by [[Gines Perez de Hita|Ginés Perez de Hita]], ''Guerras civiles de Granada'', which celebrates the feuds of the Abencerrages and the rival family of the [[Zegris]], and the cruel treatment to which the former were subjected. [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian|J. P. de Florian]]'s ''Gonsalve de Cordoue'' and [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Châteaubriand]]'s ''Le dernier des Abencerrages'' are imitations of Perez de Hita's work.

The story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The king, enraged, shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the [[Alhambra]], and ordered the Zegris to kill them all. The apartment where this is to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages. 

Many poems and plays, and two operas (''[[Les Abencérages]]'', by [[Luigi Cherubini]]'', and [[L'esule di Granata]]'', by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]])<ref>''Zelmar ou L'asile; ou, Les Abencerages'' a drame lyriqueby [[André J. Grétry]], composed in 1801, remained unperformed.</ref> mention the legend, but the whole story is doubtful, because the best historians do not mention it.
