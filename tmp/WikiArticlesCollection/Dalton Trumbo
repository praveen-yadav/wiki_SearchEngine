'''James Dalton Trumbo''' (December 9, 1905 &ndash; September 10, 1976) was an American [[screenwriter]] and [[novelist]].  As one of the [[Hollywood Ten]], he refused to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) in 1947 during the committee's investigation of [[Communist]] influences in the motion picture industry. Trumbo won two [[Academy Awards]] while [[blacklisted]]; one was originally given to a [[front (identity)|front]] writer, and one was awarded to "Robert Rich", Trumbo's pseudonym.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071008054115/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.07.18.html AMPAS Press Release]</ref><ref>[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/trivia.html AMPAS Oscar Trivia]</ref>

Blacklisting effectively ended in 1960 when it lost credibility.  Trumbo was publicly given credit for two blockbuster films: [[Otto Preminger]] made public that Trumbo wrote the screenplay for the smash hit, ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'',<ref>{{cite news |first= Jon |last= Nordheimer |title= Dalton Trumbo, Film Writer, Dies; Oscar Winner Had Been Blacklisted |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F7091EFE395C137B93C3A81782D85F428785F9&scp=3&sq=dalton%20trumbo%20exodus&st=cse |work = The New York Times |page= 17 |date=September 11, 1976 |accessdate= 2008-08-11 |quote= ... it was Otto Preminger, the director, who broke the blacklist months later by publicly announcing that he had hired Mr. Trumbo to do the screenplay ...}}</ref> and [[Kirk Douglas]] publicly announced that Trumbo was the screenwriter of ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Harvey |title=Dalton Trumbo Dies at 70, One of the 'Hollywood 10' |url= |work= Los Angeles Times |page=1 |date=September 10, 1976 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |quote=He recalled how his name returned to the screen in 1960 with the help of ''Spartacus'' star Kirk Douglas: 'I had been working on ''Spartacus'' for about a year ...}}</ref> Further, President [[John F.

On December 19, 2011, The Writers Guild of America announced  that Trumbo was given full credit for his work on the screenplay of the 1953 romantic comedy ''[[Roman Holiday]]'', sixty years after the fact.<ref name=kpcc>{{cite news|last=Cheryl Devall|first=Paige Osburn|title=Blacklisted writer gets credit restored after 60 years for Oscar-winning film|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/12/19/30417/blacklisted-writer-gets-credit-restored-oscar-winn/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|newspaper=89.3 KPCC|date=December 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=latimes-verrier>{{cite news|last=Verrier|first=Richard|title=Writers Guild restores screenplay credit to Trumbo for 'Roman Holiday'|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/12/writers-guild-restores-screenplay-credit-to-trumbo-for-roman-holiday.html|accessdate=December 20, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 19, 2011}}</ref>

==Early life==
Trumbo was born in [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Colorado]], the son of Maud (n√©e Tillery) and Orus Bonham Trumbo. His family moved to [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]] in 1908.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5VdFqKChbUEC&pg=PA12&dq=%22Orus+Bonham+Trumbo%22&hl=en Peter Hanson, ''Dalton Trumbo, Hollywood Rebel: A Critical Survey and Filmography''], McFarland, 2007, p. 12</ref> He was proud of his paternal ancestor, a Franco-Swiss immigrant named Jacob Trumbo (likely anglicized spelling), who settled in the colony of Virginia in 1736.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=FnZBAAAAIAAJ&q=jacob+trumbo+1736+swiss&dq=jacob+trumbo+1736+swiss&hl=en ''Additional Dialogue; Letters of Dalton Trumbo, 1942-1962''], edited by M. Evans, Lippincott, 1970, footnote #10, p. 26</ref> Trumbo graduated from [[Grand Junction High School]]. While still in high school, he worked as a cub reporter for the ''[[Grand Junction Daily Sentinel]]'', covering courts, the high school, the mortuary and civic organizations. He attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] for two years, working as a reporter for the ''Boulder Daily Camera'' and contributing to the campus humor magazine, the yearbook and the campus newspaper. He was also a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] International Fraternity.

For nine years after his father died, he worked the night shift wrapping bread at a Los Angeles bakery, attended [[University of Southern California|USC]], reviewed some movies, and wrote 88 short stories and six novels that were rejected for publication.<ref name=well>{{cite news |last=Well |first=Martin |title=Dalton Trumbo, 70, Dies: Blacklisted Screenwriter |newspaper=Washington Post |date=September 9, 1976 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}.</ref>

==Career==
Trumbo began his writing career in the early 1930s when several of his articles and stories appeared in magazines including the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[McCall's Magazine]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and the ''[[Hollywood Spectator]]'' <ref>{{cite web

 |title      =Dalton Trumbo

 |accessdate =2013, November 16
}}</ref> In 1934 he became managing editor of the Hollywood Spectator and subsequently left to become a reader in the story department at [[Warner Bros.]] studio.<ref name=well/>

He wrote his first published novel, ''[[Eclipse (Trumbo)|Eclipse]]'' (1935), about a town and its people, in the [[social realist]] style, drawing on his years in Grand Junction. The book was controversial in Grand Junction and many people were unhappy with his portrayal. Years after his death, he would be honored with a statue in front of the Avalon Theater on Main Street, where he was depicted writing a screenplay in a bathtub.

He started in movies in 1937 and became one of Hollywood's highest paid writers at about $4000 per week while on assignment,<ref name=nordheimer>Nordheimer 1976.</ref> as much as $80,000 in one year.<ref name=well/> He worked on such films as ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), ''[[Our Vines Have Tender Grapes]]'' (1945), and ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'' (1940), for which he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay]].

Trumbo's 1939 [[anti-war]] novel, ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'', won one of the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|early National Book Awards]]: the Most Original Book of 1939.<ref name=nyt1940>
"1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Groseclose's 'Ararat' is Picked ...", ''The New York Times'', 1940-02-14, page 25. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007).</ref>
It was inspired by an article Trumbo read several years earlier, concerning the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]' hospital visit to a Canadian soldier who had lost all his limbs in [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/johnnygun/context.html Sparknotes.com.] Retrieved 04-12-2010</ref>

==Involvement with communism==

Trumbo aligned himself with the [[Communist Party USA]] before the 1940s,<ref>http://www.humanevents.com/2003/09/02/coulter-and-her-critics/</ref> although he did not join the party until 1943.<ref name=nordheimer/> After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, American communists argued that the United States should not get involved in the war on the side of the [[United Kingdom]], since the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] of nonaggression meant that the [[Soviet Union]] was at peace with [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1941, Trumbo wrote a novel ''The Remarkable Andrew'', in which, in one scene, the ghost of [[Andrew Jackson]] appears in order to caution the United States not to get involved in the war. In a review of the book, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' wrote, "General Jackson's opinions need surprise no one who has observed [[George Washington]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] zealously following the Communist Party Line in recent years."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765251,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Counsel from Hollywood], Time Magazine, February 3, 1941</ref>

Shortly after the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Trumbo and his publisher decided to suspend reprinting of ''Johnny Got His Gun'' until the end of the war. During the war, Trumbo received letters from individuals "denouncing Jews" and using ''Johnny'' to support their arguments for "an immediate negotiated peace" with Nazi Germany; Trumbo reported these correspondents to the [[FBI]].<ref name="pg 5">Dalton Trumbo. ''Johnny Got His Gun''. Citadel Press, 2000, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LnnMLLk2uU4C&pg=PA5&lpg=PP1&output=html&sig=roPgN-QwCYEEj0YKC0GC5dnEfC8 pg 5], introduction</ref> Trumbo regretted this decision, which he called "foolish". After two FBI agents showed up at his home, he understood that "their interest lay not in the letters but in me."<ref name="pg 5"/>

In a 1946 article titled "The Russian Menace" published in Rob Wagner's [[Script Magazine]] Trumbo writes from the perspective of a post-[[World War II]] Russian Citizen. <ref>{{cite web |url        =http://oldmagazinearticles.com/Blacklisted-Hollywood_screenwriter_Dalton_Trumbo_information |title      =The Russia Menace |last       =Trumbo |first      =Dalton |date       =1946, May 26 |website    =OldMagazineArticles.Com |publisher  =Script Magazine |accessdate =2013, November 16}}</ref> While he makes a strong argument that Russian's were likely fearful of the mass of US military power that surrounded them on all sides, at this time, however, when any sympathetic view towards communist countries, especially Russia, was viewed with suspicion.<ref>{{cite web |url        =http://oldmagazinearticles.com/Blacklisted-Hollywood_screenwriter_Dalton_Trumbo_information |title      =The Russia Menace  |last       =Trumbo |first      =Dalton |date       =1946, May 26 |website    =OldMagazineArticles.Com |publisher  =Script Magazine |accessdate =2013, November 16}}</ref> He ends the articles by stating, "If I were a Russian...I would be alarmed, and I would petition my government to take measures at once against what would seems an almost certain blow aimed at my existence. This is how it must appear in Russia today,<ref>{{cite web |url        =http://oldmagazinearticles.com/Blacklisted-Hollywood_screenwriter_Dalton_Trumbo_information |title      =The Russia Menace |last       =Trumbo |first      =Dalton |date       =1946, May 26 |website    =OldMagazineArticles.Com |publisher  =Script Magazine |accessdate =2013, November 16}}</ref>" The fact that, in reading the article it is clear that Trumbo was arguing that the US was a 'menace' to Russia, rather than the more popular American view that Russia was the 'red menace' did little to help Trumbo 11 months later when he would be called to explain himself to the House Un-American Activities Committee. 

Trumbo was a member of the Communist Party USA from 1943 until 1948.<ref>[[Victor Navasky]], ''Naming Names'', New York: Viking, 2003</ref> The scholar Kenneth Billingsley found that Trumbo wrote ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' about films which he said communist influence in Hollywood had prevented from being made: among them were proposed adaptations of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s anti-[[totalitarian]] works ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and ''The Yogi and the Commissar,'' which described the rise of communism in Russia.<ref>[http://www.reason.com/news/show/27732.html Kenneth Billingsley, "Hollywood's Missing Movies: Why American films have ignored life under communism"], ''Reason Magazine'', June 2000</ref>

===Blacklisting===

{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}
In October 1947, drawing upon a list of names that had appeared in the ''Hollywood Reporter'', the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) summoned a number of persons working in the [[Hollywood]] film industry to testify.  The committee had declared its intention to investigate whether Communist agents and sympathizers had been surreptitiously planting propaganda in U.S. films.  Trumbo was one of ten people called. He and the other nine refused to give information. After conviction for [[contempt of Congress]], Trumbo and the others were [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] from working in Hollywood by the heads of the major studios.  In 1950, Dalton served 11 months in prison as punishment for the contempt conviction, in the [[federal penitentiary]] in [[Ashland, Kentucky]].

After Trumbo and the others were blacklisted, some Hollywood actors and directors, such as [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Clifford Odets]], agreed to testify and to provide names of communist party members to Congress.

Trumbo said in a speech given in 1970 that there was blame on all sides:
<blockquote>There was bad faith and good, honesty and dishonesty, courage and cowardice, selflessness and opportunism, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides; and almost every individual involved, no matter where he stood, combined some or all of these antithetical qualities in his own person, in his own acts.<ref name="nytimes"/></blockquote>

==Later life==

After completing his sentence, Trumbo could not get work in California, so he sold his ranch and his family moved to [[Mexico City]]<ref name=nordheimer/> with [[Hugo Butler]] and his wife [[Jean Rouverol]], who had also been blacklisted. He recalled earning $1750 average fee for 18 screenplays in two years and said, "None was very good."<ref name=nordheimer/> In Mexico he wrote 30 scripts under [[pseudonym]]s, such as ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1950), based on a short story by [[MacKinlay Kantor]], who was the front for the screenplay. It was not until 1992 that Trumbo's role was revealed.<ref name=Apostolou>[http://www.mysteryfile.com/Kantor/Crime_Fiction.html John Apostolou, "MacKinlay Kantor"], ''The Armchair Detective'', Spring 1997, republished on ''Mystery File'', accessed 17 Oct 2010</ref>

Gradually the blacklist began to be weakened. With the support of [[Otto Preminger]], Trumbo was credited for his screenplay for the 1960 film ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'', adapted from the novel by [[Leon Uris]]. Shortly thereafter, [[Kirk Douglas]] made public Trumbo's credit for the screenplay for ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960),<ref name="Trumbo">{{IMDb title|0889671|Trumbo (2007)}} Retrieved April 25, 2010.</ref> an event which has been cited as the beginning of the end of the blacklist. Trumbo was reinstated in the [[Writers Guild of America, West]], and was credited on all subsequent scripts.

In 1971, Trumbo directed the [[Johnny Got His Gun (film)|film adaptation of his novel]] ''[[Johnny Got His Gun]]'', which starred [[Timothy Bottoms]], [[Diane Varsi]], [[Jason Robards]] and [[Donald Sutherland]].

One of Trumbo's last films, ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'' (1973), was based on various [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]] about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]].

His account and analysis of the [[Smith Act]] trials is entitled ''The Devil in the Book''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

His son [[Christopher Trumbo]] wrote a play based on his letters during the period of the blacklist, entitled ''Red, White and Blacklisted'' (2003), produced in New York in 2003.  He adapted it as a film, adding material from documentary footage, ''[[Trumbo (film)|Trumbo]]'' (2007).<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=A Voice From the Blacklist: Documentary Lets Dalton Trumbo Speak (Through Surrogates)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/movies/11trumbo.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 11, 2007}}</ref><ref name=latimes>{{cite news|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Christopher Trumbo dies at 70; screen and TV writer whose father was blacklisted|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/12/local/la-me-christopher-trumbo-20110112|accessdate=December 15, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Academy Awards==

Trumbo won an [[Academy award|Oscar]] for ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' (1956), written under the name Robert Rich. In 1975, the Academy officially recognized Trumbo as the winner and presented him with a statuette.

In 1993, Trumbo was posthumously awarded the [[Academy Award]] for writing ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' (1953). The screen credit and award were previously given to [[Ian McLellan Hunter]], who had been a "front" for Trumbo.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.07.18.html "Great To Be Nominated" Enjoys a "Roman Holiday"] AMPAS</ref>

==Personal life==

In 1939, Trumbo married Cleo Fincher. She was born in [[Fresno]] on July 17, 1916, and later moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles. Cleo Trumbo died of natural causes at the age of 93 on October 9, 2009, in the Bay Area city of Los Altos. At the time she was living with her eldest daughter Mitzi.<ref>{{cite news

His daughter Mitzi dated comedian [[Steve Martin]] when they were both in their early 20s, which is recounted in Steve Martin's 2007 book ''[[Born Standing Up]]''. Many of Martin's early promotional photographs were taken by Ms. Trumbo.

In 2003, Christopher Trumbo mounted a Broadway play based on his father's letters called ''Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted,'' in which a wide variety of actors played his father during the run, including [[Nathan Lane]], [[Tim Robbins]], [[Brian Dennehy]], [[Ed Harris]], [[Chris Cooper (actor)|Chris Cooper]] and [[Gore Vidal]]. A documentary about Dalton Trumbo called ''[[Trumbo (film)|Trumbo]]'' was produced in 2007 incorporating elements of the play as well as footage of Dalton Trumbo and a panoply of interviews.<ref>[http://www.ktvu.com/entertainment/26464434/detail.html "Son Of Blacklisted Hollywood Writer Trumbo Dies"] (Jan. 12, 2011) KTVU.com.
