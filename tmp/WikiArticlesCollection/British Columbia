'''British Columbia''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-ca-BritishColumbia.ogg|ˌ|b|r|ɪ|t|ɪ|ʃ|_|k|ə|ˈ|l|ʌ|m|b|i|ə}}, also commonly referred to by its initials '''BC''' or '''B.C.''', ({{lang-fr|Colombie-Britannique}}, ''C.-B.'') is the westernmost [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Canada]]. In 1871, it became the sixth province of Canada. British Columbia is also a component of the [[Pacific Northwest]], along with the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebratebig.com/pacific-northwest/index.htm |title=Pacific Northwest Washington Oregon British Columbia |publisher=Celebratebig.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cooltrails.com/ |title=Northwest Hiking Trails - Washington, Oregon, Idaho |publisher=Cooltrails.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}</ref> The province's name was chosen by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1858, reflecting its origins as the British remainder of the [[Columbia District]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Its [[Latin]] motto is ''Splendor sine occasu'' ("Splendour without Diminishment").

The capital of British Columbia is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|15th largest metropolitan region]] in Canada, named for the Queen that created the Colony of British Columbia. The largest city is [[Vancouver]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Canada, the largest in [[Western Canada]], and the second largest in the [[Pacific Northwest]].  In 2012, British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,622,573 (about two and a half million of whom were in [[Greater Vancouver]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Demography/PopulationEstimates.aspx |title=Population Estimates, British Columbia and Sub-Provincial |publisher=BC Stats|date=December, 2012|accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref> The province is currently governed by the [[BC Liberal Party]], led by [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Christy Clark]], who became leader as a result of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party leadership elections|party election]] on February 26, 2011 and who led her party to an election victory on May 14, 2013.

British Columbia's economy is largely resource-based. It is the endpoint of transcontinental railways and the site of major Pacific ports, which enable international trade. Though less than five percent of its vast {{convert|944735|km2|abbr=on}} land is arable, the province is agriculturally rich (particularly in the [[Fraser Valley|Fraser]] and [[Okanagan]] Valleys) because of its mild weather. Its climate encourages [[outdoor recreation]] and [[tourism]], though its economic mainstay has long been [[resource extraction]], principally logging, farming, and mining. [[Vancouver]], the province's largest city and metropolitan area, also serves as the headquarters of many of the Western-based natural resource companies. It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per-capita income well above the national average. While the coast of BC and certain valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather, the majority of BC's land mass experiences a cold winter temperate climate similar to the rest of Canada. The Northeast corner of BC has a [[Subarctic climate]] with very cold winters.

==Etymology==

The province's name was chosen by [[Queen Victoria]] when the [[Colony of British Columbia]], i.e. "the Mainland", became a British colony in 1858.<ref>Ged Martin, "The Naming of British Columbia," ''Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies,'' Vol. 10, No. 3 (Autumn, 1978), pp. 257–263 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4048132 in JSTOR]</ref> It refers to the [[Columbia District]], the British name for the territory drained by the [[Columbia River]],  in southeastern British Columbia, which was the namesake of the pre-[[Oregon Treaty]] Columbia Department of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Queen Victoria chose ''British'' Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from that of the [[United States]] ("American Columbia" or "Southern Columbia"), which became the [[Oregon Territory]] in 1848 as a result of the treaty.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of British Columbia}}
[[File:BC-relief.png|thumb|right|British Columbia's [[geography]] is epitomized by the variety and intensity of its physical relief, which has defined patterns of [[Human settlement|settlement]] and industry since colonization.]]

British Columbia is bordered by the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the west side, by the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] on the northwest as well as parts of the west, on the north by [[Yukon]] and the [[Northwest Territories]], on the east by the province of [[Alberta]], and on the south by the U.S. states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. The current [[Definitions of Canadian borders#British Columbia|southern border of British Columbia]] was established by the 1846 Oregon Treaty, although its history is tied with lands as far south as [[California]]. British Columbia's land area is {{convert|944735|km2|-2}}. [[British Columbia Coast|British Columbia's rugged coastline]] stretches for more than {{convert|27000|km}}, and includes deep, mountainous fjords and about six thousand islands, most of which are uninhabited.

British Columbia's capital is Victoria, located at the southeastern tip of [[Vancouver Island]]. The province's most populous city is Vancouver, which is not on Vancouver Island but rather is located in the southwest corner of the mainland (an area often called the [[Lower Mainland]]). By area, [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] is the largest city. [[Vanderhoof, British Columbia|Vanderhoof]] is near the geographic centre of the province.<ref>{{cite web
 | title = Vanderhoof
 | publisher = Tourism BC
 | url = http://www.hellobc.com/en-CA/RegionsCities/Vanderhoof.htm
 | accessdate =April 26, 2007}}</ref>

The [[Coast Mountains]] and the [[Inside Passage]]'s many [[fjord|inlets]] provide some of British Columbia's renowned and spectacular scenery, which forms the backdrop and context for a growing outdoor adventure and [[ecotourism]] industry. Seventy-five percent of the province is mountainous (more than {{convert|1000|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]); 60% is forested; and only about 5% is arable.

The [[Okanagan area (wine)|Okanagan area]] is one of several wine-producing regions in Canada and also produces [[cider]]s; other wine regions in British Columbia include the [[Cowichan Valley]] on Vancouver Island, and the [[Fraser Valley]]. The cities of Kamloops and [[Penticton]], and rural towns of [[Oliver, British Columbia|Oliver]], and [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] have some of the warmest and longest summer climates in Canada, although their temperature ranges are exceeded by the warmer [[Fraser Canyon]] towns of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]] and [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]], where shade temperatures on summer afternoons often surpass {{convert|40|C}} but with very low humidity.

Much of the western part of Vancouver Island and the rest of the coast is covered by [[temperate rainforest]]. The province's mainland away from the coastal regions is not as moderated by the Pacific Ocean and ranges from desert and [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] plateau to the range and canyon districts of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central and Southern Interior]] to boreal forest and sub-arctic prairie in the [[British Columbia Interior|Northern Interior]].

A few [[Southern Interior]] valleys have short cold winters with infrequent heavy snow, while those in the [[Cariboo]], the southern part of the [[British Columbia Interior#Central Interior|Central Interior]], are colder because of their altitude and latitude, but without the intensity or duration experienced at similar latitudes elsewhere in Canada. The northern two-thirds of the province is largely unpopulated and undeveloped, and is mostly mountainous except east of the [[Canadian Rockies|Rockies]], where the [[Peace River Country|Peace River District]], in the northeast of the province contains BC's portion of the [[Canadian Prairies]].

===Climate===
[[File:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Strait of Georgia]], near [[Vancouver]].]]
As a result of [[Japan Current|Kuroshio Current]] (also known as the Japan Current), which crosses the North Pacific Ocean, coastal British Columbia has a mild, rainy oceanic climate.The climate due to the blocking presence of successive mountain ranges, the Interior of the province has a semi-arid climate with certain locations receiving less than 250&nbsp;mm (10") in annual precipitation. The annual mean temperature in the most populated areas of the province are above {{convert|10|C|0}}, the mildest anywhere in Canada.

Winters can be severe in the Interior and the North. For example, the average overnight low in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (roughly located in the middle of the province) in January is {{convert|-14|C|0}}. The coldest temperature in British Columbia was recorded in [[Smith River, British Columbia|Smith River]], where it dropped to {{convert|-58.9|C|0}},<ref name=KCH-WD2-2002>{{cite web|last=Heidorn|first=Keith C.|title=NORTH AMERICA'S RECORD COLD|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/almanac/arc2002/alm02feb.htm|publisher=The Weather Doctor Almanac|accessdate=July 14, 2012|year=2002}}</ref> one of the coldest readings recorded anywhere in North America. Southern Interior valleys have shorter winters with brief bouts of cold. Heavy snowfall occurs in the Coast, Columbia and Rocky Mountains providing healthy bases for skiers.

On the Coast, rainfall, sometimes relentless heavy rain, dominates in winter because of consistent barrages of cyclonic low-pressure systems from the North Pacific, but on occasion (and not every winter) heavy snowfalls and below freezing temperatures arrive when modified arctic air reaches coastal areas, typically for short periods. On the opposite extreme, summers in the Southern Interior valleys are hot; for example in [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] the July Maximum averages {{convert|31.7|C|0}}, hot weather sometimes moves towards the Coast or to the far north of the province. Temperatures exceed {{convert|40|C|0}} in the lower elevations of interior valleys during mid-summer, with the record high of {{convert|44.4|C}} being held in [[Lytton, British Columbia|Lytton]] on July 16, 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climateData/dailydata_e.html?timeframe=2&Prov=CA&StationID=966&Year=1941&Month=7&Day=26 |title=Daily Data Report for July 1941 |publisher=Climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca |date=September 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Vineyards Lake Okanagan.jpg|thumb|200px|The Okanagan region has a climate suitable to vineyards.]]

The extended summer dryness often creates conditions that spark forest fires, from dry-lightning or man-made causes. Coastal areas are generally milder and dry during summer, under the influence of stable anti-cyclonic high pressure much of the time. Many areas of the province are often covered by a blanket of heavy cloud and low fog during winter, despite sunny summers. Annual sunshine hours vary from 2200 near Cranbrook and Victoria to less than 1300 in [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], located on the [[British Columbia Coast#North Coast|North Coast]], just south of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].

The exception to British Columbia's wet and cloudy winters is El Niño. During this phase, the jet stream is much further south across North America, therefore winters are milder and drier than normal. Winters are much wetter and cooler under the opposite phase, La Niña.

===Parks and protected areas===
{{Main|List of protected areas of British Columbia|List of British Columbia Provincial Parks}}
[[File:Mount Robson2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Robson]], [[Canadian Rockies]], BC]]

There are 14 designations of parks and protected areas in the province that reflects the different administration and creation of these areas in a modern context. There are 141 ecological Reserves, 35 provincial marine parks, 7 Provincial Heritage Sites, 6 [[National Historic Sites of Canada]], 4 [[National park|National Parks]] and 3 National Park Reserves. 12.5% ({{convert|114000|km2|abbr=on}}) of British Columbia is currently considered protected under one of the 14 different designations that includes over 800 distinct areas.

British Columbia contains seven of [[National Parks of Canada|Canada's national parks]]:
* [[Glacier National Park (Canada)|Glacier National Park]]
* [[Gulf Islands National Park Reserve]]
* [[Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site]]
* [[Kootenay National Park]]
* [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]]
* [[Pacific Rim National Park Reserve]]
* [[Yoho National Park]]

British Columbia also contains a large network of [[provincial park]]s, run by BC Parks of the Ministry of Environment. British Columbia's provincial parks system is the second largest parks system in Canada (the largest is Canada's National Parks system).

Another tier of parks in British Columbia are [[regional park]]s, which are maintained and run by [[regional districts]].

In addition to these areas, over {{convert|47000|km2|abbr=on}} of [[arable land]] are protected by the [[Agricultural Land Reserve]].

===Fauna===
[[File:TakakkawFalls2 edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yoho National Park]]]]
Much of the province is wild or semi-wild, so that populations of many mammalian species that have become rare in much of the United States still flourish in British Columbia. Watching animals of various sorts, including a very wide range of birds, has also long been popular. Bears ([[Grizzly Bear|grizzly]], [[American Black Bear|black]], and the [[Kermode bear]] or spirit bear—found only in British Columbia) live here, as do [[deer]], [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[Bighorn Sheep|big-horn sheep]], [[mountain goat]]s, [[marmot]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[muskrat]], [[coyote]]s, [[Gray Wolf|wolves]], [[mustelidae|mustelids]] (such as [[wolverine]]s, [[badger]]s and [[fisher (animal)|fishers]]), [[cougar]], [[eagle]]s, [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s, [[Canada Goose|Canada geese]], [[swan]]s, [[loon]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[raven]]s, [[Harlequin Duck]]s, and many other sorts of ducks. Smaller birds ([[American Robin|robins]], [[jay]]s, [[grosbeak]]s, [[Tit (bird)|chickadees]], and so on) also abound.

Healthy populations of many sorts of fish are found in the waters (including [[salmonidae|salmonids]] such as several species of [[salmon]], [[trout]], [[Salvelinus|char]], and so on.). Besides salmon and trout, sport-fishers in BC also catch [[halibut]], [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[sturgeon]]. On the coastlines, [[Harbor Seal]]s and [[North American River Otter|river otter]]s are common. [[Cetacea]]n species native to the coast include the [[Killer whale|Orca]], [[Gray Whale]], [[Harbour Porpoise]], [[Dall's Porpoise]], [[Pacific White-sided Dolphin]] and [[Minke Whale]].

[[File:Cheakamuslake.JPG|thumb|[[Cheakamus Lake]] at dawn, in [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]], BC]]
British Columbian introduced species include: common [[Taraxacum|dandelion]], [[Common Pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]], [[Pacific oyster]], [[brown trout]], [[black slug]], [[European Starling]], [[cowbird]], [[Centaurea|knapweed]], [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]], [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]], [[Cytisus scoparius|Scotch broom]], [[Rubus armeniacus|Himalayan blackberry]], [[Forficula auricularia|European earwig]], [[tent caterpillar]], [[Woodlouse|sowbug]], gray [[squirrel]], Asian [[longhorn beetle]], [[Hedera helix|English ivy]], [[Fallow Deer]], [[thistle]], [[gorse]], Norway [[rat]], crested [[myna]]h, and Asian or European [[gypsy moth]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}<!-- In particular, Brown-headed Cowbird is a native North American species -->

==History==
{{Main|History of British Columbia}}

===Fur trade and colonial era===
The discovery of stone tools on the [[Beatton River]] near [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] date human habitation in British Columbia to at least 11,500 years ago. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] spread throughout the region, achieving a high [[population density]]; at the time of European contact, nearly half the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal people in present-day Canada]] lived in the region. During the 1770s, [[smallpox]] killed at least 30% of the Pacific Northwest [[First Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lange |first=Greg |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5100 |title=Smallpox epidemic ravages Native Americans on the northwest coast of North America in the 1770s. |publisher=Historylink.org |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> This epidemic was the first and the most devastating of a number that were to follow, other than the Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1862 which killed off 50% of the native population in that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.php?id=4547 |title=Plagues and Peoples on the Northwest Coast |publisher=.h-net.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Kwakiutl house pole InvMH975-123-1 .jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kwakwaka'wakw]] [[Totem pole|house pole]], second half of the 19th century]]
The arrival of Europeans began around the mid-18th century, as [[fur trade]]rs entered the area to harvest [[sea otter]]s. While it is thought that [[Sir Francis Drake]] may have explored the British Columbian coast in 1579, it was [[Juan José Pérez Hernández|Juan Pérez]] who completed the first documented voyage, which took place in 1774. [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] explored the coast in 1775. In doing so, Pérez and Quadra reasserted the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] claim for the [[Pacific coast]], first made by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] in 1513.
The explorations of [[James Cook]] in 1778 and [[George Vancouver]] in 1792-93 established British jurisdiction over the coastal area north and west of the Columbia River. In 1793, [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] was the first European to journey across North America overland to the Pacific Ocean, inscribing a stone marking his accomplishment on the shoreline of [[Dean Channel]] near [[Bella Coola, British Columbia|Bella Coola]]. His expedition theoretically established British sovereignty inland, and a succession of other fur company explorers charted the maze of rivers and mountain ranges between the Canadian Prairies and the Pacific. Mackenzie and these other explorers—notably [[John Finlay (fur trader)|John Finlay]], [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]], [[Samuel Black]], <!--also John Campbell and others but they're less well-known, though in some ways no less important; Black in particular-->and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]]—were primarily concerned with extending the [[fur trade]], rather than political considerations. In 1794, by the third of a series of agreements known as the [[Nootka Convention]]s, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] conceded its claims of exclusivity in the Pacific. This opened the way for formal claims and colonization by other powers, including Britain, but because of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] there was little British action on its claims in the region until later.

The establishment of [[trading post]]s under the auspices of the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), effectively established a permanent British presence in the region. The Columbia District, broadly defined as being south of 54°40 north latitude, (the southern limit of [[Russian colonization of the Americas|Russian America]]) and north of Mexican Controlled California west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was, by the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], under the "joint occupancy and use" of citizens of the United States and subjects of Britain (which is to say, the fur companies). This co-occupancy was ended with the Oregon Treaty of 1846.

The major supply route was the [[York Factory Express]] between [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Fort Vancouver]]. Some of the early outposts grew into settlements, communities, and cities. Among the places in British Columbia that began as fur trading posts are Fort St. John (established 1794); [[Hudson's Hope, British Columbia|Hudson's Hope]] (1805); [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] (1805); [[Fort St. James, British Columbia|Fort St. James]] (1806); [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] (1807); Kamloops (1812); [[Fort Langley, British Columbia|Fort Langley]] (1827); [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] (1843); [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]] (1848); and Nanaimo (1853). Fur company posts that became cities in what is now the United States include [[Vancouver, Washington]] ([[Fort Vancouver]]), formerly the "capital" of Hudson's Bay operations in the Columbia District, [[Colville, Washington]] and [[Walla Walla, Washington]] (old [[Fort Nez Percés]]).

With the amalgamation of the two fur trading companies in 1821, the region now comprising British Columbia existed in three fur trading departments. The bulk of the central and northern interior was organized into the [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]] district, administered from Fort St. James. The interior south of the [[Thompson River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] and north of the Columbia was organized into the Columbia District, administered from Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River. The northeast corner of the province east of the Rockies, known as the Peace River Block, was attached to the much larger [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca District]], headquartered in [[Fort Chipewyan, Alberta|Fort Chipewyan]], in present day Alberta.

Until 1849, these districts were a wholly unorganized area of [[British North America]] under the [[de facto]] jurisdiction of HBC administrators. Unlike [[Rupert's Land]] to the north and east, however, the territory was not a concession to the company. Rather, it was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants. All that was changed with the westward extension of American exploration and the concomitant overlapping claims of territorial sovereignty, especially in the southern [[Columbia Basin|Columbia basin]] (within present day Washington and [[Oregon]]). In 1846, the Oregon Treaty divided the territory along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] to the [[Strait of Georgia]], with the area south of this boundary (excluding Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]) transferred to sole American sovereignty. The [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] was created in 1849, with Victoria designated as the capital. New Caledonia, as the whole of the mainland rather than just its north-central Interior came to be called, continued to be an unorganized territory of British North America, "administered" by individual HBC trading post managers.

With the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] in 1858, an influx of Americans into New Caledonia prompted the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial office]] to formally designate the mainland as the [[Colony of British Columbia]], with New Westminster as its capital. A series of gold rushes in various parts of the province followed, the largest being the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]] in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom communities like [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] and Lillooet, which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in 1866.

===Rapid growth and development===
[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]] drives the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia|Craigellachie]], November 7, 1885. Completion of the [[transcontinental railroad]] was a condition of entry into [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]

The Confederation League, including such figures as [[Amor De Cosmos]], [[John Robson (politician)|John Robson]], and [[Robert Beaven]], led the chorus pressing for the colony to join Canada, which had been created out of three British North American colonies in 1867 (the [[Province of Canada]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]). Several factors motivated this agitation, including the fear of annexation to the United States, the overwhelming debt created by rapid population growth, the need for government-funded services to support this population, and the economic depression caused by the end of the gold rush.

With the agreement by the Canadian government to extend the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to British Columbia and to assume the colony's debt, British Columbia became the sixth province to join [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] on July 20, 1871. The borders of the province were not completely settled.  The Treaty of Washington sent the [[Pig War]] San Juan Islands Border dispute to arbitration in 1871 and in 1903, the province's territory shrank again after the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] settled the vague boundary of the [[Alaska Panhandle]].

Population in British Columbia continued to expand as the province's [[mining]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fishery|fishing]] sectors were developed. Mining activity was particularly notable throughout the Mainland, particularly in the [[Boundary Country]], in the [[Slocan Valley|Slocan]], in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]] around [[Trail, British Columbia|Trail]], the East Kootenay (the southeast corner of the province), the Fraser Canyon, the [[Cariboo District|Cariboo]], the [[Omineca Country|Omineca]] and the [[Cassiar Country|Cassiar]], so much so a common epithet for the Mainland, even after provincehood, was "the Gold Colony".<!--cite is the Akriggs, and Howay, and Ormsby, and others--> Agriculture attracted settlers to the fertile Fraser Valley, and cattle ranchers and later fruit growers came to the drier grasslands of the Thompson River area, the Cariboo, the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]], and the Okanagan. Forestry drew workers to the lush temperate rainforests of the coast, which was also the locus of a growing fishery.

The completion of the railway in 1885 was a huge boost to the province's economy, facilitating the transportation of the region's considerable resources to the east. The milltown of Granville, known as [[Gastown]], near the mouth of the [[Burrard Inlet]] was selected as the terminus of the railway, prompting the incorporation of the City as Vancouver in 1886. The completion of the [[Port of Vancouver]] spurred rapid growth, and in less than fifty years the city surpassed [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], as the largest in [[Western Canada]]. The early decades of the province were ones in which issues of land use—specifically, its settlement and development—were paramount. This included expropriation from First Nations people of their land, control over its resources, as well as the ability to trade in some resources (such as the fishery).

Establishing a [[labor force|labour force]] to develop the province was problematic from the start, and British Columbia was the locus of immigration from [[Europe]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]. The influx of a non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] population stimulated resentment from the dominant ethnic groups, resulting in agitation (much of it successful) to restrict the ability of [[Asian people]] to immigrate to British Columbia through the imposition of a [[Poll tax|head tax]]. This resentment culminated in mob attacks against Chinese and Japanese immigrants in Vancouver in 1887 and 1907. By 1923, almost all [[Chinese Immigration Act, 1923|Chinese immigration had been blocked]] except for merchants, professionals, students and investors.

Meanwhile, the province continued to grow. In 1914, the last spike of a second transcontinental rail line, the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk Pacific]], linking north-central British Columbia from the [[Yellowhead Pass]] through Prince George to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]] was driven at [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]]. This opened up the [[British Columbia Coast|North Coast]] and the [[Bulkley Valley]] region to new economic opportunities. What had previously been an almost exclusively fur trade and subsistence economy soon became a locus for forestry, farming, and mining.

===1920s through 1940s===
When the men returned from [[World War I]], they discovered the recently enfranchised women of the province had helped vote in the [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of liquor in an effort to end the social problems associated with the hard-core drinking that Vancouver and the rest of the province was famous for until the war. Because of pressure from veterans, prohibition was quickly relaxed so that the "soldier and the working man" could enjoy a drink, but widespread unemployment among veterans was hardened by many of the available jobs being taken by European immigrants and disgruntled veterans organized a range of "soldier parties" to represent their interests, variously named Soldier-Farmer, Soldier-Labour, and [[Labour candidates and parties in Canada|Farmer-Labour]] Parties. These formed the basis of the fractured labour-political spectrum that would generate a host of fringe leftist and rightist parties, including those who would eventually form the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|Co-operative Commonwealth]] and the early [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] splinter groups.
[[File:Japanese internment camp in British Columbia.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese Canadian internment|Internment camp]] for the [[Japanese Canadians]] during [[World War II]]]]

The advent of [[prohibition in the United States]] created new opportunities, and many found employment or at least profit in cross-border liquor smuggling. Much of Vancouver's prosperity and opulence in the 1920s results from this "pirate economy", although growth in forestry, fishing and mining continued. The end of U.S. prohibition, combined with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], plunged the province into economic destitution. Compounding the already dire local economic situation, tens of thousands of men from colder parts of Canada swarmed into Vancouver, creating huge [[hobo]] jungles around [[False Creek]] and the Burrard Inlet [[Classification yard|rail yards]], including the old Canadian Pacific Railway mainline [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] through the heart of the [[Downtown Vancouver|city's downtown]] (at Hastings and Carrall). Increasingly desperate times led to intense political organizing efforts, an occupation of the main Post Office at [[Granville Street|Granville]] and [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] which was violently put down by the police and an effective imposition of [[martial law]] on the docks for almost three years. A Vancouver contingent for the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] was organized and seized a train, which was loaded with thousands of men bound for the capital but was met by a [[Gatling gun]] straddling the tracks at [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]; the men were arrested and sent to work camps for the duration of the Depression.<ref>''Carved From Wood; Mission BC 1861-1992'', Andreas Schroeder, publ. The Mission Foundation (1992) ISBN 1-55056-131-6m, ISBN 978-1-55056-131-9, ASIN: B000B8XZNA</ref>

There were some signs of economic life beginning to return to normal towards the end of the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce as never before.

British Columbia has long taken advantage of its location on the Pacific Ocean to have close relations with [[East Asia]]. However, this has often caused friction between cultures which have caused occasional displays of animosity toward Asian immigrants. This was most manifest during the Second World War when many people of [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese descent were relocated]] or interned in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] of the province.

===Coalition and the post-War boom===
[[File:British Columbia Regiment 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught's Own)|BC Regiment (DCOR)]], marching in [[New Westminster]], 1940.]]
During [[World War II]] the mainstream [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] and [[British Columbia Conservative Party|BC Conservative]] Parties of British Columbia united in a formal [[coalition government]] under new Liberal leader [[John Hart (Canadian politician)|John Hart]], who replaced [[Thomas Dufferin Pattullo|Duff Pattullo]] when the latter failed to win a majority in the [[British Columbia general election, 1941|1941 election]]. While the Liberals won the most number of seats, they actually received fewer votes than the socialist [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). Pattullo was unwilling to form a coalition with the rival Conservatives led by [[Royal Maitland]] and was replaced by Hart who formed a coalition cabinet made up of five Liberal and three Conservative ministers.<ref name=con/> The CCF was invited to join the coalition but refused.<ref name=con/>

The pretext for continuing the coalition after the end of World War II was to prevent the CCF, which had won a surprise victory in [[Saskatchewan]] in 1944, from ever coming to power in British Columbia. The CCF's popular vote was high enough in the [[British Columbia general election, 1945|1945 election]] that they were likely to have won three-way contests and could have formed government. However, the coalition prevented that by uniting the anti-[[socialism|socialist]] vote.<ref name=con/> In the post-war environment the government initiated a series of infrastructure projects, notably the completion of [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] north of Prince George to the Peace River Block, a section called the John Hart Highway and also public hospital insurance.

In 1947 the reins of the Coalition were taken over by [[Byron Ingemar Johnson]]. The Conservatives had wanted their new leader [[Herbert Anscomb]] to be premier, but the Liberals in the Coalition refused. Johnson led the coalition to the highest percentage of the popular vote in British Columbia history (61%) in the [[British Columbia general election, 1949|1949 election]]. This victory was attributable to the popularity of his government's spending programmes, despite rising criticism of corruption and abuse of power. During his tenure, major infrastructure continued to expand, and the agreement with [[Rio Tinto Alcan|Alcan]] to build the [[Kemano, British Columbia|Kemano]]-[[Kitimat, British Columbia|Kitimat]] [[hydroelectricity|hydro]] and aluminum complex was put in place.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA102&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true "Boom in the Big Triangle."] ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1952, pp. 102-107/246.</ref> Johnson achieved popularity for flood relief efforts during the 1948 flooding of the Fraser Valley, which was a major blow to that region and to the province's economy.

Increasing tension between the Liberal and Conservative coalition partners led the Liberal Party executive to vote to instruct Johnson to terminate the arrangement. Johnson ended the coalition and dropped his Conservative cabinet ministers, including [[Deputy Prime Minister|Deputy Premier]] and [[Finance minister|Finance Minister]] Herbert Anscomb, precipitating the [[British Columbia general election, 1952|general election of 1952]].<ref name=con>Hans J. Michelmann, David E. Smith, Cristine De Clercy ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=d7iLYjWHvS8C&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=herbert+anscomb+conservative#PPA184,M1 Continuity And Change in Canadian Politics: Essays in Honour of David E. Smith]'', University of Toronto Press (2006), page 184</ref> A referendum on electoral reform <!--in 1950? I think; BC referenda/plebiscites need a history/list article of their own--> prior to this election had instigated an elimination ballot (similar to a [[Ranked voting systems|preferential ballot]]), where voters could select second and third choices. The intent of the ballot, as campaigned for by Liberals and Conservatives, was that their supporters would list the rival party in lieu of the CCF, but this plan backfired when a large group of voters from all major parties, including the CCF, voted for the fringe British Columbia Social Credit Party (Socreds), who wound up with the largest number of seats in the House (19), only one seat ahead of the CCF, despite the CCF having 34.3% of the vote to Social Credit's 30.18%.

The Social Credit Party, led by rebel former Conservative MLA [[W. A. C. Bennett]], formed a [[minority government]] backed by the Liberals and Conservatives (with 6 and 4 seats respectively). Bennett began a series of fiscal reforms, preaching a new variety of [[populism]] as well as waxing eloquent on progress and development, laying the ground for a [[British Columbia general election, 1953|second election in 1953]] in which the new Bennett regime secured a majority of seats, with 38% of the vote.  Secure with that majority, Bennett returned the province to the first-past-the-post system thereafter, which is still in use today.

===Growth of government in the economy===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:I 61926.gif|left|thumb|upright|Premier [[W. A. C. Bennett]] and his wife accompany [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] in Victoria, August 1958. Bennett's Socreds governed the province for an unprecedented twenty years]] -->

With the election of the Social Credit Party, British Columbia embarked a phase of rapid [[economic development]]. Bennett and his party governed the province for the next twenty years, during which time the government initiated an ambitious programme of infrastructure development, fuelled by a sustained economic boom in the forestry, mining, and energy sectors.

During these two decades, the government [[nationalization|nationalized]] British Columbia Electric and the British Columbia Power Company, as well as smaller electric companies, renaming the entity [[BC Hydro]]. By the end of the 1960s, several major dams had been begun or completed in—among others—the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Columbia, and [[Nechako River]] watersheds. Major transmission deals were concluded, most notably the [[Columbia River Treaty]] between Canada and the United States. The province's economy was also boosted by unprecedented growth in the forest sector, as well as oil and gas development in the province's northeast.

The 1950s and 1960s were also marked by development in the province's transportation infrastructure. In 1960, the government established [[BC Ferries]] as a [[Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]], in order to provide a marine extension of the provincial highway system. That system was improved and expanded through the construction of new highways and bridges, and paving of existing highways and provincial roads.

Vancouver and Victoria become cultural centres as poets, authors, artists, musicians, as well as dancers, actors, and ''haute cuisine'' chefs flocked to the beautiful scenery and warmer temperatures. Similarly, these cities have either attracted or given rise to their own noteworthy academics, commentators, and creative thinkers.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Tourism also began to play an important role in the economy. The rise of Japan and other Pacific economies was a great boost to British Columbia's economy.

Politically and socially, the 1960s brought a period of significant social ferment. The divide between the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] and right, which had prevailed in the province since the Depression and the rise of the [[labour movement]], sharpened as so-called [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] parties coalesced into the defacto coalition represented by Social Credit—in opposition to the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], the successor to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. As the province's economy blossomed, so did labour-management tensions. Tensions emerged, also, from the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, of which Vancouver and Nanaimo were centres. The conflict between [[hippie]]s and [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver mayor]] [[Tom Campbell (Canadian politician)|Tom Campbell]] was particularly legendary, culminating in the so-called [[Gastown Riots]] of 1971. By the end of the decade, with social tensions and dissatisfaction with the [[status quo]] rising, the Bennett government's achievements could not stave off its growing unpopularity.

===1970s and 1980s===
On August 27, 1969, the Social Credit Party was re-elected in a general election for what would be Bennett's final term in power. At the start of the 1970s, the economy was quite strong because of rising coal prices and an increase in annual allowable cuts in the forestry sector. However, BC Hydro reported its first loss, which was the beginning of the end for Bennett and the Social Credit Party.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061020072258/http://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/PubDocs/bcdocs/37907/electoral_history.pdf | archivedate= October 20, 2006 | title= Electoral History of British Columbia 1871–1986 | author= Elections BC | year= 1998 | accessdate=April 26, 2007}}</ref>

The Socreds were forced from power in the August 1972 election, paving the way for a provincial New Democratic Party (NDP) government under [[Dave Barrett]]. Under Barrett, the large provincial surplus soon became a deficit,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} although changes to the accounting system makes it likely that some of the deficit was carried over from the previous Social Credit regime and its "[[two sets of books]]", as WAC Bennett had once referred to his system of fiscal management. The brief three-year ("Thousand Days") period of NDP governance brought several lasting changes to the province, most notably the creation of the Agricultural Land Reserve, intended to protect farmland from redevelopment, and the [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]], a crown corporation charged with a monopoly on providing single-payer basic automobile insurance.

Perceptions that the government had instituted reforms either too swiftly or that were too far-reaching, coupled with growing labour disruptions led to the ouster of the NDP in the [[British Columbia general election, 1975|1975 general election]]. Social Credit, under W.A.C. Bennett's son, [[Bill Bennett]], was returned to office. Under the younger Bennett's government, 85% of the province's land base was transferred from Government Reserve to management by the [[Ministry of Forests]], reporting of deputy ministers was centralized to the Premier's Office, and NDP-instigated social programs were rolled back, with then-Human Resources Minister infamously demonstrating a golden shovel to highlight his welfare policy, although the new-era Socreds also reinforced and backed certain others instigated by the NDP—notably the creation of the [[Whistler, British Columbia|Resort Municipality of Whistler]], whose special status including Sunday drinking, then an anomaly in BC.

Also during the "MiniWac" regime (a reference to his father's acronym, WAC) certain money-losing Crown-owned assets were "privatized" in a mass giveaway of shares in the [[British Columbia Resources Investment Corporation]], "BCRIC", with the "Brick shares" soon becoming near-worthless. Towards the end of his tenure in power, Bennett oversaw the completion of several [[megaproject]]s meant to stimulate the economy and win votes - unlike most right-wing parties, British Columbia's Social Credit actively practiced government stimulation of the economy. Most notable of these was the winning of a world's fair for Vancouver, which came in the form of [[Expo 86]], to which was tied the construction of the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] and Vancouver's [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system. The Coquihalla Highway project became the subject of a scandal after revelations that the premier's brother bought large tracts of land needed for the project before it was announced to the public, and also because of graft investigations of the huge cost overruns on the project. Both investigations were derailed in the media by a still further scandal, the [[Doman Scandal]], in which the Premier and millionaire backer Herb Doman were investigated for insider-trading and [[securities fraud]]. Nonetheless, the Socreds were re-elected in 1979 under Bennett, who led the party until 1986.

[[File:Coquilhalla Highway.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Coquihalla Highway]]. The road was one of the legacies of the [[Expo 86]] [[World's fair]]. The creation of the [[toll road|toll highway]] sparked controversy.]]

As the province entered a sustained [[recession]], Bennett's popularity and media image were in decline. On April 1, 1983, Premier Bennett overstayed his constitutional limits of power by exceeding the legal tenure of a government, and the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant-Governor]], [[Henry Pybus Bell-Irving]], was forced to call Bennett to [[Government House (British Columbia)|Government House]] to resolve the impasse, and an election was called for April 30, while in the meantime government cheques were covered by special emergency warrants as the [[Executive Council of British Columbia|Executive Council]] no longer had signing authority because of the constitutional crisis. Campaigning on a platform of moderation, Bennett won an unexpected majority.

After several weeks of silence in the aftermath, a sitting of the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|House]] was finally called and in the [[speech from the throne|speech from the Throne]] the Socreds instituted a programme of fiscal cutbacks dubbed "restraint", which had been a buzzword for moderation during the campaign. The programme included cuts to "motherhood" issues of the left, including the human rights branch, the offices of the Ombudsman and Rentalsman, women's programs, environmental and cultural programs, while still supplying mass capital infusions to corporate British Columbia. This sparked a backlash, with tens of thousands of people in the streets the next day after the budget speech, and through the course of a summer repeated large demonstrations of up to 100,000 people.

This became known as the 1983 [[Solidarity Crisis]], from the name of the [[Solidarity Coalition]], a huge grassroots opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour]] forming a separate organization of unions, [[Operation Solidarity]], under the direction of [[Jack Munro]], then-President of the [[International Woodworkers of America]] (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt that a [[general strike]] would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at [[Pacific Press Publishing Association|Pacific Press]] ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Palmer| first =Bryan| title =Solidarity: The Rise and Fall of an Opposition in British Columbia| publisher =New Star Books| year= 1987| location =Vancouver| id = ISBN }}</ref>

A tense winter of blockades at various job sites around the province ensued, as among the new laws were those enabling non-union labour to work on large projects and other sensitive labour issues, with companies from Alberta and other provinces brought in to compete with union-scale British Columbia companies. Despite the tension, Bennett's last few years in power were relatively peaceful as economic and political momentum grew on the megaprojects associated with Expo, and Bennett was to end his career by hosting [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana]] on their visit to open Expo 86. His retirement being announced, a Social Credit convention was scheduled for the Whistler Resort, which came down to a three-way shooting match between Bud Smith, the Premier's right-hand man but an unelected official, Social Credit party [[grande dame]] [[Grace McCarthy]], and the charismatic but eccentric [[Bill Vander Zalm]].

Bill Vander Zalm became the new Socred leader when Smith threw his support to him rather than see McCarthy win, and led the party to victory in the election later that year. Vander Zalm was later involved in a [[conflict of interest]] scandal following the sale of [[Fantasy Gardens]], a [[Christian]] and [[Culture of the Netherlands|Dutch culture]] [[Amusement park|theme park]] built by the Premier, to [[Tan Yu]], a [[Filipino Chinese]] gambling kingpin. There were also concerns over Yu's application to the government for a bank licence, and lurid stories from flamboyant realtor [[Faye Leung]] of a party in the "Howard Hughes Suite" on the top two floors of the [[Bayshore Inn]], where Tan Yu had been staying, with reports of a [[bag of money]] in a brown paper bag passed from Yu to Vander Zalm during the goings-on. These scandals forced Vander Zalm's resignation, and [[Rita Johnston]] became premier of the province. Johnston presided over the end of Social Credit power, calling an election which led to the reducing of the party's caucus to only two seats, and the revival of the long-defunct British Columbia Liberal Party as Opposition to the victorious NDP under former Vancouver mayor [[Mike Harcourt]].

In 1988, [[David Lam]] was appointed as British Columbia’s twenty-fifth Lieutenant-Governor, and was the Province's first Lieutenant-Governor of Chinese origin.

===1990s to present===
{{update|type=section|date=August 2012}}
Johnston lost the [[British Columbia general election, 1991|1991 general election]] to the NDP, under the leadership of Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular, and helped boost the province's growing [[tourism]] sector. However, the economy continued to struggle against the backdrop of a weak resource economy. Housing starts and an expanded service sector saw growth overall through the decade, despite political turmoil. Harcourt ended up resigning over "[[Bingogate]]"—a political scandal involving the funnelling of charity bingo receipts into party coffers in certain ridings. Harcourt was not implicated, but he resigned nonetheless in respect of constitutional conventions calling for leaders under suspicion to step aside. [[Glen Clark]], a former president of the [[British Columbia Federation of Labour|BC Federation of Labour]], was chosen the new leader of the NDP, which won a second term in 1996. More scandals dogged the party, most notably the [[Fast Ferry Scandal]] involving the province trying to develop the shipbuilding industry in British Columbia. An allegation (never substantiated) that the Premier had received a favour in return for granting a gaming licence led to Clark's resignation as Premier. He was succeeded on an interim basis by [[Dan Miller (Canadian politician)|Dan Miller]] who was in turn followed by [[Ujjal Dosanjh]] following a leadership convention.

In the 2001 general election [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]]'s BC Liberals defeated the NDP, gaining 77 out of 79 seats total seats in the provincial legislature. Campbell instituted various reforms and removed some of the NDP's policies including scrapping the "fast ferries" project, lowering income taxes, and the controversial sale of [[BC Rail]] to CN Rail. Campbell was also the subject of criticism after he was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] during a vacation in Hawaii. However, Campbell still managed to lead his party to victory in the 2005 general election, against a substantially strengthened NDP opposition. Campbell won a third term in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009]], marking the first time in 23 years that a premier has been elected to a third term.

The province won a bid to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver and Whistler. As promised in his 2002 re-election campaign, Vancouver Mayor Larry Campbell staged a non-binding civic referendum regarding the hosting of the Olympics. In February 2003, Vancouver's residents voted in a referendum accepting the responsibilities of the host city should it win its bid. Sixty-four percent of residents voted in favour of hosting the games.<ref>Wallechinsky D. and Loucky J. 2010. The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics: 2010 Edition. pgs. 12.</ref>

British Columbia has also been significantly affected by demographic changes within Canada and around the world. Vancouver (and to a lesser extent some other parts of British Columbia) was a major destination for many of the immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] who left the former UK colony (either temporarily or permanently) in the years immediately prior to its [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover]] to the [[People's Republic of China]]. British Columbia has also been a significant destination for internal Canadian migrants. This has been the case throughout recent decades, because of its image of natural beauty, mild climate and relaxed lifestyle, but is particularly true during periods of economic growth. As a result, British Columbia has moved from approximately 10% of Canada's population in 1971 to approximately 13% in 2006. Trends of urbanization mean that the [[Greater Vancouver]] area now includes 51% of the Province's population, followed in second place by [[Greater Victoria, British Columbia|Greater Victoria]] with 8%. These two metropolitan regions have traditionally dominated the demographics of BC.

Though just 1.8% refer to their origins as being "British", a majority 57.3% of the population of British Columbia claim their ethnic origin as being from one of the British nations (England, Scotland or Wales). Migration was primarily from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern England]], especially [[North East England]] - out of the 54 of Metro Vancouver's 100 most common names that are British in origin, 29 are of Scottish or Northern English origin, 9 are Welsh, and only four are native to England's south.<ref>http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=ddfa68a8-f0a7-4dd3-bbba-4013ca3cd3a0</ref><ref>http://gbnames.publicprofiler.org/</ref>  Another 15.2% refer to their ethnicity as "Irish", though not distinguishing between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Of the provinces, British Columbia had the highest proportion of [[visible minority|visible minorities]], representing 24.8% of its population.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/analysis/ethnicorigin/british.cfm "Statistics Canada. "Canada’s Ethnocultural Mosaic, 2006 Census: Provinces and territories""].</ref> [[Asian people|Asians]] at 20.2% of the total population, are by far the largest visible minority demographic, with many of the Lower Mainland's large cities having sizable Chinese, [[South Asia]]n, Japanese, [[Philippines|Filipino]], and Korean communities.

Also present in large numbers relative to other regions of Canada (except [[Toronto]]), and ever since the province was first settled (unlike Toronto), are many European ethnicities of the first and second generation, notably [[Canadians of German ethnicity|Germans]], [[Scandinavia]]ns, [[Demographics of SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavs]] and [[Italian Canadians|Italians]]. Third-generation Europeans are generally of mixed lineage, and traditionally intermarried with other ethnic groups more than in any other Canadian province. First-generation [[British people|Britons]] remain a strong component of local society despite limitations on [[immigration]] from Britain since the ending of special status for British subjects in the 1960s.

Of the 4,113,847 population counted by the 2006 census, 4,074,385 people completed the section about language. Of these 4,022,045 gave singular responses to the question regarding [[First language|mother tongue]]. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

Half of all British Columbians live in the Metro Vancouver area, which includes [[Vancouver]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[New Westminster]], [[West Vancouver]], [[North Vancouver (city)]], [[North Vancouver (district municipality)]], [[Burnaby]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Port Coquitlam]], [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]], [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley (city)]], [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley (district municipality)]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], [[Pitt Meadows]], [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Port Moody]], [[Anmore]], [[Belcarra]], [[Lions Bay, British Columbia|Lions Bay]] and [[Bowen Island]], with adjacent unincorporated areas represented in the regional district as the [[List of regional district electoral areas in British Columbia|electoral area]] known as [[Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A, British Columbia|Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A]]. [[List of First Nations governments in British Columbia|Seventeen Indian reserves]] are located in the metropolitan area but are outside the jurisdiction of the regional district and not represented in its government. Also in the metropolitan area but not represented in the regional district are the [[University Endowment Lands]].

The second largest concentration of British Columbia population is located at the southern tip of Vancouver Island, which is made up of the 13 municipalities of Greater Victoria, [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Saanich, British Columbia|Saanich]], [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]], [[Oak Bay, British Columbia|Oak Bay]], [[View Royal, British Columbia|View Royal]], [[Highlands, British Columbia|Highlands]], [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]], [[Langford, British Columbia|Langford]], [[Central Saanich, British Columbia|Central Saanich]]/[[Saanichton, British Columbia|Saanichton]], [[North Saanich, British Columbia|North Saanich]], [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]], [[Metchosin, British Columbia|Metchosin]], [[Sooke, British Columbia|Sooke]], which are part of the [[Capital Regional District]].

==Economy==
[[File:Vancouver downtown.jpg|thumb|thumb|right|A view of the [[Vancouver]]'s downtown core. Vancouver is the business capital of British Columbia.]]
British Columbia has a resource dominated economy, centred on the forestry industry but also with increasing importance in mining. Employment in the resource sector has fallen steadily, and new jobs are mostly in the construction and retail/service sectors. With its film industry known as [[Hollywood North]], the Vancouver region is the third-largest feature film production location in North America, after [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm Film and Development | title= Film and TV | author= Vancouver Economic Development | year= 2005 | accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070101014505/http://vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm |archivedate = January 1, 2007}}</ref>

The economic history of British Columbia is replete with tales of [[Business cycle|dramatic upswings and downswings]], and this [[boom and bust]] pattern has influenced the politics, culture and business climate of the province.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of British Columbia |Monarchy in British Columbia}}
[[File:BC Legislature Buildings and Undersea Gardens.jpg|thumb|The British Columbia Parliament Buildings in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]]]

The Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, [[Judith Guichon]], is the Queen of Canada's representative in the Province of British Columbia. During the absence of the [[Lieutenant Governor|Lieutenant-Governor]], the [[Cabinet of Canada|Governor General in Council]] may appoint an administrator to execute the duties of the office. In practice, this is usually the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|Chief Justice of British Columbia]].<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html#provincial Executive Power in the Provinces] under the Constitutional Act, 1867.</ref>

British Columbia has an 85-member elected Legislative Assembly, elected by the [[plurality voting system]], though in recent years there has been significant debate about switching to a [[BC-STV|single transferable vote]] system.

The province is governed by the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] under Premier [[Christy Clark]]. The previous election saw then Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] win a third straight majority government in May 2009, taking 49 seats to the opposition [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]]'s 35. Campbell had previously led the largest landslide election in British Columbia history in 2001, with 77 of 79 seats, but the legislature has been more evenly divided between Liberals and NDP following the 2005 (46 of 79) and 2009 (49 of 85) provincial elections. The [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) and its predecessor the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation|CCF]] have been the main opposition force to right-wing parties since the 1930s and have ruled majority governments 1972-1975 and 1991-2001. The [[Green Party of British Columbia]] plays a larger role in the politics of British Columbia than Green Parties do in most other jurisdictions in Canada. However, after a breakthrough election in 2001 (12.39%), the party's vote share has declined (2005 – 9.17%, 2009 – 8.09%).

The British Columbia Liberal Party is not related to the federal Liberal Party and does not share the same ideology. Instead, the BC Liberal party is a rather diverse coalition, made up of the remnants of the Social Credit Party, many [[Liberal Party of Canada|federal Liberals]], federal Conservatives, and those who would otherwise support right-of-centre or free enterprise parties. Historically, there have commonly been [[third party (politics)|third parties]] present in the legislature (including the Liberals themselves from 1952 to 1975); the [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Green Party]] are the current third party in British Columbia, with one seat in the legislature.

Prior to the rise of the Liberal Party, British Columbia's main political party was the British Columbia Social Credit Party which ruled British Columbia for 20 continuous years. While sharing some ideology with the current Liberal government, they were more right-wing although undertook nationalization of various important monopolies, notably BC Hydro and BC Ferries.

[[File:BC-Legislature.jpg|thumb|left|The meeting chamber of the provincial legislative assembly]]
British Columbia is known for having politically active labour [[trade union|unions]] who have traditionally supported the NDP or its predecessor, the CCF.

British Columbia's political history is typified by scandal and a cast of colourful characters, beginning with various colonial-era land scandals and abuses of power by early officials (such as those that led to [[McGowan's War]] in 1858–59). Notable scandals in Social Credit years included the [[Robert Bonner (politician)|Robert Bonner]] Affair, the [[Fantasy Gardens]] scandal which forced Premier Bill Vander Zalm to resign and ended the Social Credit era, the Bingogate scandal which brought down NDP Premier Mike Harcourt, the alleged scandal named [[Casinogate]] which drove NDP Premier Glen Clark to resign. A variety of scandals have plagued the current Liberal government, including Campbell's arrest for drunk driving in Maui and the resignation of various cabinet ministers because of conflict-of-interest allegations. A Christmas Eve [[BC Legislature Raids|raid on the Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria, including the Premier's Office, has resulted in charges only for ministerial aides, although key cabinet members from the time have since resigned. The case, currently in preliminary hearings in the courts and relating to the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail, may not reach trial because of the mass of evidence and various procedural problems.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Campbell eventually resigned in late 2010 due to opposition to his government's plan to introduce a [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST) and was replaced by [[Christy Clark]] as Premier in a BC Liberal leadership election.

==Transportation==
Transportation played a huge role in British Columbia history. The Rocky Mountains and the ranges west of them constituted a significant obstacle to overland travel until the completion of the transcontinental railway in 1885. The Peace River Canyon through the Rocky Mountains was the route that the earliest explorers and fur traders used. Fur trade routes were only marginally used for access to British Columbia through the mountains. Travel from the rest of Canada before 1885 meant the difficulty of overland travel via the United States, around [[Cape Horn]] or overseas from Asia. Nearly all travel and freight to and from the region occurred via the Pacific Ocean, primarily through the ports of Victoria and New Westminster.

Until the 1930s, rail was the only means of overland travel to and from the rest of Canada; travellers using motor vehicles needed to journey through the United States. With the construction of the Inter-Provincial Highway in 1932 (now known as the [[Crowsnest Highway|Crowsnest Pass Highway]]), and later the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], road transportation evolved into the preferred mode of overland travel to and from the rest of the country.

===Roads and highways===
{{Main|List of British Columbia provincial highways}}
[[File:AlexFraserBridge.jpg|thumb|[[Alex Fraser Bridge]] on [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] in Richmond/Delta.]]

Because of its size and rugged, varying topography, British Columbia requires thousands of kilometres of provincial highways to connect its communities. British Columbia's roads systems were notoriously poorly maintained and dangerous until a concentrated programme of improvement was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s. There are now freeways in Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Central Interior of the province. Much of the rest of the province, where traffic volumes are generally low, is accessible by well-maintained generally high-mobility two-lane [[arterial road|arterial highways]] with additional passing lanes in mountainous areas and usually only a few stop-controlled intersections outside the main urban areas.

A couple of busy intercity corridors outside Greater Vancouver feature more heavily signalized limited-mobility arterial highways that are mostly four-lane and often divided by portable median [[traffic barrier]]s.  [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]] on [[Vancouver Island]] and Highway 97 through the [[Okanagan Valley]] are medium- to high-volume roadways with variable posted speeds that range from 50&nbsp;km/h to maximums just slightly lower than the principal [[grade-separated]] highways. Numerous [[traffic light]]s operate in place of [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s on both arterials as long-term cost-cutting measures.  Signalization along both these highways is heaviest through urban areas and along inter-urban sections where traffic volumes are similar to and sometimes higher than the freeways, but where funding is not available for upgrades to interchanges or construction of high-mobility alternative routes or bypasses. The building and maintenance of provincial highways is the responsibility of the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] and Infrastructure.<ref name="BC highways">{{cite web |author=BC ministry of transportation and infrastructure |title= BC highways |year=2013 |url= http://www.gov.bc.ca/tran/|accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: [[British Columbia provincial highway 3|BC Highway 3]] through the [[Crowsnest Pass]], the [[Vermilion Pass]] (Highway 93 in both [[British Columbia provincial highway 93|British Columbia]] and [[Alberta provincial highway 93|Alberta]]), the [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through [[Banff National Park]], the [[Yellowhead Highway]] (16) through [[Jasper National Park]], and [[British Columbia Highway 2|Highway 2]] through [[Dawson Creek]]. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running {{convert|2081|km|abbr=on}} from the British Columbia-Washington border at [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]] north to [[Watson Lake, Yukon]] and which includes the British Columbia portion of the [[Alaska Highway]].

===Public transit===
Prior to 1979, surface [[public transport|public transit]] was administered by BC Hydro, the provincially owned electricity utility. Subsequently, the province established [[BC Transit]] to oversee and operate all municipal transportation systems. In 1998, the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority ([[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]) (now South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority), a separate authority for routes within the Greater Vancouver Regional District was established.

Public transit in British Columbia consists mainly of diesel buses, although Vancouver is also serviced by a fleet of [[trolleybus]]es. Several experimental buses are being tested such as [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] buses that has both gasoline and electric engines. TransLink operates [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]], an automated [[rapid transit|metro]] system serving the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, North Surrey and Richmond. In 2009, the Canada Line SkyTrain was completed, linking Vancouver International Airport and the city of Richmond to downtown Vancouver bringing the total to three operating metro lines.

Presently, a new line to Coquitlam and [[Port Moody]] (the [[Evergreen Line (TransLink)|Evergreen Line]]) is being constructed, expansion of the Expo Line is being developed, and there is planning for an extension of the Millennium Line through Vancouver City to the [[University of British Columbia]]. Also of note, Turnstiles are being added to all existing (and future) lines of the system. In the past, SkyTrain used a proof of payment honour system.

===Rail===
[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|thumb|upright|left|CPR train traversing the [[Stoney Creek Bridge]].]]

Rail development expanded greatly in the decades after the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in 1885 and was the chief mode of long-distance surface transportation until the expansion and improvement of the provincial highways system began in the 1950s. Two major routes through the Yellowhead Pass competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway—the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], terminating at [[Prince Rupert]], and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], terminating at Vancouver.

The [[Pacific Great Eastern]] line supplemented this service, providing a north-south route between Interior resource communities and the coast. The Pacific Great Eastern (later known as British Columbia Railway and now owned by Canadian National Railway) connects Fort St James, Fort Nelson, and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]] with [[North Vancouver (city)|North Vancouver]]. The E&N Railway, rebranded as [[Southern Railway of Vancouver Island]], serves the commercial and passenger train markets of Vancouver Island by owning the physical rail lines.

[[Amtrak]] runs twice-daily international passenger service between Vancouver and [[Seattle]].

===Water===
[[BC Ferries]] was established as a provincial crown corporation in 1960 to provide passenger and vehicle ferry service between Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland as a cheaper and more reliable alternative to the service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It now operates 25 routes among the [[List of islands of British Columbia|islands of British Columbia]], as well as between the islands and the mainland. Ferry service to Washington is offered by the [[Washington State Ferries]] (between [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]]) and [[MV Coho|Black Ball Transport]] (between Victoria and [[Port Angeles, Washington]]). Ferry service over inland lakes and rivers is provided by the provincial government.

Commercial ocean transport is of vital importance. Major ports are located at Vancouver, [[Roberts Bank]] (near [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]), [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], and Victoria.<ref>[http://www.cosbc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=909&Itemid=98 International Shipping in British Columbia], [http://www.cosbc.ca/images/docs/BCPortsHandbook2011.pdf Chamber of Shipping (BC): ''BC Ports handbook''] (pdf)</ref> 
Of these, the [[Port of Vancouver]] is the most important, being the largest in Canada and the most diversified in North America.

Vancouver, Victoria, and Prince Rupert are also major ports of call for [[cruise ship]]s. In 2007, a large maritime [[Containerization|container port]] was opened in [[Prince Rupert Port Authority|Prince Rupert]] with an inland sorting port located in Prince George.

===Air===
{{Main|List of airports in British Columbia}}
There are over 200 airports located throughout British Columbia, the major ones being the [[Vancouver International Airport]], the [[Victoria International Airport]], the [[Kelowna International Airport]], and the [[Abbotsford International Airport]], the first three of which each served over 1,000,000 passengers in 2005. Vancouver International Airport is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|2nd busiest airport]] in the country and the second biggest International Gateway on the west coast (after Los Angeles) with an estimated 17.9 million travellers passing through in 2008.

==Culture==

===Outdoor life===
[[File:Whistler ice sailor.jpg|thumb|Ice sailing in [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]]]

Given its varied mountainous terrain and its coasts, lakes, rivers, and forests, British Columbia has long been enjoyed for pursuits like hiking and camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, [[hunting]] and [[fishing]].

Water sports, both motorized and non-motorized, are enjoyed in many places. [[Sea kayak]]ing opportunities abound on the British Columbia coast with its [[fjord]]s. [[Whitewater]] [[rafting]] and [[kayak]]ing are popular on many inland rivers. [[Sailing]] and [[Windsurfing|sailboarding]] are widely enjoyed.

In winter, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country]] and [[telemark skiing]] are much enjoyed, and in recent decades high-quality [[downhill]] [[skiing]] has been developed in the Coast Mountain range and the Rockies, as well as in the southern areas of the Shuswap Highlands and the [[Columbia Mountains]]. [[Snowboarding]] has mushroomed in popularity since the early 1990s. The [[2010 Winter Olympics]] downhill events were held in [[Whistler Blackcomb]] area of the province, while the indoor events were conducted in the Vancouver area.

In Vancouver and Victoria (as well as some other cities), opportunities for [[jogging|joggers]] and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the [[Bicycle gearing|ten-speed]] bike became available many years ago. Since the advent of the more robust [[mountain bike]], trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. [[Longboarding]] is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.

[[Equestrianism|Horseback riding]] is enjoyed by many British Columbians. Opportunities for [[trail riding]], often into especially scenic areas, have been established for tourists in numerous areas of the province.

British Columbia also has strong participation levels in many other sports, including [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Canadian football]], [[rugby union]], [[lacrosse]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[curling]] and [[figure skating]]. British Columbia has produced many outstanding athletes, especially in aquatic and [[winter sport]]s.

Consistent with both increased tourism and increased participation in diverse recreations by British Columbians has been the proliferation of [[Luxury resort|lodges]], [[chalet]]s, [[bed and breakfast]]s, motels, hotels, fishing camps, and park-camping facilities in recent decades.

In certain areas, there are businesses, non-profit societies, or municipal governments dedicated to promoting [[ecotourism]] in their region. A number of British Columbia farmers offer visitors to combine tourism with farm work, for example, through the [[WWOOF]] Canada program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwoof.ca/|title=WWOOF&nbsp;— Willing Workers on Organic Farms, Canada}}</ref>
