An '''antibacterial''' is an agent that inhibits bacterial growth or kills [[bacteria]].<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:antibacterial"/>
The term is often used [[synonym]]ously with the term ''antibiotic(s)''. Today, however, with increased knowledge of the causative agents of various [[infectious diseases]], ''antibiotic(s)'' has come to denote a broader range of [[antimicrobial]] compounds, including [[Anti-fungal medication|anti-fungal]] and other compounds.<ref name="urlDorlands Medical Dictionary:antibiotic"/>  Antibacterials must be distinguished from [[disinfectant|disinfectants (sanitizing agents)]], which are less-selective substances used to destroy [[microorganism]]s.

The term ''antibiotic'' was first used in 1942 by [[Selman Waksman]] and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is [[wikt:antagonism|antagonistic]] to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution.<ref name="Wakeman1947"/> This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but are not produced by microorganisms (such as [[gastric juices]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]). It also excluded [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial compounds such as the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]. Many antibacterial compounds are relatively [[small molecule]]s with a [[molecular weight]] of less than 2000 [[atomic mass unit]]s.

With advances in [[medicinal chemistry]], most of today's antibacterials chemically are [[semisynthetic]] modifications of various natural compounds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=von Nussbaum F. ''et al.'' |title=Medicinal Chemistry of Antibacterial Natural Products – Exodus or Revival?|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |volume=45 |issue=31 |pages=5072–5129 |year=2006 |pmid= 16881035 |doi=10.1002/anie.200600350 |last2=Brands |first2=Michael |last3=Hinzen |first3=Berthold |last4=Weigand |first4=Stefan |last5=Häbich |first5=Dieter}}</ref> These include, for example, the [[beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]] antibacterials, which include the [[penicillin]]s (produced by fungi in the genus ''[[Penicillium]]''), the [[cephalosporin]]s, and the [[carbapenem]]s. Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the [[aminoglycoside]]s, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the [[sulfonamides]], the [[quinolone]]s, and the [[oxazolidinone]]s—are produced solely by chemical synthesis. In accordance with this, many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical/[[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] origin into natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic. Another classification system is based on biological activity; in this classification, antibacterials are divided into two broad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms: [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] agents kill bacteria, and [[bacteriostatic agent]]s slow down or stall bacterial growth.

{{See also|Timeline of antibiotics}}

[[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|170px|[[Penicillin]], the first natural antibiotic discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928]]
Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on [[folk medicine|medicinal folklore]]. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago.<ref name="Considerations for Determining if a Natural Product Is an Effective Wound-Healing Agent"/> Many ancient cultures, including the [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|ancient Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greeks]], used specially selected [[mold]] and plant materials and extracts to treat [[infection]]s.<ref name="Early history of wound treatment"/><ref name="Moulds in ancient and more recent medicine"/> More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between micro-organisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. [[Louis Pasteur]] observed, "if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics".<ref name="Kingston2008"/>
The term 'antibiosis', meaning "against life," was introduced by the French bacteriologist [[Jean Paul Vuillemin]] as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs.<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/><ref name="Early descriptions of antibiosis">{{cite journal |author=Foster W, Raoult A |title=Early descriptions of antibiosis |journal=J R Coll Gen Pract |volume=24 |issue=149 |pages=889–94 |year=1974 |month=December |pmid=4618289 |pmc=2157443 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Robert Koch]] observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=H.

[[John Tyndall]] first described antagonistic activities by fungi against bacteria in England in 1875.<ref name="Kingston2008"/> Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1880s.<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/> Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, while others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial [[Salvarsan]]<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/><ref name="Limbird2004"/><ref name="Bosch2008"/> now called arsphenamine.

In 1895, Vincenzo Tiberio, physician of the [[University of Naples]] discovered that a [[mold]] (''[[Penicillium]]'') in a water well had an antibacterial action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almanacco.rm.cnr.it/reader/cw_usr_view_recensione?id_articolo=1704&giornale=1679 |title=Almanacco della Scienza CNR |publisher=Almanacco.rm.cnr.it |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Salvatore De Rosa, Introduttore: Fabio Pagan |url=http://festival2011.festivalscienza.it/site/home/programma-2011/eventi-per-tipo/conferenze/vincenzo-tiberio-vero-scopritore-degli-antibiotici.html |title=Vincenzo Tiberio, vero scopritore degli antibiotici - Festival della Scienza |language={{it icon}} |publisher=Festival2011.festivalscienza.it |date= |accessdate=October 19, 2012}}</ref>
After this initial chemotherapeutic compound proved effective, others pursued similar lines of inquiry, but it was not until in 1928 that [[Alexander Fleming]] observed antibiosis against bacteria by a fungus of the genus ''Penicillium.'' Fleming postulated the effect was mediated by an antibacterial compound named penicillin, and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.<ref name="Fleming1929"/><ref name="Sykes2001"/>
[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Fleming]]
The first [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and first commercially available antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], was developed by a research team led by [[Gerhard Domagk]] in 1932 at the [[Bayer]] Laboratories of the [[IG Farben]] conglomerate in Germany.<ref name="Bosch2008"/> Domagk received the 1939 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] for his efforts. Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against [[Gram-positive]] [[Coccus|cocci]], but not against [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]]. Research was stimulated apace by its success. The discovery and development of this sulfonamide [[drug]] opened the era of antibacterials.<br/>
In 1939, coinciding with the start of World War II, [[Rene Dubos]] reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, [[tyrothricin]], a compound of 20% [[gramicidin]] and 80% [[tyrocidine]], from ''B. brevis.'' It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics universally and very effectively used to treat wounds and ulcers during World War II.<ref name="Epps2006"/> Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during the war.<br/>
Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, [[penicillin G]], in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.<ref name="Use of Micro-organisms for therapeutic purposes"/> For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, [[Ernst Chain]] and [[Howard Florey]] shared the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.<ref name=Epps2006/>

The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include [[Immune system|host defense mechanisms]], the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial.<ref name="Pankey2004"/> A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells.<ref name="Bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary-phase and nondividing Staphylococcus aureus cells"/> These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection.<ref name="Pankey2004"/><ref>Pelczar, M.J., Chan, E.C.S. and Krieg, N.R.

==Classes==
{{Main|List of antibiotics}}
[[File:Antibiotics action.png|right|thumb|150px|Molecular targets of antibiotics on the bacteria cell]]

Antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes.<ref name="CALDERIN2007"/> Those that target the bacterial cell wall ([[penicillin]]s and [[cephalosporin]]s) or the cell membrane ([[polymyxins]]), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes ([[rifamycin]]s, [[lipiarmycin]]s, [[quinolone]]s, and [[sulfonamides]]) have [[bactericidal]] activities. Those that target protein synthesis ([[macrolide]]s, [[lincosamides]] and [[tetracycline]]s) are usually [[bacteriostatic]] (with the exception of bactericidal [[aminoglycoside]]s).<ref name="The importance of bactericidal drugs: future directions in infectious disease"/> Further categorization is based on their target specificity. "Narrow-spectrum" antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as [[Gram-negative]] or [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use: cyclic [[lipopeptides]] (such as [[daptomycin]]), [[glycylcyclines]] (such as [[tigecycline]]), [[oxazolidinone]]s (such as [[linezolid]]) and [[lipiarmycin]]s (such as [[fidaxomicin]]).<ref>Cunha BA.

==Production==
{{Main|Production of antibiotics}}

Since the first pioneering efforts of [[Howard Florey, Baron Florey|Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain|Chain]] in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to [[medicine]] has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]], usually in strongly aerobic conditions.<ref>{{cite book|title= Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia|page=305|author=William Andrew Publishing|publisher=Elsevier Science, 2013}}</ref>
==Administration==
Oral antibacterials are orally ingested, whereas [[intravenous]] administration may be used in more serious cases {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}, such as deep-seated [[systemic infection]]s. Antibiotics may also sometimes be administered [[topical]]ly, as with [[eye drop]]s or [[ointment]]s.

==Side-effects==
Antibacterials are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated. However, some antibacterials have been associated with a range of adverse effects.<ref name="pmid15993671"/>
Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use.<ref name="pmid15993671"/> Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including [[photodermatitis]] and anaphylaxis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Common side-effects include [[diarrhea]], resulting from disruption of the species composition in the [[intestinal flora]], resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''.<ref>University of Michigan Health System: [http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_aadiarrh_crs.htm Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea], November 26, 2006 {{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> Antibacterials can also affect the [[vaginal flora]], and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' in the vulvo-vaginal area.<ref name="Pirotta and Garland"/> Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of [[tendon]] damage from administration of a [[Quinolones|quinolone]] antibiotic with a systemic [[corticosteroid]]. Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with [[chronic disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The law of unintended consequences and antibiotics|journal=Open Journal of Immunology |volume=2|issue=2|publisher= Scientific Research|url=http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=20125|issn=2162-450X |doi=10.4236/oji.2012.22007 |accessdate=6 Dec 2012 |year=2012 |last1=Thacker |first1=James D. |pages=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Antibiotics and Chronic Liver Diseases|url=http://www.sinomedresearch.org/hcv/articles/c17_ABX.htm}}</ref>

==Drug-drug interactions==

===Birth control pills===
The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with [[contraceptive pill]]s,<ref name="Weaver1999"/> such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%).<ref name="pmid10384856"/> In cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial [[rifampicin]], these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients.<ref name="Weaver1999"/> Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial.<ref name="pmid3155374"/><ref name="pmid2256523"/> Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives.<ref name="Weaver1999"/>

===Alcohol===
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibacterials may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibacterial therapy.<ref name="bmj"/><ref name="antibiotics-and-alcohol"/>
:"It is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medication. However, it is unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics. However, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol should be avoided completely, because of serious side-effects."<ref name="NHS" />
Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibacterial administered. Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication, the belief that alcohol and antibacterials should never be mixed is widespread.

Antibacterials such as [[metronidazole]], [[tinidazole]], [[cephamandole]], [[latamoxef]], [[cefoperazone]], [[cefmenoxime]], and [[furazolidone]], cause a [[disulfiram]]-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath.<ref name="NHS"/>

Other effects of alcohol on antibacterial activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibacterial compound.<ref name="Antibiotics FAQ"/> In addition, serum levels of doxycycline and [[erythromycin]] succinate{{Clarify|Why do these serum levels matter?|date=February 2010}} two bacteriostatic antibacterials (see above) may be reduced by alcohol consumption, resulting in reduced efficacy and diminished pharmacotherapeutic effect.<ref>Stockley, IH (2002), Stockley's Drug Interactions. 6th ed. London: Pharmaceutical Press.</ref>

== Resistance ==
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}

[[File:MRSA7820.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scanning electron micrograph|SEM]] depicting [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] bacteria]]

The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibacterial drug therapy. The antibacterial treatment may [[Natural selection|select]] for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibacterials. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.<ref name="Balancing the drug-resistance equation"/> For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]].<ref name="Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance"/> Antibacterials such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, because of increased resistance of many bacterial strains.<ref name="voanews.com"/> 

Resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmacuticals; such as sulfamethazine degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces. <ref> {{cite journal|url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610|title=Accelerated Biodegradation of Veterinary Antibiotics in Agricultural Soil following Long-Term Exposure, and Isolationof a Sulfamethazine-degrading Microbacterium sp.|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|volume=42|pages=173-178}} </ref>
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance,<ref name="Witte2004"/> but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.<ref name="A Field Guide To Bacteria, The World Of Bacteria">{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Betsey Dexter|title=A Field Guide To Bacteria|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8854-2|pages=Chapter 9, Pathogens|url=http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002VA8L4Y&qid=1305345229&sr=1-1}}</ref> 

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing [[biological fitness|fitness]] of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.<ref name="The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: any practical conclusions?"/>

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms.<ref name="D'Costa2011"/> Natural antibiotics (produced by microorganisms to compete against other microorganisms), however, are evolutionarily robust, i.e., microorganisms are often unable to develop resistance against them. Molecular data confirm this observation, showing that the evolution of bacterial proteins targeted by antibiotics is highly constrained compared with the evolution of other proteins. For example, mutations in genes coding for antibiotics-targeted proteins tend to be deleterious, making these genes subject to strong purifying selection, which stringently maintains the sequence and structure of their cognate proteins.<ref name="Gladki2013"/>

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains.<ref name="Alekshun2007"/> For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial [[genome]]. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA.<ref name="Alekshun2007"/> Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains.<ref name="Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide-producing organisms"/><ref name="Multidrug Resistance in Bacteria"/> The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by [[Horizontal gene transfer|horizontal genetic exchange]].<ref name="Witte2004"/> For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via [[plasmids]] that carry these resistance genes.<ref name="Witte2004"/><ref name="Baker2006"/> Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.<ref name="Baker2006"/> Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.<ref name="Baker2006"/>

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as "superbugs", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing [[tuberculosis]] (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.<ref>"[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]". ''World Health Organization (WHO).''</ref> For example, [[NDM-1]] is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of [[beta-lactam]] antibacterials.<ref name="Are you ready for a world without antibiotics?"/> The United Kingdom's [[Health Protection Agency]] has stated that "most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections."<ref name="Health Protection Report"/>

=== Misuse ===
[[File:CDC Get Smart poster healthy adult.png|thumb|This poster from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "Get Smart" campaign, intended for use in doctors' offices and other healthcare facilities, warns that antibiotics do not work for viral illnesses such as the common cold.]]

{{main|Antibiotic misuse}}

{{quote|The first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.<ref name="Marino"/>|Paul L. Marino|''The ICU Book''}}

Inappropriate antibacterial treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibacterial-resistant bacteria. [[Self-prescribing|Self prescription]] of antibacterials is an example of misuse.<ref name="Larson2007"/> Many antibacterials are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibacterial therapy or are likely to resolve without treatment, or incorrect or suboptimal antibacterials are prescribed for certain bacterial infections.<ref name="pmid15993671"/><ref name="Larson2007"/> The overuse of antibacterials, like penicillin and erythromycin, have been associated with emerging antibacterial resistance since the 1950s.<ref name="voanews.com"/><ref name="Hawkey2008"/> Widespread usage of antibacterial drugs in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibacterials.<ref name="Hawkey2008"/>

Common forms of antibacterial misuse include excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibacterials on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibacterial, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibacterial treatment, for example, is the prescription of antibacterials to treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]]. One study on [[respiratory tract infection]]s found "physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them".<ref name="pmid17467120"/> Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.<ref name="pmid17509729"/>

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibacterials.<ref name="Larson2007"/> The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the U.S. Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance, and is coordinated by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), as well as other US agencies.<ref name="pharmguide"/> An NGO campaign group is ''Keep Antibiotics Working''.<ref name="Keep Antibiotics Working"/> In France, an "Antibiotics are not automatic" government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibacterial prescriptions, especially in children.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sabuncu E, David J, Bernède-Bauduin C ''et al.'' |editor1-last= Klugman |editor1-first= Keith P. |title= Significant reduction of antibiotic use in the community after a nationwide campaign in France, 2002–2007 |year=2009 |journal= PLoS Med |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e1000084 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |pmid= 19492093 |pmc= 2683932|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uJyYYA93 |archivedate = 2010-11-17|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The emergence of antibacterial resistance has prompted restrictions on antibacterial use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibacterials as growth-promotional agents since 2003.<ref>[http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/T80294.htm (accessed Nov 12, 2008)]</ref> Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibacterials, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibacterials, and to the time required for research to test causal links between antibacterial use and resistance. Two federal bills (S.742<ref name="USbill1"/> and H.R. 2562<ref name="USbill2"/>) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibacterials in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.<ref name="USbill1"/><ref name="USbill2"/> These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).<ref>[http://www.acpm.org/2003051H.pdf (accessed Nov 12, 2008)]</ref>

There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. In the United States the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to use of antibiotics in livestock was raised by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1977. In March, 2012 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated FDA regulations.<ref name=MPFDA>{{cite news|title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792|accessdate=March 24, 2012|newspaper=MedPage Today|date=March 23, 2012|author=John Gever}}</ref>

==Alternatives==
The increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of bacterial disease treatment strategies which are alternatives to conventional antibacterials.

===Resistance-modifying agents===
One strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials. For example, some resistance-modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms, such as [[drug efflux]] from the cell, thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial. Targets include:
* The [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux inhibitor]] Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2005.04.012 | author = Marquez B | year = 2005 | title = Bacterial efflux systems and efflux pumps inhibitors | url = | journal = Biochimie | volume = 87 | issue = 12| pages = 1137–1147 | pmid = 15951096 }}</ref>
* Beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]].
Metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10069 | author = Kyle R. Allison, Mark P. Brynildsen & James J. Collins | year = 2011 | title = Metabolite-enabled eradication of bacterial persisters by aminoglycosides | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7346/full/nature10069.html | journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7346| pages = 216–220 | pmid =21562562 | pmc = 3145328 }}</ref>

===[[Phage therapy]]===
Phage therapy is the use of viruses that infect bacteria (i.e. [[Bacteriophage|phages]]) for the treatment of bacterial infections.<ref name="The Bacteriophages"/><ref name="Mattey2008"/> Phages are common in bacterial populations and control the growth of bacteria in many environments, including in the intestine, the ocean, and the soil.<ref name="Bacteriophage Ecology: Population Growth, Evolution and Impact of Bacterial Viruses"/> Phage therapy was in use in the 1920s and 1930s in the US, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe. However, success rates of this therapy have not been firmly established, because only a limited number of [[clinical trials]] testing the efficacy of phage therapy have been conducted.<ref name="Mattey2008"/> These studies were performed mainly in the former Soviet Union, at the [[George Eliava Institute|Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology]], [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]].<ref name="Kutateladze2008"/> The development of antibacterial-resistant bacteria has sparked renewed interest in phage therapy in Western medicine.<ref name="Merril2003"/> Several companies (e.g., [[Intralytix]], Novolytics, and Gangagen), universities, and foundations across the world now focus on phage therapies.<ref name="Merril2003"/><ref name="Abuladze2008"/><ref name="Thiel2004"/><ref name="Parfitt2005"/> One concern with this therapeutic strategy is the use of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] viruses, which limits certain aspects of phage therapy.<ref name="Mattey2008"/><ref name="Dispersing biofilms with engineered enzymatic bacteriophage"/><ref name="Retargeting R-type pyocins to generate novel bactericidal protein complexes"/>

===[[Bacteriocin]]s===
Bacteriocins are [[peptide]]s that can be more readily engineered than small molecules,<ref name="pmid15777256"/> and are possible alternatives to conventional antibacterial compounds.<ref name="Colicins and microcins: the next generation antimicrobials"/> Different classes of bacteriocins have different potential as therapeutic agents. Small-molecule bacteriocins ([[microcin]]s and [[lantibiotic]]s) are similar to the classic antibiotics; [[colicin]]-like bacteriocins possess a narrow spectrum, and require molecular diagnostics prior to therapy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Limitations of large-molecule antibacterials include reduced transport across membranes and within the human body. For this reason, they are usually applied topically or gastrointestinally.<ref name="pmid17168847"/>

===[[Chelation]]===
Chelation of micronutrients that are essential for bacterial growth to restrict pathogen spread ''in vivo'' might supplement some antibacterials. For example, limiting the [[iron]] availability in the human body restricts bacterial proliferation.<ref name="Effects of iron chelators and iron overload on ''Salmonella'' infection"/><ref name="pmid7768775"/> Many bacteria, however, possess mechanisms (such as [[siderophores]]) for scavenging iron within [[Niche (ecology)|environmental niches]] in the human body, and experimental developments of iron chelators, therefore, aim to reduce iron availability specifically to bacterial pathogens.<ref name="The effect of synthetic iron chelators on bacterial growth in human serum"/>

===[[Vaccines]]===
[[Vaccine]]s rely on [[immune]] modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competency of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of [[macrophages]], the production of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[inflammation]], and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic, cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates, to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.<ref name=MillerAAMillerPF>{{cite book | author= Miller, AA; Miller, PF (editor) | year=2011 | title=Emerging Trends in Antibacterial Discovery: Answering the Call to Arms | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-89-9}}</ref>

===[[Biotherapy]]===
Biotherapy may employ organisms, such as protozoa,<ref name="Phagotrophic protozoa: A new weapon against pathogens?"/> to consume the bacterial pathogens. Another such approach is [[maggot therapy]].

===[[Probiotics]]===
Probiotics consist of a live culture of bacteria, which may become established as [[Competitive exclusion principle|competing symbionts]], and inhibit or interfere with colonization by microbial pathogens.<ref name=" LjunghWadstrom"/>

===[[Silver]]===
Silver mechanism of action includes disruption of multiple bacterial cellular processes (disulfide bond formation, metabolism, and iron homeostasis), which may lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species, and increased cell membrane permeability. In both mouse model and in vitro, evidence suggests that silver may increase the activity and potentially restore antibiotic susceptibility to antibiotic resistant bacterial. In one study, silver sensitized gram-negative bacteria in mouse and in vitro to vancomycin, "thereby expanding the antibacterial spectrum of this drug." Finally, "both in vitro and in a mouse biofilm infection model that silver can enhance antibacterial action against bacteria that produce biofilms."<ref>{{cite journal|last=J. R.|first=Morones-Ramirez|coauthors=J. A. Winkler, C. S. Spina, J. J.

===Host defense peptides===
An additional therapeutic agent is the enhancement of the multifunctional properties of natural anti-infectives, such as cationic host defense (antimicrobial) peptides (HDPs).<ref name=MillerAAMillerPF />

=== Antimicrobial coatings ===
[[Functionalization of Antimicrobial Surfaces|Functionalization of antimicrobial surfaces]] can be used for sterilization, self-cleaning, and surface protection.

=== Antimicrobial copper alloy surfaces ===
{{Main|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}

Copper-alloy surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to effectively and quickly destroy bacteria. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has approved the registration of 355 different [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antibacterial copper alloys]] that kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' O157:H7, ''[[methicillin]]''-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (''[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]''), ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''Enterobacter aerogenes'', and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in less than 2 hours of contact.

===Targeting the trans-translational pathway===
Using high-throughput screening, researchers in [[Pennsylvania State University]] discovered 46 small molecules capable of disrupting the [[trans-translational pathway]], the mechanism used by bacteria to facilitate [[protein synthesis]] and is unique to bacteria only. One of the most potent molecules, KKL-35, was found to cause cell death in [[Shigella]], ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' and ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', and no resistant mutant strains were observed in the experiments. This result demonstrated that KKL-35 could be effective in a wide spectrum of bacterial species due to its targeted pathway and may represent a new class of antibiotics.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/press-releases/new-kind-antibiotic-may-be-more-effective-fighting-tuberculosis-anthrax-and |title=New kind of antibiotic may be more effective at fighting tuberculosis, anthrax, and other diseases |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Keiler|first1=Kenneth|last2=Ramadoss|first2=Nitya|last3=Alumasa|first3=John|last4=Cheng|first4=Lin|last5=Wang|first5=Yu|last6=Li|first6=Sharon|last7=Chambers|first7=Benjamin|last8=Chang|first8=Hoon|last9=Chatterjee|first9=Arnab|title=Small molecule inhibitors of trans-translation have broad-spectrum antibiotic activity |journal=[[PNAS]] |volume=110 |issue=25 |pages=10282–7 |date=2013 June 18|pmid=23733947 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1302816110|pmc=3690859 }} (primary source)</ref>

== Status of new antibiotics development (2013) ==
In a policy report released by the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]] (IDSA) on April 2013, IDSA expressed grave concern over the weak pipeline of antibiotics to combat the growing ability of bacteria, especially the [[Gram-negative bacilli]] (GNB), to develop resistance to antibiotics. Since 2009, only 2 new antibiotics were approved in United States, and the number of new antibiotics annually approved for marketing continues to decline. The report could identify only seven antibiotics currently in [[Phases of clinical research|phase]] 2 or phase 3 clinical trials to treat the GNB which includes ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'' and the ''[[Enterobacteriaceae]]'' bacteria, and these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of the resistance developed by those bacteria.<ref>{{cite news |title=Drug pipeline for worst superbugs ‘on life support’: report |author=Steenhuysen, Julie |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/04/18/us-antibiotics-superbugs-idINBRE93H05520130418?feedType=RSS&feedName=health&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&dlvrit=309303 |agency=Reuters |date=18 April 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=IDSA2013>{{cite journal |last1=Boucher|first1=Helen|last2=Talbot|first2=George|last3=Benjamin|first3=Daniel|last4=Bradley|first4=John|last5=Guidos|first5=Robert|last6=Jones|first6=Ronald|last7=Murray|first7=Barbara|last8=Bonomo|first8=Robert|last9=Gilbert |first9=David |author10=Infectious Diseases Society of America |title=10 X '20 Progress – Development of new drugs active against gram-negative bacilli: an update from the Infectious Diseases Society of America |journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]] |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=1685–1694 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pmid=23599308 |doi=10.1093/cid/cit152 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/12/1685.full |pmc=3707426 }}</ref>
Some of these seven new antibiotics are combination of existent antibiotics, they include:
*Ceftolozane/[[tazobactam]] (CXA-201; CXA-101/tazobactam): [[Antipseudomonal]] [[cephalosporin]]/[[β-lactamase]] inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor). In phase 3.
*[[Ceftazidime]]/[[avibactam]] (ceftazidime/NXL104): Antipseudomonal cephalosporin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor). In phase 3.
*[[Ceftaroline]]/avibactam (CPT-avibactam; ceftaroline/NXL104): Anti-[[MRSA]] cephalosporin/ β-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) 
*[[Imipenem]]/MK-7655: [[Carbapenem]]/ β-lactamase inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor). In phase 2. 
*[[Plazomicin]] (ACHN-490): [[Aminoglycoside]] (protein synthesis inhibitor). In phase 2.
*[[Eravacycline]] (TP-434): A synthetic [[tetracycline]] derivative / protein synthesis inhibitor targeting the ribosome being developed by Tetraphase. Phase 2 trials complete.<ref>Stynes, T.

*[[Brilacidin]] (PMX-30063): Peptide defense protein mimetic (cell membrane disruption). In phase 2.
The IDSA’s prognosis for sustainable R&D infrastructure for antibiotics development will depend upon clarification of FDA regulatory clinical trial guidance which would facilitate the speedy approval of new drugs, and the appropriate economic incentives for the pharmaceuticals companies to invest in this endeavor.<ref name=IDSA2013/>
