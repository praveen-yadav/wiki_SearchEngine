'''Dill''' ('''''Anethum graveolens'''''), is either a [[perennial plant|perennial]] or [[annual plant|annual]] [[herbaceous|herb]]. It is the sole species of the genus ''Anethum''.

==Growth==
Dill grows to {{convert|40|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with slender stems and alternate, finely divided, softly delicate [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The ultimate leaf divisions are {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of [[fennel]], which are threadlike, less than {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad, but harder in texture. The [[flower]]s are white to yellow, in small [[umbel]]s {{convert|2|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and straight to slightly curved with a longitudinally ridged surface.

==Etymology==
The name "dill" comes from Old English ''dile'', thought to have originated from a Norse or Anglo-Saxon word ''dylle'', meaning "to soothe or lull," {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} the plant having the [[carminative]] property of relieving gas.

Fresh and dried dill leaves (sometimes called "dill weed" to distinguish it from dill seed) are widely used as [[herb]]s in Germany, Greece, Poland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Baltic, Russia, and central Asia.

Like [[caraway]], the fernlike leaves of dill are aromatic and are used to flavor many [[food]]s such as [[gravlax]] (cured [[salmon]]), [[borscht]] and other [[soup]]s, as well as [[pickled cucumber|pickle]]s (where the dill flower is sometimes used). Dill is best when used fresh as it loses its flavor rapidly if dried; however, [[Freeze drying|freeze-dried]] dill leaves retain their flavor relatively well for a few months.

Dill seed, having a flavor similar to caraway but also resembling that of fresh or dried dill weed,<ref>[http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=71#historyuse Whole Foods Profile]{{verify credibility|date=July 2012}}</ref> is used as a [[spice]]. [[Dill oil]] is extracted from the leaves, stems and seeds of the plant. The oil from the seeds is distilled and used in the manufacturing of soaps.
<ref>{{cite book|title=Culinary Herbs: Their Cultivation Harvesting Curing and Uses|year=1912|publisher=Orange Judd Company|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21414/21414-h/21414-h.htm#Page_87|author=M. G. Kains|editor=American Agriculturist|archivedate=2007|format=English}}</ref>

Dill is often added to [[Fish (food)|fish]]. 

Dill is the [[eponymous]] ingredient in dill [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]]: cucumbers preserved in salty brine and/or vinegar.

==European cuisine==
In [[Poland]], where dill is called "koper," it is one of the most popular herbs used in the kitchen, and, along with parsley and chives, is used for various purposes. Fresh, finely cut dill leaves are used as topping to various soups, especially the hot red [[borsht]] and the cold borsht mixed with curds, kefir, yoghurt, or sour cream, which is served during hot summer weather and is called "chłodnik" ("cooler"). It is also popular in summer to drink fermented milk (curds, kefir, yoghurt, or buttermilk) mixed with finely cut dill (and sometimes other herbs). In the same way, prepared dill is used as a topping for boiled potatoes covered with fresh butter - especially in summertime when there are the so-called "new," or young, potatoes. The dill leaves can be mixed with butter beforehand, making it a dill butter, which can serve the same purpose. Dill leaves mixed with fresh cottage cheese (or hard white cheese "twaróg" mixed with cream) form one of the traditional cheese spreads used for sandwiches. Fresh dill leaves are used all year round as an ingredient for making fresh salads, ''e.g.'', one made of lettuce, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes, the way [[basil]] leaves are used in Italy and Greece. Fresh dill leaves mixed with sour cream are the basis for dressings, and it is especially popular to use this kind of sauce with freshly cut cucumbers, which practically are wholly immersed in the sauce, making thus a salad called "mizeria." The dill leaves serve as a basis for cooking dill sauce, used hot for baked fresh water fish and for chicken or turkey breast, or used hot or cold for hard boiled eggs (depending on the temperature of the eggs served).

In south-eastern Poland it is popular to cook a dill-based soup (zupa koperkowa), served with potatoes and hard boiled eggs. 
Whole stems including roots and flower buds are traditionally used to prepare Polish-style pickled cucumbers ([[ogórki kiszone]]), especially the so-called low-salt cucumbers ("ogórki małosolne"). Whole stems of dill (often including the roots) are also cooked with potatoes, especially the late potatoes of autumn and winter, so they resemble the flavor of the newer potatoes found in summer time. Some kinds of fish, especially trout and salmon, are also traditionally baked with both stems and leaves of dill. 

In [[Romania]] dill (''mărar'') is widely used as an ingredient for soups such as ''borş'' (pronounced "borsh"), pickles and other dishes, especially those based on peas, beans and cabbage. It is also popular for dishes based on potatoes and mushrooms and can be found in many summer salads (especially cucumber salad, cabbage salad and lettuce salad). During springtime, it is used together with spring onions in omelets. It often complements sauces based on sour cream or yogurt and is often mixed with salted cheese and used as a filling. Another popular dish with dill as a main ingredient is dill sauce, which is served with eggs and fried sausages.

In [[Hungary]], dill is very widely used. It is popular as a sauce or filling, especially in [[Langos]], and mixed with a type of cottage cheese. Dill is also used for [[pickling]] and in salads. The Hungarian name for dill is ''kapor''.

In [[Serbia]], dill is known as ''mirodjija'' and is used as an addition to soups, potato and cucumber salads and French fries. It also features in the Serbian proverb "бити мирођија у свакој чорби" /biti mirodjija u svakoj čorbi/ (to be a dill in every soup) which corresponds to the English proverb "to have a finger in every pie".

In [[Greece]], dill is known as 'άνηθος'(anithos). In antiquity it was used as an add-in in wines, which they were called "anithites oinos" (wine with anithos-dill). In modern days, dill is used in salads, soups, sauces, fish dishes and vegetable dishes.

In [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]], [[Azores]], dill (''endro'') is the most important ingredient of the traditional Holy Ghost soup (''sopa do Espírito Santo''). Dill is found practically everywhere in Santa Maria and is curiously rare in the other Azorean Islands.

==Asian cooking==
In [[Iran]], dill is known as ''shevid'' and is sometimes used with rice and called ''shevid-polo''. It is also used in Iranian ''aash'' recipes, and is also called ''sheved'' in [[Persian Language|Persian]].

In [[India]], dill is known as ''shepu'' (शेपू) in Marathi and Konkani, ''savaa'' in Hindi or ''soa'' in Punjabi. In Telugu, it is called ''Soa-kura'' (for herb greens). It is also called ''sabbasige soppu'' (<big>ಸಬ್ಬಸಿಗೆ ಸೊಪ್ಪು</big>) in [[Kannada]]. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] it is known as ''sada kuppi''(சதகுப்பி). In [[Malayalam]], it is ചതകുപ്പ (''chathakuppa'') or ശതകുപ്പ (''sathakuppa''). In Sanskrit, this herb is called ''shatapushpa''. In Gujarati, it is known as ''suva''. In India, dill is prepared in the manner of yellow ''moong dal'' as a main-course dish. It is considered to have very good antigas properties,so it is used as ''mukhwas'', or an after-meal digestive. It is also traditionally given to mothers immediately after childbirth. In the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, a smaller amount of fresh dill is cooked along with cut potatoes and fresh fenugreek leaves(Hindi आलू-मेथी-सोया).
In [[Manipur]], dill, locally known as ''pakhon'', is an essential ingredient of ''chagem pomba'' – a traditional Manipuri dish made with fermented soybean and rice.

In [[Laos]] and parts of northern [[Isan|Thailand]], dill is known in English as Lao coriander<ref name="Dill Profile">[http://www.livingherbs.com/products/dill/ Dill Profile]</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Davidson, A. | year = 2003 | page = 216 | isbn = 1-58008-452-4 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8nhfSFs79fUC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=laotian+coriander&source=bl&ots=HChuB7GgBB&sig=90upJ_JfrC4HWGuG10Z0LQZgnWg&hl=en&ei=E457SoDIDZKmNoOR1JwE&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=laotian%20coriander&f=false | title = Seafood of South-East Asia | edition = 2nd | publisher = Ten Speed Press }}</ref> ({{lang-lo|ຜັກຊີ}}, {{lang-th|ผักชีลาว}}).

In [[China]] dill is colloquially called ''huixiang'' (茴香), or more properly ''shiluo'' (莳萝). It is a common filling in [[baozi]] and [[bing (bread)|xianbing]] and can be used vegetarian, with rice vermicelli, or combined with either meat or eggs. Vegetarian dill baozi are a common part of a Beijing breakfast. In baozi and xianbing, it is often interchangeable with non-bulbing [[fennel]] and the term 茴香 can also refer to fennel, like caraway and coriander leaf share a name in Chinese as well. Dill is also stir fried as a potherb, often with egg, in the same manner as [[Chinese chives]]. It is commonly used in [[Taiwan]] as well. 

In [[Vietnam]], the use of dill in cooking is regional; it is used mainly in northern Vietnamese cuisine.

==Middle East uses==

In Arab countries, dill seed, called ''ain jaradeh'' (grasshopper's eye), is used as a spice in cold dishes such as ''[[fattoush]]'' and pickles. In Arab countries of the [[Persian Gulf]], dill is called ''shibint'' and is used mostly in fish dishes.

==Other regional cooking==
In [[Canada]], dill is a favorite herb to accompany poached salmon.

==Traditional uses==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
In [[Anglo-Saxon England]], as prescribed in ''Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England'' (also called ''Læceboc'', many of whose recipes were borrowed from Greek medicinal texts), dill was used in many traditional medicines, including those against jaundice, headache, boils, lack of appetite, stomach problems, nausea, liver problems, and many other ills.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Dill seeds can also be used to prepare herbal tea.

In [[India]] the leaves of dill and other greens are used to prepare a variety of local dishes which are served as an accompaniment to rotis or chapatis.

In [[ancient Greece]] fragrance was made from the leaves of dill. Also, athletes used to spread essence of dill all over their body, as muscle toner.

==Cultivation==
Successful cultivation requires warm to hot summers with high sunshine levels; even partial shade will reduce the yield substantially. It also prefers rich, well drained soil. The seeds are viable for three to ten years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The seed is harvested by cutting the flower heads off the stalks when the seed is beginning to ripen. The seed heads are placed upside down in a paper bag and left in a warm, dry place for a week. The seeds then separate from the stems easily for storage in an airtight container.

==Companion planting==
[[File:Anethum graveolens 001.JPG|thumb|Dill plants]]
When used as a [[companion plant]]ing, dill draws in many beneficial insects as the umbrella flower heads go to seed. Fittingly, it makes a good companion plant for cucumbers. It is a poor companion for carrots and tomatoes.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/14/episode-17-my-favorite-herbs-dill/|title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast Episode 17 My Favorite Herbs - Dill}}</ref>
