{{Politics of Croatia}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}
The '''politics of Croatia''' are defined by a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] framework, where the [[Prime Minister of Croatia]] is the head of government in a multi-party system. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government and the [[President of Croatia]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[Croatian Parliament]] ({{lang-hr|Sabor}}). The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The parliament adopted the current [[Constitution of Croatia]] on 22 December 1990 and decided to declare independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The declaration of independence came into effect on 8 October 1991. The constitution has since been amended several times. The first modern parties in the country developed in the middle of the 19th century, and their agenda and appeal changed, reflecting major social changes, such as the breakup of [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], dictatorship and social upheavals in the kingdom, [[World War II]], the establishment of Communist rule and the breakup of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]].

The President of the Republic ({{lang-hr|Predsjednik Republike}}) is the [[head of state]] and the [[commander in chief]] of the [[Military of Croatia|Croatian armed forces]] and is directly elected to serve a five-year term. The [[Government of Croatia|government]] ({{lang-hr|Vlada}}), the main executive power of Croatia, is headed by the prime minister, who has four deputy prime ministers, three of whom also serve as government ministers. Seventeen ministers are in charge of particular activities. The executive branch is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies. The [[Parliament of Croatia|parliament]] is a [[unicameral]] legislative body. The number of Sabor representatives ranges from 100 to 160; they are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution and laws; adoption of the [[government budget]], declarations of war and peace, defining national boundaries, calling [[referendum|referenda]] and elections, appointments and relief of officers, supervising the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting of amnesties. The Croatian constitution and legislation provides for regular presidential and parliamentary elections, and the election of county prefects and assemblies, and city and municipal mayors and councils.

Croatia has a three-tiered, independent judicial system governed by the Constitution of Croatia and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The [[Croatian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ({{lang-hr|Vrhovni sud}}) is the highest court of appeal in Croatia. There are other specialised courts in Croatia&mdash;commercial courts and the Superior Commercial Court, [[misdemeanour]] courts, the Superior Misdemeanour (criminal) Court, the Administrative Court and the [[Croatian Constitutional Court]] ({{lang-hr|Ustavni sud}}). The [[State Attorney's Office (Croatia)|State Attorney's Office]] represents the state in legal proceedings.

{{main|Constitution of Croatia}}
Croatia is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic.

==Legislature==
{{main|Parliament of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatian Parlament Sabor.jpg|thumb|right|Building of the [[Parliament of Croatia]]]]
The Parliament of Croatia ({{lang-hr|Sabor}}) is a unicameral legislative body. A second chamber, the ''Chamber of Counties'' ({{lang-hr|Županijski dom}}), was set up in 1993 pursuant to the 1990 Constitution. The Chamber of Counties was originally composed of three deputies from each of the twenty counties and the city of [[Zagreb]]. However, as it had no practical power over the Chamber of Representatives, it was abolished in 2001 and its powers were transferred to the county governments. The number of Sabor representatives can vary from 100 to 160; they are all elected by popular vote and serve four-year terms. 140 members are elected in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], up to six members are chosen by [[proportional representation]] to represent Croatians living abroad and five members represent ethnic and national communities or minorities.<ref name="Sabor-about">{{cite web|publisher=Sabor|url= http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=713|title=About the Parliament|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> The two largest political parties in Croatia are the SDP and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).

The Sabor meets in public sessions in two periods; the first from 15 January to 30 June, and the second from 15 September to 15 December. Extra sessions can be called by the President of the Republic, by the president of the parliament or by the government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution, enactment of laws, adoption of the state budget, declarations of war and peace, alteration of the country's boundaries, calling and conducting referenda and elections, appointments and relief of office, supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting amnesty.

[[File:Josipovic election night.jpg|thumb|left|Ivo Josipović, 2010 election victory speech]]
The Croatian constitution and legislation provides for regular elections for the office of the President of the Republic, parliamentary, county prefects, county assemblies, city and municipal mayors and city and municipal councils. The President of the Republic is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens of Croatia. A majority vote is required to win. A [[Two-round system|runoff election]] round is held in cases where no candidate secures the majority in the first round of voting. The presidential elections are regulated by the constitution and dedicated legislation; the latter defines technical details, appeals and similar issues.<ref name="Ustav-RH">{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne Novine|language=Croatian|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_07_85_2422.html|title=Ustav Republike Hrvatske|trans_title=Constitution of the Republic of Croatia|date=9 July 2010|accessdate=11 October 2011}}</ref>

140 members of parliament are elected to a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, which are defined on the basis of the existing county borders, with amendments to achieve a uniform number of eligible voters in each constituency to within 5%. Citizens of Croatia living abroad are counted in an eleventh constituency; however, its number of seats was not fixed for the last parliamentary election. It was instead calculated based on numbers of votes cast in the ten constituencies in Croatia and the votes cast in the eleventh constituency. In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 parliamentary election]] the eleventh constituency elected five MPs. Constitutional changes first applied in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]] have abolished this scheme and permanently assigned three MPs to the eleventh constituency.<ref name="Sabor-Izbori2011">{{cite web|publisher=[[Sabor]]|url=http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx|language=Croatian|title=U novi saziv Hrvatskoga sabora bira se 151 zastupnik|trans_title=151 MPs to be Elected to the next Sabor|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> Additionally, eight members of parliament are elected by voters belonging to twenty-two recognised minorities in Croatia: the [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb minority]] elects three MPs, [[Hungarians of Croatia|Hungarians]] and [[Italians of Croatia|Italians]] elect one MP each, [[Czechs of Croatia|Czech]] and [[Slovaks of Croatia|Slovak]] minorities elect one MP jointly, while all other minorities elect two more MPs to the parliament.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne Novine]]|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski Sabor|trans_title=Croatian Parliament Members Election Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/305405.html|date=23 April 2003|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref> The [[D'Hondt method|Standard D'Hondt formula]] is applied to the vote, with a 5% [[election threshold]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Večernji list]]|language=Croatian|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/kukuriku-koalicija-podijelila-mjesta-listama-ali-ne-resore-clanak-310528|title=Kukuriku-koalicija podijelila mjesta na listama, ali ne i resore|trans_title=Kukuriku coalition carves out candidate lists, not the ministries|date=15 July 2011|authors=Petra Maretić-Žonja, Vojislav Mazzocco|accessdate=9 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=State Electoral Commission|url=http://www.izbori.hr/izbori/ip.nsf/WPDS/F70CFD524E0E4545C1257455004696F5?open&1|title=Izborni postupak u izborima za Hrvatski sabor|trans_title=Election process for Croatian parliamentary elections|language=Croatian|accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref> The last parliamentary election, held in 2011, elected 151 MPs.<ref name="Sabor-Izbori2011"/>

===Within Austria-Hungary===
[[File:Dragutin Weingärtner, Hrvatski sabor 1848. god.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of the [[Sabor]] in 1848]]

[[Revolutions of 1848|Events of 1848]] in Europe and the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Austrian Empire]] brought dramatic changes to Croatian society and politics, provoking the [[Croatian national revival]] that strongly influenced and significantly shaped political and social events in Croatia. At the time, the [[Sabor]] and Ban [[Josip Jelačić]] advocated the severance of ties with the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]], emphasising links to other [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] lands within the empire. Several prominent Croatian political figures emerged, such as [[Ante Starčević]], [[Eugen Kvaternik]], [[Franjo Rački]] and [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]]. A period of neo-absolutism was followed by the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and the [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]], which granted limited independence to Croatia. This was compounded by Croatian claims of uninterrupted statehood since the early Middle Ages as a basis for a modern state. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to the sentiment were the [[Party of Rights (1861–1929)|Party of Rights]], led by Starčević and Kvaternik, and the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Croatia)|People's Party]], led by [[Janko Drašković]], [[Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski]], [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] and [[Ivan Mažuranić]]. They were opposed by the [[National Constitutional Party]], which was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and the 1918, and advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary.<ref name="Matković-parties">{{cite journal|journal=Review of Croatian History|issn=1845-4380|publisher=Croatian Institute of History|volume=6|issue=1|year=2011|month=April|author=Stjepan Matković|title=Croatian-Slovenian relations in politics, 1848-1914: examples of mutual ties|pages=115–132|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=100777|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>

Other significant parties formed in the era were the [[Serb People's Independent Party]], which later formed the [[Croat-Serb Coalition]] with the Party of Rights and other Croat and Serb parties. The Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The leaders of the Coalition were [[Frano Supilo]] and [[Svetozar Pribićević]]. The [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS), established in 1904 and led by [[Stjepan Radić]], advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918.<ref name="Matković-parties"/> In [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], the two major parties were the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Dalmatia)|People's Party]] – a branch of the People's Party active in Croatia-Slavonia – and the [[Autonomist Party]], advocating maintaining autonomy of Dalmatia, opposite to the People's Party demands for unification of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party, most notably led by [[Antonio Bajamonti]], was also linked to [[Italian irredentism]]. By 1900, the Party of Rights had made considerable gains in Dalmatia.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru|publisher=[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]|issn=1330-0474|title=O broju Talijana/talijanaša u Dalmaciji XIX. stoljeća|language=Croatian|trans_title=Concerning the Number of Italians/Pro-Italians in Dalmatia in the 19th century|author=Šime Peričić|issue=45|year=2003|month=September|pages=327–355|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref> The Autonomists won the first three elections, but all elections since 1870 were won by the People's Party. In the period 1861&ndash;1918 there were seventeen elections in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and ten in the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].<ref name="Matković-parties"/>

===Modern Croatia===
[[File:Vlada12.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović]] in December 2011]]
In 1989, the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia since the beginning of the Communist rule was the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, [[Ivica Račan]] became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.<ref name=Dunatov>{{cite journal|journal=Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru|publisher=Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|issn=1330-0474|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=95848|title=Začetci višestranačja u Hrvatskoj 1989. godine|trans_title=The Origins of the Multi-Party System in Croatia in 1989|author=Šime Dunatov|issue=52|year=2010|month=December|pages=381–397|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref>

By the time of the first round of the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first multi-party elections]], held on 22 April 1990, there were 33 registered parties. The most relevant parties and coalitions were the League of Communists of Croatia – Party of Democratic Changes (the renamed Communist party), the  Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and the [[Coalition of People's Accord]] (KNS), which included the HSLS led by [[Dražen Budiša]], and the HSS, which resumed operating in Croatia in December 1989.<ref name="HSS-Statut"/><ref name=Dunatov/> The runoff election was held on 6 May 1990. The HDZ, led by [[Franjo Tuđman]], won ahead of the reformed Communists and the KNS. The KNS, led by [[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]] and [[Miko Tripalo]] – who had led the Croatian Spring – soon splintered into individual parties. The HDZ maintained a parliamentary majority until the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary election]], when it was defeated by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] (SDP), led by Račan. [[Franjo Gregurić]], of the HDZ, was appointed prime minister to head a [[national unity government]] in July 1991 as the [[Croatian War of Independence]] escalated in intensity. His appointment lasted until August 1992.<ref name="VRH-Prethodne">{{cite web|publisher=Government of Croatia|url=http://www.vlada.hr/hr/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/prethodne_vlade_rh|language=Croatian|title=Prethodne vlade RH|trans_title=Previous governments of the Republic of Croatia|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> During his term, Croatia's declaration of independence from Yugoslavia took effect on 8 October 1991.<ref name="Sabor-Independence-8Oct1991"/> The HDZ returned to power in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2003|2003 parliamentary election]], while the SDP remained the largest opposition party.<ref name="Arhiva-Izbora">{{cite web|publisher=State Election Commission|url=http://www.izbori.hr/arhiva/arhiva.html|title=Arhiva izbora|trans_title=Elections Archive|language=Croatian|accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>
