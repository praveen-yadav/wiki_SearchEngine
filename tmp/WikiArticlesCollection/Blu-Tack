'''Blu-tack''' is a reusable [[putty]]-like [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]] produced by [[Bostik]], commonly used to attach lightweight objects (such as posters or sheets of paper) to walls or other dry surfaces. Traditionally blue (blu), it is also available in other colours.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/A493553|title=Blu-Tack|work=H2G2|accessdate=27 January 2012}}{{Failed verification|date=October 2013}}</ref>

The composition of Blu-Tack is a manufacturing secret but is described as a synthetic rubber compound without hazardous properties under normal conditions.  It can be swallowed without harm and is noncarcinogenic.  It is non-soluble and is denser than water.  The material has a [[flash point]] of 93&nbsp;°C / 200&nbsp;°F, at which it releases [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], water vapour, [[oxides of nitrogen]], and toxic fumes.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

== History ==
In 1970, laboratory researcher Alan Holloway was working for sealant manufacturer [[Ralli Bondite]] of [[Waterlooville]], England. Ralli Bondite was a wholly owned subsidiary of G & L Ralli Investment & Trustee Co. Ltd.  Holloway inadvertently produced a product that was useless as a sealant, but pliable and semi-elastic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This novelty product was demonstrated by Ralli Bondite management to visiting executives from another sealant and adhesive manufacturer, as a means of wall mounting notices. There was no need for secrecy about the formula, as it was of no use for a gun-grade [[Mastic (disambiguation)|mastic]], the main product of Ralli Bondite. Initially the potential of this material was not fully recognised, but later Bostik commenced research into the development of what they were eventually to launch as Blu-Tack. In its conceptual stage Blu-Tack was white, but was coloured blue in response to concerns received from [[marketing research]] regarding the possibility of children mistaking it for edible [[confectionery]].<ref>{{cite web

In the [[United Kingdom]] in March 2008, 20,000 numbered packs of pink Blu-Tack  were made available, to help raise money for Breast Cancer Campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/36960/Blu-Tack-goes-pink-for-charity |title=Daily Express &#124; UK News :: Blu-Tack goes pink for charity |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> with 10 pence from each pack going to the charity. The formulation was slightly altered to retain complete consistency with its blue counterpart. Since then, many coloured variations have been made, including red and white, yellow and a green [[Halloween]] pack.

Like all poster putties, Blu-Tack provides an alternative to the artist's traditional [[kneaded eraser]], having a superior grip and plasticity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Blu-Tack can be finely shaped and worked into even very small areas. Like kneaded erasers, it can be stretched and kneaded to freshen its working surfaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Blu-Tack is also used for sculpture. In 2007 artist Elizabeth Thompson created a 200-kilogram sculpture of a house spider using Blu-Tack over a wire frame. It took around 4000 packs and was exhibited at London Zoo.<ref>{{cite web|author=By tulpastudios Elizabeth Thompson+ Add Contact |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/elizabeth_thompson/2574564991/ |title=Elizabeth Thompson Blu tack spider &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}</ref> Other artists have created works from the material including stop-motion animation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Blu-Tack can also be used to pick up and transfer images from printed cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Blu-Tack acts as an excellent damping agent for sound and vibration applications, due to its low amplitude response properties.<ref>http://www.stereophile.com/content/sound-surprise-loudspeakerstand-interface-page-1</ref>

Blu-Tack works excellently as an alternative to clay bar for removing contaminents, and restoring car paintwork.
