The River '''Daugava''' (in [[Latvian language|Latvian]]) or '''Western Dvina''' ({{lang-ru|Западная Двина́ (Zapadnaya Dvina)}}; {{lang-be|Заходняя Дзвіна}}, {{IPA-be|zaˈxodnʲaja dzʲvʲiˈna|}}, <small>traditionally</small> Дзвiна, ''Dzvina''; {{lang-de|Düna}}), not to be confused with [[Northern Dvina]], is a [[river]] rising in the [[Valdai Hills]], [[Russia]], flowing through Russia, [[Belarus]], and [[Latvia]], draining into the [[Gulf of Riga]] in [[Latvia]], an arm of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The total length of the river is {{convert|1020|km|mi|abbr=on}}:<ref name=statistics /> {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in Russia, {{convert|338|km|mi|abbr=on}} in Belarus,<ref name=statistics /> and {{convert|352|km|mi|abbr=on}} in Latvia.<ref name="Latvian Encyclopedia">{{Latvian Encyclopedia|2|137}}</ref> In the 19th century, it was connected by a canal to the [[Berezina]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers (the canal is currently not functioning). The Daugava forms part of the international border between Latvia and Belarus.

According to C.Michael Hogan, the Daugava River began experiencing environmental deterioration in the era of Soviet collective agriculture (producing considerable adverse water pollution runoff) and a wave of hydroelectric power projects.

There are three [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[dam]]s on the Daugava River – [[Rīgas HES]] just upstream from [[Riga]] or {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mouth of the river, [[Ķegums Hydro Power Plant|Ķegums HPP]] another {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} further up or {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mouth, and [[Pļaviņas Hydro Power Plant|Pļaviņas HPP]] another {{convert|37|km|mi|abbr=on}} upstream or {{convert|107|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mouth. A fourth one, [[Daugava 1 Hydro Power Plant|Daugavpils HES]], has been planned but has faced strong opposition. [[Belarus]] currently plans to build several hydroelectric dams on the Belarusian part of Western Dvina.

==Geography==
The total catchment area of the river is {{convert|87900|km²|mi2|abbr=on}}, {{convert|33150|km²|mi2|abbr=on}} of which are within [[Belarus]].<ref name=statistics />

== Etymology ==
The Latvian name for the river, "Daugava" originated from the ancient Baltic words for "the great water" (daudz ūdens).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The names for the Daugava in other languages; Dyna – Düna – Двина – Дзьвіна – Dźwina – Dvina have an unclear origin. This name is mentioned in the Viking sagas and the [[Chronicle of Nestor]].
According to the [[Max Vasmer]]'s Etymological Dictionary, the [[toponym]] Dvina clearly cannot stem from a [[Uralic language]], and it possibly comes from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] word which used to mean ''river'' or ''stream''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Фасмер|first=Макс|title=Этимологический словарь Фасмера|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fshare%2Fstarling%2Fmorpho&morpho=1&basename=morpho%5Cvasmer%5Cvasmer&first=1&off=&text_word=%D0%94%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0&method_word=substring&ic_word=on&text_general=&method_general=substring&ic_general=on&text_origin=&method_origin=substring&ic_origin=on&text_trubachev=&method_trubachev=substring&ic_trubachev=on&text_editorial=&method_editorial=substring&ic_editorial=on&text_pages=&method_pages=substring&ic_pages=on&text_any=&method_any=substring&sort=word&ic_any=on|language=Russian|page=161}}</ref>
