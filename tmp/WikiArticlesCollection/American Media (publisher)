'''American Media, Inc.''' is an [[United States|American]] publisher of magazines, [[supermarket tabloid]]s, and books.

==Company background==
"American Media" is not to be confused with the international event coverage firm "American Media Distribution" (www.americanmediadistribution.com). The modern American Media came into being after [[Generoso Pope, Jr.]], longtime owner of ''[[The National Enquirer]]'', died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership. American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' from Rupert Murdoch. The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' and the ''[[National Examiner]]'') followed nine years later.

American Media's corporate headquarters in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Florida]], figured prominently in news headlines in late 2001, after an [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attack]] was perpetrated on the company. Since then the corporate headquarters have moved to [[New York City]] at 1 Park Avenue in [[Manhattan]], before moving to the [[Financial District]] to the former [[JP Morgan Chase]] headquarters at 4 New York Plaza. That building was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Sandy]] but reopened in February 2013. The [[CEO]], [[David J. Pecker]], travels between the Boca Raton and New York offices while managing the company.

AMI continued to expand after it bought [[Joe Weider]]'s Weider Publications in 2002. Joe Weider continues to manage control of his magazines under AMI's Weider Publications subsidiary.

American Media also owns Distribution Services, an in-store magazine merchandising company. In fall 2002, it launched the book-publishing [[imprint]], AMI Books.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030804/21271-american-media-to-expand-book-program-.html|volume= 250 |issue =31 |date=August 04, 2003|title=American Media to Expand Book Program|first=Jim |last=Milliot|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|archivedate=February 29, 2012|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/65pNvadXR|deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[Roger Altman]], through [[Evercore Partners]], bought a controlling stake in American Media in 1999.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1007/The_Clintonite_who_owns_National_Enquirer.html The Clintonite who owns National Enquirer] Ben Smith, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'', October 11, 2007</ref> In 2009, American Media was taken over by its bondholders to keep it out of bankruptcy.

In November 2010, American Media filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection due to nearly $1 billion in debt, and assets of less than $50,000. Its subsidiary, American Media Operations Inc., listed assets of $100 to $500 million and debt of over $1 billion.<ref>{{cite web|title='National Enquirer' Publisher Files for Chapter 11|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> It exited in December.
