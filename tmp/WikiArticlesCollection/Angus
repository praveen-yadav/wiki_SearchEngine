'''Angus''' ({{lang-gd|Aonghas}}) is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas of Scotland]], a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. The council area borders [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Dundee City]] and [[Perth and Kinross]]. Main industries include [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Global pharmaceuticals company GSK has a significant presence in Montrose in the north of the county.

Angus was historically a [[Shires of Scotland|county]], known officially as '''Forfarshire''' from the 18th century until 1928. It remains a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. In 1975 its administrative functions were transferred to the council district of the [[Tayside]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|Region]], and in 1995 further reform resulted in the establishment of the unitary Angus Council.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The area that now comprises Angus has been occupied since at least the [[Neolithic period]]. Material taken from [[posthole]]s from an enclosure at Douglasmuir, near [[Friockheim]], about five miles north of Arbroath have been [[radiocarbon date]]d to around 3500&nbsp;BC The function of the enclosure is unknown, but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes.<ref name="Douglasmuir">

[[Bronze age]] archaeology is to be found in abundance in the area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet.<ref>Jervise, A. (1863), [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_005/5_100_102.pdf Notice of stone cists and an urn, found near Arbroath, Forfarshire]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}. Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland 5, 100–102. ahds.ac.uk; Retrieved 11 December 2008</ref> [[Iron Age]] archaeology is also well represented, for example in the [[souterrain]] nearby Warddykes cemetery<ref>Watkins, T. and Barclay, G.

===Mediaeval history===
The county is traditionally associated with the [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdom of Circinn, which is thought to have encompassed Angus and the [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]]. Bordering it were the kingdoms of Ce (Mar and Buchan) to the North, Fotla (Atholl) to the West, and Fib (Fife) to the South. 

The most visible remnants of the Pictish age are the numerous [[Pictish stones|sculptured stones]] that can be found throughout Angus. Of particular note are the collections found at [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones|Aberlemno]], [[St Vigeans Sculptured Stones Museum|St Vigeans]], [[Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones|Kirriemuir]] and [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones|Monifieth]].

Angus shares borders with [[Kincardineshire]] to the north-east, [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the north and [[Perthshire]] to the west. Southwards, it faces [[Fife]] across the [[Firth of Tay]].

Angus is marketed as the birthplace of Scotland. The signing of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] at [[Arbroath Abbey]] in 1320 marked Scotland's establishment as an independent nation. It is an area of rich history from Pictish times onwards. Notable historic sites in addition to Arbroath Abbey include Glamis Castle, Arbroath Signal Tower museum and the Bell Rock Light House.

Main industries include [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Global pharmaceuticals company GSK has a significant presence in Montrose in the north of the county.

==Demography==
===Population structure===
In the 2001 census the population of Angus was recorded as 108,400. 20.14% were under the age of 16, 63.15% were between 16 and 65 and 18.05% were aged 65 or above.

Of the 16 to 74 age group, 32.84% had no formal qualifications, 27.08% were educated to 'O' Grade/Standard Grade level, 14.38% to Higher level, 7.64% to HND or equivalent level and 18.06% to degree level.

===Language in Angus===
The most recent available census results (2001) show that [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] is spoken by 0.45% of the Angus population. This, similar to other lowland areas, is lower than the national average of 1.16%.<ref>{{citation

Historically, the dominant language in Angus was [[Pictish language|Pictish]] until the sixth to seventh centuries AD when the area became progressively gaelicised, with Pictish extinct by the mid-ninth century.<ref>Forsyth, 1997; Forsyth, 2006</ref> Gaelic/[[Middle Irish]] began to retreat from lowland areas in the late-eleventh century and was absent from the Eastern lowlands by the fourteenth century. It was replaced there by [[Middle Scots]], the contemporary local [[South Northern]] dialect of [[Modern Scots]], while Gaelic persisted as a majority language in the highland Glens until the 19th century.<ref>Smout, 1969; Withers, 1984</ref> [[Scottish English]] is now increasingly replacing Scots.

Angus Council are planning to raise the status of Gaelic in the county by adopting a series of measures, including bilingual road signage, communications, vehicle livery and staffing.<ref>{{citation

==Government==
===Local government===
'''Angus''' ({{lang-gd|Aonghas}}) is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas of Scotland]].  In 1996, two-tier local government council was abolished and Angus was established as one of the replacement single-tier [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Council Areas]].

The boundaries of the present council area are exactly the same as those of the county minus the City of [[Dundee]].

The council area borders [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Dundee City]] and [[Perth and Kinross]].  

===Parliamentary representation===
Areas similar to that of the council area are covered by the [[Angus (UK Parliament constituency)|Angus Westminster constituency for the UK Parliament]] and the area is also represented at the Scottish Parliament by both the [[Angus (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus]] and [[North Tayside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|North Tayside Holyrood constituencies]].

==Geography==
Angus can be split into three geographic areas. To the north and west, the [[topography]] is mountainous. This is the area of the five [[Angus Glens]], which is sparsely populated and where the main industry is [[hill-farming]]. To the south and east the topography consists of rolling hills bordering the sea. This area is well populated, with the larger towns and the city of Dundee on the coast. In between lies [[Strathmore, Angus and Perth & Kinross|Strathmore]] (''the Great Valley''), which is a fertile agricultural area noted for the growing of potatoes, soft fruit and the raising of [[Angus cattle]]. Montrose in the north east of the county is notable for its tidal basin.
