'''Bolventor''' ({{lang-kw|Bedhasbold}}) is a hamlet on [[Bodmin Moor]] in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is situated in [[Altarnun]] [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] between [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] and [[Bodmin]].<ref>Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 ''Plymouth & Launceston'' ISBN 978-0-319-23146-3</ref>

Bolventor is the location of the famous [[Jamaica Inn]] coaching inn. It is bypassed by a [[dual carriageway]] section of the [[A30 road|A30]] trunk road; before the bypass was built the village straddled the A30 road.

[[Daphne du Maurier]], a former resident, chose Bolventor as the setting for her novel about Cornish [[smuggling|smugglers]] titled ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]''.  The inn that inspired the novel, [[Jamaica Inn]], has stood beside the main road through the village since 1547. It is now a tourist attraction in its own right and dominates the village. 

The small [[Church (building)|church]] (dedicated to the Holy Trinity) that lies to the east of the village closed some years ago. A mile from Bolventor there was a chapel of St Luke (from the 13th to the early 16th century): the font is now at the church of [[Tideford]].<ref>Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 62</ref> Bolventor parish was established in 1846 (before that date the village was in St Neot parish) but has now been merged with [[Altarnun]]. 

The village has been said to take its name from the "Bold Venture" that it must have appeared to build a farm in this moorland, but this is probably [[folk etymology]], as "Bol-" is a common prefix in Cornish placenames. It is much more likely that the name derives from the 'Bold Adventure' tin-working area which was in operation near Jamaica Inn during the 1840s-1850s <ref>R.D. Penhallurick Tin in Antiquity (2008) Maney; p. 207</ref>
