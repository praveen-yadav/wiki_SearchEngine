The word '''neuroleptic''' originates from the Greek word ''lepsis'' ("seizure" or "fit").<ref>{{cite book|title=Moby's Medical Dictionary|publisher=Elsevier}}</ref>

A first generation of antipsychotics, known as [[typical antipsychotics]], was discovered in the 1950s. Most of the drugs in the second generation, known as [[atypical antipsychotics]], have been developed more recently, although the first atypical antipsychotic, [[clozapine]], was discovered in the 1950s and introduced clinically in the 1970s. Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's [[dopamine pathway]]s, but atypicals tend to act on [[serotonin]] receptors as well.

Notable and relatively common [[adverse effect|adverse]] effects of antipsychotics include [[extrapyramidal symptoms]] (which involve motor control) and [[hyperprolactinaemia]] primarily in typicals and weight gain and metabolic abnormalities mostly in atypicals.<ref name = "SCZ">Frankenburg FR, Dunayevich E, Albucher RC, Talavera F.

==Medical uses==
Antipsychotics are most frequently used for the following conditions:
* [[Schizophrenia]]
* [[Schizoaffective disorder]] most commonly in conjunction with either an antidepressant (in the case of the depressive subtype) or a mood stabiliser (in the case of the bipolar subtype). 
* [[Bipolar disorder]] (acute mania and mixed episodes may be treated with either typical or atypical antipsychotics, although atypical antipsychotics are usually preferred seeing how they tend to have more favourable adverse effect profiles<ref name = "Lancet 09" /> and, according to a recent meta-analysis, they tend to have a lower liability for causing conversion from mania to depression.<ref name = "Haldep">Goikolea JM, Colom F, Torres I, Capapey J, Valentí M, Undurraga J, et al.

===Schizophrenia===
In people with schizophrenia less than half (41%) showed any therapeutic response to an [[atypical antipsychotic]], compared to 24% on placebo, there is a decline in treatment response over time, and potentially a biases in the literature in favor of these medication.<ref name="pmid18180760">{{cite journal |author=Leucht S, Arbter D, Engel RR, Kissling W, Davis JM |title=How effective are second-generation antipsychotic drugs?

Some doubts have been raised about the long-term effectiveness of antipsychotics for schizophrenia, in part because two [[World Health Organization]] studies found individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to have better long-term outcomes in developing countries (where there is lower availability and use of antipsychotics and mental health problems are treated with more informal, community-led methods only) than in developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jablensky A, Sartorius N, Ernberg G, ''et al.'' |title=Schizophrenia: manifestations, incidence and course in different cultures.

Some argue that the evidence for antipsychotics from discontinuation-relapse studies may be flawed, because they do not take into account that antipsychotics may sensitize the brain and provoke psychosis if discontinued, which may then be wrongly interpreted as a relapse of the original condition.<ref name="Moncrieff-2006" /> Evidence from comparison studies indicates that at least some individuals with schizophrenia recover from psychosis without taking antipsychotics, and may do better in the long term than those that do take antipsychotics.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Harrow M, Jobe TH |title=Factors involved in outcome and recovery in schizophrenia patients not on antipsychotic medications: a 15-year multifollow-up study |journal=J.

The methods used in trials of antipsychotics, despite stating that the overall quality is "rather good," reported issues with the selection of participants (including that in schizophrenia trials up to 90% of people who are generally suitable do not meet the elaborate inclusion and exclusion criteria, and that negative symptoms have not been properly assessed despite companies marketing the newer antipsychotics for these); issues with the design of trials (including pharmaceutical company funding of most of them, and inadequate [[blind experiment|experimental "blinding"]] so that trial participants could sometimes tell whether they were on placebo or not); and issues with the assessment of outcomes (including the use of a minimal reduction in scores to show "response," lack of assessment of quality of life or recovery, a high rate of discontinuation, selective highlighting of favorable results in the abstracts of publications, and poor reporting of side-effects).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leucht S, Heres S, Hamann J, Kane JM |title=Methodological issues in current antipsychotic drug trials |journal=Schizophr Bull|volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=275–85 |year=2008 |month=March |pmid=18234700 |pmc=2632403 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm159}}</ref>

===Bipolar disorder===

Antipsychotics are routinely used, often in conjunction with [[Mood stabilizer|mood stabilisers]] such as [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]]/[[Valproate semisodium|valproate]], as a first-line treatment for manic and mixed episodes associated with [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name = "Maudsley">Taylor D, Paton C, Kapur S, Taylor D.

Applied Therapeutics: The Clinical Use of Drugs. 9th ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2009.</ref> The reason for this combination is the therapeutic delay of the aforementioned mood stabilisers (for valproate therapeutic effects are usually seen around five days after treatment is commenced whereas lithium usually takes at least a week<ref name = "Young" /> before the full therapeutic effects are seen) and the comparatively rapid antimanic effects of antipsychotic drugs.<ref>Correll CU, Sheridan EM, DelBello MP.

* Aripiprazole
* Asenapine (which appears to have efficacy in improving depressive symptoms in acute mania/mixed episodes<ref>Azorin JM, Sapin C, Weiller E.

* Haloperidol (although this treatment is not recommended because of its relatively high propensity for inducing a depressive switch when compared to the atypical antipsychotics<ref name = "Haldep" />)
* Olanzapine
* Paliperidone<ref>Berwaerts J, Xu H, Nuamah I, Lim P, Hough D.

* Quetiapine
* Risperidone
* Ziprasidone

Three atypical antipsychotics (lurasidone,<ref name = "Lur" /> olanzapine<ref name = "OLD" /> and quetiapine<ref name = "QuetD" />) have also been found to possess efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression as a monotherapy. Whereas only olanzapine<ref name = "OlanM" /> and quetiapine<ref name = "QuetM1" /><ref name = "QuetM2" /> have been proven to be effective broad-spectrum (i.e. against all three types of relapse— manic, mixed and depressive) prophylactic (or ''maintenance'') treatments in patients with bipolar disorder. A recent Cochrane review also found that olanzapine had a less favourable risk/benefit ratio than [[lithium (medication)|lithium]] as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cipriani A, Rendell JM, Geddes J |title=Olanzapine in long-term treatment for bipolar disorder|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004367 |year=2009 |pmid=19160237 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004367.pub2|editor1-last=Cipriani |editor1-first=Andrea}}</ref>

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the UK [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] recommend antipsychotics for managing acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and as a longer-term maintenance treatment for reducing the likelihood of further episodes.<ref name="pmid15000267">{{cite journal |author=Lehman AF, Lieberman JA, Dixon LB, ''et al.'' |title=Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, second edition |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=161 |issue=2 Suppl |pages=1–56 |year=2004|month=February |pmid=15000267}}</ref><ref>The Royal College of Psychiatrists & The British Psychological Society (2003).[http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=289559 ''Schizophrenia.

A number of studies have looked at levels of "compliance" or "adherence" with antipsychotic regimes and found that discontinuation (stopping taking them) by patients is associated with higher rates of relapse, including hospitalization.

===Dementia===
Antipsychotics in old age [[dementia]] showed a modest benefit compared to placebo in managing aggression or psychosis, but that this was combined with a significant increase in serious adverse events. Thus antipsychotics should not be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis, but may be an option in a few cases where there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to others.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ballard C, Waite J |title=The effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of aggression and psychosis in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD003476 |year=2006 |pmid=16437455|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003476.pub2 |editor1-last=Ballard |editor1-first=Clive G}}</ref>

A recent [[randomized controlled trial]], however, found no benefit over [[placebo]] and recommended that the use of antipsychotics in this way should no longer be regarded as an acceptable routine treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Romeo R, Knapp M, Tyrer P, Crawford M, Oliver-Africano P |title=The treatment of challenging behaviour in intellectual disabilities: cost-effectiveness analysis |journal=J Intellect Disabil Res |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=633–43 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19460067 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2009.01180.x}}</ref>

The study found that only [[olanzapine]] outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging {{convert|44|lb}} over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean and maximal doses used for olanzapine were considerably higher than standard practice, and this has been postulated as a biasing factor that may explain olanzapine's superior efficacy over the other atypical antipsychotics studied, where doses were more in line with clinically relevant practices.<ref name="Bobo 2006">{{cite journal |author=Meltzer HY, Bobo WV |title=Interpreting the efficacy findings in the CATIE study: what clinicians should know |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=11 |issue=7 Suppl 7 |pages=14–24 |year=2006|month=July |pmid=16816796}}</ref> No other atypical studied ([[risperidone]], [[quetiapine]], and [[ziprasidone]]) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine, although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%).<ref name="pmid19058842">{{cite journal |author=Leucht S, Corves C, Arbter D, Engel RR, Li C, Davis JM |title=Second-generation versus first-generation antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia: a meta-analysis |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9657 |pages=31–41 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19058842|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61764-X}}</ref>

Antipsychotics are associated with a range of side effects. It is well-recognized that many people stop taking them (around two-thirds even in controlled drug trials) due in part to adverse effects.<ref name="Bellack06">{{Cite journal|author=Bellack AS |title=Scientific and Consumer Models of Recovery in Schizophrenia: Concordance, Contrasts, and Implications |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=432–42|year=2006 |month=July |pmid=16461575 |pmc=2632241 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj044}}</ref>

;Common (≥1% and up to 50% incidence for '''most''' antipsychotic drugs) adverse effects of antipsychotics include:
* Sedation (particularly common in patients on clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, chlorpromazine and zotepine<ref name = "Lancet 13" />)
* Headaches
* Dizziness
* Diarrhoea
* Anxiety
* Extrapyramidal side effects (particularly common in patients on first-generation antipsychotics) which includes:
:- [[Akathisia]] — an often distressing sense of inner restlessness.
:- [[Dystonia]]
:- [[Parkinsonism]]
:- Tremor
* Hyperprolactinaemia (rare for those on clozapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole<ref name = "Maudsley" /><ref name = "Lancet 13" />) which can cause:

:- [[Angle-closure glaucoma]] (also rare in patients on antipsychotics)
:- Blurred vision
:- Constipation
:- Dry mouth (although hypersalivation may also occur)

Withdrawal effects may also occur when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (presumably due to variations of potency and receptor activity). Such withdrawal effects can include [[cholinergic]] rebound, an activation syndrome, and motor syndromes including [[dyskinesia]]s.

==Mechanism of action==
All antipsychotic drugs tend to block [[dopamine receptor|D<sub>2</sub> receptors]] in the [[dopamine]] pathways of the [[Human brain|brain]]. This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] has been linked to psychotic experiences. It has also been proven{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} less dopamine released in the prefrontal cortex in the brain, and excess dopamine released from all other pathways, has also been linked to psychotic experiences, caused by abnormal dopaminergic function as a result of patients suffering from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Various neuroleptics such as [[haloperidol]] and [[chlorpromazine]] suppress dopamine chemicals throughout its pathways, in order for dopamine receptors to function normally.

In addition of the antagonistic effects of dopamine, antipsychotics (particular atypical narcoleptic) also block serotonin receptors. The over-activation of the serotonin receptor subtype, 5-HT2A has been linked to psychotic experiences such as visual and auditory hallucinations, various delusion disorders, and manic episodes.

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block dopamine receptors in the [[mesocortical pathway]], [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]], and the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. Blocking D<sub>2</sub> receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some of the unwanted [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]], in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[thioridazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side effects.

[[Atypical antipsychotic]] drugs have a similar blocking effect on D<sub>2</sub> receptors, however, most also act on serotonin receptors, especially [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT<sub>2C</sub>]] receptors. Both clozapine and quetiapine appear to bind just long enough to elicit antipsychotic effects but not long enough to induce extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin hypersecretion.<ref name = Atypicality>{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=SM|title=Describing an Atypical Antipsychotic: Receptor Binding and Its Role in Pathophysiology|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry|year=2003|volume=5|issue=Suppl. 3|pages=9–13|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0302.pdf}}</ref> 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism increases dopaminergic activity in the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], leading to a lowered extrapyramidal side effect liability among the atypical antipsychotics.<ref name = Atypicality /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gross|first1=Gerhard|last2=Geyer|first2=Mark A.|title=Current Antipsychotics|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-25761-2|pages=88–89|url=http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2/page/1|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Thorazine advert.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Thorazine ([[chlorpromazine]]) from the 1950s, reflecting the perceptions of psychosis, including the now-discredited perception of a tendency towards violence, from the time when antipsychotics were discovered<ref>The text reads:''When the patient lashes out against "them" - THORAZINE (brand of chlorpromazine) quickly puts an end to his violent outburst. 'Thorazine' is especially effective when the psychotic episode is triggered by delusions or hallucinations. At the outset of treatment, Thorazine's combination of antipsychotic and sedative effects provides both emotional and physical calming. Assaultive or destructive behavior is rapidly controlled. As therapy continues, the initial sedative effect gradually disappears. But the antipsychotic effect continues, helping to dispel or modify delusions, hallucinations and confusion, while keeping the patient calm and approachable. SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH LABORATORIES leaders in psychopharmaceutical research.''</ref>]]

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, [[chlorpromazine]], was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]]. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a non-permanent "pharmacological [[lobotomy]]".<ref name=pieters>{{Cite journal|last=Pieters|first=Toine|coauthors=Majerus, Benoît|title=The introduction of chlorpromazine in Belgium and the Netherlands (1951–1968); tango between old and new treatment features|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|date=1 December 2011|volume=42|issue=4|pages=443–452|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10993/2251|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2011.05.003}}</ref>Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than lobotomy, even though it was known to be capable of causing severe sedation. The underlying [[neurochemistry]] involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.

The discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to greatly reduced use of restraint, seclusion, and sedation in the management of agitated patients,<ref name=pieters /> and also led to further research that resulted in the development of [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, [[Henri Laborit]] described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.<ref>Healy, D. 2005. Psychiatric Drugs Explained. 4th Ed. Britain:Elsevier Limited. P. 8, 17.</ref>

Until the 1970s there was considerable debate within psychiatry on the most appropriate term to use to describe the new drugs.<ref name="king">{{Cite journal| issn = 1180-4882| volume = 27| issue = 3| pages = 168–75| last = King| first = Caroline| coauthors = Lakshmi N.P.

Thus, the word means ''taking hold of one's nerves''. This may refer to common side effects such as reduced activity in general, as well as lethargy and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and in some cases harmful, they were at one time, along with akathisia, considered a reliable sign that the drug was working.<ref name=pieters /> The term "ataraxy" was coined by the neurologist Howard Fabing and the classicist Alister Cameron to describe the observed effect of psychic indifference and detachment in patients treated with chlorpromazine.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-63353-6| last = Owens| first = David Griffith Cunningham| title = A guide to the extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic drugs|date = 1999-04-13|url = http://books.google.ie/books?id=RwRSahg71GkC&pg=PA12| page = 12}}</ref> This term derived from the Greek adjective "[[wikt:ἀτάρακτος|ἀτάρακτος]]" (''[[wikt:ataractic|ataraktos]]'') which means "not disturbed, not excited, without confusion, steady, calm".<ref name="king"/> In the use of the terms "[[tranquilizer]]" and "ataractic", medical practitioners distinguished between the "major tranquilizers" or "major ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat psychoses, and the "minor tranquilizers" or "minor ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat [[neurosis|neuroses]].<ref name="king"/> While popular during the 1950s, these terms are infrequently used today. They are being abandoned in favor of "antipsychotic", which refers to the drug's desired effects.<ref name="king"/> Today, "minor tranquilizer" can refer to [[anxiolytic]] and/or [[hypnotic]] drugs such as the [[benzodiazepines]] and [[nonbenzodiazepines]] which have some antipsychotic properties and are recommended for concurrent use with antipsychotics, and are useful for insomnia or drug-induced psychosis.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Saunders| isbn = 0-7216-5257-3 |last = Tasman| first = Allan| title = Psychiatry Volume 2| page = 956}}</ref> They are powerful (and potentially addictive) sedatives.

Antipsychotics are broadly divided into two groups, the [[typical antipsychotic|typical or first-generation antipsychotics]] and the [[atypical antipsychotic|atypical or second-generation antipsychotics]]. The typical antipsychotics are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical antipsychotics are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see[[dopamine antagonist]] and [[serotonin antagonist]]), multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and [[dopamine partial agonists]], which are often categorized as atypicals.<ref name=Horacek2006>{{Cite journal|author=Horacek J |title=Mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the neurobiology of schizophrenia|journal=CNS Drugs |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=389–409 |year=2006|pmid=16696579|doi=10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004|author-separator=,|author2=Bubenikova-Valesova V|author3=Kopecek M|display-authors=3|last4=Palenicek|first4=Tomas|last5=Dockery|first5=Colleen|last6=Mohr|first6=Pavel|last7=h??Schl|first7=Cyril}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
===Sales===
Antipsychotics are among the biggest selling and most profitable of all drugs, generating $22&nbsp;billion in global sales in 2008.<ref name="healthcarefinancenews.com">[http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/press-release/pipeline-antipsychotic-drugs-drive-next-market-evolutionPipelineantipsychotic drugs to drive next market evolution (2009)]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}.

===Formulations===

Antipsychotics are sometimes administered as part of compulsory psychiatric treatment via [[involuntary commitment|inpatient (hospital) commitment]] or [[outpatient commitment]]. They may be administered orally or, in some cases, through long-acting (depot) injections administered in the [[dorsogluteal muscle|dorsgluteal]], [[ventrogluteal area|ventrogluteal]] or [[deltoid muscle]].

===Controversy===
According to [[The Guardian]] newspaper: "At the heart of years of dissent against psychiatry through the ages has been its use of drugs, particularly antipsychotics, to treat distress. Do such drugs actually target any "psychiatric condition"? Or are they chemical control—a socially-useful reduction of the paranoid, deluded, distressed, bizarre and odd into semi-vegetative zombies?"<ref name="guard 1" />

Use of this class of drugs has a history of criticism in residential care. As the drugs used can make patients calmer and more compliant, critics claim that the drugs can be overused. Outside doctors can feel under pressure from care home staff.<ref>''GPs under 'pressure' to issue neuroleptics, claims professor'', Chemist + Druggist, 15 January 2009</ref> In an official review commissioned by UK government ministers it was reported that the needless use of anti-psychotic medication in dementia care was widespread and was linked to 1800 deaths per year.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nick Triggle |title=Dementia drug use 'killing many' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8356423.stm |date=12 November 2009 |newspaper=BBC |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author= |title=UK study warns against anti-psychotics for dementia |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/12/dementia-drugs-idUSLC44347420091112 |date=Nov 12, 2009 |newspaper=reuters |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref> In the US, the government has initiated legal action against the pharmaceutical company [[Johnson & Johnson]] for allegedly paying kickbacks to [[Omnicare]] to promote its antipsychotic [[Risperidone]] (Risperdal) in nursing homes.<ref name=Hilzenrath>{{Cite news|author=Hilzenrath, David S. |date=16 January 2010 |title=Justice suit accuses Johnson & Johnson of paying kickbacks |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011503903.html |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate= 17 January 2010}}</ref>

There is some controversy over maintenance therapy for schizophrenia.<ref name="Moncrieff-2006"/><ref name="Jobe2005"/> A review of studies about maintenance therapy concluded that long-term antipsychotic treatment was superior to placebo in reducing relapse in individuals with schizophrenia, although some of the studies were small.<ref name="Kane-2008">{{Cite journal| last1 = Kane | first1 = JM. | last2 = Leucht | first2 = S. | title = Unanswered Questions in Schizophrenia Clinical Trials | journal = Schizophr Bull | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–9 | month = Mar | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm143 | pmc = 2632396 | pmid = 18199633 }}</ref> A review of major [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] in North America found that a moderate number of patients with schizophrenia were seen to recover over time from their symptoms, raising the possibility that some patients may not require maintenance medication.<ref name="Jobe2005">{{Cite journal|author=Jobe TH, Harrow M |title=Long-term outcome of patients with schizophrenia: a review |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=14 |pages=892–900 |year=2005 |month=December |pmid=16494258 |url=http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2005/december/cjp-dec-05-Harrow-IR.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> It has also been argued that much of the research into long-term antipsychotic maintenance may be flawed due to failure to take into account the role of antipsychotic withdrawal effects on relapse rates.<ref name="Moncrieff-2006"/>

There has also been controversy about the role of [[pharmaceutical]] companies in [[marketing]] and promoting antipsychotics, including allegations of downplaying or covering up adverse effects, expanding the number of conditions or illegally promoting off-label usage; influencing drug trials (or their publication) to try to show that the expensive and profitable newer atypicals were superior to the older cheaper typicals that were out of patent. Following charges of illegal marketing, settlements by two large pharmaceutical companies in the US set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations.<ref name=bied2010/> One case involved [[Eli Lilly and Company]]'s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged [[Pfizer]] with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]].<ref name=bied2010/> In addition, [[Astrazeneca]] faces numerous personal-injury lawsuits from former users of [[Seroquel]] (quetiapine), amidst federal investigations of its marketing practices.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drug Maker's E-Mail Released in Seroquel Lawsuit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/business/28drug.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=27 July 2012|author=DUFF WILSON|date=27|month=February|year=2009}}</ref> By expanding the conditions for which they were indicated, Astrazeneca's Seroquel and Eli Lilly's Zyprexa had become the biggest selling antipsychotics in 2008 with global sales of $5.5&nbsp;billion and $5.4&nbsp;billion respectively.<ref name="healthcarefinancenews.com"/>

Harvard medical professor [[Joseph Biederman]] conducted research on bipolar disorder in children that led to an increase in such diagnoses. A 2008 Senate investigation found that Biederman also received $1.6 million in speaking and consulting fees between 2000 and 2007&nbsp;— some of them undisclosed to Harvard&nbsp;— from companies including makers of antipsychotic drugs prescribed for children with bipolar disorder. [[Johnson & Johnson]] gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, where research was conducted, in part, on [[Risperdal]], the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment.<ref name=bied2010/>

Pharmaceutical companies have also been accused of attempting to set the mental heath agenda through activities such as funding consumer advocacy groups.<ref name="pmid15278977">{{cite journal |author=Gosden R, Beder S |title=Pharmaceutical industry agenda setting in mental health policies |journal=Ethical Human Sciences and Services : an International Journal of Critical Inquiry |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=147–59 |year=2001 |pmid=15278977 |doi= |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/pharm-agenda.html}}</ref>
