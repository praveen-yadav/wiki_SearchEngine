'''Barbara Kay Olson''' (born '''Barbara Kay Bracher'''; December 27, 1955 {{spaced ndash}} September 11, 2001) was a lawyer and conservative American television commentator who worked for [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], and several other outlets.<ref>Lewis, Neil A. (September 13, 2001). [http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/13/us/barbara-olson-45-advocate-and-conservative-commentator.html?ref=barbaraolson "Barbara Olson, 45, Advocate And Conservative Commentator"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> She was a passenger on [[American Airlines Flight 77]] en route to a taping of [[Bill Maher]]'s television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' when it was flown into [[the Pentagon]] in the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Early life==
Olson was born Barbara Kay Bracher in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. (Her older sister, Toni Bracher-Lawrence, has been a member of the Houston City Council since 2004.) She graduated from [[Waltrip High School]]<ref>"[http://hs.houstonisd.org/WaltripHS/TriviaFolder/trivia.htm Waltrip Trivia Page]," ''[[Waltrip High School]]''</ref> and earned a Bachelor of Arts from the [[University of St. Thomas (Houston)|University of Saint Thomas]] in Houston. She earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Yeshiva University]]'s [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]].

==Career==
As a newcomer, she achieved a surprising measure of success, working for [[HBO]] and Stacy Keach Productions.{{When|date=May 2012}} In the early 1990s, she worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm of [[Wilmer Cutler & Pickering]] where she did civil litigation for several years before becoming an [[United States Attorney|Assistant U.S. Attorney]]. 

Olson's support in 1991 of Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas]] led to the formation of the [[Independent Women's Forum]]. At that time, Olson and friend [[Rosalie (Ricky) Gaull Silberman]] started an informal network of women who supported the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment by [[Anita Hill]], a former subordinate of Thomas at the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. Olson, who had also worked under Thomas at the EEOC and was a close friend of Thomas, spoke out on his behalf during his contentious Senate confirmation hearings. Olson later helped edit ''[[The Real Anita Hill]]'', a book by [[David Brock]] that savaged Hill and portrayed the harassment claim as a political [[Dirty tricks|dirty trick]] (Brock later recanted his claims and apologized to Hill). The Independent Women's Forum continued on with a goal of remaining a high profile group of women to advocate for economic and political freedom and personal responsibility. 

In 1994, Olson became chief investigative counsel for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]]. In that position, she led the [[Travelgate]] and [[Filegate]] investigations into the Clinton administration. She was later a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama law firm [[Balch & Bingham]]. 

==Personal life==
She married [[Theodore Olson]] in 1996. Theodore went on to successfully represent [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential candidate]] [[George W. Bush]] in the Supreme Court case of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', and subsequently served as [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] in the Bush administration. 

Olson was a frequent critic of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton administration]] and wrote a book about then [[First Lady]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''Hell to Pay: The Unfolding Story of Hillary Rodham Clinton'' (1999). Olson's  second book, ''The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House'' was published posthumously.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books/about/The_final_days.html?id=xANcUb7FY1UC | title=The final days: the last, desperate abuses of power by the Clinton White House | publisher=Regnery Pub. | author=Olson, Barbara | year=October 25, 2001}}</ref>

She was a resident of [[Great Falls, Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
