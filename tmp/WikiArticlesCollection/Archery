'''Archery''' is the art, practice, or skill of propelling [[arrow]]s with the use of a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], from Latin ''arcus''. Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat, while in modern times, its main use is that of a recreational activity. A person who participates in archery is typically known as an "archer" or "bowman", and one who is fond of or an expert at archery can be referred to as a "toxophilite".<ref>The noun "toxophilite", meaning "a lover or devotee of archery, an archer", is derived from ''[[Toxophilus]]'' by [[Roger Ascham]] —"imaginary proper name invented by Ascham, and hence title of his book (1545), intended to mean 'lover of the bow'."

==History==
{{main|History of archery}}
The bow seems to have been invented in the later [[Paleolithic]] or early [[Mesolithic]] periods. The oldest indication for its use in Europe comes from the {{Ill|de|Stellmoor}} in the {{Ill|de|Ahrensburg valley|Stellmoor–Ahrensburger Tunneltal}} north of [[Hamburg]], Germany and dates from the late [[Paleolithic]], about 10,000–9000 BCE. The arrows were made of [[pine]] and consisted of a mainshaft and a 15–20&nbsp;centimetre (6–8&nbsp;inches) long fore shaft with a [[flint]] point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by [[spear-thrower]]s rather than bows. The [[Holmegaard bow|oldest bows]] known so far come from the [[Holmegaard|Holmegård]] swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the spear-thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted [[projectiles]], on every continent except Australia, though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the [[Inuit]].

Bows and arrows have been present in [[Egypt]]ian culture since its [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] origins. In the [[Levant]], artifacts which may be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the [[Natufian culture]], (c. 12,800–10,300 [[Before Present|BP]] (before present)) onwards. The [[Khiamian]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPN A]] shouldered Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

[[Classical antiquity|Classical]] civilizations, notably the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]], [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Parthia]]ns, [[History of India|Indians]], [[History of Korea|Koreans]], [[History of China|Chinese]],  [[History of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Turkish archery|Turks]] fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. The [[English longbow]] proved its worth for the first time in Continental warfare at the [[Battle of Crécy]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Bow Evolution | url=http://www.archeryequipment.org/category/bow-evolution/ }}</ref> In the Americas archery was widespread at European contact.<ref>Zimmerman, Larry J., 1985 Peoples of Prehistoric South Dakota. University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London.</ref>

Archery was highly developed in [[Asia]]. The Sanskrit term for archery, [[dhanurveda]], came to refer to martial arts in general. In East Asia, [[Goguryeo]], one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.<ref>[[Book of the Later Han]] [http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%BE%8C%E6%BC%A2%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B785]"句驪一名貊耳有別種依小水為居因名曰小水貊出好弓所謂貊弓是也"</ref><ref name="koreantrad">{{citation|title=Korean Traditional Archery|last1=Duvernay|first1=Thomas A.|last2=Duvernay|first2=Nicholas Y.|publisher=Handong Global University|year=2007|postscript=<!--none-->}}</ref>

===Decline of archery===
The development of [[Gunpowder warfare|firearms]] rendered bows obsolete in warfare. Despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in Armenia, China, Egypt, England, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|America]], India, Japan, Korea, Turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery. Early firearms were vastly inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very susceptible to wet weather. However, they had longer effective range<ref name="koreantrad" /> and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions. They also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armour without any need to develop special musculature. Armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly-trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield. However, the bow and arrow is still an effective form of violence, and archers have seen action in the 21st century.<ref>Bows and arrows: deadly weapons of rural Kenya's war.

===Eighteenth-century revival===
[[File:1823 Royal British Bowmen archery club.jpg|thumb|A print of the 1822 meeting of the "Royal British Bowmen" archery club.]] 
Early recreational archery societies included the Finsbury Archers and the [[Popinjay (sport)|Kilwinning Papingo]], established in 1688. The latter held competitions in which the archers had to dislodge a wooden parrot from the top of an abbey tower. The Company of Scottish Archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world. It remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the [[aristocracy]]. Sir [[Ashton Lever]], an antiquarian and collector, formed the Toxophilite Society in London in 1781, with the patronage of [[George III|George, the Prince of Wales]].

Archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes. Recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and [[21 gun salute]]s for the competitors. The clubs were "the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of local elites.  As well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females.  Young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so.  Thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnes |first=Martin |url=http://swansea.academia.edu/MartinJohnes/Papers/127610/Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 |title=Archery—Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales—c-1780-1840 Martin Johnes. Archery, Romance and Elite Culture in England and Wales, c. 1780–1840 |publisher=Swansea.academia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> It was often consciously styled in the manner of a [[Medieval]] [[tournament]] with titles and [[laurel wreath]]s being presented as a reward to the victor. General meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies. Archery was also co-opted as a distinctively British tradition, dating back to the lore of [[Robin Hood]] and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in [[Europe]]. The societies were also elitist, and the new [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the preindustrial rural Britain. Particularly influential was Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s 1819 novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' that depicted the heroic character Lockseley winning an archery tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://martinfrost.ws/htmlfiles/archers.html|title=The Royal Company of Archers|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>

===A modern sport===
The 1840s saw the first attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport. The first [[Grand National Archery Society]] meeting was held in [[York]] in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardised as the 'York Round' - a series of shoots at 60, 80, and 100 yards. [[Horace A. Ford]] helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques. He won the Grand National 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.

[[Image:Saxton Pope and grizzly.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of Pope taken while grizzly hunting at Yellowstone]]
Towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as [[croquet]] and [[tennis]] became more popular among the middle class. By 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in Britain, but it was still included as a sport at the [[1900 Paris Olympics]].

In the United States, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century. The last of the [[Yahi#Yahi|Yahi Indian]] tribe, a native known as [[Ishi]], came out of hiding in California in 1911.<ref>{{citation|title=The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 4|last1=Allely|first1=Steve, et al.|year=2008|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-0-9645741-6-8|postscript=<!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Ishi in Two Worlds: a biography of the last wild Indian in North America|last=Kroeber|first=Theodora|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|place=Berkeley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-24037-7|postscript=<!--none-->}}</ref> His doctor, [[Saxton Pope]], learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.<ref>{{citation|title=Hunting with the Bow and Arrow|last=Pope|first=Saxton|publisher= G.

Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the Club was patterned after the prestigious [[Boone and Crockett Club]] and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices.

From the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.<ref name="technical">{{citation|title=Archery: The Technical Side.

These modern forms are now dominant in modern Western archery; traditional bows are in a minority. In the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by American enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding. Much of this expertise is available in the ''Traditional Bowyer's Bibles'' (see Additional reading). Modern game archery owes much of its success to [[Fred Bear]], an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.<ref>Bertalan, Dan.

===Mythology===
[[File:Vishwamitra archery training-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vishwamitra]] archery training from [[Ramayana]]]]

Deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers,  including the Greek [[Artemis]] and [[Apollo]], the Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Cupid]], the Germanic [[Agilaz]], continuing in legends like those of [[Wilhelm Tell]], [[Palnetoke]], or [[Robin Hood]]. Armenian [[Hayk]] and Babylonian [[Marduk]], Indian [[Arjuna]], [[Abhimanyu]], [[Eklavya]], [[Karna]], [[Rama]], and [[Shiva]], and Persian [[Arash (mythology)|Arash]] were all archers. Earlier Greek representations of [[Heracles]] normally depict him as an archer. 

The Nymphai Hyperboreioi (Νύμφαι Ὑπερβόρειοι) were worshipped on the Greek island of Delos as attendants of [[Artemis]], presiding over aspects of archery; Hekaerge (Ἑκαέργη), represented distancing, Loxo (Λοξώ), trajectory, and Oupis (Οὖπις), aim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NymphaiHyperboreiai.html |title=Nymphai Hyperboreioi at Theoi Greek Mythology |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> The

==Equipment==

===Types of bows===
{{main|Bow and arrow}}
While there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern) all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string. Bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.

Directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being [[self bow]]s, [[laminated bow]]s and [[composite bow]]s. Bows can also be classified by the [[shape|bow shape]] of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to simple straight bows, a [[Recurve bow#Recurve bow|recurve bow]] has tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung. The cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic [[longbow]] is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are D-shaped in cross section, and the [[flatbow]] has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section. The classic D-shape comes from the use of the wood of the yew tree. The sap-wood is best suited to the tension on the back of the bow, and the heart-wood to the compression on the belly. Hence, a cross-section of a yew longbow shows the narrow, light-coloured sap-wood on the 'straight' part of the D, and the red/orange heartwood forms the curved part of the D, to balance the mechanical tension/compression stress. [[Cable-backed bow]]s use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable. They were widespread among [[Inuit]] who lacked easy access to good bow wood. One variety of cable-backed bow is the Penobscot bow or [[Wabenaki]] bow, invented by Frank Loring (Chief Big Thunder) about 1900.<ref>The Penobscot War Bow. Gordon M Day. Contributions to Canadian Ethnology 1975. Canadian Ethnology Service Paper no. 31. ISSN 0316-1854. Ottawa 1975.</ref> It consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.

[[Image:recurve bow.jpg|thumb|right|Modern recurve bow]]

[[Compound bow]]s are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress. Most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this. A typical let-off is anywhere from 65%–80%. For example, a 60-pound bow with 80% let-off will only require 12 pounds of force to hold at full draw. Up to 99% let-off is possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conceptarchery.com/ |title=99% Let Off Bows |publisher=Concept Archery |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> The compound bow was invented by [[Holless Wilbur Allen]] in the 1960s (a US patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in North America. 

Mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the [[crossbow]]. They are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as [[siege engine]]s.

===Types of arrows and fletchings===

{{main|Arrow}}
The most common form of arrow consists of a [[Arrow straightener|shaft]] with an [[arrowhead]] attached to the front end and with [[fletching]]s and a [[Arrow#Nocks|nock]] attached to the other end. Arrows across time and history are normally carried in a container known as a [[quiver]], which can take many different forms . Shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid [[wood]], [[bamboo]] [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Wooden arrows are prone to warping. Fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily. Aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories. Carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s and are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows. Today, arrows made up of composite materials are the most popular tournament arrows at Olympic Events, especially the [[Easton (company)|Easton]] X10 and A/C/E.

The arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, stone, or other hard materials. The most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.

[[Image:Spliced feather 0002.jpg|thumb|Shield cut straight fletching – here the hen [[feather]]s are barred red]]
[[Fletching]] is traditionally made from bird feathers. Also solid plastic '''vanes''' and thin sheetlike spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. Three fletches is the most common configuration in all cultures, though as many as six have been used. Two will result in unstable arrow flight. When ''three-fletched'' the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string (though with modern equipment, variations are seen especially when using the modern spin vanes).  This fletch is called the "index fletch" or "cock feather" (also known as "the odd vane out" or "the nocking vane") and the others are sometimes called the "hen feathers".  Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision.  When ''four-fletched'', often two opposing fletches are cock feathers and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.

The fletching may be either ''parabolic'' (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or ''shield'' (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield) cut and is often attached at an angle, known as ''helical'' fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight.  Whether helicial or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) are used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird.  Oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called ''[[flu-flu arrow|flu-flus]]''. Misplacement of fletchings can often change the arrow's flight path dramatically.

===Bow string===
{{main|Bow string}}
[[Dacron]] and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows. Linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows. Almost any fiber can be made into a bow string. The author of "Arab Archery" suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.<ref name="arabarchery">{{citation

[[Image:Finger-tab hg.jpg|A right-hand finger tab to protect the hand while the string is drawn.|thumb]]
Most archers wear a [[bracer (archery)|bracer]] (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bow string. The bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term "brassard", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge.

Some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow. Possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time.

Target Archery 1952 pages 345–349</ref>

===Release aids===
{{main|Release Aid (Archery)}}

A release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow. In the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist.  In another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.

==Shooting technique and form==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Mediaeval archery reenactment.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval archery [[reenactment]]]]

The standard convention on teaching archery, is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance (though in modern [[Kyudo]] all archers are trained to hold the bow in the right hand). Therefore, if you were right eye dominant, you would hold the bow in the left hand, and draw the string with the right hand. Not everybody agrees with this line of thought, though. A smoother, and more fluid release of the string produces the finest and most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore determines the accuracy of the arrow flight. There are some who believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity, should be the hand that draws and releases the string. Either eye can be used for aiming, and even the less dominant eye can be trained over time to effectively become the more dominant. This can be achieved by retraining with the use of an eye-patch over the dominant eye as a temporary measure.

The hand that holds the bow is referred to as the '''bow hand''' and its arm the '''bow arm'''. The opposite hand is called the '''drawing hand''' or '''string hand'''. Terms such as '''bow shoulder''' or '''string elbow''' follow the same convention. 

If shooting according to eye dominance, then right-eye-dominant archers, shooting in a conventional way, will hold the bow with their left hand.

If shooting according to hand dexterity, then the string will be drawn with whichever hand possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.

===Modern form===

To shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance. The body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart. As an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the  "open stance"  or the "closed stance" may be used, although many choose to stick with a "neutral stance". Each archer will have a particular preference but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line will be a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.

To load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf. The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the '''nock''' (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow). This step is called "nocking the arrow". Typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the "cock feather", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.

A compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.

The bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release. Most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique.  ''Instinctive'' shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves). In either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in either the first or second joint of the fingers.

Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the "thumb release", style. This involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support. To release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb. When using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e. Left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.

The bow is then raised and drawn, with varying alignments used for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions. This is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows which tends to vary from archer to archer, although for a compound shooter, there is often a slightly-jerky movement occurring during the drawback of the arrow at around midpoint where the draw weight is at its maximum, before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position. The string hand is drawn towards the face, where it should rest lightly at the chosen fixed ''anchor point''. This point is consistent from shot to shot and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending upon one's preferred shooting style. The bow arm is held outwards toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground as exemplified by the Korean archer [[Jang Yong-Ho]]. This keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring. 

In modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a "T". The archer's lower [[trapezius muscle]]s are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point. Some modern bows will be equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length.  In contrast, traditional English Longbow shooters step "into the bow", exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100&nbsp;lbs to over 175&nbsp;lbs.  Heavily-stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight in or around mid-draw, dropping holding weight significantly at full draw.  Compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy. 

The arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see [[Bow draw]]), or triggering the mechanical release aid. Usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions. An archer should also pay attention to the recoil or ''follow through'' of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.

==Aiming methods==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Kyujutsu14.jpg|thumb|From ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'', 1817]]
There are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow. 

Mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming. They can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification. They usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string which aids in a consistent anchor point. Modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length which gives a consistent arrow velocity while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length. Mechanical methods to make a traditional bow's draw length consistent are sometimes used. Barebow archers often use a sight picture which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer. With a fixed "anchor point" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position will fall on the same [[Predicted impact point|point]]. This allows the archer to adjust aim with successive shots in order to achieve accuracy. Modern archery equipment usually includes [[Sight (device)|sights]]. Instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows.  The two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under.  Split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below.  Three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow.  This technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called "gun barreling" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).

When using short bows, or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture. The archer may look at the target but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view. Aiming then involves hand/eye coordination which includes proprioception and motor/muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball. With sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.<ref name="lehman">{{citation

When a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the [[kinetic energy]] imparted by the thrower's muscles performing [[Work (physics)|work]].  However, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather [[Power (physics)|power]], which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available.  Power generated by muscles, however, is limited by [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|force–velocity relationship]], and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work done by the muscle will be less than half of what could be done if the muscle were contracting over the same distance at very slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force–velocity relationship.

When a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done.  This work is stored in the bow as [[elastic potential energy]], and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance.  This same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance.  In archery, some energy is dissipated through [[Hysteresis#Elastic hysteresis|elastic hysteresis]], reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot. Of the energy remaining, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring.  Depending on the elasticity of the arrow, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side. This is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers. Even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect will usually be experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism.  This results in an in-flight oscillation of the arrow in which its center flexes out to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds; this can be clearly seen in high-speed photography of an arrow at discharge. A direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when [[dry firing]]. Dry firing refers to releasing the bow string without a nocked arrow. Because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, all the energy stays in the bow. It has been suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow such as cracks and fractures, and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be attempted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/75758007/The-Physics-of-Archery-AstraZeneca-Science-Teaching-Trust |title=The Physics of Archery AstraZeneca Science Teaching Trust |publisher=Docstoc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref>

Modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the [[archer's paradox]]. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.

The accurate flight of an arrow is dependent on its fletching.  The arrow's manufacturer (a "fletcher") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis.  This improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to "plane" on the air in a random direction after shooting. Even though the arrow be made with extreme care, the slightest imperfection, or air movement, will cause some unbalanced turbulence in air flow. Consequently, rotation creates an equalling of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e. accuracy. This rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet. If the fletching is not arranged to induce rotation, it will still improve accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts away from its intended direction of travel.

The innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow. The huge ratio of length vs cross sectional area coupled with velocity made the arrow orders of magnitude more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented. Arrows may be designed to spread or concentrate force, depending on their applications.  Practice arrows, for instance, can use a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration.  Arrows designed to pierce armor in the Middle Ages would use a very narrow and sharp tip ("bodkinhead") to concentrate the force.  Arrows used for hunting would use a narrow tip ("broadhead") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.

==Hunting==
{{main|Bow hunting}}
[[File:Bow compound.JPG|thumb|A modern hunting bow]]
Using archery to take game animals is known as "'''bow hunting'''". Bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as the distances between the hunter and the game are much shorter in order to ensure a humane kill. The skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand. In many countries, including much of the United States, bow hunting for large and small game is legal. Bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle. Usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting and may feature fiber optic sights and other enhancements. Using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as "'''[[bow fishing]]'''".

==Modern competitive archery==
{{main|Modern competitive archery}}

Competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called [[target archery]]. A form particularly popular in Europe and [[Americas|America]] is [[field archery]], shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. Para-Archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability. It is governed by the [[World Archery Federation]] (WA), and is one of the sports in the Summer [[Paralympic Games]]. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as [[archery games|archery novelty games]] and [[Modern_competitive_archery#Flight_archery|flight archery]], where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.
