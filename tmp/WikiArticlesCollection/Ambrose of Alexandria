'''Ambrose of Alexandria''' (before 212 – c. 250) was a friend of the [[Christian]] [[theologian]] [[Origen]]. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]] in 212.  At first a [[gnostic]] [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]] and [[Marcionism|Marcionist]], Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion,<ref>[[Origen]], ''Epistle to Sextus Julius Africanus'' vol. i. p. 29</ref> and was ordained [[deacon]].<ref>[[Jerome's De Viris Illustribus]] # 61.</ref><ref>[[Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' vii. 18</ref> He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries ({{lang|grc|ἐργοδιώκτης}}) on the books of the [[Bible]], and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier,<ref name="DGRBM"/> he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.<ref>S. Epiph. ''adv. Haer.'' 64. [44] § 3</ref>

He suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 235.<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]],  ''Church History'', 6.18.</ref> He was later released and died a [[confessor]].<ref name="patrick">{{cite web | last =Rabenstein | first =Katherine | title =Ambrose of Alexandria (AC) | work =Saints O' the Day for March 17 | date =March 1998 | url =http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0317.shtml | accessdate =2007-04-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206151558/http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0317.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-06}}</ref> The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's ''[[Contra Celsum]],'' which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.

Origen often speaks of Ambrose in affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his ''On Martyrdom'', ''Contra Celsum'', ''Commentary on St. John's Gospel'', and ''On Prayer''.<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Christie | first = Albany James | authorlink = Albany James Christie | title = Ambrosius Alexandrinus | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0148.html}}</ref> Ambrose's letters to Origen (praised by [[Jerome]]) are lost, although part of one exists.<ref>Routh, ''Reliquiae Sacr.'' ii. p. 367</ref>
