'''Aeronautics''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] words ὰήρ ''āēr'', which means "air", and ναυτική ''nautikē'' which means "navigation", i.e. "navigation of the air") is the science involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air[[flight]]-capable machines, or the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rocketry within the atmosphere. While the term—literally meaning "sailing the air"—originally referred solely to the science of ''operating'' the aircraft,it has since been expanded to include technology, business and other aspects related to aircraft.<ref name="americana">{{cite encyclopedia

One of the significant parts in aeronautics is a branch of [[physical science]] called [[aerodynamics]], which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft. The term "[[aviation]]" is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes lighter-than-air craft such as [[airship]]s, and includes ballistic vehicles while "aviation" does not.<ref name="americana"/>

==Early aeronautics==
[[File:Flying boat.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Francesco Lana de Terzi]]'s flying boat concept c.1670.]]

The first mention of aeronautics in history came in the writings of ancient Egyptians who described the flight of birds. Aeronautics also finds mention in ancient China where people flew kites thousands of years ago. The medieval Islamic scientists were not far behind, as they understood the actual mechanism of bird flight. Before scientific investigation of aeronautics started, people started thinking of ways to fly. In a Greek legend, [[Icarus]] and his father [[Daedalus]] built wings of feathers and wax and flew out of prison. (Icarus flew too close to the sun, the wax melted, and he fell into the sea and drowned.) When people started to study scientifically how to fly, people began to understand the basics of air and aerodynamics. [[Ibn Firnas]] may have tried to fly in the 8th century in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]].<ref name=Aramco>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196401/first.flights.htm First Flights], ''[[Saudi Aramco World]]'', January–February 1964, p. 8-9.</ref>

Other early Europeans to study aeronautics included [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Leonardo studied the flight of birds in developing engineering schematics for some of the earliest flying machines in the late fifteenth century. His schematics, however, such as that for the [[ornithopter]], ultimately failed as practical aircraft. The flapping machines that he designed were either too small to generate sufficient lift, or too heavy for a human being to operate.

Although hobbyists continue to show interest in the ornithopter, aeronautics research in the 19th century came to focus on the glider. [[Sir George Cayley]] (1773-1857) became "one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight."<ref>

[[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] (1631-1687), a [[Jesuit]] professor of physics and mathematics from [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]], has been referred to as the Father of Aeronautics.<ref>

Many cultures have built devices that travel through the air, from the earliest projectiles such as stones and spears,<ref>[http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/1/14.html Archytas of Tar entum, Technology Museum of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Greece]</ref><ref>[http://automata.co.uk/History%20page.htm Automata history]</ref> the [[boomerang]] in [[Australia]], the hot air [[Kongming lantern]], and [[kite]]s. There are early legends of human flight such as the story of [[Icarus]], and [[Jamshid]] in Persian myth, and later, somewhat more credible claims of short-distance human flights appear, such as the flying automaton of [[Archytas]] of [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (428–347 BC),<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&pg=PA128&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Aviation: Reaching for the Sky]''".

The modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighter-than-air flight on November 21, 1783, in a [[hot air balloon]] designed by the [[Montgolfier brothers]].  The practicality of balloons was limited because they could only be controlled vertically. It was immediately recognized that a steerable, or [[Airship|dirigible]], balloon was required. [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] flew the first human-powered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785.

In 1799 [[Sir George Cayley]] set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.<ref name="britannica" /><ref>{{cite web

==Early aviation==
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|left|First assisted take-off flight by the [[Wright Brothers]], December 17, 1903]]

While there are [[Early flying machines|many competing claims]] for the earliest powered, heavier-than-air flight, the most widely accepted date is December 17, 1903 by the Wright brothers. The Wright brothers were the first to fly in a powered and controlled aircraft. Previous flights were gliders (control but no power) or free flight (power but no control), but the Wright brothers combined both, setting the new standard in aviation records. Following this, the widespread adoption of [[aileron]]s versus wing warping made aircraft much easier to control, and only eleven years later, at the start of [[World War I]], heavier-than-air powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, even attacks against ground positions and [[Dogfight|attacking other aircraft]].

Aircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable. In contrast to small non-rigid [[Non-rigid airship|blimps]], giant [[rigid airship]]s became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German [[Zeppelin]] company.
[[File:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumb|''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' at [[Lakehurst Naval Air Station]], 1936]]

The most successful Zeppelin was the [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]. It flew over one million miles, including an around-the-world flight in August 1929. However, the dominance of the Zeppelins over the aeroplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as aeroplane design advanced. The "Golden Age" of the airships ended on May 6, 1937 when the [[Hindenburg (airship)|Hindenburg]] caught fire, killing 36 people. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.

Great progress was made in the field of aviation during the 1920s and 1930s, such as [[Charles Lindbergh|Charles Lindbergh's]] solo transatlantic flight in 1927, and [[Charles Kingsford Smith]]'s transpacific flight the following year. One of the most successful designs of this period was the [[Douglas DC-3]], which became the first [[airliner]] that was profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of [[World War II]], many towns and cities had built space, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. The war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first [[turbojet|jet]] aircraft and the first liquid-fueled [[rocket]]s.

==Modern aviation==
[[File:Helios cthomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]]'s [[Helios Prototype|Helios]] researches [[solar power]]ed flight.]]
After [[World War II]], especially in [[North America]], there was a boom in [[general aviation]], both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as [[Cessna]], [[The New Piper Aircraft|Piper]], and [[Beechcraft]] expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.

By the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the [[de Havilland Comet]], though the first widely used passenger jet was the [[Boeing 707]], because it was much more economical than other planes at the time. At the same time, [[gas turbine|turboprop]] propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.

Since the 1960s, [[composite material|composite]] airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and [[Concorde]] provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of [[transistor|solid-state]] electronics, the [[Global Positioning System]], [[communications satellite|satellite communications]], and increasingly small and powerful [[computer]]s and [[light-emitting diode|LED]] displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of [[airliner]]s and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through [[synthetic vision]], even at night or in low visibility.

On June 21, 2004, [[Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne|Space Ship One]] became the first privately funded aircraft to make a [[spaceflight]], opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earth's atmosphere.  Meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as [[ethanol]], [[electricity]], and even [[solar energy]], are becoming more common and may soon enter the mainstream, at least for light aircraft.

== Rocketry ==

[[File:Apollo 15 launch.ogg|thumb|right|Launch of ''[[Apollo 15]]'' [[Saturn V]] rocket: ''T'' - 30 s through ''T'' + 40 s.]]

A [[rocket]] or rocket vehicle is a [[missile]], spacecraft, [[aircraft]] or other [[vehicle]] which obtains [[thrust]] from a [[rocket engine]]. In all rockets, the exhaust is formed entirely from [[propellant]]s carried within the rocket before use.<ref name="RPE7">{{cite book | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7|chapter=1}}</ref> Rocket engines work by [[Reaction (physics)|action and reaction]]. Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century [[China]].<ref name="NASA EARLY">{{harvnb|MSFC History Office}} "Rockets in Ancient Times (100 B.C. to 17th Century)"</ref> Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology of the [[Space Age]], including [[Apollo 11|setting foot on the moon]].

Rockets are used for [[fireworks]], weaponry, [[ejection seat]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s for [[artificial satellite]]s, [[human spaceflight]] and [[Space exploration|exploration]] of other planets. While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, they are very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining [[escape velocity|extremely high speeds]] with reasonable efficiency.

[[Chemical rocket]]s are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of [[rocket propellant]]. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.
