An '''amateur''' ([[French language|French]] ''amateur'' "lover of", from Old French and ultimately from Latin amatorem nom. amator, "lover") is generally considered a person attached to a particular pursuit, study, or science in a non-[[professional]] or unpaid manner. Amateurs often have little or no formal training in their pursuits, and many are [[Autodidacticism|autodidacts]] (self-taught).

Amateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often do not have formal training, some amateur work may be considered sub-par. For example, [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]] in sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]] or [[Football games|football]] are regarded as having a lower level of ability than professional athletes. On the other hand, an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.  An amateur who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest, or who possesses a general but superficial interest in any art or a branch of knowledge, is often referred to as a [[dilettante]].

The lack of financial benefit can also be seen as a sign of [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to an activity; and until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs. Receiving payment to participate in an event disqualified an athlete from that event, as in the case of [[Jim Thorpe]]. The only Olympic events that still require participants to be amateurs are [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]], but amateurism in these cases are defined in terms of fight rules rather than whether the athlete receives any money for his sport.

Many amateurs make valuable contributions in the field of [[computer programming]] through the [[open source]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Amateur dramatics]] is the performance of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] or [[musical theater]], often to high standards, but lacking the budgets of professional [[West End theatre|West End]] or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances. [[Astronomy]], history, linguistics, and the natural sciences are among the myriad fields that have benefited from the activities of amateurs. [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]] were amateur scientists who never held a position in their field of study. [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were considered amateur artists and autodidacts in their fields of study. Radio astronomy was founded by [[Grote Reber]], an [[amateur radio operator]]; radio itself was greatly advanced if not founded by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], a young Italian gentleman who started out by tinkering with a coherer and a spark coil as an amateur electrician. [[Pierre de Fermat]] was a highly influential mathematician whose primary vocation was law. During her lifetime, [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]] was considered an amateur pianist and composer.
