The [[Military of Afghanistan|Afghan army]] began their conquests by capturing Ghazni and Kabul from the local rulers. In 1749 the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ruler ceded sovereignty over what is now Pakistan and northwestern India to the Afghans. Ahmad Shah then set out westward to take possession of [[Herat]], which was ruled by [[Shahrukh Afshar]]. He next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the [[Hindu Kush]] and in short order all the different tribes began joining his cause. Ahmad Shah and his forces invaded India four times, taking control of the Kashmir and the [[Punjab region]].

==Reign of Ahmad Shah Durrani (1747–1772)==
In 1709 [[Mir Wais Hotak]], chief of the [[Ghilzai]] tribe of [[Kandahar Province]], gained independence from the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] Persians. From 1722 to 1725, his son [[Mahmud Hotaki|Mahmud]] ruled [[Iran]] and declared himself as ''Shah of Persia''. However, the [[Hotaki dynasty]] came to a complete end in 1738 after being toppled by the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharids]] who were led by [[Nader Shah]] of [[Persia]].

The year 1747 marks the definitive appearance of an Afghan political entity independent of both the Persian and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iranicaonline.org/articles/afghanistan-x-political-history |title=Afghanistan x. Political History |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |author=D. Balland |date=December 15, 1983|accessdate=2012-08-08}}</ref> In October 1747 a [[loya jirga]] (grand council) concluded near the city of Kandahar with [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] being selected as the new leader of the Afghans, thus the Durrani dynasty was founded. Despite being younger than the other contenders, Ahmad Shah had several overriding factors in his favor. He belonged to a respectable family of political background, especially since his father served as [[list of governors of Herat|Governor of Herat]] who died in a battle defending the Afghans. He also had a well-trained larger army and possessed a substantial part of Nadir Shah's treasury, including the world's largest [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond.<ref name="EB"/>

===Early victories===
One of Ahmad Shah's first military action was the capture [[Ghazni]] from the Ghilzais, and then wresting Kabul from the local ruler. In 1749, the Mughal ruler was induced to cede [[Sindh Province|Sindh]], the [[Punjab region]] and the important trans [[Indus River]] to Ahmad Shah in order to save his capital from Afghan attack. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Ahmad Shah turned westward to take possession of [[Herat Province|Herat]], which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, [[Shah Rukh of Persia]]. Ahmad Shah next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], and other tribes of northern Afghanistan. Ahmad Shah invaded the remnants of the Mughal Empire a third time, and then a fourth, consolidating control over the Kashmir and Punjab regions, with [[Lahore]] being governed by Afghans. He sacked Delhi in 1757, but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]] to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left India to return to Afghanistan.

===Relations with China===
Alarmed by the expansion of China's [[Qing Dynasty]] up to the western border of Kazakhstan, Ahmad Shah attempted to rally neighboring Muslim khanates and the Kazakhs to unite and attack China, ostensibly to liberate its western Muslim subjects.<ref>{{cite book|title= Holy war in China: the Muslim rebellion and state in Chinese Central Asia, 1864-1877 |last1=Kim |first1=Ho-dong |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press |location=|isbn=978-0-8047-4884-1 |page=20|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC|accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> Ahmad Shah halted trade with Qing China and dispatched troops to [[Kokand]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Empire and the Khanate: a political history of Qing relations with Khoqand c. 1760-1860 |last1=Newby |first1=Laura J. |authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2005|publisher=BRILL |location=|isbn=978-90-04-14550-4 |page=34|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C|accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> However, with his campaigns in India exhausting the state treasury, and with his troops stretched thin throughout Central Asia, Ahmad Shah lacked sufficient resources to do anything except to send envoys to [[Beijing]] for unsuccessful talks.

===Third Battle of Panipat===
{{Main|Third Battle of Panipat}}
The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of [[Aurangzeb]], who died in 1707; In 1751-52, ''Ahamdiya'' treaty was signed between the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]] and [[Mughals]], when [[Balaji Bajirao]] was the [[Peshwa]].<ref name="Panipat">Patil, Vishwas. ''Panipat''.</ref> Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at [[Pune]] and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent [[Raghunathrao]]. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule.<ref name=K.RoyIHB>{{cite book | last=Roy |first=Kaushik |title=India's Historic Battles: From Alexander the Great to Kargil |publisher=Permanent Black, India |pages=80–1 |isbn=978-81-7824-109-8}}</ref> Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy.

Ahmad Shah declared a [[jihad]] (or [[Islam]]ic holy war) against the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], and warriors from various Pashtun tribes, as well as other tribes such as the [[Baloch people|Baloch]], [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], and Nawabs in India, answered his call. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, [[Panipat]] was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of [[northern India]]. The Third Battle of Panipat (January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely [[Hinduism|Hindu]] armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges. As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat. This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising [[Sikh]] [[misls]]. There were rebellions in the north in the region of [[Bukhara]].

===Decline===
The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's—and Afghan—power. His Durrani empire was the second largest Islamic empire in the world, behind the [[Ottoman Empire]] at that time.<ref>"[http://www.bijanomrani.com/?p=afgan_search_unit Afghanistan and the Search for Unity]" Omrani, Bijan, published in ''Asian Affairs'', Volume 38, Issue 2, 2007, pp. 145–157.</ref> However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]]. He assaulted Lahore and, after taking their holy city of [[Amritsar]], massacred thousands of [[Sikh]] inhabitants, destroying their revered [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]].<ref>Purnima Dhavan, ''When Sparrows Became Hawks:The Making of the Sikh Warrior Tradition, 1699'', (Oxford University Press, 2011), 112.</ref> Within two years, the Sikhs rebelled again and rebuilt their holy city of Amritsar. Ahmad Shah tried several more times to subjugate the Sikhs permanently, but failed. Ahmad Shah also faced other rebellions in the north, and eventually he and the Uzbek Emir of [[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]] agreed that the Amu Darya would mark the division of their lands. A decade after the [[third Battle of Panipat]], [[Marathas]] under the leadership of [[Mahadji Scindia]] entered and recaptured [[Delhi]] in 1771, cutting off [[Rohillas]] from the [[Durranis]] forever. Ahmad Shah retired to his home in the mountains east of Kandahar, where he died on April 14, 1773.<ref>{{cite book|title=Inside Afghanistan: end of the Taliban era? |last1=Reddy |first1=L.

He earned recognition as Ahmad Shah Baba, or "Father" of Afghanistan.<ref name="Singh"/><ref name="LoC"/>

==Other Durrani rulers (1772–1826)==
{{History of Afghanistan}}
[[Ahmed Shah Abdali|Ahmad Shah]]'s successors governed so ineptly during a period of profound unrest that within fifty years of his death, the Durrani empire ''per se'' was at an end, and Afghanistan was embroiled in civil war. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century. By 1818, the [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than Kabul and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.

===Timur Shah (1772–1793)===
{{main|Timur Shah Durrani}}

Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who had been deputed to administer his fathers conquests in northern India, but had been driven out by the Marathas. Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession. Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to insurgency. Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories. Timur died in 1793, and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah

===Zaman Shah (1793–1801)===
{{Main|Zaman Shah Durrani}}

After the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. [[Zaman Shah]], governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that threw Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the intervention of outside forces.

The efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The [[Sikhs]] became particularly troublesome, and after several unsuccessful efforts to subdue them, Zaman Shah made the mistake of appointing a forceful young Sikh chief, [[Ranjit Singh]], as his governor in the Punjab. This "one-eyed" warrior would later become an implacable enemy of Pashtun rulers in Afghanistan.

Zaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the [[Nurzai]] and the [[Alizai tribe|Alizai]] Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the [[Qizilbash]] clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.

===Mahmud Shah (first reign, 1801–1803)===
{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}
Zeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shuja Shah]].

===Shuja Shah (1803–1809 and 1839–1842)===
{{Main|Shuja Shah Durrani}}
Yet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the [[British East India Company|British]], which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a [[Europe]]an power, stipulated joint action in case of [[France|Franco]]-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839–1842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.

===Mahmud Shah (second reign, 1809–1818)===
{{main|Mahmud Shah Durrani}}

Mahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, [[Dost Mohammad Khan]].

===Sultan Ali Shah (1818–1819)===
{{Main|Ali Shah Durrani}}
Ali Shah was another son of [[Timur Shah Durrani|Timur Shah]]. He seized power for a brief period in 1818-19.

===Ayub Shah (1819–1823)===
{{Main|Ayub Shah Durrani}}
[[File:The main street in the bazaar at Caubul.jpg|thumb|The main street in the bazaar at Caubul]]
Ayub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself later deposed, and presumably killed in 1823. The loss of Kashmir during his reign opened a new chapter in South Asian history.
