'''Cyril of Alexandria''' ({{lang-el|Κύριλλος Ἀλεξανδρείας}}; c. 376 – 444) was the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] from 412 to 444. He was enthroned when the city was at the height of its influence and power within the [[Roman Empire]]. Cyril wrote extensively and was a leading protagonist in the [[Christological controversies]] of the later 4th and 5th centuries. He was a central figure in the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431, which led to the deposition of [[Nestorius]] as [[Patriarch of Constantinople]].

Cyril is counted among the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[Doctors of the Church]], and his reputation within the Christian world has resulted in his titles ''Pillar of Faith'' and ''Seal of all the Fathers'', but [[Theodosius II]], the [[Roman Emperor]], condemned him for behaving like a "proud pharaoh", and the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] bishops at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] declared him a heretic, labelling him as a "monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church."<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47</ref>

Cyril is well-known due to his dispute with Nestorius and his supporter Patriarch [[John of Antioch]], whom Cyril excluded from the Council of Ephesus for arriving late. He is also known for his involvement in the expulsion of [[Novatianism|Novatians]] and Jews from Alexandria and the murder of the [[hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosopher]] [[Hypatia]] by Coptic monks. Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility for these events.

The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the [[Tridentine Calendar]]: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February. The 1969 revision moved it to 27 June, considered to be the day of the saint's death, as celebrated by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]].<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice, 1969), pp. 95 and 116</ref> The same date has been chosen for the Lutheran calendar. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Church]] celebrate his feast day on 9 June and also, together with [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria]], on 18 January.

==Early life==

{{refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
Little is known for certain of Cyril's early life.  He was born c. 376, in the small town of Theodosios, Egypt, near modern day [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]]. A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle [[Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] rose to the powerful position of [[Patriarch of Alexandria]].<ref name=dictionary>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-280058-2|pages=125|edition=4. ed.}}</ref>  His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated. His education showed through his knowledge, in his writings of Christian writers of his day, including [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Origen]], [[Didymus the Blind]], and writers of the [[Church of Alexandria]]. He received the formal Christian education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390-392), rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393-397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398-402). He did not study in the [[Hellenistic]] tradition of 'mathematics, philosophy and astronomy', unlike contemporaries such as [[Hypatia]], and he and his supporters would later come into conflict with followers of that broader learning rooted in the city's founding under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].

===Patriarch of Alexandria===

Theophilus died on 15 October 412, and Cyril was made [[Pope (word)|Pope]] or [[Patriarch of Alexandria]] on 18 October 412, against the party favouring [[Archdeacon]] Timothy.

====Persecution of the Novatians and stopping Persecution of Christians by Jews====
Thus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jews|Jewish]], and Christian inhabitants.<ref name="library">Preston Chesser, {{cite web | title=The Burning of the Library of Alexandria | url=http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/articleview.cfm?aid=9}}, eHistory.com</ref>

He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the [[Novatians]] to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized.

[[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]], ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], steadfastly resisted Cyril's agenda of ecclesiastical encroachment onto secular prerogatives.<ref>Wessel, p. 34.</ref> On one occasion, Cyril sent the ''grammaticus'' Hierax to secretly discover the content of an edict that Orestes was to promulgate on the mimes shows, which attracted great crowds. When the Jews, with whom Cyril had clashed before {{fact|date=September 2013}}, discovered the presence of Hierax, they rioted, complaining that Hierax's presence was aimed at provoking them.<ref>John of Nikiu, 84.92.</ref> Then Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre. This order had two aims: the first was to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril.<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13.6-9. Wessel, p. 34</ref>

According to Christian sources, the Jews of Alexandria schemed against the Christians and killed many of them {{fact|date=September 2013}}.  There is no evidence of these charges, {{fact|date=September 2013}} but they were used nonetheless to justify attacks on the Jews. Cyril reacted and expelled either all of the Jews, or else only the murderers, from Alexandria, actually exerting a power that belonged to the civil officer, Orestes.<ref>Socrates Scholasticus, vii.13 (who says that the whole Alexandrian Jewish community was expelled); John of Nikiu, 84.95-98 (who says that only the murderers were expelled). Welles, p. 35.</ref> Orestes was powerless, but nonetheless rejected Cyril's gesture of offering him a Bible, which would mean that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy.<ref name="wessel35">Wessel, p. 35.</ref>

This refusal almost cost Orestes his life. [[Wadi El Natrun|Nitrian monks]] came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks' violence had already been used, 15 years before, by Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) against the "[[Tall Brothers]]"; furthermore, it is said that Cyril had spent five years among them in ascetic training. The monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople. However, the monks were not satisfied, and one of them, [[Ammonius (monk)|Ammonius]], threw a stone and hit Orestes in the head, and so much blood flowed out that he was covered in it. Orestes' guard, fearing to be stoned by the monks, fled leaving Orestes alone. The people of Alexandria, however, came to his help, captured Ammonius and put the monks to flight. Orestes was cured and put Ammonius under torture in a public place, killing him. The prefect then wrote to the emperor [[Theodosius II]], telling him of the events. Cyril also wrote to the Emperor, telling his version of the events. The bishop also seized the body of Ammonius and put it in a church, conferring upon him the title of ''Thaumasius'' and putting his name in the list of the martyrs. However, the Christian population of Alexandria knew that Ammonius had been killed for his assault and not for his faith, and Cyril was obliged to remain silent about the events.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}<ref name="ss7_14">Socrates Scholasticus, vii.14.</ref><ref>Wessel, p. 35-36.</ref>

====Murder of Hypatia====

[[File:Hypatia Raphael Sanzio detail.jpg|thumb|The Alexandrian philosopher [[Hypatia]] (detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', by [[Raphael]], Apostolic Palace, Rome, 1509-1510). Some Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes, the ''[[Praefectus augustalis]]'' of the [[Byzantine Diocese of Egypt|Diocese of Egypt]], to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. A group of Cyril's supporters killed her in the streets.]] 
Prefect [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] enjoyed the political backing of [[Hypatia]], an astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who had considerable [[moral authority]] in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. Indeed many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all reconciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the Pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, to handle better the difficult political life of the Egyptian capital.<ref>Christopher Haas, ''Alexandria in Late Antiquity: Topography and Social Conflict'', JHU Press, 2006, ISBN 0-8018-8541-8, p. 312.</ref> A Christian mob, however, possibly led by [[parabalani]], took Hypatia from her chariot and brutally murdered her, hacking her body apart and burning the pieces outside the city walls.<ref name="ss7_15">Socrate Scolastico, vii.15.</ref><ref>Giovanni di Nikiu, 84.88-100.</ref>

Modern studies represent Hypatia's death as the result of a struggle between two Christian factions, the moderate Orestes, supported by Hypatia, and the more rigid Cyril.<ref>Maria Dzielska, ''Hypatia of Alexandria'', Cambridge (Mass.): Harvard University Press, 1995. (Revealing Antiquity, 8), p. xi, 157. ISBN 0-674-43775-6</ref> According to lexicographer [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], "She was accused of too much familiarity with Orestes, prefect of Alexandria, and the charge spread among the clergy, who took up the notion that she interrupted the friendship of Orestes with their archbishop, Cyril."<ref>http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1645.html</ref>

====Conflict with Nestorius====

Another major conflict was between the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] and [[Antiochian school|Antiochian]] schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse. This long running conflict widened with the [[First Council of Constantinople#Dispute concerning the third canon|third canon of the First Council of Constantinople]] which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch. Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople. The conflict came to a head in 428 after [[Nestorius]], who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople.<ref>Leo Donald Davis, ''The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology'', Collegeville (Min.): The Liturgical Press, 1983, p. 136-148. ISBN 0-8146-5616-1</ref>

{{POV-section|date=September 2013}}
Cyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] the "Mother of God". As the term "Mother of God" had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest. Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf. Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a "Mother of Man" nor "[[Theotokos|Mother of God]]" as these referred to [[Christology#Person of Christ|Christ's two natures]]; rather, Mary was the "Mother of Christ". Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his "temple" (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature). The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ. Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered "in the flesh."<ref>Thomas Gerard Weinandy, Daniel A. Keating, ''The theology of St. Cyril of Alexandria: a critical appreciation''; New York (NY); T&T Clark LTD, 2003, p. 49</ref> However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh.<ref>Nestorius, Second Epistle to Cyril http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/34-patrtexts/189-nestorius-to-cyril2</ref> Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of [[adoptionism]]. By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria. At Easter 429 A.D., Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius' views. A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it. This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone. Finally, Emperor [[Theodosius II]] convoked the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (in 431) to solve the dispute. Cyril selected Ephesus{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary. The council was convoked before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned. Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy. 

However, when [[John of Antioch]] and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a ''monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church''.<ref name="ReferenceA">Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 47</ref> Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped. Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius' courtiers, and sent a mob led by [[Dalmatius of Constantinople|Dalmatius]], a [[hermit]], to besiege Theodosius' palace, and shout abuse; the Emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt).<ref name="ReferenceA" /> 
Cyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the [[Second Council of Ephesus|"Robber Synod" of Ephesus]] (449) to the [[Fourth Ecumenical Council|Council of Chalcedon]] (451) and beyond.

==Theology==
Cyril regarded the embodiment of [[God]] in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the [[God-man (mystic)|God-man]] into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]] to believers. [[Nestorius]], on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was [[Theotokos]]  (God Bearer)), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity. Nestorius spoke of the distinct 'Jesus the man' and 'the divine [[Logos]]' in ways that Cyril thought were too [[dichotomous]], widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ.

The main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril posited that the composition of the Trinity consisted of one divine essence (ousia) in three distinct modes of being (hypostases.) These distinct modes of being were the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Then, when the Son became flesh and entered into the world, these two divine and human natures both remained but became ''united'' in the person of Jesus. This resulted in the slogan "One Nature united out of two" being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop.  
 
According to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son: the state that existed ''prior'' to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed. Thus, only the Logos incarnate suffered and died on the Cross and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering. Cyril's concern was that there needed to be continuity of the divine subject between the Logos and the incarnate Word—and so in Jesus Christ the divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world.

===Mariology===
Cyril of Alexandria became noted in [[Church history]] because of his spirited fight for the title "[[Theotokos]]<ref>http://independent.academia.edu/EIRINIARTEMINationalandCapodistrianUniversityofAthens/Papers/1721697/The_rejection_of_the_term_Theotokos_by_Nestorius_Constantinople</ref>" during the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431).

His writings include the homily given in Ephesus  and several other sermons.<ref>PG 76,992 , ''Adv. Nolentes confiteri Sanctam Virginem esse Deiparem'', PG 76, 259</ref> Some of his alleged homilies are in dispute as to his authorship. In several writings, Cyril focuses on the love of Jesus to his mother. On the [[Cross]], he overcomes his pain and thinks of his mother. At the wedding in [[Cana]],  he bows to her wishes. Cyril is credited with {{by whom|date=November 2011}} creating a basis for all other [[mariology|mariological]] developments through his teaching of the blessed Virgin Mary, as the [[Mother of God]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
St. Cyril received an important recognition of his preachings by the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 d.C.) which declared;
:"St. Cyril who announced the right faith of Christians" (Anathematism XIV, Denzinger et Schoenmetzer 437).

==In modern culture==
Cyril plays a role in the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[novel]] ''[[Azazeel (2008 novel)|Azazel]]'' by the Egyptian scholar [[Youssef Ziedan]]. The novel, which won the 2009 [[International Prize for Arabic Fiction]] is set in 5th-century Egypt and Syria and deals with the early history of Christianity. The book depicts [[religious fanaticism]] and mob violence among early Christians in [[Roman Egypt]]. The narrator, Hypa, witnesses the lynching of Hypatia and finds himself involved in the schism of 431, when Cyril deposed Nestorius. Cyril is portrayed as a fanatic who kills Jews and others who have not converted to Christianity from the traditional religions of antiquity. This portrayal angered many of Egypt's Coptic Christians.<ref>Maya Jaggi, "Meeting the winner of the 'Arabic Booker'," ''The Guardian'' 26 March 2009 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/mar/26/arabic-fiction-prize-youssef-ziedan/print online], archived by [http://www.webcitation.org/5fajn08nO WebCite.]</ref>

Cyril has also been portrayed in [[Ki Longfellow]]'s ''Flow Down Like Silver, Hypatia of Alexandria''.<ref>http://independent.academia.edu/EIRINIARTEMINationalandCapodistrianUniversityofAthens/Papers/1216348/Cyril_Orestes_and_Hypatia</ref> Though Longfellow does not accuse Cyril of ordering the death of [[Hypatia]], her work does not shy away from speculating on his part in the murder.

In the [[2009 film]] ''[[Agora (film)|Agora]]'', Cyril is played by [[Sami Samir]] as an extremist who opposes Orestes's attempts to harmonize the different communities of Alexandria.

==Works==
Cyril was a scholarly archbishop and a prolific writer. In the early years of his active life in the Church he wrote several exegesis. Among these were: ''Commentaries on the [[Old Testament]]'',<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_luke_00_intro.htm Cyril of Alexandria, Commentary on Luke (1859) Preface. pp.i-xx]</ref> ''Thesaurus'', ''Discourse Against [[Arianism|Arians]]'' ''Commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]]'',<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/cyril_on_john_00_eintro.htm Cyril of Alexandria, Commentary on John, LFC 43, 48 (1874/1885). Preface to the online edition]</ref> and ''Dialogues on the [[Trinity]]''. In 429 as the Christological controversies increased, his output of writings was that which his opponents could not match. His writings and his theology have remained central to tradition of the Fathers and to all Orthodox to this day.
