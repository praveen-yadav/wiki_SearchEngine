'''''Beavis and Butt-head''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[teen animation]] series created and designed by [[Mike Judge]]. The series originated from "[[Frog Baseball]]", a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on [[Liquid Television]]. After seeing the short, [[MTV]] signed Judge to develop the concept.<ref>{{cite news|title= MTV Toon Dudes Are Slow on Two Counts Television |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]| date= 16 March 1993 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-16/entertainment/ca-664_1_animation-festival| accessdate= 2010-11-12| first= Daniel| last= Cerone}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Butt-head, We Hardly Knew Ye|last= Rosenberg|first= Howard|work= Los Angeles Times|date=1997-11-26|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/entertainment/ca-57733|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> The ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' television show first ran from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997. It was revived in 2011 and new episodes began airing on MTV from October 27, 2011 to December 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/07/29/mtv-presents-full-slate-at-their-summer-tca-presentation-new-beavis-and-butt-head-good-vibes-to-premiere-october-27/99241/ |title=MTV Presents Full Slate At Their Summer TCA Presentation; New ‘Beavis and Butt-Head’ & ‘Good Vibes’ to Premiere October 27 |publisher=Tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> The series has retained a [[cult following]]. Later, reruns aired on other [[Viacom]] properties, including [[MTV2]], [[Comedy Central]] and [[UPN]]. In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]].''

==Story format==
The show centers on two socially awkward, [[Heavy metal music|rock]]-loving teenage delinquents, [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] (both voiced by Judge), who live in the town of Highland. They have no apparent adult supervision at home, and in one episode ("Scientific Stuff") they say that they're not sure if they have the same father or not. They are dim-witted, under-educated, and barely literate, and both lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. Their most common shared activity is watching music videos, which they tend to judge by deeming them "cool," or by exclaiming, "This sucks!" They also apply these judgments to other things that they encounter, and will usually deem something "cool" if it is associated with violence, sex or the [[macabre]]. Despite having no experience with women, their other signature traits are a shared obsession with sex, and their tendency to chuckle and giggle whenever they hear words or phrases that can even remotely be construed as sexual or [[scatology|scatological]].

===Basic themes===
Each episode features a few interstitial scenes in which they view videos in this manner, their commentary improvised by Judge, with the rest of the episode depicting them embarking on some scheme or adventure.<ref>{{cite news|title= Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

In many episodes they skip school altogether. Their actions sometimes have extreme consequences, but often for others, for which they themselves show no remorse whatsoever.

==Characters==
{{Section OR|date=November 2011}}
===Main characters===
*{{anchor|Beavis}}'''[[Beavis]]''' (Mike Judge) - Beavis has an [[Prognathism|underbite]] and a fixed [[Wiktionary:countenance#English|countenance]], which is almost always shown in 3/4 view. Like Butt-head, Beavis compulsively laughs and grunts. He also has a habit of picking his nose. He is the more excitable of the two; despite his obliviousness to what should be obvious, he is prone to moments of insight. He is more polite and more optimistic than Butt-Head. He often suffers physically in the show, either at the hands of Butt-Head or various other characters or situations. He usually takes the beating and screams in pain before quickly reverting to his trademark laugh. Before controversy erupted (see below), he [[cigarette smoking|smoked]] and he exhibited [[pyromania|an obsession with fire]] and his trademark phrase was "FIRE! FIRE!" which he would utter with a maniacal gaze in his eye. One episode depicted him as having voices in his head, which told him to engage in destructive activities; however, generally he has a passive demeanor in contrast to Butt-Head's more dominant personality. Beavis also wears a blue [[Metallica]] shirt with gray shorts. (Beavis's shirt in trademark posters, T shirts and other merchandise reads "Death Rock.")  When Beavis consumes large amounts of [[caffeine]] or sugar, he transforms into his hyperactive [[alter-ego]], [[Cornholio]]. Beavis's laugh was based on a "straight A" classmate of creator Mike Judge who had a guttural laugh.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Taint of Greatness: The Story of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 1", in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 1</ref>

*{{anchor|Butt-head}}'''[[Butt-head]]''' (Mike Judge) - Butt-head has squinty eyes and a drooping nose with prominent nostrils. He has a prominent overbite, speaks nasally with a deep voice and wears braces, giving him a slight lisp. He begins almost every statement with "Uhhhhhh..." and ends with his short trademark laugh, "Uh huh huh huh". Calmer, though cockier, older and marginally more intelligent than Beavis, Butt-Head is oblivious to subtlety of any sort and is usually completely confident in everything he says and does, no matter how ridiculous or frivolous it is—unless it has to do with girls, in which case he either wavers or comes on too strongly. His trademark phrase when approaching women is "Hey baby." As the more dominant personality of the duo, he seems to derive pleasure from regularly abusing Beavis. Butt-Head rarely gets perceptibly angry about anything, his usual expression of dissatisfaction being a resigned "This sucks! huh huh huh."  He also frequently has to try to calm the more mercurial Beavis down, either telling him to "settle down, Beavis! huh huh huh," or in more drastic cases, slap him. Butt-Head also wears a gray [[AC/DC]] shirt with red shorts. (Butt-Head's shirt in other media reads "Skull.") Judge has stated he got the idea for the name "Butt-Head" from two people he knew during his childhood called "Iron Butt" (who encouraged people to kick him in the butt to demonstrate his strength) and "Head-Butt."<ref name="Interview">{{cite web| url=http://www.inthe80s.com/july1995/animate/beavis.html | title=Mike Judge Interviewed by John Kricfalusi | publisher =[[Wild Cartoon Kingdom]] | year=1994}}</ref>

*{{anchor|Tom Anderson}}'''Tom Anderson''' (Mike Judge) - The [[myopia|nearsighted]], elderly neighbor of Beavis and Butt-Head. He often hires them to do chores which involve both of them destroying his yard, home, or personal belongings. Due to his poor eyesight and mild [[senility]], he never seems to recognize either of them and he never seems to even remember their names. (In one episode the two wore [[horn rimmed glasses]] in an absurd disguise which Anderson did not notice.) He served in the Navy during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. His character is similar in look and voice to the [[Hank Hill]] character from Judge's subsequent series, ''[[King of the Hill]]'' since both were based on the same collection of elderly men from Judge's youth.

*{{anchor|David Van Driessen}}'''David Van Driessen''' (Mike Judge) - A teacher at Highland High School and arguably the only person who cares about Beavis and Butt-Head. Ever the idealist, he never gives up on educating and enlightening the duo no matter how disastrous his attempts to do so turn out. But not only are his efforts with the two always total failures, they laugh at him and are completely oblivious to his genuine concern for them. Van Driessen is a devoted [[hippie]] with a forgiving nature and gentle demeanor. His repeated attempts to teach the duo useful life lessons typically end in disaster as they almost always deduce the wrong message. He often plays songs on his [[acoustic guitar]] which typically end in him being severely hurt and in some cases almost killed. He has been shown teaching classes on [[biology]], [[art]], [[animation]], [[economics]], [[health]], [[history]], [[math]], and [[literature]], among others. Van Driessen is fired from his job in ''School Test'' by Principal McVicker, who blames him for Beavis and Butt-Head being "so damn stupid." He also owns a substantial [[8-track tape]] collection, which is ruined in ''Cleaning House'' by Beavis and Butt-Head. His voice and personality are similar to and may serve as a basis of sort for the character of Gerald Goode in Judge's latest animated series ''[[The Goode Family]].'' Mike Judge has stated Van Driessen was his favorite character, after Beavis, to voice. He based it on an interviewer he overheard during his time in a band.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

*{{anchor|Coach Bradley Buzzcut}}'''Coach Bradley Buzzcut''' (Mike Judge) - Another of the duo's high school teachers and the antithesis of Van Driessen. Angry, impatient and short-tempered, Buzzcut is a [[Vietnam War]] veteran who served in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and, with the possible exception of Principal McVicker, hates the duo more than any other character. He is shown substitute-teaching regular classes, but usually teaches [[physical education]]. It is implied that he has on occasion committed [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]] against the duo. Coach Buzzcut drives a [[Jeep Grand Wagoneer]]. Although Buzzcut's first name was never given in the series, it was revealed in ''This Book Sucks.''

*{{anchor|Principal McVicker}}'''Principal McVicker''' (Mike Judge) - the [[Principal (education)|principal]] of Highland High School and hates the duo. The two have unintentionally ruined his life. Many episodes begin with Beavis and Butt-Head in his office. They refer to him as "Mc[[penis|Dick]]er." He is an ill-tempered man who is constantly stressed out due to having to deal with Beavis and Butt-Head: he shakes when he speaks, he frequently rummages through his desk for prescription medications, and in ''No Laughing'', he is shown guzzling a bottle of [[Old Crow]] bourbon whiskey. In the original series finale, when McVicker thinks that Beavis and Butt-Head are dead, he immediately stops shaking and he becomes calmer and more cheerful. It is revealed in ''Dumb Design'' that he survived his [[heart attack]]. The spelling of his name was changed after the beginning of the series; his nameplate and office door spells his surname "McVicar" in early episodes. His voice and mannerisms are based upon a band director Mike Judge had in ninth grade. He stated that he was always wound up, angry, and smelled like liquor in the morning. He also stuttered and made the noises that McVicker makes when talking.<ref>Beavis and Butt-Head, The Mike Judge Collection. Special "A Taint of Greatness part 1".</ref>

*{{anchor|Daria Morgendorffer}}'''[[Daria Morgendorffer]]''' ([[Tracy Grandstaff]]) - a sarcastic, vaguely [[Alternative rock|alt-rock]]erish, nerdy girl who attends Highland High with Beavis and Butt-Head and she is one of the few people who sees the two for what they truly are. While not above taking jabs at them for their lack of intelligence, she also offers occasional help and advice. The duo nicknamed her "[[Diarrhea]]" but once said she was cool after she asked President Clinton a pointed and pertinent question during a school assembly (''Citizen Butt-head''). She eventually starred in her own spin-off series, ''[[Daria]].'' Daria is not featured in the newer episodes, but made a cameo of sorts, according to an August 2011 ''Rolling Stone'' interview with Mike Judge. In the episode "Drones" while watching a [[deadmau5]] video, Butt-Head asks Beavis if he remembers "That kid at school who died?" and Beavis mentions "I know Daria killed herself". Butt-head then incredulously tells him that Daria did not die but merely moved to a different city. She was the only character created at the request of MTV, who wanted a female character who could tolerate and handle the duo. Judge agreed with the idea, and worked on her with series writer David Felton.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

*{{anchor|Todd Ianuzzi}}'''Todd Ianuzzi''' (Mike Judge in "The Crush", later by Rottilio Michieli, and [[Toby Huss]] in 2011) - a trashy deadbeat and a violent criminal. Although Beavis and Butt-Head greatly admire him and aspire to join his "[[gang]]," Todd despises the two and frequently beats them up and takes advantage of them when he needs something, such as [[money]], food or a place to hide from other gangs or the [[police]]. However, in "A Great Day" Todd does thank the duo for giving him some gas money, and he allows them to watch him beat up someone who bumped into his car. In "Lord of the Harvest," Todd refrains from beating up Beavis as Cornholio, citing that as being "messed up," showing that even he does have some standards. Beavis and Butt-head seem to be to Todd what Stewart is to them. In the episode "Steamroller" it is said that Todd had dropped out of school two years before. Though Todd's last name has never been mentioned in the series, it was revealed in ''This Book Sucks''. Writers Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil suggested the idea of a character that the lads idolize even though he beats them up; Judge based Todd on a teenaged bully who lived near him and terrified him as a kid.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

*{{anchor|Stewart Stevenson}}'''Stewart Stevenson''' (Adam Welsh from 1993 to 1997 and by Mike Judge in 2011) - A nerdy, wimpy, obese boy who admires Beavis and Butt-Head and mistakenly believes they are his best friends. Beavis and Butt-Head relate to him mostly as Todd relates to them. They bully Stewart and take advantage of his attempts to befriend them, which usually results in him getting in trouble for something actually done by Beavis and Butt-Head. Stewart wears a black [[Winger (band)#Criticism|Winger]] t-shirt as a not-so-subtle reinforcement of his wimpiness (as opposed to the "coolness" of Beavis and Butt-Head wearing Metallica and AC/DC t-shirts). It is implied he lost his virginity in ''Holy Cornholio'', as Beavis, who was being worshipped by a group of fanatics at the time, passed on his followers to Stewart, who took him to have sex with the women of the cult, much to Stewart's delight.

==Episodes==
{{main|List of Beavis and Butt-head episodes}}
===Holiday specials===
Four holiday specials were produced—one for [[Halloween]], two for [[Christmas]] and one for [[Thanksgiving]].
*The Halloween special, titled ''[[Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest|Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest (Butt-O-Ween)]]'', involved them attempting to [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]] in ridiculous [[costume]]s—i.e. Beavis dressed up as a giant [[testicle|"'nad"]] by wearing underpants on his head and Butt-Head becoming [[nachos]] by pouring hot cheese sauce over his head, although at one point he said he was dressed up as a dumbass. When Beavis eats all of Tom Anderson's candy, his Cornholio persona emerges and he embarks on a rampage to acquire more from other trick-or-treaters, while Butt-Head is taken on a ride to the countryside in Todd's trunk, where he encounters a strangely pale old farmer. When Beavis finally comes down from his sugar high, he is hanging on a meathook in the farmer's barn, where the old man and a similarly pale Butt-Head seemingly attack him with chainsaws as the episode fades to blood red. (The duo, of course, both re-appear unharmed in future episodes.)
*The first Christmas special featured the pair sitting in front of the television providing crude commentary on various aspects of Christmas, and commenting on Christmas-themed music videos from various artists.
*The second Christmas special was simply titled "[[Sprout (Beavis and Butt-head episode)|''Beavis and Butt-Head'' Christmas Special]]," or alternately "Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas." It consisted of two segments that [[parody|parodied]] ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' directed by Tony Kluck and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (inverting it where life would have actually been "better" for everyone had Butt-head not been born) directed by former [[DreamWorks Animation]] director Mike deSeve, as well as Christmas-themed [[music video]]s (taken from the first Christmas special) and several segments in which Butt-Head answered [[fan mail]] dressed as [[Santa Claus]] while whipping a [[reindeer]]-costumed Beavis.
*The MTV Thanksgiving Special ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do Thanksgiving'' aired on November 27, 1997, the day before the series finale ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Are Dead]]'' written by Andy Rheingold and Scott Sonneborn. The bit featured [[Kurt Loder]] as the show's host, half-reluctantly and half-resigned, trying to teach the two characters the meaning of Thanksgiving as they report live from the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City, where they take more interest in people's butts and porn-shops than anything else. Among others, the special featured appearances by [[Adam Sandler]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Jay-Z]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[Tori Amos]], and the [[Beastie Boys]]. Also featured were two music videos ("Long Hard Road Out of Hell" by Marilyn Manson and "Criminal" by Fiona Apple) not included in any of the show's regular episodes. The Thanksgiving special only aired once, and its inclusion in the Mike Judge Collection [[DVD]] set shows it in a heavily edited format without the music videos or the celebrity appearances.

==Critiques of music videos==
One of the most well-known aspects of the series was the inclusion of music videos, which occurred between animated segments. The duo would watch and make humorous observations (about the band, a song's lyrics, or a video's visuals), or simply engage in nonsensical dialogue. Mike Judge always improvised the video comments. Almost all the animations of Beavis and Butt-Head during the videos were re-used from earlier episodes.<ref name="Interview" /> Even the new episodes that aired in 2011 used the old animation of the duo on the couch. 

==Criticism and controversy==
Over its run, ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reaction from the public with its combination of lewd humor and implied criticism of society.<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION; Keeping Beavis and Butt-Head Just Stupid Enough
|work= New York Times|date=October 17, 1993|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-11 | first=Elizabeth | last=Kolbert}}</ref> It became the focus of criticism from social conservatives, such as [[Michael Medved]], while others, such as [[David Letterman]], and the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]],'' defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the attention of many young television viewers in the United States and abroad and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and [[Generation X]]. [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], creators of ''[[South Park]],'' cite the show as an influence and compared it to the [[blues]]. They met Mike Judge before the show aired.<ref>"Taint of Greatness: The Journey of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 2," in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 2</ref>

In 1997, Dan Tobin of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' commented on the series' humor, stating that it transformed "stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh."<ref>"[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html Butting out]," ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''</ref> In 1997 Ted Drozdowski of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' described the 1997 ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' state as "reduced to self-parody of their self-parody."<ref>"[http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html Eye pleasers]," ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]''.</ref> In December 2006, ''[[TV Guide]]'' even ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases.<ref>[http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}, TV Guide. Retrieved on 2008-04-02. In 2010, it was ranked No. 8 by ''TV Guide'' in their list of "TV's Top 25 Animated Shows."</ref>

Mike Judge himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two - ''Blood Drive/Give Blood'' and ''Door to Door'' — which he described as "awful, I don't know why anybody liked it... I was burying my head in the sand."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Allegations of promoting dangerous behavior===
Early installments gave them a juvenile obsession with fire and dangerous behavior, summed up with Beavis' chant of "Fire! Fire!" The show was blamed for the death of a two-year-old in [[Moraine, Ohio]] in October 1993. The girl's five-year-old brother set fire to his mother's mobile home, killing her.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DF143EF933A25753C1A965958260 |title=Cartoon On Mtv Blamed For Fire |publisher=New York Times |date=1993-10-10 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> The mother later claimed that her son watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home.<ref name="nyt2" /> However, according to an article in the March 24, 1994 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', neighbors claimed that the family did not have cable television.

As a result, references to fire were excised from subsequent airings. The creators found a censorship [[loophole]] and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous "Fire! Fire!" (such as "Fryer! Fryer!" when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang "Liar, liar, pants on..." and pausing before "fire" (''Liar! Liar!''). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion ("California" by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say "fire". References to fire were cut from earlier episodes&nbsp;— even the original tapes were altered permanently.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sonic.net/~goblin/9beavis.html | title=Mike Judge interview | publisher= Goblin Magazine}}</ref> Other episodes MTV opted not to rerun included ''Stewart's House'' and ''Way Down Mexico Way''. Copies of early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare. The ones that exist are made from home video recordings of the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the recent ''Mike Judge Collection'' DVD set, Judge said he is uncertain if some of the earlier episodes still exist in their uncensored form.

When new episodes returned in 2011, MTV allowed Beavis to use the word "fire" once again uncensored.<ref name="RS-2011-08-03" /> During the first video segment during "[[Werewolves of Highland]]", the first new episode of the revival, Beavis utters the word "fire" a total of 7 times within 28 seconds, with Butt-head saying it once as well.<ref>{{Cite episode |title= [[Werewolves of Highland]] |series= Beavis and Butt-head |network=MTV |date= October 27, 2011|season=8 |number=1}}</ref>

The show has also been blamed for animal cruelty and the murder of a cat with fireworks. In the summer of 1993, Dick Zimmerman, a 44-year-old retired broadcasting executive from Larkspur, California, happened to see the episode in which Butt-head joked, "Hey, Beavis, let's go over to Stewart's house and light [a firecracker] in his cat's butt." Five days later, a cat was found killed by a firecracker in nearby Santa Cruz. Zimmerman, winner of a $10 million state lottery in 1988, immediately put up a $5,000 reward for the perpetrators, told the press that ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' was responsible for the death, and started a letter-writing campaign against the show. By the fall, 4,000 people from around the country had joined his campaign.<ref>John Leland, "Battle For Your Brain", ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 11, 1993, p. 51</ref>

In February 1994, watchdog group [[Morality in Media]] claimed that the death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a bowling ball thrown from an overpass onto a [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] highway near the [[Holland Tunnel]] by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by ''Beavis and Butt-Head''.<ref name="nyt">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDF1538F933A25751C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Youth Is Held in Death from Bowling Ball]</ref> The group said that Settle was influenced by ''Ball Breakers'', in which Beavis and Butt-Head loaded a bowling ball with explosives and dropped it from a rooftop.<ref name="nyt" /> While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. Later it was revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant as well, that Settle did not have cable TV and did not watch the show.

===Responses by writers and MTV===
In ''Lightning Strikes'', the show parodies blaming actions on youth culture. When asked by a reporter why they were flying a kite in a thunderstorm, the duo explained that they were inspired by a documentary about [[Benjamin Franklin]], who Butt-head describes as "some old dude with long hair and glasses". The reporter asks if it was [[Howard Stern]], and when Butt-head answers "no", she asks if he has ever listened to Stern's radio program. The reporter continues asking them leading questions until they mention that they had watched rock music videos earlier in the day. The reporter then concludes on the air that the music videos are to blame for the duo's actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00 P.M., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:
:Beavis and Butt-Head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by this Texas guy whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self destructive fools. But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh.
This was later changed to:
:Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do could cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly [[deported]]. To put it another way: Don't try this at home.
This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game as well as their Windows game ''[[Beavis and Butt-head in Virtual Stupidity]]''.

They were famously lambasted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] as "Buffcoat and Beaver."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289100,00.html |title=Dude... This Sucks– We mourn the loss of fresh Beavis and Butt-Head episodes |publisher=EW.com Television News |date=August 15, 1997}}</ref> This subsequently became a running gag on the show where adults mispronounced their names, Tom Anderson originally calling them "Butthole" and "Joe", and believing the two to be of Asian ethnicity (describing them to the police as "[[Oriental]]"). In later episodes, Tom Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as "Penis and Butt-Munch." President Clinton called them "Beavis and Bum-head" in ''Citizen Butt-head'', as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America|movie]], where an old lady (voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]) consistently calls them "Travis" and "Bob-head". In ''Incognito'', when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named "Crevis and Bung-Head". Also, in ''Right On!'', when the duo appear on the Gus Baker Show, host Gus Baker, who is an obvious caricature of [[Rush Limbaugh]], introduces them as "Beavis and Buffcoat".

Beavis and Butt-Head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savants]] because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by Mike Judge. With regard to criticisms of the two as "idiots", Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.

==Feature film==
{{Main|Beavis and Butt-Head Do America}}
In 1996, a full-length movie featuring the duo titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was released in theaters. The movie features the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Greg Kinnear]] (in an uncredited role), and [[David Letterman]] (credited as Earl Hofert). It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a "two thumbs up" from Siskel and Ebert. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $5 million to produce.

Also, in recent interviews, Judge claims that he is interested in producing a [[live-action]] movie. He said that previously he despised the idea, but now he thinks "maybe there's something there."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/05/15/beavis_and_butthead_to_make_a_big_screen |title='Beavis And Butthead' To Make A Big Screen Return—Starpulse Entertainment News Blog |publisher=Starpulse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> During an interview for Collider on August 25, 2009, Judge told them, "I like to keep the door open on Beavis and Butt-Head, because it's my favorite thing that I've ever done. It's the thing I'm most proud of." However, he also added, "Another movie... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years—maybe—to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years." One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. "I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s," he said. "I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch." Judge added that he wouldn't completely ignore the time that has passed in between. "At one point I thought Butt-Head might do okay on some really low-level sales job". While the TV show went into reruns, Mike Judge went on to make movies: he directed such films as ''[[Extract (film)|Extract]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', and ''[[Office Space]]'', which found favor with moviegoers and later became cult classics.

==First revival==
On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter that Mike Judge is creating a new ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' series, that Judge will reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation will be hand-drawn. According to [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], MTV has not asked [[Tracy Grandstaff]] to reprise her role as [[Daria Morgendorffer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/05/beavis-butthead-daria-morgendorffer-mtv-show-mike-judge/|title=Daria Left Out of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Reboot| publisher=TMZ| date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Later, in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Judge was asked if ''Daria'' is coming back and he said, "No. There's sort of a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in one episode.

As in the old series, Beavis and Butt-head are high school students who, among other things, criticize contemporary music videos.<ref name="revival">{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM |title=They're back! |work= New York Post |last=Starr |first=Michael |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-07-14| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100716203405/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/they_re_back_PZVN8lcKHQYVIYx3xAJRtM| archivedate= 16 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', MTV president Van Toffler said that the duo will also watch ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] matches, and amateur videos from [[YouTube]], as well as give movie reviews. "The biggest change is obviously the references are updated, it's set in modern day, and there's going to be a movie review segment," Linn said. "Otherwise they're still true to their prior passions."<ref name=rs>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/exclusive-new-beavis-and-butthead-will-tackle-jersey-shore-and-more-20110216| title= Exclusive: New 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Will Tackle 'Jersey Shore' and More| last= Greene| first= Andy| work= Rolling Stone| date=16 February 2011 |accessdate= 2011-05-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628193918/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/exclusive-new-beavis-and-butthead-will-tackle-jersey-shore-and-more-20110216| archivedate= 28 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for ''[[King of the Hill]]'', told a ''Rolling Stone'' reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving ''Beavis and Butt-head''. On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of ''King of the Hill'' would work well for ''Beavis and Butt-head''; eventually he concluded, "Maybe we should just actually make some good ''Beavis and Butt-head'' episodes." Later, a [[Lady Gaga]] video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a ''Beavis and Butt-head'' revival: "I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point-of-view that only Beavis and Butt-Head could bring."<ref name=rs/>

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' opened the [[feature film]] with a [[3-D film|3-D]] ''Beavis and Butt-head'' short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2011, MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid-2011. On July 21, 2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at [[Comic-Con International]]. A preview of the episode "Holy Cornholio" was also shown.<ref>Sitterson, Aubrey.

The new episodes debuted in the United States and Canada on October 27, 2011.

==Second cancellation & Possible Hulu Revival==
In 2012, many of the show's fans were unsure whether or not the show would be renewed for another season which lead to fans creating a petition to renew the show. <ref>{{cite web|title=XBOX Or Hulu: Pick Up Beavis And Butt-Head|url=http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/xbox-or-hulu-pick-up-beavis-and-butt-head|publisher=Change.org|accessdate=Monday, 14 October 2013 6:33PM}}</ref> After a year of the show's fate, TVSeriesFinale.com revealed to one of the managers of "Save Beavis & Butt-Head 2013" that the show was axed due to low viewership. <ref>{{cite web|title=Save Beavis & Butt-Head 2013|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=580363188689663&set=pb.436745306384786.-2207520000.1381789280.&type=3&theater|accessdate=Monday, 14 October 2013 6:13PM}}</ref> 

It seems that out of all the networks that the fans have been pitching the idea to, Hulu has made a hint that they are interested & the show could likely land on their online network. <ref>{{cite web|title=SaveBandBForXBO|url=https://twitter.com/SaveBandBForXBO/status/389875630507966464|accessdate=Monday, 14 October 2013 6:23PM}}</ref>

===Marvel Comics===
From 1994 to 1996, [[Marvel Comics]] published a monthly ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' comic<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotextra.com/bandbcollectiblescomics.html |title=Beavis and Butthead Central |publisher=Hotextra.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> under the [[Marvel Absurd]] imprint by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letters page was answered by 'Beavis and Butt-Head' or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics—in one with [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], Beavis tries to avoid using the word "fire" to describe the character's fiery skull.

In the comic, [[List of minor characters in Beavis and Butt-Head|minor characters]] like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

==Other appearances==
The characters have made cameo appearances (either visually or only voices) and have been referenced in numerous television shows, such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', [[The Head]], ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''[[TV Funhouse]]''), in films such as ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' and ''[[Jackass 3D]]'', and even parodied in children shows such as ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Regular Show]]'' and ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]''.

==''Daria'' spin-off==
In 1997, a spin-off show based on their classmate Daria Morgendorffer, ''[[Daria]]'', was created. Mike Judge was not credited as a producer of this series and has said he was not involved with it at all, except to give permission for the use of the character. The Daria character had been created for ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' by [[Glenn Eichler]] and originally designed by Bill Peckmann of J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. Eichler then became a producer for ''Daria''.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brainy 'Beavis' Pal 'Daria' Spins Off |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 1997|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34294_1_daria-morgendorffer|accessdate=2010-11-20 | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg}}</ref> In the first episode of ''Daria'', she and her family move from Beavis and Butt-Head's hometown of Highland to Lawndale—the only references to the original show is a single mention of Highland in the first episode, with Daria saying Lawndale can't be a second Highland "unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too".

==Home releases==
The first official [[home video]] releases of ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' were two [[VHS]] tapes titled ''There Goes the Neighborhood'' and ''Work Sucks!'', distributed by [[Sony]] Music Video and MTV Home Video in 1996 in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Each tape contained approximately eight episodes, each selected from the first four seasons. Although most of the episodes were presented in complete form, minus the music video segments, a handful of episodes were edited for content. Eight more VHS compilations were released between 1996 and 1999 in the U.S., before the final volume, ''Butt-O-Ween'', was issued in October 1999. However, the series continued in Australia and U.K., with a further ten volumes being issued between 1999 and 2001. When the series ended in the U.K., a further seven volumes were issued exclusively in Australia, meaning that over 28 volumes, all 200 episodes were released on VHS.

Prior to the release of the VHS Volumes, a laserdisc titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head: The Essential Collection'' was issued in 1994, containing sixteen episodes from the second and third seasons. ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was also issued on Laserdisc in 1997.

All of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the [[Time–Life]] organisation. The DVD releases were titled ''The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head''. A two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set started selling on [[eBay]] at very high prices, sometimes over $300 USD, as well as fetching over $1000 USD in new condition on websites such as "Amazon.com". According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23060 |title=Mike Judge |publisher=The A.V. Club |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> In all, half of the 32 episodes on ''The History of Beavis and Butt-head'' weren't included on later releases of the series, including all but two episodes on the first disc.

On November 8, 2005, MTV and [[Paramount home entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released a three-disc DVD compilation titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-head: The Mike Judge Collection]]'', Volume 1. The DVD set includes 40 episodes and 11 music video segments from the original shows. The set was followed by Volume 2 and Volume 3. On January 26, 2009, MTV and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] made all three collections available on the [[iTunes Store]].

A Blu-ray and DVD release of Season 8, titled ''Beavis and Butt-head – Volume 4'', was released on February 14, 2012 in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Volume-4/16232 ''Beavis and Butt-head - Volume 4''] at TV Shows on DVD</ref>
