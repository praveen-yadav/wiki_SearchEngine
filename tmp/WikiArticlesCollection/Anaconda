An '''anaconda''' is a large, non-venomous [[snake]] found in tropical [[South America]]. Although the name actually applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species in particular, the common or green anaconda, ''[[Eunectes murinus]]'', which is one of the largest snakes in the world.

'''Anaconda''' may refer to:

* Any member of the genus ''[[Eunectes]]'', a group of large, aquatic snakes found in South America
** ''[[Eunectes murinus]]'', the green anaconda, the largest species, is found east of the Andes in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].
** ''[[Eunectes notaeus]]'', the yellow anaconda, a small species, is found in eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay and northeastern Argentina.
** ''[[Eunectes deschauenseei]]'', the darkly-spotted anaconda, is a rare species found in northeastern Brazil and coastal French Guiana.
** ''[[Eunectes beniensis]]'', the Bolivian anaconda, the most recently defined species, is found in the Departments of Beni and Pando in [[Bolivia]].
* The [[giant anaconda]] is a mythical snake of enormous proportions said to be found in South America.
* Any large snake that "constricts" its prey (see [[Constriction]]), if applied loosely, could be called anaconda.<ref name="COED">Oxford. 1991. The Compact Oxford English Dictionary. Second Edition. Clarendon Press, Oxford. ISBN 0-19-861258-3.</ref>

==Etymology==
Although the name refers to a snake found only in South America, the name commonly used in Brazil is ''sucuriyu'' or ''sucuriuba''. The South American names ''anacauchoa'' and ''anacaona'' were suggested in an account by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by [[Henry Walter Bates]] who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon that [[John Ray]] described in Latin in his ''Synopsis Methodica Animalium'' (1693) as ''serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus, ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/synopsismethodic00rayj#page/332/mode/1up|page=332|year=1693|author=Ray, John|title=Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis |publisher= Impensis S. Smith & B. Walford|place=London}}</ref> Ray used a catalogue of snakes from the Leyden museum supplied by Dr. Tancred Robinson but the description of its habit was based on [[Andreas Cleyer]] who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling and crushing their bones.<ref>{{cite book|first=Charles |last=Owen |year=1742| title=An essay towards a natural history of serpents |page=114|url=http://archive.org/stream/essaytowardsnat00owen#page/114/mode/2up/}}</ref> [[Henry Yule]] in his [[Hobson-Jobson]] notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the Scots Magazine by a certain R. Edwin. Edwin described a ''tyger'' being crushed and killed by an anaconda when in fact tigers never occurred in Sri Lanka. Yule and [[Frank Wall]] noted that the snake was in fact a python and suggested a Tamil origin ''anai-kondra'' meaning elephant killer.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wall|first=Frank |year=1921|title=Ophidia Taprobanica or the Snakes of Ceylon. |publisher=Government Press|place=Ceylon |url=http://archive.org/stream/ophidiataprobani00wall#page/48/mode/1up/search/|page=48}}</ref> A Sinhalese origin was suggested by Donald Ferguson who pointed out that the word ''Henakandaya'' (''hena'' lightning and ''kanda'' stem/trunk) was used for the small whip snake (''[[Ahaetulla pulverulenta]]'')<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Spolia Zeylanica |year=1904 |volume=1 |url=http://archive.org/stream/spoliazeylanica01nati#page/84/mode/1up/| title=Some rare snakes of Ceylon|pages=81-89|author=Willey, A}}</ref> and somehow got misapplied to the python before myths were created.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Notes and Queries|volume=12|year=1897|author=Ferguson, Donald |pages=123-124 |title=The derivation of "Anaconda"|url=http://archive.org/stream/s8notesqueries12londuoft#page/122/mode/1up}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A concise etymological dictionary of the English Language|last=Skeat|first=Walter W.| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1882| page=16|url=http://archive.org/stream/conciseetymologi00skea#page/16/mode/1up}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url= http://archive.org/stream/hobsonjobsonagl02croogoog#page/n75/mode/1up|pages=24-25|title=Hobson-Jobson. |last1=Yule|first1=Henry|first2=A.C.|last2=Burnell|publisher=John Murray|place=London| year=1903}}</ref>
