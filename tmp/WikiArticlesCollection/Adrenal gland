In [[mammal]]s, the '''adrenal glands''' (also known as '''suprarenal glands''') are [[endocrine gland]]s that sit at the top of the [[kidney]]s; in humans, the right adrenal gland is triangular shaped, while the left adrenal gland is semilunar shaped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.organsofthebody.com/adrenal-glands/|title= FeedBack What Is Adrenal Gland? Adrenal Gland Diseases|publisher=OrgansOfTheBody|accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> They are chiefly responsible for releasing [[hormone]]s in response to [[stress (medicine)|stress]] through the [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] of [[corticosteroid]]s such as [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamine]]s such as [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) and [[norepinephrine]]. These endocrine glands also produce [[androgen]]s in their innermost cortical layer. The adrenal glands affect kidney function through the secretion of [[aldosterone]], and recent data (1998) suggest that adrenocortical cells under [[Pathology|pathological]] as well as under [[Physiology|physiological]] conditions show [[neuroendocrine]] properties; within the normal adrenal, this neuroendocrine differentiation seems to be restricted to cells of the [[zona glomerulosa]] and might be important for an [[autocrine]] regulation of adrenocortical function.<ref name="pmid9694576">{{cite journal |author=Ehrhart-Bornstein M, Hilbers U |title=Neuroendocrine properties of adrenocortical cells. |journal=Horm Metab Res. |volume=30 |issue=6-7 |pages=436–439 |year=1998 |month=June–July |pmid=9694576 |doi= 10.1055/s-2007-978911|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9694576 }}</ref>

==Anatomy and physiology==
The adrenal glands are located in the [[retroperitoneum]] superior to the [[kidney]]s, they are quadrilaterial in shape and are situated bilaterally.  The combined weight of the adrenal glands in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10&nbsp;grams.<ref>[http://journals.lww.com/obgynsurvey/Citation/1972/01000/Reinfection_With_Rubella_in_Pregnant_Women.4.aspx Page 18] in: {{cite journal |author=Boué A, Nicolas A, Montagnon B |title=Reinfection with rubella in pregnant women |journal=Lancet |volume=297 |issue=7712 |pages=1251–3 |year=1971 |month=June |pmid=4104713 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(71)91775-2 |url=}}</ref> They are surrounded by an [[adipose capsule]] and [[renal fascia]].

Each adrenal gland has two distinct structures, the outer [[adrenal cortex]] and the inner [[adrenal medulla|medulla]], both of which produce hormones. The cortex mainly produces [[cortisol]], [[aldosterone]] and [[androgen]]s, while the medulla chiefly produces [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].  In contrast to the direct innervation of the medulla, the cortex is regulated by [[neuroendocrine]] hormones secreted from the [[pituitary gland]] which are under the control of the [[hypothalamus]], as well as by the [[renin-angiotensin system]].

===Cortex===
{{main|Adrenal cortex}}
The [[adrenal cortex]] is devoted to production of [[corticosteroid]] and [[androgen]] [[hormones]]. Specific cortical cells produce particular hormones including [[aldosterone]], [[cortisol]], and [[androgen]]s such as [[androstenedione]].  Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40&nbsp;mg of cortisone acetate per day.<ref name="safeuses">{{cite book |author=Jefferies, William McK |title=Safe uses of cortisol |publisher=Charles C. Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-398-07500-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The adrenal cortex comprises three zones, or layers.  This ''anatomic zonation'' can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics.<ref name="whitehead">{{cite book |author=Whitehead, Saffron A.; Nussey, Stephen |title=Endocrinology: an integrated approach |publisher=BIOS |location=Oxford |year=2001 |pages=122 |isbn=1-85996-252-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> The adrenal cortex exhibits ''functional zonation'' as well: by virtue of the characteristic enzymes present in each zone, the zones produce and secrete distinct hormones.<ref name="whitehead"/>

;Zona glomerulosa (outer)
:The outermost layer, the [[zona glomerulosa]] is the main site for production of [[aldosterone]], a [[mineralocorticoid]], by the action of the enzyme [[aldosterone synthase]] (also known as [[Aldosterone synthase|CYP11B2]]).<ref name="pmid1775135">{{cite journal |author=Curnow KM, Tusie-Luna MT, Pascoe L, Natarajan R, Gu JL, Nadler JL, White PC |title=The product of the CYP11B2 gene is required for aldosterone biosynthesis in the human adrenal cortex. |journal=Mol.

;Zona fasciculata
:Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the [[zona fasciculata]] is responsible for producing [[glucocorticoid]]s, such as [[11-deoxycorticosterone]], [[corticosterone]], and [[cortisol]] in humans.  Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid under normal conditions and its actions include mobilization of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, but it does not increase under starvation conditions.<ref name=Kaplan.Physio />  Additionally, cortisol enhances the activity of other hormones including glucagon and catecholamines.  The zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH) from the [[anterior pituitary]].

;Zona reticularis
:The inner most cortical layer, the [[zona reticularis]] produces [[androgen]]s, mainly [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), [[DHEA sulfate]] (DHEA-S), and [[androstenedione]] (the precursor to [[testosterone]]) in humans.<ref name=Kaplan.Physio />

===Medulla===
{{main|Adrenal medulla}}
The [[adrenal medulla]] is the core of the adrenal gland, and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex.  It secretes approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine).<ref name=Kaplan.Physio />  The [[chromaffin cell]]s of the medulla, named for their characteristic brown staining with [[chromic acid]] salts, are the body's main source of the circulating [[catecholamine]]s adrenaline and noradrenaline.  Catecholamines are derived from the amino acid [[tyrosine]] and these water-soluble hormones are the major hormones underlying the [[fight-or-flight response]].

To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal medulla receives input from the [[sympathetic nervous system]] through [[preganglionic fiber]]s originating in the [[thoracic spinal cord]] from T5–T11.<ref name="essentialneuroscience">{{cite book |author=Sapru, Hreday N.; Siegel, Allan |title=Essential Neuroscience |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-9121-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Because it is innervated by [[preganglionic nerve fibers]], the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized [[sympathetic ganglion]].<ref name="essentialneuroscience"/> Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.

Cortisol also promotes epinephrine synthesis in the medulla. Produced in the cortex, cortisol reaches the adrenal medulla and at high levels, the hormone can promote the upregulation of [[phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase|phenylethanolamine ''N''-methyltransferase]] (PNMT), thereby increasing epinephrine synthesis and secretion.<ref name="whitehead"/>

===Blood supply===
Although variations of the blood supply to the adrenal glands (and indeed the kidneys themselves) are common, there are usually three arteries that supply each adrenal gland:
* The [[superior suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[inferior phrenic arteries|inferior phrenic artery]]
* The [[middle suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[abdominal aorta]]
* The [[inferior suprarenal artery]] is provided by the [[renal artery]]

[[Venous]] drainage of the adrenal glands is achieved via the [[suprarenal veins]]:
* The [[right suprarenal vein]] drains into the [[inferior vena cava]]
* The [[left suprarenal vein]] drains into the left [[renal vein]] or the left [[inferior phrenic vein]].

The [[suprarenal veins]] may form [[anastomoses]] with the [[inferior phrenic veins]]. Since the right supra-renal vein is short and drains directly into the inferior vena cava it is likely to injure the latter during removal of right adrenal for various reasons.

The adrenal glands and the [[thyroid gland]] are the organs that have the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue. Up to 60 [[arterioles]] may enter each adrenal gland.<ref name="isbn960-399-074-4">{{cite book |author=Mirilas P, Skandalakis JE, Colborn GL, Weidman TA, Foster RS, Kingsnorth A, Skandalakis LJ, Skandalakis PN |title=Surgical Anatomy: The Embryologic And Anatomic Basis Of Modern Surgery |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional Publishing |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=960-399-074-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  This may be one of the reasons lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the adrenals.

==Diseases involving the adrenal glands==
* Several [[adrenal tumor]]s cause symptoms because they result in the over- or underproduction of certain hormones by the adrenal gland.
* In [[hyperaldosteronism]] the adrenal glands produce too much aldosterone.
* In [[pheochromocytoma]] the adrenal glands secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines.
* In endogenous [[Cushing's syndrome]] the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol.
* [[Adrenal insufficiency]] denotes a group of diseases characterized by underproduction of cortisol or aldosterone. They can be caused by problems in the adrenal glands themselves, or by impairment of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. The [[ACTH stimulation test]] may assist in diagnosis.
** [[Addison's disease]] is a rare disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of [[glucocorticoid]]s (mainly cortisol). This can be caused by an [[autoimmune reaction]], by certain infections or by some other rarer causes.
** [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]s are genetic defects of enzymes involved in cortisol production and can affect sex characteristics of affected patients.
** [[Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome]] is adrenal gland failure due to bleeding into the adrenal glands, caused by severe bacterial infection.
* Isolated [[hypoaldosteronism]] can rarely occur due to [[aldosterone synthase]] deficiency
* [[Absent adrenal gland]], rare congenital condition

==Terminology==
The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys. The term "adrenal" comes from ''ad-'' (Latin, "near") and ''renes'' (Latin, "kidney").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/aindex/g/adrenal-glands.htm|title=What Are The Adrenal Glands?|accessdate=2013-09-18|publisher=About.com}}</ref> Similarly, "suprarenal" is derived from ''supra-'' (Latin, "above") and ''renes''.
