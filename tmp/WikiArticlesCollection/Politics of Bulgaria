{{Politics of Bulgaria}}
'''[[Politics]] of [[Bulgaria]]''' take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]].<ref name="LCCS Government">Bulgaria Library of Congress Country Study, ''Government and politics - overview'', p. 16</ref> [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|National Assembly]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Since 1989, after over fifty years of single party system, Bulgaria has an unstable party system, dominated by the post-communist [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]], its first opposition - the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] and several personalistic parties, which emerge for a short period of time in the past decade, governing of which are [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]]'s [[NDSV]] party and [[Boyko Borisov]]'s [[GERB]] party. The US Library of Congress Federal Research Division reported it in 2006 as having generally good [[freedom of speech]] and [[human rights]] records,<ref>

[...]Human Rights: In the early 2000s, Bulgaria '''generally has been rated highly on the issue of human rights'''. However, some exceptions exist. Although the media have a record of unbiased reporting, Bulgaria’s lack of specific legislation protecting the media from state interference is a theoretical weakness.

== Developments since 1990 ==
After the fall of the communism in 1990, the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|former communist party]] changed to [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP) and won the first post-communist elections for the Constitutional Assembly in 1990 with a small majority. Meanwhile, [[Zhelyu Zhelev]], a communist-era dissident from the new democratic party - [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]], was elected President by the Assembly in 1990, and in 1992 won Bulgaria's first presidential elections and served as President until 1997. The second President was another member of the Union of Demicratic Forces - [[Petar Stoyanov]] and served until 2002, when the leader of the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] - [[Georgi Parvanov]] began to replace him, he won two mandates and served until 2012, when [[Rosen Plevneliev]] of the right-oriented [[GERB]] was elected to serve as President until January, 2017.

In Bulgaria, the government and its leader - the Prime Minister are more significant than the President and the parliamentary elections are the most important ones. The country's first post-communist parliamentary elections in November 1991 made the winning with small majority pro-reform [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) to make government alone, having won 110 out of the 240 seats in the National Assembly. Their government collapsed in late 1992, and was succeeded by a technocratic team, put forward by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP), which served until 1994, when the President dissolved the government and appointed a provisional one to serve until the pre-term elections, appointed for December in the same year. The BSP won convincingly the pre-term elections in December 1994 with a majority of 125 seats out of the 240 seats in the Assembly and despite the mandate is for 4 years, BSP's government collapsed too and remained in office until 1996 due to the economic crysis in Bulgaria. A caretaker cabinet was appointed by the President again and served until the new pre-term parliamentary elections in April 1997. The elections resulted in a landslide victory for the pro-reform [[United Democratic Forces]], giving to the party the majority of 163 seats in the Assembly. This year marks the first post-communist government that not collapsed and served its full 4-year term until 2001. In 2001, former King [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] returned to power, this time as Prime Minister with his [[National Movement Simeon II]]. He won the majority of 120 seats in the Assembly and agreed partnership with the party of the Muslim minorities - [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] in opposition against the two previously governing parties - the Socialist Party and the Democratic Forces. The [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] won the parliamentary elections in 2005 with 82 out of the 240 seats, thus it didn't get the majority of the seats, with Simeon's movement being the second party.

Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007.<ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/eu_members/bulgaria/index_en.htm Bulgaria<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On the parliamentary elections in 2009, the newly established personalistic party of [[Boyko Borisov]] - [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]] (GERB) won the elections, securing 117 seats out of 240, which enabled it to form a cabinet alone. Once the governing party - the [[National Movement Simeon II]] have not amassed enough votes to enter the parliament. In the last seven elections held since 1989, no government has been re-elected—each has had to implement stringent economic and social reforms, since the fall of communism. The next elections will be held in 2013.

The present government of Bulgaria resigned on 20 February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulgarian government resigns amid growing protests|url=http://news.yahoo.com/bulgaria-government-resigns-national-protests-073220738.html?.b=index&.cf3=World+News&.cf4=1&.cf5=Reuters&.cf6=/|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>

== Executive branch ==
The [[president of Bulgaria]] is directly elected for a 5-year term with the right to one re-election. The president serves as the [[head of state]] and commander in chief of the armed forces. The President's main duties are to schedule elections and referendums, represent Bulgaria abroad, conclude international treaties, and head the Consultative Council for National Security. The President may return legislation to the National Assembly for further debate—a kind of veto—but the legislation can be passed again by an absolute majority vote.

The Council of Ministers is the principal organ of the executive branch. It is usually formed by the majority party in Parliament, if one exists, or by the largest party in Parliament along with coalition partners. Chaired by the Prime Minister, it is responsible for carrying out state policy, managing the state budget, and maintaining law and order. The Council must resign if the National Assembly passes a vote of no confidence in the Council or the Prime Minister or rejects a vote of confidence.
The current government is made of the centre-right [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]].

== Legislative branch ==
[[File:National Assembly of Bulgaria Sofia TB.jpg|thumb|350px|The National Assembly]]
The Bulgarian [[unicameral]] [[parliament]], the National Assembly or [[Narodno Sabranie]], consists of 240 deputies who are elected for 4-year-terms by popular vote. The votes are for party or coalition lists of candidates for each of the 28 administrative divisions. A party or coalition must garner a minimum of 4% of the vote in order to enter parliament. Parliament is responsible for enactment of laws, approval of the budget, scheduling of presidential elections, selection and dismissal of the [[prime Minister of Bulgaria|prime minister]] and other ministers, declaration of war, deployment of troops outside of Bulgaria, and ratification of international treaties and agreements.

The Supreme Judicial Council is in charge of the self-administration and organisation of the Judiciary.

A qualified majority of two-thirds of the membership of the Supreme Judicial Council elects the Presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and of the Supreme Administrative Court, as well as the Prosecutor General, from among its members; the President of the Republic then appoints those elected.

The Supreme Judicial Council has charge of the self-administration and organization of the Judiciary.

The [[Constitutional Court of Bulgaria]] supervises the review of the constitutionality of laws and statutes brought before it, as well as the compliance of these laws with international treaties that the Government has signed. Parliament elects the 12 members of the Constitutional Court by a two-thirds majority. The members serve for a nine-year term.
