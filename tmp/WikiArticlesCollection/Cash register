A '''cash register,''' also referred to as '''till,''' is a mechanical or electronic device for calculating and recording sales transactions, and an attached drawer(storage space) for storing [[cash]]. The cash register also usually prints a [[receipt]] for the customer. 

In most cases the drawer can be opened only after a sale, except when using special [[key (lock)|keys]], which generally only the owner (if not also some employees) have. This reduces the risk of employees [[Theft|stealing]] from the shop owner by pocketing the money without recording a sale, when a customer does not need a receipt but has to be given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than [[inventory]]). In fact, cash registers were invented for the purpose of eliminating employee theft or [[embezzlement]]; the original name was ''Incorruptible Cashier''.<ref name="Bryson"/> It has also been suggested<ref name="Bryson">{{cite book

==History==
[[File:NationalCashRegister.jpg|thumb|185px|right|[[National Cash Register]]]]

The first cash register invented by [[James Ritty]] following the [[American Civil War]]. He was the owner of a saloon in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], [[United States|USA]], and wanted to stop employees from pilfering his profits. He invented the Ritty Model I in 1879 after seeing a tool that counted the revolutions of the propeller on a steamship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=98 |title=Replica of the Ritty Model 1 Cash Register |publisher=[[National Museum of American History]] |date= |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> With the help of John Ritty, his brother, he patented it in 1883.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/ritty.html |title=Inventor of the Week: Archive |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |date=April 2002 |accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> 

The first registers were entirely mechanical, without receipts. The employee was required to ring up every transaction on the register, and when the total key was pushed, the drawer opened and a bell would ring, alerting the manager to a sale taking place. Those original machines were nothing but simple adding machines.

Shortly after his patent, Ritty became overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the cash register business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register]] Company and improved the cash register by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the [[receipt]]. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner could read the receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not embezzle the cash drawer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tale of the Tape: Retailers Take Receipts to Great Lengths|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|last1=Brat|first1=Ilan|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Ann|date=2 September  2009|page=A1|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125175363135673825.html|accessdate=2009-09-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1906, while working at the National Cash Register company, inventor [[Charles F. Kettering]] designed a cash register with an electric motor.

Their cash registers were particularly popular around the time of [[decimalisation]] in Britain in early 1971, Henry having designed one of the few known models of cash register which could switch currencies from [[£sd]] to £p so that retailers could easily change from one to the other on or after [[decimal day|Decimal Day]]. Sweda also had decimal ready registers where the retailer used a special key on decimal day for the conversion.

Cash registers include a key labeled "NS", which is abbreviated for "No Sale", and opens the drawer, printing a receipt stating "No Sale" and recording it in the register log that the register was opened. Some other cash registers require a numeric password or physical key to be used when attempting to open the till. In some jurisdictions the law also requires customers to collect the receipt and keep it at least for a short while after leaving the shop,<ref>[http://www.slowtrav.com/italy/restaurants/receipt.htm Slow Travel Italy - Restaurants, paying the bill, receipt, check]. Slowtrav.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.</ref><ref>[http://www.roderickconwaymorris.com/Articles/344.html When in Italy, Keep That Receipt!]. Roderickconwaymorris.com (1992-04-10). Retrieved on 2013-09-27.</ref> again to check that the shop records sales, so that it cannot [[tax evasion|evade sales taxes]].

Often cash registers are attached to [[weighing scale|scales]], [[barcode scanner]]s, [[checkstand]]s, and [[debit card]] or [[credit card]] terminals. Increasingly, dedicated cash registers are being replaced with general purpose [[computer]]s with [[Point of sale|POS]] software. Cash registers use [[bitmap]] characters for printing.<ref>[http://papress.com/thinkingwithtype/letter/bitmap.htm Type: Bitmap]. Papress.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-27.</ref>

Today, point of sale systems scan the barcode (usually [[European Article Number|EAN]] or [[Universal Product Code|UPC]])) for each item, retrieve the price from a [[database]], calculate deductions for items on sale (or, in British retail terminology, "special offer", "multibuy" or "[[buy one, get one free]]"), calculate the [[sales tax]] or [[VAT]], calculate differential rates for preferred customers, actualize inventory, time and date stamp the transaction, record the transaction in detail including each item purchased, record the method of payment, keep totals for each product or type of product sold as well as total sales for specified periods, and do other tasks as well. These POS terminals will often also identify the cashier on the receipt, and carry additional information or offers.

Currently, many cash registers are individual computers. They may be DOS, Windows or Unix based. Many of them have touch screens. They may be connected to computerized [[Point of sale]] networks using any type of protocol. Such systems may be accessed remotely for the purpose of obtaining records or troubleshooting. Many businesses also use [[tablet computer]]s as cash registers, utilizing the sale system as downloadable app-software.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/21/ipads-and-other-tablets-transforming-cash-register/51erCu8o01D2m4AMmTIUJN/story.html|date=2013-04-22|agency=New York Times|title=Tablets transforming the cash register|author=Nick Wingfield}}</ref>



A cash drawer is the compartment underneath a cash register in which the cash from transactions is kept. The drawer typically contains a removable till. The till is usually a plastic or wooden tray divided into compartments used to store each denomination of bank notes and coins separately in order to make counting easier. The removable till allows money to be removed from the sales floor to a more secure location for counting and creating bank deposits. Some modern cash drawers are individual units separate from the rest of the cash register.

A cash drawer is usually of strong construction and may be integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides in and out of its lockable box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves cash is completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open the drawer.
Cash drawers that are integral to a stand-alone register often have a manual release catch underneath to open the drawer in the event of a power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a cylinder lock, requiring a key to manually open the drawer. The cylinder lock usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the "locked" position, the drawer will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.

Due the increasing amount of notes and varieties of notes, many cash drawers have opted to store notes in a vertical side facing position instead of the traditional horizontal upward facing position. It enables faster access to each note and allowed more varieties of notes to stored. Sometimes the cashier will even divide the notes without any physical divider at all. Some cash drawers are also the Flip Top in design, where they flip open instead of sliding out like an ordinary drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcs-technology.com/cash_drawers.html |title=Cash Drawers |publisher=PCS Technology Ltd |date= |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref>

===Manual input===
Registers will typically feature a numerical pad, QWERTY or custom keyboard, touch screen interface, or a combination of these input methods for the cashier to enter products and fees by hand and access information necessary to complete the sale. For older registers as well as at restaurants and other establishments that do not sell barcoded items, the manual input may be the only method of interacting with the register. While customization was previously limited to larger chains that could afford to have physical keyboards custom-built for their needs, the customization of register inputs is now more widespread with the use of touch screens that can display a variety of point of sale software.

===Scanner===
Modern cash registers may be connected to a handheld or stationary [[barcode reader]] so that a customer's purchases can be more rapidly scanned than would be possible by keying numbers into the register by hand. The use of scanners should also help prevent errors that result from manually entering the product's barcode or pricing. At grocers, the register's scanner may be combined with a scale for measuring product that is sold by weight.

===Receipt printer===
Cashiers are often required to provide a receipt to the customer after a purchase has been made. Registers typically use [[thermal printing|thermal printers]] to print receipts, although older [[Dot matrix printing|dot matrix printers]] are still in use at some retailers. Alternatively, retailers can forgo issuing paper receipts in some jurisdictions by instead asking the customer for an email to which their receipt can be sent. The receipts of larger retailers tend to include unique barcodes or other information identifying the transaction so that the receipt can be scanned to facilitate returns or other customer services.

===Security deactivation===
In stores that use [[electronic article surveillance]], a pad or other surface will be attached to the register that deactivates security devices embedded or attached to the items being purchased. This will prevent a customer's purchase from setting off security alarms at the store's exit.

==Self checkout==
[[File:HomeDepotPinOakHoustonselfcheckout.jpg|thumb|left|Self checkout machine at [[Home Depot]] store #566 Pin Oak, [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
{{Main|Self checkout}}
Some corporations and [[supermarket]]s have introduced self-checkout machines, where the customer is trusted to scan the [[barcode]]s (or manually identify uncoded items like fruit), and place the items into a bagging area.<ref>http://www-03.ibm.com/products/retail/products/self/sco/index.html</ref> The bag is weighed, and the machine halts the checkout when the weight of something in the bag doesn't match the weight in the inventory database. Normally, an employee is watching over several such checkouts to prevent theft or exploitation of the machines' weaknesses (for example, intentional misidentification of expensive produce or dry goods). Payment on these machines is accepted by [[debit card]]/[[credit card]], or cash via coin slot and [[Bill validator|bank note scanner]]. Store employees are also needed to authorize "age-restricted" purchases, such as alcohol, solvents or knives, which can either be done remotely by the employee observing the self-checkout, or by means of a "store login" which the operator has to enter.
