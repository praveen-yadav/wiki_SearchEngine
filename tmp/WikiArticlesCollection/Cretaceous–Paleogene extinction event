In the [[geologic record]], the K–Pg event is marked by a thin layer of [[sediment]] called the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|K–Pg boundary]], which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows high levels of the metal [[iridium]], which is rare in the [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]] but abundant in asteroids.

It is generally believed that the K–Pg extinction was triggered by [[Chicxulub impactor|a massive comet/asteroid impact]] and its catastrophic effects on the global environment, including a lingering [[impact winter]] that made it impossible for [[plant]]s and [[plankton]] to carry out [[photosynthesis]].<ref name=Alvarez/> The impact hypothesis was bolstered by the discovery of the {{convert|180|km|0|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Chicxulub crater]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in the late 1970s,<ref name="Hildebrand, A.

==Extinction patterns==
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=left}} The K–Pg extinction event was severe, global, rapid, and selective. In terms of severity, the event eliminated a vast number of species. Based on marine fossils, it is estimated that 75% or more of all species were wiped out by the K–Pg extinction.<ref>Jablonski, D. (1994). "Extinctions in the fossil record (and discussion)." Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B. 344(1307) 11-17.</ref> This is a rough estimate. It is difficult to estimate diversity for modern ecosystems, let alone for fossil ones, and the data are derived primarily from marine invertebrates. Terrestrial organisms, especially insects, represent much of the diversity, but have a poorer record. Despite this, the high levels of extinction seen in terrestrial and marine fossils indicate that the K–Pg extinction is the most severe extinction in the past 250 million years.

The K–Pg extinction was a global event. The event appears to have hit all continents at the same time. Dinosaurs, for example, are known from the Maastrichtian of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and Antarctica,<ref>Weishampel, D. B., P. M. Barrett, et al. (2004). Dinosaur Distribution. The Dinosauria. D. B. Weishampel, P. Dodson and H. Osmolska. Berkeley, University of California Press: 517-606.</ref> but are unknown from the Cenozoic anywhere in the world. Similarly, fossil pollen show devastation of the plant communities in areas as far flung as New Mexico, Alaska, China, and New Zealand.<ref name="Nichols, D. J 2008"/> The event also affected all seas and oceans. Widespread groups such as mosasaurs and ammonites disappeared around the world. Furthermore, the extinctions occurred at the same time on land and in the sea.

The fossil record shows that the tempo of the K–Pg extinction was extremely rapid, occurring on a scale of thousands of years or less.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In some cases, it is possible to study fossils on a very fine scale - centimeter-by-centimeter - through the K–Pg rocks. Examples include marine microfossils, such as calcareous nanoplankton and foraminifera, and terrestrial plant pollen. Here, the fossils show that the ecosystem remained relatively stable up to the K–Pg boundary, at which point many species suddenly vanish. For groups with a poorer fossil record, such as dinosaurs, fossils are unlikely to be preserved just below the K–Pg boundary. For example, only a few dozen ''Tyrannosaurus'' skeletons are known, and so the odds of finding one a few centimeters below the boundary are low. This effect, called the [[Signor–Lipps effect]], causes many species to appear to vanish before the K–Pg boundary, creating the illusion of gradual extinction. Nevertheless, improved sampling shows that groups once thought to undergo a slow decline, such as dinosaurs, actually disappear suddenly near the K–Pg boundary. Reworking—when fossils are eroded from older rocks and deposited into younger rocks—can also make extinction appear gradual. For example, in the Bug Creek Anthills beds in Montana, dinosaur fossils occur alongside mammals from the earliest Paleocene, which created the illusion that dinosaurs dwindled as mammals radiated. Reworked fossils are recognized because they tend to be rare and are often damaged by the reworking.

The patterns are critical to understanding the cause of the extinctions. The fact that the extinction is severe, global, and rapid suggests that the extinctions result from a severe, global, and rapid environmental disturbance: an environmental catastrophe. In the 1970s and 1980s, this led scientists to seriously consider catastrophic mechanisms such as supernovas, volcanic eruptions, and asteroids, and sparked new interest in [[catastrophism]] in geology and paleontology.

The extinction was also highly selective. Some groups were relatively unaffected, others were devastated, and some were eliminated entirely. Many species of alligator, turtle, and salamander survived, for example. Mammals, birds, and lizards suffered high rates of extinction. Non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs were wiped out entirely.

Even though the boundary event was severe, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different [[clade]]s. Species that depended on [[photosynthesis]] declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the [[solar energy]] reaching the Earth's surface. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups.<ref name="autogenerated347">{{cite journal|author=Wilf P, Johnson KR |title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: a quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record |journal=Paleobiology |year=2004 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=347–368 |doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030<0347:LPEATE>2.0.CO;2|issn=0094-8373}}</ref> Photosynthesizing organisms, including [[phytoplankton]] and land plants, formed the foundation of the [[food chain]] in the late Cretaceous as they do today. Evidence suggests that [[herbivores|herbivorous]] animals died out when the plants they depended on for food became scarce.

[[Coccolithophorids]] and [[mollusc]]s (including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, freshwater [[snail]]s and [[mussel]]s), and those organisms whose [[food chain]] included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of [[mosasaur]]s, a group of giant marine [[reptiles]] that became extinct at the boundary.<ref name="Kauffman">{{cite journal| author =Kauffman E| authorlink =| title =Mosasaur Predation on Upper Cretaceous Nautiloids and Ammonites from the United States Pacific Coast | journal =PALAIOS | volume =19 | issue =1 | pages =96–100 | publisher =Society for Sedimentary Geology | url=http://palaios.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/19/1/96

[[Omnivores]], [[insectivores]] and [[carrion]]-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous there seems to have been no purely herbivorous or [[carnivore|carnivorous]] mammals. Mammals and birds that survived the extinction fed on [[insect]]s, [[worm]]s, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on [[detritus (biology)|detritus]] (non-living organic material).<ref name="MacLeod">{{cite journal |author=MacLeod N, Rawson PF, Forey PL, Banner FT, Boudagher-Fadel MK, Bown PR, Burnett JA, Chambers, P, Culver S, Evans SE, Jeffery C, Kaminski MA, Lord AR, Milner AC, Milner AR, Morris N, Owen E, Rosen BR, Smith AB, Taylor PD, Urquhart E, Young JR |title=The Cretaceous–Tertiary biotic transition |year=1997 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=265–292 |url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/154/2/265.short |doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.2.0265}}</ref><ref name="SheehanHansen">{{cite journal| author=Sheehan Peter M, Hansen Thor A | title =Detritus feeding as a buffer to extinction at the end of the Cretaceous | journal =Geology | volume =14 |issue =10| pages =868–870| year =1986| url =http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/10/868| doi =10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14<868:DFAABT>2.0.CO;2|accessdate =2007-07-04| issn=0091-7613|bibcode = 1986Geo....14..868S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Faunal evidence for reduced productivity and uncoordinated recovery in Southern Hemisphere Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections|author=Aberhan M, Weidemeyer S, Kieesling W, Scasso RA, Medina FA |year=2007 |journal=Geology |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=227–230 |doi=10.1130/G23197A.1|bibcode = 2007Geo....35..227A }}</ref>

The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, [[crocodyliform]]s and [[Choristodera|champsosaurs]], were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name="SheehanHansen"/>

Numerous species of [[benthic]] foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg extinction event, presumably because they depend on organic debris for nutrients, since the [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in the ocean is thought to have decreased. However, as the marine microbiota recovered, it is thought that increased speciation of benthic foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources.<ref name="MacLeod"/> Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large benthic foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the benthic populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Deep-sea benthic foraminiferal recolonisation following a volcaniclastic event in the lower Campanian of the Scaglia Rossa Formation (Umbria-Marche Basin, central Italy)|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/people/m-kaminski/reprints-pdfs/Galeotti_etal2002.pdf |format=PDF|author=Galeotti S, Bellagamba M, Kaminski MA, and Montanari A |year=2002 |journal=Marine Micropaleontology |volume=44 |pages=57–76 |accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=8.

[[Ostracod]]s, a class of small [[crustacean]]s that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits in a variety of locations.

Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous [[Scleractinia]] [[coral]] genera failed to cross the K–Pg boundary into the Paleocene.

The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the [[photic zone]]) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary.

These included the ecologically significant [[belemnoidea|belemnoids]], as well as the [[ammonoids]], a group of highly diverse, numerous, and widely distributed shelled cephalopods. Researchers have pointed out that the reproductive strategy of the surviving nautiloids, which rely upon few and larger eggs, played a role in outsurviving their ammonoid counterparts through the extinction event. The ammonoids utilized a planktonic strategy of reproduction (numerous eggs and planktonic larvae), which would have been devastated by the K–Pg extinction event. Additional research has shown that subsequent to this elimination of ammonoids from the global biota, nautiloids began an evolutionary radiation into shell shapes and complexities theretofore known only from ammonoids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ward PD, Kennedy WJ, MacLeod KG, Mount JF |year=1991 |title=Ammonite and inoceramid bivalve extinction patterns in Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sections of the Biscay region (southwestern France, northern Spain) |journal=Geology |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=1181–1184 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/12/1181 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<1181:AAIBEP>2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1991Geo....19.1181W }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Harries PJ, Johnson KR, Cobban WA, Nichols DJ |year=2002 |title=Marine Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary section in southwestern South Dakota: Comment and Reply |journal=Geology |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=954–955 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030<0955:MCTBSI>2.0.CO;2 |issn=0091-7613|bibcode = 2002Geo....30..954H }}</ref>

Approximately 35% of [[echinoderm]] genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although [[taxon|taxa]] that thrived in low-latitude, shallow-water environments during late Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of [[carbonate platform]]s, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Neraudeau D, Thierry J, Moreau P |year=1997 |title=Variation in echinoid biodiversity during the Cenomanian–early Turonian transgressive episode in Charentes (France) |journal=Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France |volume=168 |pages=51–61}}</ref>

===Terrestrial invertebrates===
[[Insect]] damage to the fossilized leaves of [[flowering plant]]s from fourteen sites in North America were used as a proxy for insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. Researchers found that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity.

Due to the wholesale destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary there was a proliferation of [[saprotrophic]] organisms such as [[fungus|fungi]] that do not require [[photosynthesis]] and use nutrients from decaying vegetation.

===Non-archosaur reptiles===
[[File:Kronosaurus hunt1DB.jpg|thumb|right|Large marine reptiles such as [[mosasaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s died out by the end of the Cretaceous.]]

The two living non-[[archosaur]]ian reptile taxa, [[testudines]] (turtles) and [[lepidosaur]]s ([[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, and [[amphisbaenia]]ns (worm lizards)), along with [[choristodere]]s (semi-aquatic [[archosauromorph]]s that died out in the early [[Miocene]]), survived through the K–Pg boundary.<ref name="MacLeod"/> Over 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–Pg boundary.

The order Squamata, which is represented today by lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians, radiated into various ecological niches during the [[Jurassic]] and were successful throughout the Cretaceous. They survived through the K–Pg boundary and are currently the most successful and diverse group of living reptiles with more than 6,000 extant species. No known family of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary, and fossil evidence indicates they did not suffer any significant decline in numbers.

===Archosaurs===
The [[archosaur]] clade includes two living orders, [[crocodilia]]ns (of which [[Alligatoridae]], [[Crocodylidae]] and [[Gavialidae]] are the only surviving families) and dinosaurs (of which birds are the sole surviving members), along with the extinct non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and [[pterosaur]]s.

====Crocodyliforms====
Ten families of crocodilians or their close relatives are represented in the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K–Pg boundary.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Calibration age and quartet divergence date estimation |author=Brochu CA |year=2004 |journal=Evolution |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1375–1382 |doi=10.1554/03-509 |pmid=15266985}}</ref> Five families have both Maastrichtian and Paleocene fossil representatives.

====Pterosaurs====
One family of [[pterosaurs]], [[Azhdarchidae]], was definitely present in the [[Maastrichtian]], and it became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained 10 families during the mid-Cretaceous. Smaller pterosaurs became extinct prior to the Maastrichtian during a period that saw a decline in smaller animal species while larger species became more prevalent. Recently, several pterosaur taxa have been discovered dating to the [[Campanian]]/Maastrichtian, such as the [[ornithocheirid]]s [[Piksi]] and "[[Ornithocheirus]]", possible [[Pteranodontidae|pteranodontids]] and [[Nyctosauridae|nyctosaurids]], and a [[Tapejaridae|tapejarid]].<ref name="mnhn-piksi">{{citation | url=http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/front/medias/publication/48099_g2012n4a10.pdf | title=Systematic reinterpretation of Piksi barbarulna Varricchio, 2002 from Two Medicine Formation (Upper Cretaceous) of Western USA (Montana) as a pterosaur rather than a bird)) | publisher=Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, Paris | work=Varricchio, D. | year=2012 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Agnolin, F.

====Birds====
Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see [[Origin of birds]]).

Many species of neornithines can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name="Robertson"/>

====Non-avian dinosaurs====
[[Image:Tyrannosaurus Rex Holotype.jpg|thumb|''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' was one of the last dinosaurs to live on Earth before the extinction.]]
Excluding a few controversial claims, scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit researchers to distinguish between the options.<ref name=AF04>{{cite book |first=Archibald|last=David|coauthors=David Fastovsky|editor=Weishampel David B, Dodson Peter, Osmólska Halszka (eds.) |title=The Dinosauria |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-24209-2 |pages=672–684 |chapter=Dinosaur Extinction |chapterurl=http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald/ArchFast.pdf }}</ref> Since there is no evidence that late Maastrichtian nonavian dinosaurs could burrow, swim or dive, they were unable to shelter themselves from the worst parts of any environmental stress that occurred at the K–Pg boundary. It is possible that small dinosaurs (other than birds) did survive, but they would have been deprived of food as both herbivorous dinosaurs would have found plant material scarce, and carnivores would have quickly found prey in short supply.<ref name="Robertson"/>

The growing consensus about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see [[physiology of dinosaurs|dinosaur physiology]]) helps to understand their full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the [[crocodilians]]. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died,<ref name="autogenerated347"/> while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.<ref name="springerlink.com">{{cite book |last=Ocampo|first=A|coauthors=Vajda V, Buffetaut E |chapter=Unravelling the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–T) turnover, evidence from flora, fauna and geology in biological processes associated with impact events |editor=Cockell C, Gilmour I, Koeberl C |title=Biological Processes Associated with Impact Events |publisher=SpringerLink |year=2006 |pages=197–219 |isbn=978-3-540-25735-6|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vw75014157p2p278/}}</ref>

Whether the extinction occurred gradually or very suddenly has been debated, as both views have support in the fossil record. A study of 29&nbsp;fossil sites in Catalan [[Pyrenees]] of Europe in 2010 supports that dinosaurs there had great diversity until the asteroid impact, with over 100 living species.<ref>{{cite journal

Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from K–Pg boundary environmental stresses.<ref name="Robertson"/>

==Evidence==

===North American fossils===
In North American terrestrial sequences, the extinction event is best represented by the marked discrepancy between the rich and relatively abundant late-Maastrichtian [[palynomorph]] record and the post-boundary fern spike.<ref name="Vajdaetal"/>

At present the most informative sequence of dinosaur-bearing rocks in the world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late [[Maastrichtian]]-age [[Hell Creek Formation]] of Montana, US. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75&nbsp;Ma) [[Judith River Formation|Judith River]]/[[Dinosaur Park Formation]]s (from Montana, USA, and Alberta, Canada, respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10&nbsp;million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.<ref name=AF04/>

The middle–late Campanian formations show a greater diversity of dinosaurs than any other single group of rocks. The late Maastrichtian rocks contain the largest members of several major clades: ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Torosaurus]]'',<ref name="Dodson">{{cite book | last = Dodson|first= Peter| authorlink =Peter Dodson | title = The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History| publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1996| location = Princeton | pages = 279–281| isbn = 0-691-05900-4}}</ref> which suggests food was plentiful immediately prior to the extinction.

In addition to rich dinosaur fossils, there are also plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are [[angiosperm]] pollen grains, but the actual boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores.<ref name="USGS">{{cite web | title =Online guide to the continental Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary in the Raton basin, Colorado and New Mexico | publisher =U.S. Geological Survey | year=2004| url=http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/kt/stop2b.html | doi = | accessdate =2007-07-08}}</ref> Normal pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer.

==Duration==
The length of time taken for the extinction to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over a relatively short period (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the [[Signor–Lipps effect]]; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.bechberger.com/Mel/Signor%20Lipps%20Paper.pdf | title=Geological implications of impacts of large asteroids and comets on the Earth | publisher=Geological Society of America | year=1982 | contribution=Sampling bias, gradual extinction patterns, and catastrophes in the fossil record. | volume=Special Publication 190 | location=Boulder, Colorado | pages=291–296 | oclc=4434434112 | last2=Lipps | first2=JH | last1=Signor III | first1=PW | editor=Silver LT | editor2=Schultz PH (editors)}}</ref> Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock which cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to a few million years after it.<ref name="MacLeod"/>

===Evidence for impact===
In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of [[Nobel prize]]-winning physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], his son geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and chemists [[Frank Asaro]] and [[Helen Michel]] discovered that [[sedimentary]] layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] many times greater than normal (30, 160 and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] because it is a [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|siderophile element]], and therefore most of it travelled with the [[iron]] as it sank into [[Structure of the Earth#Core|Earth's core]] during [[planetary differentiation]]. As iridium remains abundant in most [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth at the time of the K–Pg boundary.<ref name="Alvarez">{{cite journal|title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction |author=Alvarez LW, Alvarez W, Asaro F, Michel HV |year=1980 |journal=Science |volume=208 |issue=4448 |pages=1095–1108 |doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095 |pmid=17783054 |bibcode=1980Sci...208.1095A}}</ref> There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an [[impact event]], but this was the first hard evidence of an impact.<ref>{{cite journal |author=De Laubenfels MW |title=Dinosaur extinction: One more hypothesis |journal=Journal of Paleontology |pages=207–218 |year=1956 |volume=30 |issue=1 |jstor=1300393 }}</ref>

===Effects of impact===
Such an impact would have inhibited photosynthesis by generating a dust cloud that blocked sunlight for a year or less, and by injecting [[sulfuric acid]] [[aerosol]]s into the [[stratosphere]], which would have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by 10–20%. It would take at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate, which would account for the extinction of [[plant]]s and [[phytoplankton]], and of [[organisms]] dependent on them (including [[predator|predatory animals]] as well as [[herbivores]]). Small creatures whose food chains were based on [[detritus]] would have a reasonable chance of survival.<ref name="springerlink.com"/><ref name="Pope"/> The consequences of reentry of ejecta into Earth's atmosphere would include a brief (hours long) but intense pulse of [[infrared|infrared radiation]], killing exposed organisms.<ref name=Robertson/> Global [[firestorm]]s likely resulted from the heat pulse and the fall back to Earth of incendiary fragments from the blast. Recent research indicates that the
global debris layer deposited by the impact contained enough soot to suggest that the entire terrestrial biosphere had burned.<ref>Robertson, D.S., Lewis, W.M., Sheehan, P.M. & Toon, O.B. (2013) K/Pg Extinction: Re-evaluation of the Heat/Fire Hypothesis.Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences</ref> The high {{chem|O|2}} levels during the late Cretaceous would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric {{chem|O|2}} plummeted in the early Tertiary Period. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the {{chem|CO|2}} content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary [[greenhouse effect]] once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable organisms that survived the period immediately after the impact.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub Cretaceous/Tertiary impact |author=Pope KO, Baines KH, Ocampo AC, Ivanov BA |year=1997 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=102 |issue=E9 |pages=21645–21664 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1997/97JE01743.shtml |doi=10.1029/97JE01743|pmid=11541145 |bibcode=1997JGR...10221645P}}</ref>

The impact may also have produced [[acid rain]], depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor, lasting for approximately {{val|12|u=years}}.<ref name="Pope"/> The acidity was [[Buffer solution|neutralized]] by the environment, and the survival of animals vulnerable to acid rain effects (such as [[frog]]s) indicate this was not a major contributor to extinction. Impact theories can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulfuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time—possibly within {{val|10|u=years}}.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kring DA |year=2003 |title=Environmental consequences of impact cratering events as a function of ambient conditions on Earth |journal=Astrobiology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=133–152 |pmid=12809133 |doi=10.1089/153110703321632471|bibcode = 2003AsBio...3..133K }}</ref>

The shape and location of the crater indicate further causes of devastation in addition to the dust cloud. The asteroid landed in the ocean and would have caused [[megatsunami]]s, for which evidence has been found in several locations in the Caribbean and eastern United States—marine sand in locations that were then inland, and vegetation debris and terrestrial rocks in marine sediments dated to the time of the impact. The asteroid landed in a bed of [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]), which would have produced a vast sulfur dioxide [[aerosol]]. This would have further reduced the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and then precipitated as acid rain, killing vegetation, plankton, and organisms that build shells from [[calcium carbonate]] ([[coccolithophore]]s and [[mollusca|molluscs]]). In February 2008, a team of researchers used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than was previously assumed. They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which could have made the impact deadlier by altering climate and by generating acid rain.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Importance of pre-impact crustal structure for the asymmetry of the Chicxulub impact crater|author=Gulick|journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |pages=131–135 |date=13 January 2008 | doi=10.1038/ngeo103|last2=Barton|first2=Penny J.|last3=Christeson|first3=Gail L.|last4=Morgan|first4=Joanna V.|last5=McDonald|first5=Matthew|last6=Mendoza-Cervantes|first6=Keren|last7=Pearson|first7=Zulmacristina F.|last8=Surendra|first8=Anusha|last9=Urrutia-Fucugauchi|first9=Jaime |issue=2|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..131G }}</ref>

Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth at approximately the end of the Cretaceous, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the extinctions.<ref name="Keller"/><ref name="Morgan">{{cite journal |title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub |author=Morgan J, Lana C, Kersley A, Coles B, Belcher C, Montanari S, Diaz-Martinez E, Barbosa A, Neumann V |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=251 |issue=3–4 |year=2006 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009 |bibcode=2006E&PSL.251..264M}}</ref> There is evidence that there was an interval of about {{val|300|ul=ka}} from the impact to the mass extinction.<ref name="Keller_2009">{{cite journal| author=Keller G, Abramovich S, Berner Z, Adatte T| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=271| issue=1–2| date=1 January 2009| pages=52–68| title=Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, K–Pg catastrophe and sea level change in Texas| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.007}}</ref> In 1997, paleontologist [[Sankar Chatterjee]] drew attention to the proposed and much larger {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} [[Shiva crater]] and the possibility of a multiple-impact scenario.

In {{date|March 2010}} an international panel of scientists endorsed the asteroid hypothesis, specifically the Chicxulub impact, as being the cause of the extinction. A team of 41 scientists reviewed {{val|20|u=years}} of scientific literature and in so doing also ruled out other theories such as massive volcanism. They had determined that a {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|adj=on}} space rock hurtled into Earth at [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]] on Mexico's [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The collision would have released the same energy as {{convert|100|TtTNT|ZJ|lk=on}}, over a billion times the energy of the bombs dropped on [[Nagasaki and Hiroshima]].<ref name="Schulte10"/>

==Alternative hypotheses==
The fact that the extinctions occur at the same time as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction. However, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, and to suggest that other events may have contributed to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.

===Deccan Traps===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] -->
{{Main|Deccan Traps}}

Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around {{val|68|ul=Ma}} and lasted more than {{val|2|u=million years}}. The most recent evidence shows that the traps erupted over a period of {{val|800000|u=years}} spanning the K–Pg boundary, and therefore may be responsible for the extinction and the delayed biotic recovery thereafter.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Keller G, Adatte T, Gardin S, Bartolini A, Bajpai S |title=Main Deccan volcanism phase ends near the K–T boundary: Evidence from the Krishna-Godavari Basin, SE India |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.015 |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=268 |pages=293–311 |bibcode=2008E&PSL.268..293K |issue= 3–4}}</ref>

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name="Duncan">{{cite journal |title=Rapid eruption of the Deccan flood basalts at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary |author=Duncan RA, Pyle DG |year=1988 |journal=Nature |volume=333 |pages=841–843 |doi=10.1038/333841a0 |issue=6176|bibcode = 1988Natur.333..841D }}</ref>

In the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that [[paleontologists]] were being misled by [[Signor–Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Alvarez|first= W |title=T. rex and the Crater of Doom |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01630-6 |pages=130–146}}</ref>

===Multiple impact event===
Several other craters also appear to have been formed about the time of the K–Pg boundary. This suggests the possibility of near simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9|Shoemaker–Levy 9]] impact with [[Jupiter]]. In addition to the {{convert|180|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Chicxulub Crater]], there is the {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Boltysh crater]] in [[Ukraine]] ({{val|65.17|0.64|u=Ma}}), the {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Silverpit crater]], a suspected impact crater in the [[North Sea]] ({{val|62.5|2.5|u=Ma}}), and the controversial and much larger {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Shiva crater]]. Any other craters that might have formed in the [[Tethys Ocean]] would have been obscured by tectonic events like the relentless northward drift of Africa and India.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date= October 13, 2004 |title= Debating the Dinosaur Extinction| url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1243/debating-the-dinosaur-extinction|journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Mullen L| date= October 20, 2004 | title=Multiple impacts |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1253/multiple-impacts|journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref><ref name="Mullen Shiva">{{cite journal |author=Mullen L |date=November 3, 2004 |title=Shiva: Another K–T impact? |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1281/shiva-another-k-t-impact|journal=Astrobiology Magazine |accessdate=2012-03-29 }}</ref><ref name="chatterjee 1997">{{cite book |last=Chatterjee |first=Sankar |authorlink=Sankar Chatterjee |coauthors= |year=1997 |month=August |chapter=Multiple Impacts at the KT Boundary and the Death of the Dinosaurs |title= 30th International Geological Congress|volume= 26|issue= |pages=31–54 |id= |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/?id=3IORF1Ei3LIC&pg=PA31&dq=Chatterjee+and+Rudra+1996+Shiva|accessdate= 2008-02-22 |quote= |isbn=978-90-6764-254-5 }}</ref>

===Maastrichtian sea-level regression in the north and ingression in the south===
There is clear evidence that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the [[Mesozoic]] era. In some [[Maastrichtian]] [[Faunal stage|stage]] rock layers from various parts of the world, the later layers are terrestrial; earlier layers represent shorelines and the earliest layers represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with [[Orogeny|mountain building]], therefore, the likeliest explanation is a "regression", that is, a drop in sea level. There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the explanation currently accepted as most likely is that the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]] became less active and therefore sank under their own weight.<ref name="MacLeod"/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Abrupt deep-sea warming at the end of the Cretaceous |journal=Geology |year=1998 |first1=Liangquan |last1=Li| first2=Gerta|last2=Keller |volume=26 |issue= 11|pages=995–998 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/11/995 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026<0995:ADSWAT>2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1998Geo....26..995L }}</ref>

A severe regression would have greatly reduced the [[continental shelf]] area, which is the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a ''marine'' mass extinction. However research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's [[albedo]] and therefore increasing global temperatures.<ref name="Marshall"/>

Marine regression also resulted in the loss of [[epeiric sea]]s, such as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing [[coastal plain]]s that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. Another consequence was an expansion of [[freshwater]] environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to [[freshwater]] [[vertebrates]], those that prefer [[ocean|marine]] environments, such as [[shark]]s, suffered.<ref name=AF04/>

An interesting aspect, very poorly studied up to now, is that in coincidence with the regression in the northern hemisphere, southern continents experienced a massive marine ingression, the first related to the Atlantic Ocean, that formed at least three vast epeiric seas in South America. One of them, over the Austral Basin, flooded southernmost Patagonia. Another one flooded Central Patagonia, reaching the Andes foothills, and the northernmost, entering across central Argentina (Buenos Aires Province) flooded the center of the country and reached southern Bolivia in the Potosi Basin.

===Multiple causes===
In a review article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky discussed a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, [[marine regression]], and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in and loss of habitats. Dinosaurs, as the largest vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, [[particulate]] materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction.<ref name=AF04/>

==Recovery and radiation==
The K–Pg extinction had a profound effect on the evolution of life on earth. The elimination of dominant Cretaceous groups allowed other organisms to take their place, spurring a remarkable series of [[adaptive radiation]]s in the Paleogene.<ref name="Alroy, J. 1999"/> The most striking example is the replacement of dinosaurs by mammals. After the K–Pg extinction, mammals evolved rapidly to fill the niches left vacant by the dinosaurs. Within mammalian genera, new species were approximately 9.1% larger after the K–Pg boundary.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Alroy J |title=Cope's rule and the dynamics of body mass evolution in North American fossil mammals |journal=Science |volume=280 |issue=5364 |pages=731–4 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9563948 |doi= 10.1126/science.280.5364.731|url= |accessdate=|bibcode = 1998Sci...280..731A }}</ref>

Other groups also underwent major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary.<ref name="Feduccia, A. 1995"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Ericson PG, Anderson CL, Britton T, ''et al.'' |title=Diversification of Neoaves: integration of molecular sequence data and fossils |journal=Biol. Lett. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=543–7 |year=2006 |month=December |pmid=17148284 |pmc=1834003 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0523 |url= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}</ref> They even produced giant, flightless forms, such as the herbivorous ''[[Gastornis]]'' and [[Dromornithidae]], and the predatory [[Phorusrhacidae]]. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes may have led to the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas.<ref name="Longrich, N. R. 2012"/> On land, [[Titanoboa|giant boid]] and enormous [[Madtsoiidae|madtsoiid]] snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant [[sea snakes]] radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively,<ref name="Friedman, M. 2010"/> filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and flatfish. Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps to take the place of leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also rose to prominence.<ref>{{cite book |author=Grimaldi, David A. |title=Evolution of the Insects |publisher=Cambridge Univ Pr (E) |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-511-12388-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
