'''Games played''' (most often abbreviated as '''G''' or '''GP''') is a [[statistic]] used in [[team sport]]s to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.

==Baseball==
In [[baseball]], the [[baseball statistics|statistic]] applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a [[starting lineup]] card or are announced as ''ex ante'' substitutes, whether they actually play or not,<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_scorer_10.jsp Section 20 of the official scorer guidelines]</ref> although, in [[Major League Baseball]], the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A [[starting pitcher]], then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a [[games started|game started]], an [[innings pitched|inning pitched]], or a [[complete game]].
