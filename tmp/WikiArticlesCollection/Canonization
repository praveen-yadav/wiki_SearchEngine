'''Canonization''' (in [[American English]] and [[Oxford spelling]]) or '''canonisation''' (in majority [[British English]]) is the act by which the [[Catholic Church]] or [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] declares a deceased person to be a [[saint]], upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, individuals were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] were developed.

==Historical development of the process==
The first people honored as saints were the [[martyr]]s. Pious legends of their deaths were considered to affirm the truth of their faith in Christ, and formalization and celebration of these legends served to legitimize and propagate the doctrines of the Church and serve as examples.

The [[Latin Rite]]'s Canon of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] contains the names only of martyrs, along with that of the [[Virgin Mary]] and, since 1962, that of [[Saint Joseph]].

By the fourth century, however, "[[confessor]]s"—people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life—began to be venerated publicly. Examples of such people are Saint [[Hilarion]] and Saint [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in the East, and Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint [[Hilary of Poitiers]] in the West. Their names were inserted in the [[diptych]]s, the lists of saints explicitly venerated in the [[liturgy]], and their tombs were honoured like those of the martyrs. Since the witness of their lives was not as unequivocal as that of the martyrs, they were venerated publicly only with the approval by the local [[bishop]]. This process is often referred to as "local canonization".<ref>For the history of canonization, see Kemp, Canonization and Authority in the Western Church,</ref>

This approval was required even for veneration of a reputed martyr. In his history of the [[Donatism|Donatist]] [[heresy]], [[Saint Optatus]] recounts that at [[Carthage]] a Catholic matron, named Lucilla, incurred the censures of the Church for having kissed the [[relic]]s of a reputed martyr whose claims to martyrdom had not been juridically proved. And Saint [[Cyprian]] (died 258) recommended that the utmost diligence be observed in investigating the claims of those who were said to have died for the faith. All the circumstances accompanying the martyrdom were to be inquired into; the faith of those who suffered, and the motives that animated them were to be rigorously examined, in order to prevent the recognition of undeserving persons. Evidence was sought from the court records of the trials or from people who had been present at the trials.

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] (died 430) tells of the procedure which obtained in his day for the recognition of a martyr. The bishop of the diocese in which the martyrdom took place set up a canonical process for conducting the inquiry with the utmost severity. The acts of the process were sent either to the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] or [[primate]], who carefully examined the cause, and, after consultation with the [[suffragan]] bishops, declared whether the defunct was worthy of the name of 'martyr' and public veneration.

Acts of formal recognition, such as the erection of an [[altar]] over the saint's tomb or transferring the saint's relics to a church, were preceded by formal inquiries into the sanctity of the person's life and the miracles attributed to that person's intercession.

Such acts of recognition of a saint were authoritative, in the strict sense, only for the [[diocese]] or [[ecclesiastical province]] for which they were issued, but with the spread of the fame of a saint, were often accepted elsewhere also.

==Catholic Church==
In the [[Catholic Church]] (both the [[Latin Catholic Church|Western]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]) the act of canonization is reserved to the [[Holy See]] and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the person proposed for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he or she is worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the persons are now in heavenly glory, that they may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the [[liturgy]] of the Church, most especially in the [[Litany of the Saints]]. Other churches still follow the older practice (see, for instance, [[Canonization#Eastern Orthodox Practice—Glorification|below]] on the practice of the Orthodox Church).

In the Catholic Church, canonization involves a decree that allows veneration of the saint in the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Rite]] throughout the world. For permission to venerate on a local level, only [[beatification]] is needed, not canonization.<ref>"Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept" ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Beccari, Camillo. "Beatification and Canonization"] ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. Retrieved 27 May 2009).</ref>

===Medieval procedure===
In the Medieval West, the [[Holy See]] was asked to intervene in the question of canonizations, so as to ensure a more authoritative decision. The canonization of [[Saint Udalric, Bishop of Augsburg]], by [[Pope John XV]] in 993 is the first undoubted example of a papal canonization of a saint from outside Rome (Some historians maintain that the first such canonization was that of Saint Swibert by [[Pope Leo III]] in 804). Thereafter recourse was had with greater frequency to the judgment of the popes. [[Walter of Pontoise]] was canonized by [[Hugh de Boves]], the [[Archbishop of Rouen]] in 1153; Walter was the last saint in [[Western Europe]] to have been canonized by an authority other than the pope.<ref name = "ofsnlu">[http://www.archive.org/stream/dictionaryofchri01smituoft/dictionaryofchri01smituoft_djvu.txt William Smith, Samuel Cheetham, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'' (Murray, 1875), 283.]</ref><ref>[http://www.saint-mike.org/library/papal_library/AlexanderIII/biography.html Alexander III]</ref> “The last case of canonization by a metropolitan is said to have been that of St. Gaultier, or Gaucher, abbot of Pontoise, by the Archbishop of Rouen. A decree of [[Pope Alexander III]], 1170, gave the prerogative to the pope thenceforth, so far as the Western Church was concerned.”<ref name = "ofsnlu"/>

In 1173 [[Pope Alexander III]], after reprimanding certain bishops for having permitted veneration of a man who was far from being a saint, decreed: "You shall not therefore presume to honour him in the future; for, even if miracles were worked through him, it is not lawful for you to venerate him as a saint without the authority of the Catholic Church."<ref>Gregory IX, ''Decretales'', III, "De reliquiis et veneratione sanctorum"</ref>

The procedure initiated by the text of Alexander III, confirmed by a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Innocent III]] in the year 1200, issued on the occasion of the canonization of Saint Cunegunde, led to increasingly elaborate inquiries.

===From the 18th to the 20th century===

In his ''De Servorum Dei beatifιcatione et de Beatorum canonizatione'', the eminent canonist Prospero Lambertini (1675–1758), who later became [[Pope Benedict XIV]], elaborated upon the procedural norms issued by [[Pope Urban VII]] (1623-1644)<ref>Apostolic Letter ''Caelestis Hierusalem cives'' of 5 July 1634; ''Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum'' of 12 March 1642</ref> and the actual established practice. From his time until the 20th century proceedings were governed by his five-volume work published in 1734-1738. Its substance was incorporated into the [[Code of Canon Law]] of 1917.<ref>[http://www.strasbourginstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Musoni-The-Catholic-Canonization-Process.pdf Aimable Musoni, "Saints without Borders", pp. 9-10]</ref> The article [[Beatification and canonization process in 1914]] describes the procedures followed immediately before the publication of that Code.

===Roman Catholic procedure since 1983===
{{Main|Congregation for the Causes of Saints}}

[[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul II's]] [[apostolic constitution]] ''Divinus Perfectionis Magister''<ref>http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_divinus-perfectionis-magister_en.html</ref> of 25 January 1983, and the norms issued by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] on 7 February 1983, for its implementation on diocesan level, continued the work of simplification already initiated by [[Pope Paul VI]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_divinus-perfectionis-magister_en.html Divinus Perfectionis Magister]</ref> In particular, the reforms eliminated the office of the Promoter of the Faith (Latin: promotor fidei), popularly known as the [[Devil's advocate]], who was required to present a case against canonization. Possibly as a result, the rate of canonization increased markedly after 1983.

'''The steps to canonization''' that the saints have to go through to become a saint:

'''"Servant of God"''' The process leading towards canonization begins at the diocesan level. A [[bishop]] with jurisdiction—usually the bishop of the place where the candidate died or is buried, although another ordinary can be given this authority—gives permission to open an investigation into the virtues of the individual, responding to a petition by members of the faithful, either actually or [[pro forma]].<ref>[[Pope John Paul II]], 1983, [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_divinus-perfectionis-magister_en.html ''Divinus Perfectionis Magister''], Art I, Sec 1</ref> This investigation usually opens no sooner than five years after the death of the person being investigated.<ref>Pietro Cardinal Palazzini, 1983, [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_07021983_norme_en.html ''Norms to be observed in inquiries made by bishops in the causes of saints''], § 9 a</ref> The pope, as Bishop of Rome, may open a process and has the authority to waive the five-year waiting period, as was done for [[Mother Teresa]] by [[Pope John Paul II]],<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html '' Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1910–1997), biography''], Office of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, Internet Office of the Holy See</ref> and for [[Lúcia Santos]] and for John Paul II himself by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].<ref>http://www.zenit.org/article-21764?l=english</ref><ref>[[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[José Saraiva Martins]], [[Claretians|C.M.F.]]; 2005; [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html ''Response of His Holiness Benedict XVI for the examination of the cause for beatification and canonization of the Servant of God John Paul II'']</ref> Normally, a guild or organization to promote the cause of the candidate's sainthood is created, an exhaustive search of the candidate's writings, speeches and sermons is undertaken, a detailed biography is written and eyewitness accounts are gathered. When sufficient information has been gathered, the investigation of the candidate, who is called '''"Servant of God"''', is presented by the local bishop to the [[Roman Curia]]—in particular, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints—where it is assigned a [[postulator]], whose task is to gather further information about the life of the Servant of God. Religious orders who regularly deal with the congregation often have their own designated postulator generals. At some point, permission is then granted for the body of the Servant of God to be exhumed and examined. A certification ("non cultus") is made that no superstitious or heretical worship or improper cult has grown up around the servant or his or her tomb, and relics are taken.

'''"Venerable/Heroic in Virtue"''' When enough information has been gathered, the congregation will recommend to the [[pope]] that he make a proclamation of the Servant of God's [[heroic virtue]] (that is, that the servant exhibited the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, and the cardinal virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, to a heroic degree). From this point the one said to be "heroic in virtue" is referred to by the title '''"[[Venerable]]"'''. A Venerable has as yet no [[feast day]], no churches may be built in his or her honor, and the church has made no statement on the person's probable or certain presence in heaven, but [[prayer card]]s and other materials may be printed to encourage the faithful to pray for a [[miracle]] wrought by his or her intercession as a sign of God's will that the person be canonized.

'''"Blessed"''' Beatification is a statement by the church that it is "worthy of belief" that the person is in heaven, having come to salvation. This step depends on whether the Venerable is a [[martyr]] or a "confessor".
* For a martyr, the Pope has only to make a declaration of martyrdom, a certification that the venerable gave his or her life voluntarily as a witness for the faith and/or in an [[act of heroic charity]] for others.
* If the Venerable was not a martyr – all non-martyrs are "confessors" as they "confessed" or bore witness to their faith by how they lived their lives – it must be proven that a [[Beatification#Alleged miracle|miracle]] has taken place by his or her intercession: that is, that God has shown a sign that the person is enjoying the Beatific Vision by God performing a miracle in response to the Blessed's prayers. Today, these miracles are almost always miraculous cures, as these are the easiest to establish based on the Catholic Church's requirements for a "miracle." (The patient was sick, there was no known cure for the ailment, prayers were directed to the Venerable, the patient was cured, the cure was spontaneous, instantaneous, complete and lasting, and doctors cannot find any natural explanation.)

This allows [[beatification]], giving the venerable the new title '''"Blessed"''' (abbreviated "Bl.") or, in Latin, Beatus or Beata. A feast day will be designated, but its observance is normally restricted to the Blessed's home diocese, to certain locations associated with him or her, and/or to the churches or houses of the blessed's religious order, if they belonged to one. Parishes may not normally be named in honor of a Blessed.

'''"Saint"''' (contracted "St" or "S.") To be canonized a saint, at least two miracles must have been performed through the saint's intercession after his or her death (i.e., an additional miracle after that granting beatification). Canonization is a statement by the church that the person certainly enjoys the [[Beatific Vision]]. The saint is assigned a feast day which ''may'' be celebrated anywhere within the Catholic Church, although it may or may not appear on the general calendar or local calendars as an ''obligatory'' feast, parish churches may be built in his or her honor, and the faithful may freely and without restriction celebrate and honor the saint.

In the case of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], individual churches ''[[sui juris]]'' retain, in theory, the right to glorify saints for their own jurisdictions, though this has rarely happened in practice.

Although a recognition of sainthood by the Pope does not directly concern a fact of divine revelation, it must still be "definitively held" by the faithful as infallible under (at the very least) the [[Infallibility of the Church|Universal Magisterium of the Church]] since it is a truth connected to revelation by historical necessity.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFADTU.HTM Doctrinal Commentary on the Concluding Formula of the ''Professio Fidei''], by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.</ref><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm "Beatification and Canonization"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907, p. 366</ref>

===Equipollent canonization===

Popes have several times extended to the whole Church, without carrying out the ordinary judicial process of canonization described above, the veneration as a saint, the "[[cultus]]", of someone long venerated as such locally. This action by a Pope is known as equipollent canonization or "confirmation of [[cultus]]". According to the rules laid down by Pope Benedict XIV, there are three conditions for such a canonization: an ancient cultus, a general constant attestation by trustworthy historians to the virtues or martyrdom of the person, and an uninterrupted fame as a worker of miracles.

Pope Benedict XIV himself gave as examples the equipollent canonizations of the saints [[Romuald]] in 1595, [[Norbert]] in 1621, [[Bruno]] in 1623, [[Peter Nolasco]] in 1655, [[Raymond Nonnatus]] in 1681, [[Stephen of Hungary]] in 1686, [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Scotland]] in 1691), [[John of Matha]] and [[Felix of Valois]] in 1694, [[Pope Gregory VII]] in 1728, [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus of Bohemia]] in 1729, and [[Gertrude of Helfta]] in 1738. Later equipollent canonizations include those of [[Peter Damian]] and [[Boniface]] in 1828, [[Cyril and Methodius]] in 1880, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in 1920, [[Albert the Great]] in 1931, [[Margaret of Hungary (saint)|Margaret of Hungary]] in 1943, [[John of Ávila]] and [[Nikola Tavelić]] and his three companion martyrs in 1970, [[Marko Krizin]], [[István Pongrácz]] and [[Melchior Grodziecki]] in 1995, and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] in 2012. [[Pope Francis]] added [[Angela of Foligno]] on 9 October 2013.<ref>Angelo Amato, "La canonizzazione equipollente della mistica Angela da Foligno" in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (12 October 2013)</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/canonize.htm P.
