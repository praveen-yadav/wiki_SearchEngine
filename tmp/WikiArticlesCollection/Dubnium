{{Infobox dubnium}}
'''Dubnium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Db''' and [[atomic number]] 105, named after the town of [[Dubna]] in [[Russia]], where it was first produced. It is a [[synthetic element]] (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known [[isotope]], dubnium-268, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 28 hours.<ref>Physical experiments determined a half-life of ~16 h whilst chemical experiments provided a value of ~32 h. The half-life is often taken as ~28 h due to the higher number of atoms detected by chemical means</ref>

In the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] element and in the [[transactinide element]]s. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and belongs to [[group 5 element|Group 5]]. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that dubnium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[tantalum]] in group 5. The chemical properties of dubnium are characterized only partly. They are similar to those of other group 5 elements.

In the 1960s, microscopic amounts of dubnium were produced in laboratories in the former [[Soviet Union]] and in [[California]]. The priority of the discovery and therefore the [[Element naming controversy|naming of the element]] was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] established "dubnium" as the official name for the element.

==History==
===Discovery===
Dubnium was reportedly [[discovery of the chemical elements|first discovered]] in 1968 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] at [[Dubna]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]). Researchers there bombarded an [[americium-243]] target with [[neon-22]] [[ion]]s. They reported a 9.40 MeV and a 9.70 MeV alpha-activity and assigned the decays to the isotope <sup>260</sup>Db or <sup>261</sup>Db:

:{{Nuclide|americium|243}} + {{Nuclide|neon|22}} → {{Nuclide|dubnium|265−''x''}} + x {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}

Two years later the Dubna team separated their reaction products by thermal gradient chromatography  after conversion to chlorides by interaction with [[niobium pentachloride|NbCl<sub>5</sub>]]. The team identified a 2.2 second [[spontaneous fission]] activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, likely dubnium-261 pentachloride, <sup>261</sup>DbCl<sub>5</sub>.

In the same year, a team led by [[Albert Ghiorso]] working at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a [[californium-249]] target with [[nitrogen-15]] ions. The team published a convincing synthesis of <sup>260</sup>Db in the reaction between [[californium-249]] target and [[nitrogen-15]] ions and measured the alpha decay of <sup>260</sup>Db with a [[half-life]] of 1.6 seconds and a decay energy of 9.10 MeV, correlated with the daughter decay of [[lawrencium]]-256:

:{{Nuclide|californium|249}} + {{Nuclide|nitrogen|15}} → {{Nuclide|dubnium|260}} + 4 {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}

These results by the Berkeley scientists did not confirm the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] findings regarding the 9.40 MeV or 9.70 MeV alpha-decay of dubnium-260, leaving only dubnium-261 as possible produced isotope. In 1971, the Dubna team repeated their reaction using an improved set-up and were able to confirm the decay data for <sup>260</sup>Db using the reaction:

:{{Nuclide|americium|243}} + {{Nuclide|neon|22}} → {{Nuclide|dubnium|260}} + 5 {{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}

In 1976, the Dubna team continued their study of the reaction using thermal gradient chromatography and were able to identify the product as dubnium-260 pentabromide, <sup>260</sup>DbBr<sub>5</sub>.

In 1992 the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]/[[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|IUPAP]] Transfermium Working Group assessed the claims of the two groups and concluded that confidence in the discovery grew from results from both laboratories and the claim of discovery should be shared.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1351/pac199365081757}}</ref>

===Naming controversy===
{{main|Element naming controversy}}
{{multiple image
| footer = The element 105 was originally proposed to be named after [[Niels Bohr]] (left side), a [[Denmark|Danish]] nuclear physicist, with name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns) by the Soviet/Russian team. The American team initially proposed the element to be named after [[Otto Hahn]] (right side), a [[Germany|German]] chemist, known as a pioneer in the fields of [[radioactivity]] and [[radiochemistry]].

}}

The Soviet, later Russian, team proposed the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns) in honor of the Danish nuclear physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. The American team proposed that the new element should be named ''hahnium''  (Ha), in honor of the late [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Otto Hahn]]. Consequently ''hahnium'' was the name that most American and Western European scientists used and appears in many papers published at the time, and ''nielsbohrium'' was used in the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] countries.

An [[element naming controversy]] erupted between the two groups. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) thus adopted ''unnilpentium'' (Unp) as a temporary, [[systematic element name]]. Attempting to resolve the issue, in 1994, the IUPAC proposed the name ''joliotium'' (Jl), after the French physicist [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], which was originally proposed by Soviet team for element 102, later named [[nobelium]]. The two principal claimants still disagreed about the names of elements 104-106. However, in 1997 they resolved the dispute and adopted the current name, ''dubnium'' (Db), after the [[Russia]]n town of [[Dubna]], the location of the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]]. It was argued by IUPAC that the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times in the naming of elements (i.e., [[berkelium]], [[californium]], [[americium]]) and that the acceptance of the names ''[[rutherfordium]]'' and ''[[seaborgium]]'' for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing the Russian team's contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105 and 106.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994) | year=1994 | journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume=66 | pages=2419 | issue=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1351/pac199769122471|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997) | year=1997 | journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume=69 | pages=2471 | issue=12}}</ref>

==Chemical properties==
===Extrapolated properties===
Element 105 is projected to be the second member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group V in the Periodic Table, below [[vanadium]], [[niobium]] and [[tantalum]]. Because it is positioned right below tantalum, it may also be called ''eka-tantalum''. All the members of the group readily portray their oxidation state of +5 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus dubnium is expected to form a stable +5 state. For this group, +4 and +3 states are also known for the heavier members and dubnium may also form these reducing oxidation states.

In an extrapolation of the chemistries from [[niobium]] and [[tantalum]], dubnium should react with oxygen to form an inert pentoxide, Db<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. In alkali, the formation of an orthodubnate complex, {{chem|DbO|4|3-}}, is expected.
Reaction with the halogens should readily form the pentahalides, DbX<sub>5</sub>. The pentachlorides of niobium and tantalum exist as volatile solids or monomeric trigonal bipyramidal molecules in the vapour phase. Thus, DbCl<sub>5</sub> is expected to be a volatile solid. Similarly, the pentafluoride, DbF<sub>5</sub>, should be even more volatile.
Hydrolysis of the halides is known to readily form the oxyhalides, MOX<sub>3</sub>. Thus the halides DbX<sub>5</sub> should react with water to form DbOX<sub>3</sub>.
The reaction with fluoride ion is also well known for the lighter homologues and dubnium is expected to form a range of fluoro-complexes. In particular, reaction of the pentafluoride with HF should form a hexafluorodubnate ion, {{chem|DbF|6|-}}. Excess fluoride should lead to {{chem|Db|F|7|2-}} and {{chem|DbOF|5|2-}}. If eka-tantalum properties are portrayed, higher concentrations of fluoride should ultimately form {{chem|DbF|8|3-}} since {{chem|NbF|8|3-}} is not known.

===Experimental chemistry===
The chemistry of dubnium has been studied for several years using gas thermochromatography. The experiments have studied the relative adsorption characteristics of isotopes of [[niobium]], [[tantalum]] and dubnium radioisotopes. The results have indicated the formation of typical group 5 halides and oxyhalides, namely DbCl<sub>5</sub>, DbBr<sub>5</sub>, DbOCl<sub>3</sub> and DbOBr<sub>3</sub>. Reports on these early experiments usually refer to dubnium as hahnium.

==Nucleosynthesis history==
===Cold fusion===
''This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of dubnium by so-called "cold" fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at low excitation energy (~10-20 MeV, hence "cold"), leading to a higher probability of survival from fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of one or two neutrons only.''

;<sup>209</sup>Bi(<sup>50</sup>Ti,xn)<sup>259-x</sup>Db (x=1,2,3)
The first attempts to synthesise dubnium using cold fusion reactions were performed in 1976 by the team at FLNR, Dubna using the above reaction. They were able to detect a 5 s [[spontaneous fission]] (SF) activity which they assigned to <sup>257</sup>Db. This assignment was later corrected to <sup>258</sup>Db.
In 1981, the team at GSI studied this reaction using the improved technique of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays. They were able to positively identify <sup>258</sup>Db, the product from the 1n neutron evaporation channel.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF01412623}}</ref>
In 1983, the team at Dubna revisited the reaction using the method of identification of a descendant using chemical separation. They succeeded in measuring alpha decays from known descendants of the decay chain beginning with <sup>258</sup>Db. This was taken as providing some evidence for the formation of dubnium nuclei.
The team at GSI revisited the reaction in 1985 and were able to detect 10 atoms of <sup>257</sup>Db.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heßberger|first1=F.

After a significant upgrade of their facilities in 1993, in 2000 the team measured 120 decays of <sup>257</sup>Db, 16 decays of <sup>256</sup>Db and decay of <sup>258</sup>Db in the measurement of the 1n, 2n and 3n excitation functions.

;<sup>209</sup>Bi(<sup>49</sup>Ti,xn)<sup>258-x</sup>Db (x=2?)
This reaction was studied by Yuri Oganessian and the team at Dubna in 1983. They observed a 2.6 s SF activity tentatively assigned to <sup>256</sup>Db. Later results suggest a possible reassignment to <sup>256</sup>Rf, resulting from the ~30% EC branch in <sup>256</sup>Db.

;<sup>209</sup>Bi(<sup>48</sup>Ti,xn)<sup>257-x</sup>Db (x=1?)
This reaction was studied by Yuri Oganessian and the team at Dubna in 1983. They observed a 1.6 s activity with a ~80% alpha branch with a ~20% SF branch. The activity was tentatively assigned to <sup>255</sup>Db. Later results suggest a reassignment to <sup>256</sup>Db.

The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 and were again able to detect the 5 s SF activity, first tentatively assigned to <sup>257</sup>Db and later to <sup>258</sup>Db.
In 2006, the team at LBNL reinvestigated this reaction as part of their odd-Z projectile program.

The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 but this time they were unable to detect the 5 s SF activity, first tentatively assigned to <sup>257</sup>Db and later to <sup>258</sup>Db. Instead, they were able to measure a 1.5 s SF activity, tentatively assigned to <sup>255</sup>Db.

The team at Dubna also studied this reaction in 1976 and were again able to detect the 5 s SF activity, first tentatively assigned to <sup>257</sup>Db and later to <sup>258</sup>Db.

===Hot fusion===
''This section deals with the synthesis of nuclei of dubnium by so-called "hot" fusion reactions. These are processes which create compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40-50 MeV, hence "hot"), leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission and quasi-fission. The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 3-5 neutrons.''

;<sup>232</sup>Th(<sup>31</sup>P,xn)<sup>263-x</sup>Db (x=5)
There are very limited reports that this rare reaction using a P-31 beam was studied in 1989 by Andreyev et al. at the FLNR. One source suggests that no atoms were detected whilst a better source from the Russians themselves indicates that <sup>258</sup>Db was synthesised in the 5n channel with a yield of 120 pb.

;<sup>243</sup>Am(<sup>22</sup>Ne,xn)<sup>265-x</sup>Db (x=5)
The first attempts to synthesise dubnium were performed in 1968 by the team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR) in Dubna, Russia. They observed two alpha lines which they tentatively assigned to <sup>261</sup>Db and <sup>260</sup>Db.
They repeated their experiment in 1970 looking for [[spontaneous fission]]. They found a 2.2 s SF activity which they assigned to <sup>261</sup>Db.
In 1970, the Dubna team began work on using gradient thermochromatography in order to detect dubnium in chemical experiments as a volatile chloride. In their first run they detected a volatile SF activity with similar adsorption properties to NbCl<sub>5</sub> and unlike HfCl<sub>4</sub>. This was taken to indicate the formation of nuclei of dvi-niobium as DbCl<sub>5</sub>. In 1971, they repeated the chemistry experiment using higher sensitivity and observed alpha decays from an dvi-niobium component, taken to confirm the formation of <sup>260</sup>Db. The method was repeated in 1976 using the formation of bromides and obtained almost identical results, indicating the formation of a volatile, dvi-niobium-like DbBr<sub>5</sub>.

In 1988, scientists as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) used the asymmetric hot fusion reaction with an einsteinium-254 target to search for the new nuclides <sup>264</sup>Db and <sup>263</sup>Db. Due to the low sensitivity of the experiment caused by the small Es-254 target,they were unable to detect any evaporation residues (ER).

===Isomerism===
;<sup>260</sup>Db
Recent data on the decay of <sup>272</sup>Rg has revealed that some decay chains continue through <sup>260</sup>Db with extraordinary longer life-times than expected. These decays have been linked to an isomeric level decaying by alpha decay with a half-life of ~19 s. Further research is required to allow a definite assignment.

;<sup>258</sup>Db
Evidence for an isomeric state in <sup>258</sup>Db has been gathered from the study of the decay of <sup>266</sup>Mt and <sup>262</sup>Bh. It has been noted that those decays assigned to an electron capture (EC) branch has a significantly different half-life to those decaying by alpha emission. This has been taken to suggest the existence of an isomeric state decaying by EC with a half-life of ~20 s. Further experiments are required to confirm this assignment.

;<sup>257</sup>Db
A study of the formation and decay of <sup>257</sup>Db has proved the existence of an isomeric state. Initially, <sup>257</sup>Db was taken to decay by alpha emission with energies 9.16,9.07 and 8.97 MeV. A measurement of the correlations of these decays with those of <sup>253</sup>Lr have shown that the 9.16 MeV decay belongs to a separate isomer. Analysis of the data in conjunction with theory have assigned this activity to a meta stable state, <sup>257m</sup>Db. The ground state decays by alpha emission with energies 9.07 and 8.97 MeV. Spontaneous fission of <sup>257m,g</sup>Db was not confirmed in recent experiments.

===Spectroscopic decay level schemes===

[[Image:257Db decay scheme.png|thumb|325px|none|This is the currently suggested decay level scheme for <sup>257</sup>Db<sup>g,m</sup> from the study performed in 2001 by Hessberger et al. at GSI]]

===Retracted isotopes===
;<sup>255</sup>Db
In 1983, scientists at [[Dubna]] carried out a series of supportive experiments in their quest for the discovery of [[Bohrium]]. In two such experiments, they claimed they had detected a ~1.5 s [[spontaneous fission]] activity from the reactions <sup>207</sup>Pb(<sup>51</sup>V,xn) and <sup>209</sup>Bi(<sup>48</sup>Ti,xn). The activity was assigned to <sup>255</sup>Db. Later research suggested that the assignment should be changed to <sup>256</sup>Db. As such, the isotope <sup>255</sup>Db is currently not recognised on the chart of radionuclides and further research is required to confirm this isotope.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}
