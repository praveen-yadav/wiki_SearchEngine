'''Atomic semantics''' is a term which describes the guarantees provided by a [[data register]] shared by several [[central processing unit|processors]] in a [[parallel machine]] or in a network of computers working together.

Atomic semantics are defined for a variable with a single writer but multiple readers. These
semantics are very strong: they guarantee that the read and write operations to the variable behave exactly as if they happened instantaneously in some point in time which is within the actual time where the operation took place.
