'''Christoph Ludwig Agricola''' (November 5, 1667 – August 8, 1719) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Landscape art|landscape painter]]. He was born and died at [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon).

He trained as a painter in his native country. He  spent a great part of his life in travel, visiting England, the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], and residing for a considerable period at [[Naples]].

His numerous landscapes, chiefly cabinet pictures, are remarkable for fidelity to nature, and especially for their skilful representation of varied phases of climate.  In composition his style shows the influence of [[Nicolas Poussin]], while in light and colour he imitates [[Claude Lorrain]]. He stayed for some years circa 1712 in [[Venice]], where he painted many works for the patron [[Zaccaria Sagredo]].<ref>Boni, Page 8</ref>

His pictures can be found in [[Dresden]], [[Braunschweig]], [[Vienna]], [[Florence]], Naples and many other towns of both Germany and [[Italy]].
