{{Capitalism}}
'''Crony capitalism''' is a term describing an economy in which success in business depends on close relationships between business people and government officials.  It may be exhibited by favoritism in the distribution of legal permits, government grants, special [[tax break]]s, or other forms of [[dirigisme]].<ref>{{cite web

Crony capitalism is believed to arise when political [[cronyism]] spills over into the business world; [[self-serving]] friendships and family ties between businessmen and the government influence the economy and society to the extent that it corrupts [[public good|public-serving]] economic and political ideals.

The term "crony capitalism" made a significant impact in the public arena as an explanation of the [[Asian financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Crony Capitalism: Corruption and Development in South Korea and the Philippines |first=David C. |last=Kang |year=2002 |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/2001025806.pdf |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-00408-4
|quote=Focused only on explaining successful outcomes, the conventional model provided no analytic way to explain the 1997 crisis. Countries previously regarded as miracles now were nothing more than havens for crony capitalists (p.3)}}</ref>  It is also used world wide to describe virtually any governmental decisions favoring "cronies" of governmental officials.  In many cases, the term is used interchangeably with [[corporate welfare]];  to the extent that there is a difference, the latter might be restricted only to direct government subsidies of major corporations, excluding tax loopholes and all manner of regulatory and trade decisions, which in practice could be much larger than any direct subsidies.

==Crony capitalism in practice==

In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of [[collusion]] among market players. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front (sometimes called a trade association or [[industry trade group]]) to the government in requesting subsidies or aid or regulation.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> Newcomers to a market may find it difficult to find loans, acquire shelf space, or receive official sanction (like the Medallion System of the [[Taxicabs of New York City]] created during the [[Great Depression]]) to sell their product or services; in technological fields, they may be accused of infringing on [[patent]]s that the established competitors never assert against each other. Distribution networks will refuse to aid the entrant. In spite of this, some competitors will succeed when the legal [[Barriers to entry|barriers]] are light, especially where the old guard has become inefficient and is failing to meet the needs of the market. Of course, some of these upstarts may then join with the established networks to help deter any other new competitors. Examples of this have been argued to include the ''[[keiretsu]]'' of post-war Japan, the print media in India, the ''[[chaebol]]'' of South Korea, and the powerful families who control much of the investment in [[Latin America]].

However, crony capitalism is generally associated with more virulent government intervention. Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business; in practice, they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. Troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have the laws suddenly enforced against them, leading to fines or even jail time. Even in high-income democracies with well established legal systems and freedom of the press a larger state is associated with more political corruption (including crony capitalism).<ref>Hamilton , Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.</ref>

==Cronyism in sections of an economy==
{{POV-section|date=November 2012}}

More direct government involvement can lead to specific areas of crony capitalism, even if the economy as a whole may be healthy. Governments will, often in good faith, establish government agencies to regulate an industry. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of a regulatory body, while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected. As a result, it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the "watchdog" and use it against competitors. This phenomenon, known as [[regulatory capture]], has a long history.

A [[Gibbons_v._Ogden#Background|1824 landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling]] overturned a New York State-granted monopoly ("a veritable model of state munificence" facilitated by one of the [[Founding Fathers]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]]) for the then-revolutionary technology of [[North River Steamboat|steamboats]].<ref>{{cite book |first=T.J. |last=Styles  |title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]

Two distinct levels of wealth were required to vote, one for state assembly, and a second and higher level for the state senators and governor... [this [[suffrage]] scheme fostered] [[mercantilism]], which in the state empowered private parties to carry out activities thought to serve the public interest. The standard reward for such an undertaking was a [[monopoly]]—just what Chancellor Livingston sought when he offered to meet a most pressing public need, the need for steamboats...Livingston maneuvered...the monopoly through the legislature ("a veritable model of state munificence," as legal scholar Maurice G. Baxter writes—that gave him the right to seize steamboats the entered New York waters from other states. But Livingston had overreached.

The [[military-industrial complex]] in the United States is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry. Connections with [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] and lobbyists in Washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition, due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts.  In the [[Transatlantic relations#Boeing and Airbus subsidies|Airbus-Boeing WTO dispute]], Airbus (which receives outright [[subsidy|subsidies]] from European governments) has stated Boeing receives similar subsidies, which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pulling Boeing Out of a Tailspin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862121_mz029.htm |work=[[Business Week]] |quote=A national treasure, once No. 1 in commercial aviation, Boeing has become a risk-averse company stumbling to compete in the marketplace and dependent on political connections and chicanery to get government contracts.

==Creation of crony capitalism in developing economies==

In its worst form, crony capitalism can devolve into simple [[Political corruption|corruption]], where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with. Bribes to government officials are considered ''de rigueur'' and [[tax evasion]] is common; this is seen in many parts of Africa, for instance.  This is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).

Corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others. This may also be done with racial, religious, or ethnic favoritism; for instance, [[Alawites]] in [[Syria]] have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there. ([[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] is an Alawite.)<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01makhlouf.html?_r=1&hp Syrian Businessman Becomes Magnet for Anger and Dissent] "Like Mr. Ezz in Egypt, he has become a symbol of how economic reforms turned crony socialism into crony capitalism, making the poor poorer and the connected rich fantastically wealthier."</ref> This can be explained by considering personal relationships as a [[social network]]. As government and business leaders try to accomplish various things, they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors. These people form hubs in the network. In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.

Normally, this will be untenable to maintain in business; new entrants will affect the market. However, if business and government are entwined, then the government can maintain the small-hub network.

wrote that the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain]], because they were the first to successfully limit the power of veto groups (typically cronies of those with power in government) to block innovations.<ref>Vernon (1989)</ref>  "Unlike most other national environments, the British environment of the early 19th century contained relatively few threats to those who improved and applied existing inventions, whether from business competitors, labor, or the government itself.  In other European countries, by contrast, the merchant guilds ... were a pervasive source of veto for many centuries.  This power was typically bestowed upon them by government".  For example, a Russian inventor produced a steam engine in 1766 and disappeared without a trace.  "[A] steam powered horseless carriage produced in France in 1769 was officially suppressed."  [[James Watt]] began experimenting with steam in 1763, got a patent in 1769, and began commercial production in 1775.<ref>Vernon (1989, p. 8);  see also [[Watt steam engine]] and [[James Watt#Patents|James Watt]]</ref>

Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]]'s book ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]'' provides an even broader perspective:  For as far back as we can see in the historical and archaeological record, argues Graeber, people with wealth and power, typically a monarch and cronies, have written the rules to benefit them at the expense of others.  The situation would deteriorate for common folk until it was interrupted by a peasant revolt.  Then the cycle would start over again.

==Political viewpoints==

Critics of capitalism including [[socialism|socialists]] and other [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]] often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of ''any'' capitalist system. [[Jane Jacobs]] described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[trade]], while [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that the word "crony" is superfluous when describing capitalism.<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081114.htm "Black Faces in Limousines:" A Conversation with Noam Chomsky] from Chomsky.info accessed on June 5, 2009</ref> Since businesses make money and money leads to political power, business will inevitably use their power to influence governments. Much of the impetus behind [[campaign finance reform]] in the United States and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power.

[[Ravi Batra]] argues that "all official economic measures adopted since 1981...have devastated the middle class" and that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement should push for their repeal and thus end the influence of the super wealthy in the political process, which he considers a manifestation of crony capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474 |title=The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism |first=Ravi |last=Batra |publisher=[[Truthout]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref>

Socialist economists, such as [[Robin Hahnel]], have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Let's Review |url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/bpn/znet/april08.txt |author=[[Robin Hahnel]] |quote=IMF officials Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer were quick to explain that the afflicted economies had only themselves to blame. Crony capitalism, lack of transparency, accounting procedures not up to international standards, and weak-kneed politicians too quick to spend and too afraid to tax were the problems according to IMF and US Treasury Department officials. The fact that the afflicted economies had been held up as paragons of virtue and IMF/World Bank success stories only a year before, the fact that neoliberalism’s only success story had been the Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC's) who were now in the tank, and the fact that the IMF and Treasury department story just didn’t fit the facts since the afflicted economies were no more rife with crony capitalism, lack of transparency, and weak-willed politicians than dozens of other economies untouched by the Asian financial crisis, simply did not matter.}}</ref> Socialist economists dismiss the term as an apologetic for failures of neoliberal policy and, more fundamentally, their perception of the weaknesses of market allocation.
