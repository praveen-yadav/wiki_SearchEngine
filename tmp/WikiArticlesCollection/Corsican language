'''Corsican''' (''corsu'' or ''lingua corsa'') is an [[Italo-Dalmatian|Italo-Dalmatian Romance language]] spoken and written on the islands of [[Corsica]] ([[France]]) and northern [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]). Corsican was long the [[Vernacular|vernacular language]] alongside [[Italian language|Italian]], official language in Corsica until 1859: afterwards Italian was replaced by [[French language|French]], owing to the acquisition of the island by France from Genoa in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The twentieth century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1990, an estimated 50% of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a small minority, perhaps 10%, used Corsican as a first language.<ref name=cif>{{cite web|title=Corsican in France|url=http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=2008-06-13}} To access the data, click on List by languages, Corsican, Corsican in France, then scroll to ''Geographical and language background''.</ref>

== Number of speakers ==
The January 2007 estimated population of the island was 281,000, while the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies – though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article – were performed, was about 261,000 (see under [[Corsica]]). Only a fraction of the population at either time spoke Corsican with any fluency.

The use of Corsican over French has been declining. In 1980 about 70% of the population "had some command of the Corsican language".<ref>{{cite web|title=Corsican language use survey|url=http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/homean/index1.html|publisher=Euromosaic|accessdate=2008-06-13}} To find this statement and the supporting data click on List by languages, Corsican, Corsican language use survey and look under ''INTRODUCTION''.</ref> In 1990 out of a total population of about 254,000 the percentage had declined to 50%, with only 10% using it as a first language.<ref name=cif/>  (These figures do not count varieties of Corsican spoken in Sardinia.)  The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its unsupportive stand and began some strong measures to save it.

[[UNESCO]] classifies Corsican as a ''potentially endangered language'', as it has "a large number of children speakers" but is "without an official or prestigious status".<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Red Book on Endagered Languages: Europe:|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/europe_index.html|first=Tapani|last=Salminen|date=1993-1999|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref> The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in [[proverb]]s and in [[polyphony|polyphonic]] song.

== Governmental support ==
The 1991 "Joxe Statute", in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the [[Corsican Assembly]], and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsican. The [[University of Corsica Pascal Paoli]] at [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] took a central role in the planning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Insular Autonomy: A Framework for Conflict Settlement?

At the primary school level Corsican is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level,<ref>(French) [http://www.ac-corse.fr/lcc_20/file/1890/ Dispositif académique d’enseignement de la langue corse dans le premier degré, année scolaire 2010-2011], Academy of Corsica</ref> but is required at the University of Corsica. It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the Corsican Assembly advocates for its use; for example, on public signs.

[[Ferdinand Gregorovius]], 19th century traveller and enthusiast of Corsican culture, reports that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the ''vocero'', a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 18th century Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi.<ref>{{cite book|pages=275–312|title=Corsica in Its Picturesque, Social, and Historical Aspects: the Records of a Tour in the Summer of 1852|first=Ferndinand|last=Gregorovius|authorlink=Ferdinand Gregorovius|coauthors=Russell Martineau (Translator)|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans|location=London|year=1855}}</ref>

The trail of written popular literature of known date in Corsican currently goes no further back than the 17th century.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Corsican Language|url=http://www.transcript-review.org/section.cfm?id=227&lan=en|journal=Transcript|first=Francis (Translator)|last=Beretti|issue=17|year=2008|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under ''External links'' below). Corsican has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on Corsica and many of the churchmen were [[Notary|notaries]].

Between 1200 and 1425 the monastery of [[Gorgona, Italy|Gorgona]], [[Benedictine]] for much of that time and in the territory of [[Pisa]], acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts written on Corsica. As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with Corsican ones there the legal language shows a transition from entirely [[Latin language|Latin]] through partially Latin, partially Corsican to entirely Corsican. The first known surviving document containing some Corsican is a bill of sale from [[Patrimonio]] dated to 1220.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/CID2003/scalfati |title=Latin et langue vernaculaire dans les actes notariés corses XIe-XVe siècle |last1=Scalfati |first1=Silio P.

Research into earlier evidence of Corsican is ongoing.

== Origins ==
The Corsican language has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the Medieval Italian powers: [[Tuscany]] (828–1077), [[Pisa]] (1077–1282) and [[Genoa]] (1282–1768), more recently by France (1768–present), which, since 1789, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term ''gallicised Corsican'' refers to Corsican up to about the year 1950. The term ''distanciated Corsican'' refers to an idealized Corsican from which various agents have removed French or other elements.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Corsican distanciation strategies: Language purification or misguided attempts to reverse the gallicisation process?|first=Robert J.|last=Blackwood|journal=Multilingua – Journal of Cross-Cultural and Interlanguage Communication|volume=23|issue=3|pages=233–255|date=August 2004|format=PDF|url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/mult.2004.011?cookieSet=1|accessdate=2008-06-13|doi=10.1515/mult.2004.011}}</ref>

The general classification of Corsican as a Romance language allows two possibilities as to the identity of the speakers of the first distinct Corsican, or Proto-Corsican. They created the language either from Proto-Romance or from a subsequent Romance language.

In 40 AD neither a Romance nor an Italic language were spoken by the natives of Corsica. The Roman exile, [[Seneca the younger]], reports that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he did not understand (see under [[Prehistory of Corsica#Ligurian hypothesis|Prehistory of Corsica]]). Latin at that time was generally spoken only in the Roman colonies. There was probably a substratic language that is still visible in the toponymy or in some words, for instance [[Gallurese]] ''zerru'' 'pig'. The same is valid for [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]. The occupation of the island by [[Vandals]] about 469 AD marks the end of authoritative influence by Latin-speaking Romans (see under [[Medieval Corsica]]). If the natives of that time were speaking Latin they must have acquired it during the late empire. The documents of the early Christian church concerning Corsica are in Latin, but they are only communications between church officials (see under [[Ajaccio#History|Ajaccio]]).

The next window of opportunity for the predecessor of a Proto-Corsican was the administration of Corsica by [[Tuscany]], then speaking the [[Tuscan dialect]], an immediate predecessor of Italian. The first [[History of Italian|Italian]] documents date from the 10th century but Italian must have developed earlier and Tuscan even earlier. Tuscan would have come from the latest phases of [[Vulgar Latin]]; Proto-Corsican from the Tuscan spoken on Corsica.

The last historical possibility is that Proto-Corsican came from the Tuscan dialect of [[Pisa]]; its period of Corsican administration, however, was relatively short. Genoese is not a likely possibility as Corsican is attested before the presence of [[Genoa]] on Corsica, and the linguistic features of Corsican do not match well with those of Genoese. Historical circumstances alone reduce the window of opportunity only to within several hundred years.

== Classification by subjective analysis ==
One of the main sources of confusion in popular classifications is the difference between a [[dialect]] and a [[language]]. Typically it is not possible to ascertain what an author means by these terms. For example, one might read that Corsican is a "central southern [[Regional Italian|Italian dialect]]" along with [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and others<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560079/italian_language.html|title=Italian Language|publisher=Encarta|accessdate=2008-06-13|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwaudYBC|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> or that it is "closely related to the Tuscan dialect of Italian,",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurolang.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72&Itemid=52&lang=en|title=Eurolang report on Corsican|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref> an infelicitous claim in that Italian is derived from Tuscan rather than the reverse.

One of the characteristics of Italian, but not of modern Tuscan, is the retention of the -''re'' infinitive ending as in Latin ''mittere'', "send", which is lost in Corsican (and in modern Tuscan), which has ''mette''/''metta'', "to put." The Latin relative pronoun, "who," "qui," "quae," and "what," "quod," are [[inflected]] in Latin, while relative pronoun in Italian for "who" and "what" is "che" and in Corsican is uninflected ''chì."

== Dialects in Corsica ==
The two most widely spoken forms of the Corsican language are ''Supranacciu'', spoken in the [[Bastia]] and [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] area (generally throughout the [[Haute-Corse|northern half]] of the island), and ''Suttanacciu'', spoken around [[Sartène]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]] (generally throughout the [[Corse-du-Sud|southern half]] of the island). The dialect of [[Ajaccio]] has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at [[Calvi, Haute-Corse|Calvi]] and [[Bonifacio, Corse-du-Sud|Bonifacio]] are closer to the [[Genoa]] dialect, also known as [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]].

[[Image:Gallurese.png|right|thumb|250px|Languages in northern [[Sardinia]]]]
On [[Maddalena archipelago]] the local dialect (called ''Isulanu, Maddaleninu, Maddalenino'') was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio during immigration in the 17th-18th centuries. Though influenced by [[Gallurese]] it has maintained the original characteristics of Corsican. There are also numerous words of [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] and [[Ponza|Ponzese]] origin.<ref name=ethn>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=cos|title=Corsican|accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>

== Corsican in Sardinia ==
{{Main|Gallurese|Sassarese language}}
[[Gallurese]] is spoken in the extreme north of [[Sardinia]], including the region of [[Gallura]] and the archipelago of [[La Maddalena]]. [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] is spoken in [[Sassari]] and in its neighbourhood, in the north-west of [[Sardinia]]. Whether these two languages should be included in Corsican as dialects, included in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] as dialects, or considered as independent languages, is debatable.

Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26, October 15, 1997, of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia grants "''al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese''" equal legal status with the other languages on [[Sardinia]]. They are thus legally defined as different languages from [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] by the Sardinian government.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&c=72&s=1&file=1997026|title= Legge Regionale 15 ottobre 1997, n. 26|accessdate=2008-06-16|author=Autonomous Region of Sardinia|date=1997-10-15|pages=Art. 2, paragraph 4}} {{it icon}}</ref>

== Alphabet and spelling ==
{{Main|Corsican alphabet}}
Corsican is written in the standard [[Latin script]], using 22 of the letters for native words. The letters k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names and French vocabulary. The multigraphs '''chj''', '''ghj''', '''sc''', and '''sg''' are also defined as "letters" of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of ''ch'' or ''ll'' in the Spanish alphabet), and appear respectively after c, g, and s.

The primary diacritic used is the [[grave accent]], indicating word stress when not [[penult]]imate. In scholarly contexts [[Syllable|disyllables]] may be distinguished from [[diphthongs]] by use of the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] on the ''first'' of the two vowels (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing the [[acute accent]] is sometimes found on stressed {{angle bracket|e}}, and [[circumflex]] on stressed {{angle bracket|o}}, indicating respectively the Close E ({{IPA|/e/}}) and Close O ({{IPA|/o/}}) phonemes.

Corsican has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similarly to the regional Romance languages in Italy proper, and in writing often resembles Italian (with the substitution of -u for final -o, and the articles ''u'' and ''a'' for ''il/lo'' and ''la'' respectively). However the phonemes of the modern spoken forms of Corsican undergo complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, thus pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowel inventory ===
As in Italian, the grapheme {{angle bracket|i}} appears in some [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. {{angle bracket|i}} is not pronounced before {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} after {{angle bracket|sc}}, {{angle bracket|sg}}, {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}}: ''sciarpa'' {{IPA|[ˈʃarpa]}}; or initially in some words: ''istu'' {{IPA|[ˈstu]}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=La prononciation des voyelles|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gbatti-alinguacorsa/|publisher=A Lingua Corsa|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>

Vowels may be nasalized before {{angle bracket|n}} (which is assimilated to {{angle bracket|m}} before {{angle bracket|p}} or {{angle bracket|b}}) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by {{angle bracket|gn}}. The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|m}} or {{angle bracket|gn}}. The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: {{angle bracket|pane}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈpãnɛ]}} and not {{IPA|[ˈpanɛ]}}.

The vowel inventory, or collection of phonemic vowels (and the major allophones), transcribed in [[IPA]] symbols, is:<ref name=omni/><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes sur la phonétique utilisée sur ce site|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/gbatti-alinguacorsa/|publisher=A Lingua Corsa|date=April 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>
