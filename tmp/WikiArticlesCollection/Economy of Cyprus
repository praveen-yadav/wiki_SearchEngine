The '''economy of [[Cyprus]]''' is classified by the [[World Bank]] as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups#High_income|title=Country and Lending Groups|publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref> and was included by the [[International Monetary Fund]] in its list of [[developed country|advanced economies]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2001/01/data/index.htm#changes|title=World Economic Outlook Database May 2001|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref> Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflected the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe. The economic situation is expected to get worse in 2014.

On 1 January 2008, the country entered the [[eurozone]] and adopted the euro as its official currency, replacing the [[Cypriot pound]] at an irrevocable fixed exchange rate of CYP 0.585274 per EUR 1.00.

The [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]], part of the wider [[Eurozone crisis]], has dominated the country's economic affairs in recent times. In March 2013, the Cypriot government reached an agreement with its [[Eurogroup]] partners to split the country's second biggest bank, the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] (also known as Laiki Bank), into a "bad" bank which would be wound down over time and a "good" bank which would be absorbed by the larger [[Bank of Cyprus]]. In return for a €10 billion [[bailout]] from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the International Monetary Fund, the Cypriot government would be required to impose a significant [[haircut (finance)|haircut]] on [[deposit insurance|uninsured deposits]], a large proportion of which were held by wealthy [[Russia]]ns who used Cyprus as a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{cite news|title=As Banks in Cyprus Falter, Other Tax Havens Step In|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/business/global/as-banks-in-cyprus-falter-other-tax-havens-step-in.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 March 2013}}</ref> Insured deposits of €100,000 or less would not be affected.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eurogroup Statement on Cyprus|url=http://eurozone.europa.eu/newsroom/news/2013/03/eg-statement-cyprus-25-03-13/|publisher=[[Eurogroup]]|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=25 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=ReutersNewdeal>{{cite news |author=Jan Strupczewski |author2=Annika Breidthardt |title=Last-minute Cyprus deal to close bank, force losses |publisher=Reuters |date=25 March 2013 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-cyprus-parliament-idUSBRE92G03I20130325 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=Ekathimerini>{{cite news |title=Eurogroup signs off on bailout agreement reached by Cyprus and troika |newspaper=Ekathimerini |location=Greece |date=25 March 2013 |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_25/03/2013_489702 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>

==Economy in the government-controlled area==
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Cyprus.jpeg|thumb|350px|An graph of Cypriot exports.]]
Cyprus has an [[open economy|open]], [[market economy|free-market]], [[service economy|service-based]] economy with some light [[manufacturing]]. Internationally, Cyprus promotes its geographical location as a "bridge" between [[Eastern world|East]] and West, along with its educated English-speaking population, moderate local costs, good airline connections, and telecommunications.

Since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, Cyprus has had a record of successful economic performance, reflected in strong growth, full employment conditions and relative stability. The underdeveloped agrarian economy inherited from colonial rule has been transformed into a modern economy, with dynamic services, industrial and agricultural sectors and an advanced physical and social infrastructure. The Cypriots are among the most prosperous people in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region, with GDP per capita surpassing $26,000 in 2012.<ref name="IMF GDP" />

Their [[standard of living]] is reflected in the country's "very high" [[Human Development Index]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Development Index (HDI) - 2011 Rankings|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> and Cyprus is ranked 23rd in the world in terms of the [[Quality-of-life Index]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Economist Intelligence Unit’s quality-of-life index|url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf|publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]]|accessdate=2 August 2011|format=PDF|year=2005}}</ref> 
However, after more than three decades of unbroken growth, the Cypriot economy contracted in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1980&ey=2016&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=423&s=NGDP_RPCH&grp=0&a=|work=World Economic Outlook Database, April 2011|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref> This reflected the exposure of Cyprus to the global [[late-2000s recession|recession]] and [[European sovereign debt crisis]]. In recent times, concerns have been raised about the state of public finances and spiralling borrowing costs. Furthermore, Cyprus was dealt a severe blow by the [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion]] in July 2011, with the cost to the economy estimated at €1–3&nbsp;billion, or up to 17% of GDP.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kambas|first=Michele|title=Cyprus too slow in making cuts|url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/cyprus-too-slow-making-cuts/20110730|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]]|date=30 July 2011|location=Nicosia}}</ref>

The economic achievements of Cyprus during the preceding decades have been significant, bearing in mind the severe economic and social dislocation created by the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of 1974 and the continuing occupation of the northern part of the island by [[Turkey]]. The Turkish invasion inflicted a serious blow to the Cyprus economy and in particular to agriculture, [[Tourism in Cyprus|tourism]], mining and quarrying: 70 percent of the island’s wealth-producing resources were lost, the tourist industry lost 65 percent of its hotels and tourist accommodation, the industrial sector lost 46 percent, and mining and quarrying lost 56 percent of production. The loss of the port of [[Famagusta]], which handled 83 percent of the general cargo, and the closure of Nicosia International Airport, in the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|buffer zone]], were additional setbacks.

The success of Cyprus in the economic sphere has been attributed, ''inter alia'', to the adoption of a market-oriented economic system, the pursuance of sound macroeconomic policies by the government as well as the existence of a dynamic and flexible entrepreneurship and a highly educated labor force. Moreover, the economy benefited from the close cooperation between the public and private sectors.

In the past 30 years, the economy has shifted from agriculture to light manufacturing and services. The services sector, including tourism, contributes almost 80% to GDP and employs more than 70% of the labor force. Industry and construction account for approximately one-fifth of GDP and labor, while agriculture is responsible for 2.1% of GDP and 8.5% of the labor force. Potatoes and citrus are the principal export crops.

[[File:Cranes Limassol Harbour 20110703.jpg|thumb|250px|The port of [[Limassol]], the busiest in Cyprus.]]
After robust growth rates in the 1980s (average annual growth was 6.1%), economic performance in the 1990s was mixed: real GDP growth was 9.7% in 1992, 1.7% in 1993, 6.0% in 1994, 6.0% in 1995, 1.9% in 1996 and 2.3% in 1997. This pattern underlined the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (i.e., to economic and political conditions in Cyprus, Western Europe, and the Middle East) and the need to diversify the economy. Declining competitiveness in tourism and especially in manufacturing are expected to act as a drag on growth until structural changes are effected. Overvaluation of the Cypriot pound prior to the adoption of the euro in 2008 had kept inflation in check.

Trade is vital to the Cypriot economy—the island is not self-sufficient in food and until the recent [[Aphrodite gas field|offshore gas discoveries]] had few known natural resources—and the trade deficit continues to grow. Cyprus must import fuels, most raw materials, heavy machinery, and transportation equipment. More than 50% of its trade is with the rest of the European Union, especially [[Greece]] and the United Kingdom, while the Middle East receives 20% of exports. In 1991, Cyprus introduced a [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT), which is currently 15% in line with the EU minimum. Cyprus ratified the new world trade agreement ([[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], GATT) in 1995 and began implementing it fully on 1 January 1996.

[[File:Cyprusgrapefarm.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[vineyard]] in the [[Troodos Mountains]]. The agricultural sector continues to employ a significant proportion of the labor force.]]
EU accession negotiations started on 31 March 1998, and concluded when Cyprus joined the organization as a full member in 2004. 

[[File:Bank of Cyprus new and huge offices in Aglandjia suberb of Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bank of Cyprus]] offices in [[Aglandjia]], [[Nicosia]].]]
Cyprus has the fourth-largest [[Cyprus Merchant Marine|ship registry]] in the world, with 2,758 ships and 25.5&nbsp;million [[Gross Register Tonnage|gross registered tons]] (GRTs). It is an open registry and includes ships from more than 43 countries, including [[Greece]], Germany, and [[Russia]].

===Investment climate===
The Cyprus [[legal system]] is founded on [[English law]], and is therefore familiar to most [[international financiers]]. Cyprus's [[legislation]] was aligned with EU norms in the period leading up to [[EU accession]] in 2004. Restrictions on foreign direct investment were removed, permitting 100% foreign ownership in many cases. Foreign portfolio investment in the [[Cyprus Stock Exchange]] was also liberalized.<ref name="ft.com">[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e2899694-4eb4-11dc-85e7-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz2A6usbMmz Cyprus will continue to fight against money laundering] FT.com August 20, 2007</ref>

In 2002 a modern, business-friendly tax system was put in place with a 10% corporate tax rate, the lowest in the EU. Cyprus has concluded treaties on [[double taxation]] with more than 40 countries, and, as a member of the [[Eurozone]], has no exchange restrictions. Non-residents and foreign investors may freely repatriate proceeds from investments in Cyprus.<ref name="ft.com"/>

==Role as a financial hub==
As a result of the reforms in the past decade Cyprus has developed into one of the world's more important international business centers.<ref>[http://www.cysec.gov.cy/existing_laws_en.aspx CySEC Legal Framework] CySEC.com.cy April 20, 2001</ref> In the years following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] it gained great popularity as a portal for investment from the West into [[Russia]] and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/21525458 The midget and the mighty] Economist.com August, 06 2012</ref> 

More recently, although Russia and Eastern Europe remain the most important investment destinations, there have been increasing investment flows from the West through Cyprus into [[Asia]] (particularly [[China]] and [[India]]), [[South America]] and the [[Middle East]]. In addition, businesses from outside the EU use Cyprus as their entry-point for investment into Europe. The [[Business service provider|business services]] sector was the fastest growing sector of the economy, and had overtaken all other sectors in importance before the financial crisis imposed haircuts on large bank depositors. [[Cyprus Investment Promotion Agency|CIPA]] has been fundamental towards this trend.<ref>[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/investments/investments-worth-billions-pipeline/20120913 Investments worth Billions in the Pipeline] Cyprus-Mail - September 13, 2012</ref>

==Role as an energy hub==
The eastern Mediterranean is home to vast reserves of natural gas. [[Noble Energy]] has already got promising results from the [[Leviathan gas field]], off the coast of [[Israel]] (and edging into an area claimed by Lebanon), and is now drilling in the waters just south of Cyprus. Hence plenty of optimistic talk at the conference of co-operation between Cyprus and Israel to construct [[List of LNG terminals|LNG terminals]] or a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] to transmit gas to energy-hungry Europe in competition with the network of pipelines, actual or proposed, from Russia and central Asia.<ref name="Oil and gas for Cyprus and Israel">[http://www.economist.com/blogs/theworldin2012/2011/11/oil-and-gas-cyprus-and-israel Oil and gas for Cyprus and Israel] Economist.com November 15, 2011</ref><ref name="offshore-technology.com">[http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel/ Leviathan Gas Field, Levantine Basin, Mediterranean Sea, Israel] Offshore-Technology.com October 23, 2012</ref>

Noble Energy apparently reckons a pipeline could be in operation as soon as 2014 or 2015.<ref name="Oil and gas for Cyprus and Israel"/><ref name="offshore-technology.com"/> Surveys suggest more than 100 trillion cubic feet (2.831 trillion cubic metres) of [[Natural gas by country|reserves]] lie untapped in the eastern Mediterranean basin between Cyprus and [[Israel]] - almost equal to the world's total annual consumption of natural gas.<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/06/energy-cyprus-gas-idINL6E8I63R920120706 Cyprus hopes gas export income will flow by 2019] Reuters.com July, 06 2012</ref>

==Role as a Shipping hub==
Cyprus constitutes one of the largest [[Ship management]] centers in the world; around 50 shipmanagement companies and marine-related foreign enterprises are conducting their international activities in the country while the majority of the largest ship management companies in the world have established fully fledged offices on the island.<ref>[http://www.cyprusshipping.com/limassol-shipping-companies.html Limassol Based Shipping Companies] CyprusShipping.com</ref> Its geographical position at the crossroads of three continents and its proximity to the [[Suez canal]] has promoted [[Cyprus Merchant Marine|merchant shipping]] as an important industry for the island nation.

===Trade===
In 2008 fiscal aggregate value of goods and services exported by Cyprus was in region of $1.53 billion. It primarily exported goods and services such as citrus fruits, cement, potatoes, clothing and pharmaceuticals. At that same period total financial value of goods and services imported by Cyprus was about $8.689 billion. Prominent goods and services imported by Cyprus in 2008 were consumer goods, machinery, petroleum and other lubricants, transport equipment and intermediate goods.

====Cyprus export and import partners====
Traditionally Greece has been major export and import partner of Cyprus. In 2007 fiscal it amounted for 21.1 percent of total exports of Cyprus. At that same period it was responsible for 17.7 percent of goods and services imported by Cyprus. Some other important names in this regard are UK and Italy.

==Eurozone crisis==
{{Main|2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis}}

In 2012, Cyprus became affected by the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|Eurozone financial and banking crisis]]. In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need €{{Nowrap|1.8 billion}} of foreign aid to support the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]], and this was followed by [[Fitch Group|Fitch]] down-grading Cyprus's credit rating to [[junk status]].<ref name=BBCJune>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18577983 |title=Cyprus's credit rating cut to junk status by Fitch |author= |date=25 June 2012 |work= |publisher=BBC News Online |accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref> Fitch said Cyprus would need an additional €{{Nowrap|4 billion}} to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of [[Bank of Cyprus]], [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] and [[Hellenic Bank]] (Cyprus's 3 largest banks) to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek financial crisis]].<ref name=BBCJune/>

In June 2012 the Cypriot finance minister [[Vassos Shiarly]] stated that the [[European Central Bank]], [[European commission]] and [[IMF]] officials are to carry out an in-depth investigation into Cyprus' economy and banking sector to assess the level of funding it requires. The Ministry of Finance rejected the possibility that Cyprus would be forced to undergo the sweeping austerity measures that have caused turbulence in Greece, but admitted that there would be "some negative repercussion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/business/cyprus-says-eu-imf-officials-to-start-assessing-next-week-how-much-bailout-money-needed-160567635.html |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/cyprus-says-eu-imf-officials-to-start-assessing-next-week-how-much-bailout-money-needed/2012/06/27/gJQAArGD7V_story.html|title= Cyprus says EU, IMF officials to start assessing next week how much bailout money needed - from Associated Press |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref> 

In November, 2012 international lenders negotiating a bailout with the Cypriot government have agreed on a key capital ratio for banks and a system for the sector's supervision. Both commercial banks and cooperatives will be overseen by the [[Central Bank of Cyprus|Central Bank]] and the Ministry of Finance. They also set a core Tier 1 ratio - a measure of financial strength - of 9% by the end of 2013 for banks, which could then rise to 10% in 2014.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/17/cyprus-troika-idUSL5E8MH46120121117 Cyprus, troika agree on bank supervision, capital ratio] Reuters 17/11/12</ref>

==Economy in the Turkish-occupied area==
{{main|Economy of Northern Cyprus}}
The [[economy of Northern Cyprus|economy]] of Turkish-occupied [[Northern Cyprus]] is about one-fifth the size of the economy of the government-controlled area, while GDP per capita is around half. Because the ''de facto'' administration is recognized only by [[Turkey]], it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The economy mainly revolves around the agricultural sector and government service, which together employ about half of the work force. 

The tourism sector also contributes substantially into the economy. Moreover, the small economy has seen some downfalls because the [[Turkish lira]] is [[legal tender]]. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey has been known to provide significant financial aid. In both parts of the island, water shortage is a growing problem, and several [[desalination]] plants are planned.

The economic disparity between the two communities is pronounced. Although the economy operates on a free-market basis, the lack of private and government investment, shortages of skilled labor and experienced managers, and inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish lira continue to plague the economy.

=== Trade with Turkey ===

Turkey is by far the main trading partner of the Turkish-occupied area, supplying 55% of imports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994 against the British practice of importing produce from northern Cyprus based on certificates of origin and [[phytosanitary certificate]]s granted by the ''de facto'' authorities. The ECJ decided that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4&nbsp;million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7&nbsp;million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of northern Cyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.

The most important exports of Northern Cyprus are [[citrus]] and [[dairy products]]. These are followed by [[rakı]], [[scrap]] and clothing.<ref>TRNC Ministry of Economy and Energy, Department of Trade. ''Dış Ticaret İthalat ve İhracat İstatistikleri 2010'', p. VI.</ref>

Assistance from Turkey is the mainstay of the Turkish Cypriot economy. Under the latest economic protocol (signed 3 January 1997), Turkey has undertaken to provide loans totalling $250&nbsp;million for the purpose of implementing projects included in the protocol related to public finance, tourism, banking, and privatization. Fluctuation in the Turkish lira, which suffered from [[hyperinflation]] every year until its replacement by the [[Turkish new lira]] in 2005, exerted downward pressure on the Turkish Cypriot standard of living for many years.

The ''de facto'' authorities have instituted a free market in foreign exchange and permit residents to hold foreign-currency denominated bank accounts. This encourages transfers from Turkish Cypriots living abroad.
