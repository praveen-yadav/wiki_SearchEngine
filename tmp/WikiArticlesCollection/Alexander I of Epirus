== Biography==
As the son of [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]] and brother of [[Olympias]], Alexander I was an uncle of [[Alexander the Great]]. He came at an early age to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]], and after the Grecian fashion became the object of his attachment. Philip in requital made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle [[Arymbas]].

When Olympias was repudiated by her husband, 337&nbsp;BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip.

Philip, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Alexander by giving him his daughter (Alexander I's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] in marriage (336&nbsp;BC). At the wedding Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]].

In 334&nbsp;BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]] and Lucanians near [[Paestum]], 332&nbsp;BC, he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Success still followed his arms. He took [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]] from the Lucanians, and [[Terina]] and Sipontum from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the [[battle of Pandosia]] and was killed by a Lucanian. He left a son, [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]], and a daughter, Cadmea.<ref>[[Junianus Justinus|Justin]]. ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'', viii.6, ix.6, xii.2</ref><ref>[[Livy]]. ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', viii.3, 17, 24</ref><ref>[[Aulus Gellius]]. ''Noctes Atticae'', xvii.21</ref>

In a famous passage<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D19 Livy 9.19, Alternative history: Alexander the Great vs. Rome]</ref> that is often considered the first specimen of [[Counterfactual history|alternative history]], [[Livy]] speculates on what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Roman Republic]]. He reports there that as Alexander of Epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield at Pandosia he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter "waged war against women".
