'''Bursa''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈbuɾsa}}) is a city in [[Turkey]], located in northwestern [[Anatolia]], within the [[Marmara Region]]. It is the [[list of cities in Turkey|fourth most populous]] city in Turkey and one of the most industrialized metropolitan centers in the country. The city is also the administrative center of [[Bursa Province]]. 

Bursa was the second capital of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman State]] between 1335 and 1413. The city was referred to as "Hüdavendigar" (meaning "God's Gift") during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, while a more recent nickname is "Yeşil Bursa" (meaning "Green Bursa") in reference to the parks and gardens located across its urban fabric, as well as to the vast and richly varied forests of the surrounding region. The [[ski resort]] of [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]] towers over it. The mountain was called The Olympus by the Romans who lived there before.  Bursa has rather orderly urban growth and borders a fertile plain. The [[mausoleums]] of the early [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman sultans]] are located in Bursa and the city's main landmarks include numerous edifices built throughout the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. Bursa also has [[thermal bath]]s and several museums, including a museum of [[archaeology]].

The [[shadow play]] characters [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] are based on historic personalities who lived and died in Bursa. Bursa is also home to some of the most famous [[Cuisine of Turkey|Turkish dishes]] such as [[İskender kebap]], specially candied [[marron glacé]]s, [[peach]]es and [[lokum]]. Bursa houses the [[Uludağ University]], and its population can claim one of the highest overall levels of education in Turkey. The historic towns of [[İznik]] ([[Nicaea]]), [[Mudanya]] and [[Zeytinbağı]] are all situated in [[Bursa Province]].

According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, as of 2011 the city of Bursa had a population of 1,704,441 and its [[metropolitan municipality]] 1,948,744.<ref name="citypopulation.de"/><ref name="rapor.tuik.gov.tr"/>

The earliest known settlement at this location was the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Cius]], which [[Philip V of Macedon]] granted to [[Prusias I of Bithynia|Prusias]], the King of [[Bithynia]], in 202 BC. Prusias rebuilt the city and renamed it ''Prusa'' ({{lang-grc|Προῦσα}}). After 128 years of Bithynian rule, [[Nicomedes IV]], the last King of [[Bithynia]], bequeathed the entire kingdom to the [[Roman Empire]] in 74 BC.

Bursa became the first major capital city of the early [[Ottoman Empire]] following its capture from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 1326. As a result, the city witnessed a considerable amount of urban growth throughout the 14th century. After conquering [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) in 1365 the Ottomans turned it into a joint capital city for governing their European realms, but Bursa remained the most important Anatolian administrative and commercial center even after it lost its status as the sole Ottoman capital. The Ottoman sultan [[Bayezid I]] built the Bayezid Külliyesi (Bayezid I theological complex) in Bursa between 1390 and 1395<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2872|title=Bayezid I Complex|publisher=ArchNet|accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> and the Ulu Cami (Great Mosque) between 1396 and 1400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2881|title=Great Mosque of Bursa|publisher=ArchNet|accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> Bursa remained to be the most important administrative and commercial center in the empire until [[Mehmed II]] [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] [[Constantinople]] in 1453. The population of Bursa was 45,000 in 1487.<ref>''The city in the Islamic world'', Volume 1, ed. [[Salma Khadra Jayyusi]], Renata Holod, Attilio Petruccioli, André Raymond, page 362.</ref>

During the Ottoman period, Bursa continued to be the source of most royal [[silk]] products. Aside from the local silk production, the city imported raw silk from [[Iran]], and occasionally from [[China]], and was the main production center for the kaftans, pillows, embroidery and other silk products for the Ottoman palaces until the 17th century.

Following the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Bursa became one of the industrial centers of the country. The economic development of the city was followed by population growth and Bursa became the 4th most populous city in [[Turkey]].

The city has traditionally been a pole of attraction, and was a major center for refugees from various ethnic backgrounds who immigrated to [[Anatolia]] from the [[Balkans]] during the loss of the [[Ottoman territories in Europe]] between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most recent arrival of [[Turks in Europe#Balkan Turks|Balkan Turks]] took place in the 1940s until the 1990s, when the [[Todor Zhivkov|communist regime]] in [[Bulgaria]] expelled approximately 150,000 [[Turks in Bulgaria|Bulgarian Turks]] to Turkey.<ref>Eminov, Ali, ''Turks and Other Muslim Minorities in Bulgaria'', New York, Routledge, 1997, Hoepken, W., "Modernnisierung und Nationalismus: Sizialgeschichtliche Aspeckte der Bulgarischen Minder hertenpolitik gegennüber den Türken", Schönfeld, R., ed, ''Nationalitätenprobleme in Südosteuropa'', Munich, Oldenbourg, 1997, p. 255-303, Erdinç, Didar, "Bulgaristan'daki Değişim Sürecinde Türk Azınlığın Ekonomik Durumu", ''Türkler'', Ankara, 2002, s.394–400.</ref> About one-third of these 150,000 Bulgarian Turkish refugees eventually settled in Bursa.

==Geography==
Bursa is settled on the northwestern slopes of [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]] in the southern [[Marmara Region]]. It is the capital city of [[Bursa Province]] bordered by the [[Sea of Marmara]] and [[Yalova]] to the north; [[İzmit|Kocaeli]] and [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]] to the northeast; [[Bilecik]] to the east; and [[Kütahya]] and [[Balıkesir]] to the south.

===Climate===
Bursa has a borderline [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]/[[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Csa/Cfa). The city has hot, humid summers that last from June until September. Winters are cold and damp, also containing the most rainfall. There can be snow on the ground which will last for a week or two. In the mountains; especially Uludağ, it is freezing and snows all winter. Summer in the mountains is pleasantly warm.

Traditionally, Bursa was famous for being the largest center of [[silk]] trade in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, during the period of the lucrative [[Silk Road]]. The city is still a major center for textiles in Turkey and is home to the Bursa International Textiles and Trade Center (Bursa Uluslararası Tekstil ve Ticaret Merkezi, or BUTTIM.) Bursa was also known for its fertile soil and agricultural activities, which have decreased in the recent decades due to the heavy industrialization of the city.

Bursa is a major center for tourism. One of the most popular [[skiing]] resorts of Turkey is located at [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]], just next to the city proper. Bursa's thermal baths have been used for therapeutical purposes since [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. Apart from the baths that are operated by hotels, [[Uludağ University]] has a [[physical therapy]] center which also makes use of thermal water.

Bursa's [[Yenişehir Airport]] is {{convert|20|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from the city center. The citizens of Bursa also prefer Istanbul's airports such as [[Istanbul Atatürk Airport|Atatürk International Airport]] and [[Sabiha Gökçen International Airport]] for flights to foreign countries, due to Istanbul's vicinity to Bursa. There are numerous daily bus and ferry services between the two cities.

The {{convert|8.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} long [[Bursa Uludağ Gondola]] ({{lang-tr|Teleferik}}) connects Bursa with the ski resort areas {{convert|1870|m|ft|abbr=on}} high on the mountain Uludağ.

Bursaspor is today considered one of the five biggest football clubs in Turkey along with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football)|Fenerbahçe]], [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]] and [[Trabzonspor]]. The city had a professional [[basketball]] team in the [[Turkish Basketball League]], [[Tofaş S.K.]], which was among the most successful teams; until it stopped participating in the league following a decision by the automobile manufacturer [[Tofaş]], its sponsor and parent company.

==Main sights==

===Ulu Cami (Grand Mosque)===
[[File:Ulucamii2-Turkey-2001.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of the [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] (Grand Mosque), showing the fountain (şadırvan) for [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]].]]

[[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] is the largest mosque in Bursa and a landmark of early [[Ottoman architecture]], which carried many elements from the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate|Seljuk]] architecture. Ordered by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], the mosque was designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1400. It is a large and rectangular building, with a total of twenty domes that are arranged in four rows of five, and are supported by 12 columns. Supposedly the twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which Sultan [[Bayezid I]] had promised for winning the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396. The mosque has two [[minaret]]s.

Inside the mosque there are 192 monumental wall inscriptions written by the famous [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] of that period. There is also a fountain ([[şadırvan]]) where worshipers can perform [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]] before prayer; the dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which creates a soft, serene light below; thus playing an important role in the illumination of the large building.

The horizontally spacious and dimly lit interior is designed to feel peaceful and contemplative. The subdivisions of space formed by multiple domes and pillars create a sense of privacy and even intimacy. This atmosphere contrasts with the later Ottoman mosques (see for example the works of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s chief architect [[Mimar Sinan]].) The mosques that were built after the [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and influenced by the design of the 6th century Byzantine basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]], had increasingly elevated and large central domes, which create a vertical emphasis that is intended to be more overwhelming; in order to convey the divine power of Allah, the majesty of the Ottoman Sultan, and the governmental authority of the Ottoman State.
