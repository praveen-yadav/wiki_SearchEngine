The '''arctic fox''' (''Vulpes lagopus''), also known as the '''white fox''', '''polar fox''', or '''snow fox''', is a small [[fox]] native to the [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and is common throughout the [[Tundra#Arctic tundra|Arctic tundra]] [[biome]].<ref name="iucn"/><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id=14000873}}</ref> It is well [[adaptation|adapted]] to living in cold environments. It has a deep thick fur which is brown in summer and white in winter. It averages in size at about {{convert|85.3|cm|abbr=on}} in body length, with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of [[body heat]].

They prey on any small animals they can find, including [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, [[ringed seal]] pups, fish, [[seabird]]s, and bird eggs. They will also eat [[carrion]], berries, and seaweed. They form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs during the breeding season and usually stay together in family groups of multiple generations in complex underground dens.

==Adaptations==
[[File:Alopex lagopus IMG 9019.JPG|thumb|left|Arctic fox sleeping with its tail wrapped as a blanket.]]
The arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet. Among its [[adaptation]]s for cold survival is its deep, thick fur,<ref>Claudio Sillero-Zubiri, Michael Hoffmann and David W. Macdonald (eds.) (2004) [http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/canids.pdf Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs]. IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group.</ref> a system of [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent heat exchange]] in the circulation of paws to retain [[wiktionary:core temperature|core temperature]], and a good supply of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]]. The fox has a low [[surface area to volume ratio]], as evidenced by its generally rounded body shape, short muzzle and legs, and short, thick ears. Since less of its surface area is exposed to the arctic cold, less heat escapes the body. Its furry paws allow it to walk on ice in search of food. The arctic fox has such keen hearing that it can precisely locate the position of prey under the snow. When it finds prey, it pounces and punches through the snow to catch its victim. Its fur changes color with the seasons: in the winter it is white to blend in with snow, while  in the summer it is  brown.<ref>[http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/snp/programs/education/animal_facts/mammals/arctic_fox.html Arctic Fox ''Alopex lagopus'']. Department of Environment and Conservation, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador</ref>

==Reproduction==
The arctic fox tends to be active from early September to early May. The [[gestation period]] is 52 days. Litters tend to average 5–8 kits but may be as many as 25<ref name="ADW"/>(the largest in the order Carnivora<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=David W.|title=Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-851556-1}}</ref>). Both the mother and the father help to raise their young. The females leave the family and form their own groups and the males stay with the family.

Foxes tend to form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs in the breeding season. Litters are born in the early summer and the parents raise the young in a large den. Dens can be complex underground networks, housing many generations of foxes. Young from a previous year's litter may stay with the parents to help rear younger siblings.<ref name="ADW">Dewey, T. and Middlebrook, C. (2007) [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Vulpes_lagopus.html "Vulpes lagopus"]. Retrieved 16 May 2009 at Animal Diversity Web</ref> The kits are initially brownish; as they become older they turn white. Their coat of fur also changes color when summer arrives, but in winter it is white.

==Diet==
The arctic fox will generally eat any small animal it can find: [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, [[hare]]s, [[owl]]s, [[Egg (food)|egg]]s, and [[carrion]], etc. Lemmings are the most common prey. A family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. During April and May the arctic fox also preys on [[ringed seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless. Fish beneath the ice are also part of its diet. They also consume berries and seaweed and may thus be considered [[omnivore]]s.<ref name="Bockstoce2009">{{cite book|author=Bockstoce, John R. |title=Furs and frontiers in the far north: the contest among native and foreign nations for the Bering Strait fur trade|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HY6LvFMSxxwC&pg=PA41|year =2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14921-0|page=41}}</ref> It is a significant bird egg predator, excepting those of the largest tundra bird species.<ref name=truett>{{cite book|author=Truett, Joe Clyde and Johnson, Stephen R. |title=The natural history of an Arctic oil field: development and the biota|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ELsq-yAP0XkC&pg=PA161|year=2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-701235-3|pages=160–163}}</ref> If there is an overabundance of food hunted, the arctic fox will bury what the family cannot eat. When its normal prey is scarce, the arctic fox scavenges the leftovers and even [[feces]] of larger predators, such as the [[polar bear]], even though the bear's prey includes the arctic fox itself.

==Size==
The average length is {{convert|85.3|cm|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|80|to|110|cm|abbr=on}}, in the male and {{convert|82.1|cm|abbr=on}}, with a range of {{convert|71.3|to|85|cm|abbr=on}}, in the female.<ref name="smith"/> The tail is {{convert|31|cm|abbr=on|1}} long in the male and {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on|1}} long in the female.

==Taxonomy==
''Vulpes lagopus'' is a 'true fox' belonging to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]'' of the fox [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Vulpini]]. It is classified under the [[subfamily (biology)|subfamily]] [[Caninae]] of the canid [[family (biology)|family]] [[Canidae]]. Although it has previously been assigned to its own [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[genus]] ''Alopex'', recent [[genetics|genetic]] evidence now places it in the genus ''Vulpes'' with the majority of the other foxes.<ref name=msw3/><ref name=complete>{{cite journal|title=Building large trees by combining phylogenetic information: a complete phylogeny of the extant Carnivora (Mammalia)|journal=Biol.

It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']] in 1758 as ''Canis lagopus''. The [[type specimen]] was recovered from [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[Sweden]]. The generic name ''vulpes'' is [[Latin]] for "fox".<ref name="lariviere">{{cite journal|author= Larivière, Serge |year=2002|title=''Vulpes zerda''|journal=Mammalian Species|issue=714|pages=1&ndash;5|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/714_Vulpes_zerda.pdf|doi= 10.1644/1545-1410(2002)714<0001:VZ>2.0.CO;2|volume= 714}}</ref> The specific name ''lagopus'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] λαγως (''lagos'', "[[hare]]") and πους (''pous'', "foot"), referring to the hair on its feet similar to those found in cold-climate species of hares.<ref name="audet">{{cite journal|author=Audet, Alexander M.; Robbins, C.

==Population and distribution==
[[File:Lagopusskull.jpg|thumb|left|Arctic fox skull]]
The arctic fox has a circumpolar range, meaning that it is found throughout the entire Arctic, including the outer edges of Greenland, Russia, Canada, [[Alaska]], and [[Svalbard]], as well as in [[Subarctic]] and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas, such as Iceland and mainland alpine [[Scandinavia]]. The conservation status of the species is good, except for the Scandinavian mainland population. It is acutely endangered there, despite decades of legal protection from hunting and persecution. The total population estimate in all of Norway, Sweden and Finland is a mere 120 adult individuals.

The arctic fox is the only land mammal native to Iceland.<ref name="Iceland">{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html|title=Wildlife|year=2000|work=Iceland Worldwide|publisher=iww.is|accessdate=22 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100414112114/http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html| archivedate= 14 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It came to the isolated [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] island at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], walking over the frozen sea. [[The Arctic Fox Center]] in [[Súðavík]] contains an exhibition on the arctic fox and conducts studies on the influence of tourism on the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticfoxcenter.com/|title=The Arctic Fox Center|accessdate=19 May 2011}}</ref>

The abundance of the arctic fox species tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings and [[vole]]s (a 3-to-4-year cycle).<ref name=truett/> The populations are especially vulnerable during the years when the prey population crashes, and uncontrolled [[Animal trapping|trapping]] has almost eradicated two subpopulations. 

The pelts of arctic foxes with a slate blue coloration—an expression of a [[recessive gene]]—were especially valuable. They were transported to various previously fox-free [[Aleutian Island]]s during the 1920s. The program was successful in terms of increasing the population of blue foxes, but their predation of [[Aleutian Cackling Goose|Aleutian Canadian geese]] conflicted with  the goal of preserving that species.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sbYL7JNnMNIC&pg=PA42|page=42|title=Ecology of North America|author=Bolen, Eric G. |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-13156-4}}</ref>

The arctic fox is losing ground to the larger [[red fox]]. This has been attributed to [[climate change]]—the camouflage value of its lighter coat decreases with less snow cover.<ref name="Hannah2010">{{cite book|author=Hannah, Lee |title=Climate Change Biology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4Vvqw2gdk9QC&pg=PA63|year=2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374182-0|page=63}}</ref> Red foxes dominate where their ranges begin to overlap by killing arctic foxes and their kits.<ref name="MacdonaldSillero-Zubiri2004">{{cite book|author=Macdonald, David Whyte and Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio |title=The biology and conservation of wild canids|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vrgow9ERQeIC&pg=PA10|year= 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851556-2|page=10}}</ref> An alternate explanation of the red fox's gains involves the [[gray wolf]]: Historically, it has kept red fox numbers down, but as the wolf has been hunted to near [[extinction]] in much of its former range, the red fox population has grown larger, and it has taken over the niche of [[Apex predator|top predator]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In areas of northern Europe, there are programs in place that allow hunting of the red fox in the arctic fox's previous range.

As with many other game species, the best sources of historical and large scale population data are hunting bag records and questionnaires. There are several potential sources of error in such data collections.<ref name=G_and_E>{{cite book | author = Garrott, R. A. and Eberhardt, L. E. | year = 1987 | chapter = Arctic fox | editor = Novak, M. et al. (eds.) | title = Wild furbearer management and conservation in North America | pages = 395–406|isbn=0774393653}}</ref> In addition, numbers vary widely between years due to the large population fluctuations. However, the total population of the arctic fox must be in the order of several hundred thousand animals.<ref name=Tannerfeldt>{{cite book | author = Tannerfeldt, M. | year = 1997 | title = Population fluctuations and life history consequences in the Arctic fox. | publisher = Dissertation, Stockholm University | location = Stockholm, Sweden}}</ref>

The world population is thus not endangered, but two arctic fox subpopulations are. One is on [[Medny Island]] ([[Commander Islands]], Russia), which was reduced by some 85–90%, to around 90 animals, as a result of [[mange]] caused by an ear tick introduced by dogs in the 1970s.<ref name=Goltsman>{{cite journal | author = Goltsman, M.| year = 1996 | last2 = Kruchenkova | first2 = E.

The other threatened population is the one in [[Fennoscandia]] (Norway, Sweden, Finland and [[Kola Peninsula]]). This population decreased drastically around the start of the 20th century as a result of extreme fur prices which caused severe hunting also during population lows.<ref name=Lönnberg>{{cite book | author = Lönnberg, E. | year = 1927 | title = Fjällrävsstammen i Sverige 1926 | publisher = Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | location = Uppsala, Sweden}}</ref> The population has remained at a low density for more than 90 years, with additional reductions during the last decade.<ref name=Angerbjörn>{{cite journal | author = Angerbjörn, A. et al. | year = 1995 | title = Dynamics of the Arctic fox population in Sweden | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 32 | pages = 55–68|url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:234717}}</ref> The total population estimate for 1997 is around 60 adults in Sweden, 11 adults in Finland and 50 in Norway. From Kola, there are indications of a similar situation, suggesting a population of around 20 adults. The Fennoscandian population thus numbers a total of 140 breeding adults. Even after local lemming peaks, the arctic fox population tends to collapse back to levels dangerously close to non-viability.<ref name=Tannerfeldt/>

The arctic fox is classed as a "prohibited new organism" under New Zealand's [[Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996]] preventing it from being imported into the country.<ref>{{Cite document| url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|title=Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 2003 – Schedule 2 Prohibited new organisms|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref>
