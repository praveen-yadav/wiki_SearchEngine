'''Transport infrastructure''' in [[Brazil]] is characterized by strong regional differences and lack of development of the national rail network.<ref>http://www.dhl-discoverlogistics.com/cms/en/course/trends/america/brazil.jsp</ref> Brazil's fast growing economy, and especially the growth in exports, will place increasing demands on the transport networks.<ref name="ic.gc.ca">http://www.ic.gc.ca/scdt/bizmap/interface2.nsf/vDownload/ISA_3976/$file/X_9317614.PDF</ref> However, sizeable new investments that are expected to address some of the issues are either planned or in progress.<ref name="ic.gc.ca"/><ref>http://www.bsdlive.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3130466</ref>

''{{Main|Brazilian Highway System}}''
Brazil has 1,751,868 kilometers of roads,<ref name="transtats">{{cite web|url=http://www.iraptranstats.net/bz|title=Transport in Brazil|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=International Transport Statistics Database|publisher=[[iRAP]] }}</ref> 96,353&nbsp;km of them paved and 1,655,515&nbsp;km unpaved. That means that only 5.5% of the roads are paved and that 94.5% are unpaved. The most important highway of the country is [[BR-116]] and the second is [[BR-101]].

The country has a low rate of car ownership of 140 per 1000 population, however in comparison to the other developing economies of the [[BRIC]] group Brazil exceeds India and China.<ref name="transtats"/>

== [[Airport]]s ==

Most international flights must go to [[Guarulhos International Airport]] in São Paulo or [[Galeão International Airport]] in Rio de Janeiro. Belo Horizonte is the main international airport outside Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. A few go to Brasília, Recife, Natal, and just recently Fortaleza has accepted international flights.  With South American integration, more airports can be expected to open to international flights.
