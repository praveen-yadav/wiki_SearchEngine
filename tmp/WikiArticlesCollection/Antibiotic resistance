'''Antibiotic resistance''' is a form of [[drug resistance]] whereby some (or, less commonly, all) sub-populations of a [[microorganism]], usually a [[bacteria]]l species, are able to survive after exposure to one or more [[antibiotic]]s; pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics are considered ''[[multidrug resistant]]'' (MDR) or, more colloquially, superbugs. Microbes, rather than people, develop resistance to antibiotics.<ref name=cdcgetsmart>{{cite web|title=Antibiotic Resistance Questions & Answers|url=http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|work=Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=30|month=June|year=2009}}</ref>

Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the pre-eminent public health concerns of the 21st century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is especially relevant to organisms which cause disease in humans). In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, a first-line agent is selected on the basis of several factors including safety, availability and cost; a second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, has a less favourable risk-benefit profile and is more expensive or, in dire circumstances, may be locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second and even third-line antibiotics is thus sequentially acquired, a case quintessentially illustrated by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in some [[nosocomial]] settings. Some pathogens, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', also   possess a high level of intrinsic resistance.

It may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic [[mutation]], or the acquisition of resistance [[gene]]s from other bacterial species by [[horizontal gene transfer]] via [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible [[plasmids]], facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic [[natural selection|naturally selects]] for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the bacteria that causes [[Tuberculosis]], since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids.<ref name=pmid2115217>{{cite journal |pmid=2115217 |year=1990 |last1=Zainuddin |first1=ZF |last2=Dale |first2=JW |title=Does Mycobacterium tuberculosis have plasmids? |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=43–9 |journal=Tubercle}}</ref>  Also.

Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient.{{sfn|D'Costa|King|Kalan|Morar|2011|pp=457–461}} However, the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and [[veterinary medicine]]. Any use of antibiotics can increase [[selective pressure]] in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs.{{sfn|Donadio|Maffioli|Monciardini|Sosio|2010|pp=423–430}} Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem.

The growing prevalence and incidence of infections due to MDR pathogens is epitomised by the increasing number of familiar acronyms used to describe the causative agent and sometimes the infection generally; of these, [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] is probably the most well-known, but others including VISA (vancomycin-intermediate ''S. aureus''), VRSA (vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus''), ESBL (Extended spectrum beta-lactamase), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'') and MRAB (Multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'') are prominent examples. [[Nosocomial infection]]s overwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated, but multidrug-resistant infections are also becoming increasingly common in the community.

===In medicine===

In 1945, in his Nobel Lecture, "Penicillin," Alexander Fleming warned against the use of sub‐therapeutic doses of antibiotics – “bought by anyone in the shops” without a prescription: “The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non‐lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant. Here is a hypothetical illustration. Mr. X. has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not enough to kill the streptococci but enough to educate them to resist penicillin. He then infects his wife. Mrs. X gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin. As the streptococci are now resistant to penicillin the treatment fails. Mrs. X dies. Who is primarily responsible for Mrs. X’s death?”<ref>http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1945/fleming-lecture.pdf</ref>

Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has been attributed to a number of causes, including people who insist on antibiotics, physicians who simply prescribe them as they feel they do not have time to explain why they are not necessary, and physicians who do not know when to prescribe antibiotics or else are overly cautious for medical legal reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=SR |last2=Straus |first2=SE |title=Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices in ambulatory care |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=4 |pages=CD003539 |year=2005 |pmid=16235325 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003539.pub2 |editor1-last=Arnold |editor1-first=Sandra R|ref=harv}}</ref>  For example, a third of people believe that antibiotics are effective for the [[common cold]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=McNulty |first=CA |last2= Boyle |first2=P |last3= Nichols |first3=T |last4=Clappison |first4=P |last5=Davey |first5=P |title=The public's attitudes to and compliance with antibiotics |journal=[[J.

The number of persons inappropriately prescribed antibiotics is a greater factor in the increasing rates of bacterial resistance rather than non-compliance with antibiotic protocol among those prescribed the drugs. However, the non-compliance rate is high.<ref name="Pechère JC 2001 S170–3">{{cite journal |last=Pechère |first=JC |title=Patients' interviews and misuse of antibiotics |journal=Clin. Infect.

Antibiotic resistance has been shown to increase with duration of treatment; therefore, as long as a clinically effective lower limit is observed (that depends upon the organism and antibiotic in question), the use by the medical community of shorter courses of antibiotics is likely to decrease rates of resistance, reduce cost, and have better outcomes due to fewer complications such as [[Clostridium difficile|C. difficile]] infection and diarrhea.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Li |first=JZ |last2= Winston |first2=LG |last3=Moore |first3=DH |last4= Bent |first4=S |title=Efficacy of short-course antibiotic regimens for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis |journal=Am.

Antibiotic-tolerant states may depend on physiological adaptations without direct connections to antibiotic target activity or to drug uptake, [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]], or inactivation. Identifying these adaptations, and targeting them to enhance the activity of existing drugs, is a promising approach to mitigate the public health crisis caused by the scarcity of new antibiotics.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The improper use of antibiotics and therapeutic treatments can often be attributed to the presence of structural violence in particular regions. Socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect the accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy. The efficacy of treatment programs for these drug-resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violence.<ref>Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006.

===Role of other animals===
{{main|Antibiotic use in livestock}}
The emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms in human medicine is primarily the result of the use of antibiotics in humans, although the use of antibiotics in animals is also partly responsible.<ref>The Resistance Phenomenon in Microbes and Infectious Disease Vectors: Implications for Human Health and Strategies for Containment: Workshop Summary.Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Emerging Infections; Knobler SL, Lemon SM, Najafi M, et al., editors.

Antibiotic drugs are used in animals that are intended for human consumption, such as cattle, pigs, chickens, fish, etc. Traditionally, there has been extensive use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. Many of these drugs are not considered significant drugs for use in humans, either because of their lack of efficacy or purpose in humans, (such as the use of ionopores in ruminants<ref>{{cite web|last=Hersom|first=Matt|title=Application of Ionophores in Cattle Diets|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/AN/AN28500.pdf|work=AN285 Department of Animal Sciences|publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>) or because that drug has gone out of use in humans (such as the decline in use of [[sulfa drugs|Sulfonamide_(medicine)]] due to widespread allergic reactions and antibiotic resistance among human pathogens.)Historically , regulation of antibiotic use in food animals has been limited to limiting drug residues in meat, egg, and milk products, rather than concern over the development of antibiotic resistance. This mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine, where researchers and doctors were generally more concerned about effective but non-toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance.
 
The resistant bacteria in animals due to antibiotic exposure can be transmitted to humans via three pathways, those being through the consumption of [[animal products]] (milk, meat, eggs, etc), from close or direct contact with animals or other humans, or through the environment.<ref>{{cite web |last= Schneider |first=K |last2= Garrett |first2=L |title= Non-therapeutic Use of Antibiotics in Animal Agriculture, Corresponding Resistance Rates, and What Can be Done About It |url= http://www.cgdev.org/content/article/detail/1422307/ |publisher=Center for Global Development|date= June 19, 2009 |ref=harv}}</ref> In  first pathway many [[food preservation]] methods are available in order to eliminate, decrease or prevent the growth of bacteria. Evidence for the transfer of antibiotic- resistant microorganisms from animals to humans has been scant, and most evidence shows that pathogens of concern in human populations originated in humans and are maintained there, with rare cases of transference to humans,.<ref>Hurd HS, Doores S, Hayes D, Mathew A, Maurer J, Silley P, Singer RS, Jones RN. “Public health consequences of macrolide use in food animals: a deterministic risk assessment “.

The use of antibiotics in animals can be divided in different use patterns depending on what is its purpose. The most accepted classification discriminates the use of antibiotics as therapeutic, prophylactic, metaphylactic and growth promotion.<ref>Joint FAO/OIE/WHO Expert Workshop
on Non-Human Antimicrobial Usage and Antimicrobial Resistance:
Scientific assessment [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/en/amr.pdf]</ref> The first three options are considered valid for therapeutic purposes in contrast with the fourth option that is considered as with non- therapeutic purposes. All these patterns predispose the exhibition of mechanisms of bacterial resistance due the proper use or misuse of antibiotics since antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process.
 
The [[World Health Organization]] concluded that inappropriate use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is an underlying factor that contributes to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant germs and the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited, in the absence of risk assessments.
Regarding this matter, the [[OIE]] has added to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code a series of guidelines with recommendations to its members for the creation and harmonization of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programs,<ref>[http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.6.7.htm OIE,Terrestrial Animal Health Code]</ref> monitoring of the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry,<ref>[http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.6.8.htm OIE,Terrestrial Animal Health Code]</ref> and recommendations to ensure the proper and prudent use of antibiotic substances.  Another guideline introduced in the terrestrial Animal Health Code is the implementation of methodologies that help to establish risk factors associated with this worldwide concern. The OIE concluded that risk assessments should be performed in order to assess, manage and define the possible health risks of  antibiotic resistance in human and animal populations.<ref>[http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.6.9.htm OIE,Terrestrial Animal Health Code]</ref>

In the world, the use of antibiotics in animals is widely accepted. As in human medicine, antibiotics can be bought without prescription and can be used in pets and livestock without veterinary supervision. Bacteria remaining in these animals are likely to be resistant to the antibiotics used, and may be passed into the environment by the excretion and secretion of materials such as milk, feces, urine, saliva, semen, lochia etc. The actual impact of these resistant organisms depends on their specific type and the animal or organism they henceforth infect. Some organisms, such as tetanus, are toxic regardless of their antibiotic resistant status. (It is useful to remember that antibiotics are not used in treatment of all diseases caused by bacteria. Tetanus, as an example, is prevented by vaccine and is extremely difficult to treat once symptoms appear.)

In 1998, European Union health ministers voted to ban four antibiotics widely used to promote animal growth (despite their scientific panel's recommendations). Regulation banning the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective in 2006.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Castanon |first=J.I. | year = 2007 | title = History of the use of antibiotic as growth promoters in European poultry feeds | journal = Poult.

====In the United States====
In the USA, federal agencies as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] collect data on antibiotic use in animals and humans.<ref>http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html</ref> In research studies occasional animal-to-human spread of drug-resistant organisms has been demonstrated.

Animals which appear ill are generally not permitted to be slaughtered for human consumption in the USA.

Growing U.S. consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to a niche market of "antibiotic-free" animal products, but this small market is unlikely to change entrenched, industry-wide practices.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=R |title=Health management with reduced antibiotic use&nbsp;— the U.S. experience |journal=Anim. Biotechnol. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=195–205 |year=2006 |pmid=17127530 |doi=10.1080/10495390600962274 |ref=harv}}</ref>

In 2001, the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs and cattle), in the absence of disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/antibiotics_and_food/hogging-it-estimates-of-antimicrobial-abuse-in-livestock.html |title=Executive summary from the UCS report "Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock"|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|month= January |year=2001|ref=harv}}</ref> The amounts given are termed "sub-therapeutic", i.e., insufficient to combat disease. Despite no diagnosis of disease, the admistration of these drugs (most of which are not significant to human medicine) results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated. It is theorized that sub-therapeutic dosages kills some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal— likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant.  Studies have shown, however, that the overall population levels of bacteria are essentially unchanged; only the mix of bacteria is affected.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Thus the actual mechanism by which sub-therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promotors is unclear.  Some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub-clinical infections, which are cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed, thereby allowing the creatures to thrive; but no convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory.  As the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives, the mechanism of growth promotion is possible to be something other than "killing off the bad bugs."

In 2000, the [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. The final decision to ban fluoroquinolones from use in poultry production was made in 2006 because of challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries.<ref name="Nelson-2007">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Nelson | first1 = JM. | last2 = Chiller | first2 = TM. | last3 = Powers | first3 = JH. | last4 = Angulo | first4 = FJ. | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | month = Apr | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | pmid = 17342653 |ref=harv}}</ref> Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007.  However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

In 2001, the National Hog Farmer warned US producers that C. difficile “is sweeping the industry, killing many piglets” (Neutkens D; "New Clostridium Claiming Baby Pigs"). In 2006, a study by the USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System further investigated the prevalence of C. difficile in hog farms.  The study, which covered hog farms of a size typical of those comprising 94% of US swine, found the prevalence of C. difficile was "relatively low (11.4%)" and that there was no difference in region or in size of farm.<ref>{{cite web|last=APHIS|title=Clostridium difficile on U.S. Swine Operations|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/swine/downloads/swine2006/Swine2006_is_Cdiff.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>  Human infection with C. difficile (either drug resistant or not) is most commonly associated with the use of strong antibiotics in hospitalized humans, and is not associated with humans in contact with farm animals.

During 2007, two federal bills (S. 549<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-549 |title=US Senate Bill S. 549: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}</ref> and H.R. 962<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-962 US House Bill H.R. 962: |title=Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}</ref>) aimed at phasing out "nontherapeutic" antibiotics in US food animal production.  The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. Edward "Ted" Kennedy, died.  The House bill, introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, died after being referred to Committee.

In the United States, evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock was determined by the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] in 1977. However, the long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals continued in all states. In March, 2012 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock which violated FDA regulations.<ref name=MPFDA>{{cite news|title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792|accessdate=March 24, 2012|newspaper=MedPage Today|date=March 23, 2012|author=John Gever}}</ref> On April 11, 2012 the FDA announced a voluntary program to phase out unsupervised use of drugs as feed additives and convert approved over-the-counter uses for antibiotics to prescription use only, requiring veterinarian supervision of their use and a prescription.<ref name=NYTPrescription>{{cite news|title=U.S. Tightens Rules on Antibiotics Use for Livestock|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/us/antibiotics-for-livestock-will-require-prescription-fda-says.html|accessdate=April 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2012|author=Gardiner Harris}}</ref><ref name=FDAFAQ>{{cite web|title=FDA's Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance&nbsp;— Questions and Answers|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm216939.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=April 12, 2012|date=April 11, 2012|quote=“Judicious use” is using an antimicrobial drug appropriately and only when necessary; Based on a thorough review of the available scientific information, FDA recommends that use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals be limited to situations where the use of these drugs is necessary for ensuring animal health, and their use includes veterinary oversight or consultation.

In 2013 the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] released the report “Antibiotic resistance threats in the United States”.<ref>CDC, US, 2013. http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.</ref> The report highlighted 18 antibiotic resistant microorganisms that are considered as public health threats.

==Environmental impact==
Antibiotics have been polluting the environment since their introduction through human waste (medication, farming), animals, and the pharmaceutical industry.<ref name="Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171">Martinez, J. L., & Olivares, J. (2012). Envrironmental Pollution By Antibiotic Resistance Genes. In P. L. Keen, & M. H. Montforts, Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment (pp. 151- 171). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment. As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter the environment replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. Additionally, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continual exposure.<ref name="Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171"/>

A study done of the [[Poudre River]] implicated wastewater treatment plants, as well as animal feeding operations in the dispersal of antibiotic resistance genes into the environment.<ref>Pruden, A., & Arabi, M. (2012). Quantifying Anthropogenic Impacts on Environmental Reservoirs of Antibiotic Resistance. In P. L. Keen, & M. H. Montforts, Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment (pp. 173-202). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons.</ref> This research was done using molecular signatures in order to determine the sources, and the location at the Poudre River was chosen due to lack of other anthropogenic influences upstream. The study indicates that monitoring of antibiotic resistance genes may be useful in determining not only the point of origin of their release, but also how these genes persist in the environment. Additionally, studying physical and chemical methods of treatment may alleviate pressure of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, and thus their entry back into human contact.

[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|right|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.]]
Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ochiai|first= K.|last2= Yamanaka|first2= T |last3=Kimura |first3=K |last4=Sawada|first4= O |year=1959|title= Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor,|page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}
</ref> and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10<sup>8</sup> per chromosomal replication. The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce. They then pass this trait to their offspring, which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony.

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]
# Alteration of target site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acids]] in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] and/or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface<ref>{{cite journal |last=Li|first= X|last2=Nikadio |first2=H |title = Efflux-Mediated Drug Resistance in Bacteria: an Update| journal = Drug | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623| year = 2009 | pmid = 19678712 |  doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000|pmc= 2847397 |ref=harv}}</ref>

There are three known mechanisms of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance. Some types of [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular [[quinolone]] concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Morita |first=Y|last2=Kodama |first2=K |last3= Shiota |first3=S |last4=Mine |first4=T |last5= Kataoka |first5=A |last6= Mizushima |first6=T |last7= Tsuchiya |first7=T | title = NorM, a Putative Multidrug Efflux Protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Its Homolog in Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrob.

Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Robicsek |first=A |last2= Jacoby |first2=GA|last3= Hooper |first3=DC |title=The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=629–40 |year=2006 |month=October |pmid=17008172 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 |ref=harv}}</ref> Research has shown the bacterial protein [[LexA]] may play a key role in the acquisition of bacterial mutations giving resistance to quinolones and rifampicin.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cirz |first=RT |last2= Chin |first2=JK |last3= Andes |first3=DR |last4= de Crécy-Lagard |first4=V  |last5=Craig |first5=WA |last6=Romesberg |first6=FE |title=Inhibition of Mutation and Combating the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=e176 |year=2005 |pmid=15869329 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 |pmc=1088971|ref=harv}}</ref>

Antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest. A recent study demonstrated that the extent of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among ''Staphylococcus'' is much greater than previously expected—and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, and beyond genes residing within the [[mobile genetic elements]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chan |first=CX |last2=Beiko |first2=RG |last3= Ragan |first3=MA |title=Lateral Transfer of Genes and Gene Fragments in Staphylococcus Extends beyond Mobile Elements |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=193 |issue=15 |pages=3964–3977 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21622749 |doi=10.1128/JB.01524-10 |pmc=3147504|ref=harv}}</ref>

For a long time it has been thought that for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic, it must be in a large population. However, recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. We know now, that small populations of E.coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate the development of antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations and this is also true for the human body. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E.coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic. These mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance.

A common misconception is that a person can become resistant to certain antibiotics. It is a strain of microorganism that can become resistant, not a person's body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html |title=CDC: Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/societal_prob.shtml |title=APUA: General Background: Antibiotic Resistance, A Societal Problem |publisher=Tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref>

==Resistant pathogens==

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}
''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as "Staph aureus" or a "Staph infection") is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membranes]] and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] due to significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4-8&nbsp;μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US.

===''Streptococcus'' and ''Enterococcus''===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case. For those with very severe illness, supportive care in an intensive care unit may be needed.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization.

Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug.

===Prevention===
Rational use of [[antibiotics]] may reduce the chances of development of opportunistic infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to [[dysbacteriosis]]. Our immune systems will cure minor bacterial infections on their own. If we give it the chance without relying on antibiotics to cure a small infection, it will be less likely to become immune or resistant to the antibiotic. It is also important to note that antibiotics will not cure viral infections. Taking an antibiotic unnecessarily to treat a viral infection can lead to the resistance of antibiotics<ref>{{cite web|title=Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/10/4/l_104_03.html|work=PBS.org|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation and Clear Blue Sky Productions, Inc.|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref> In one study, the use of fluoroquinolones is clearly associated with ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''  infection, which is a leading cause of [[nosocomial]] [[diarrhea]] in the United States,<ref name="pmid12781017">{{cite journal |last=McCusker |first=ME|last2= Harris |first2=AD|last3= Perencevich |first3=E|last4= Roghmann |first4=MC |title=Fluoroquinolone Use and Clostridium difficile–Associated Diarrhea |journal=Emerging Infect.

[[Vaccine]]s do not have the problem of resistance because a vaccine enhances the body's natural defenses, while an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Nevertheless, new strains may [[Evolution|evolve]] that escape immunity induced by vaccines; for example an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is under way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html |title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases,and Pandemics—What You Can Do |publisher=HomesteadSchools.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref>

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ([[CSIRO]]), realizing the need for the reduction of antibiotic use, has been working on two alternatives. One alternative is to prevent diseases by adding [[cytokine]]s instead of antibiotics to animal feed.<ref name="blogspot1">{{cite web|url=http://biotechnolo.blogspot.com/2009_12_01_archive.html |title=Science,Technology,genetics,research on biotechnology: December 2009 |publisher=Biotechnolo.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref> These proteins are made in the animal body "naturally" after a disease and are not antibiotics, so they do not contribute to the antibiotic resistance problem. Furthermore, studies on using cytokines have shown they also enhance the growth of animals like the antibiotics now used, but without the drawbacks of nontherapeutic antibiotic use. Cytokines have the potential to achieve the animal growth rates traditionally sought by the use of antibiotics without the contribution of antibiotic resistance associated with the widespread nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics currently used in the food animal production industries. Additionally, CSIRO is working on vaccines for diseases.<ref name="blogspot1"/>

Bacteriophage therapy is an important alternative to antibiotics in the current era of multidrug resistant pathogens. A review of studies that dealt with the therapeutic use of phages from 1966–1996 and few latest ongoing phage therapy projects via internet showed: phages were used topically, orally or systemically in Polish and Soviet studies. The success rate found in these studies was 80–95% with few gastrointestinal or allergic side effects. British studies also demonstrated significant efficacy of phages against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp. and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. US studies dealt with improving the bioavailability of phage.

===Mechanism===
In research published on October 17, 2008 in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'', a team of scientists pinpointed the place on bacteria where the antibiotic [[myxopyronin]] launches its attack, and why that attack is successful. The myxopyronin binds to and inhibits the crucial bacterial enzyme, [[RNA polymerase]]. The myxopyronin changes the structure of the switch-2 segment of the enzyme, inhibiting its function of reading and transmitting DNA code. This prevents RNA polymerase from delivering genetic information to the [[ribosomes]], causing the bacteria to die.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mukhopadhyay, J.; Das, K.; Ismail, S.; Koppstein, D.; Jang, M.; Hudson, B.; Sarafianos, S.; Tuske, S.; Patel, J., Jansen, R., Irschik, H., Arnold, E., [[Richard H.

In 2012, a team of the University of Leipzig modified a peptide found in honeybees. It is effective against 37 types of bacteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/web/2012/05/Modified-Bee-Peptide-Slays-Deadly.html |title=Modified Bee Peptide Slays Deadly Bacteria &#124; Chemical & Engineering News |publisher=Cen.acs.org |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

One major cause of antibiotic resistance is the increased pumping activity of microbial [[ABC transporters]], which diminishes the effective drug concentration inside the microbial cell. ABC transporter inhibitors that can be used in combination with current antimicrobials are being tested in clinical trials and are available for therapeutic regimens.<ref name= Ponte-SucreA>{{cite book |editor1-last=Ponte-Sucre |editor1-first=A | year=2009 |title=ABC Transporters in Microorganisms | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-49-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}</ref>

===Applications===
Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for [[genetic engineering]]. By constructing a [[plasmid]] that contains an antibiotic resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that when bacteria replicate, only the copies that carry the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

The most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are generally "older" antibiotics that have largely fallen out of use in clinical practice. These include:
* [[ampicillin]]
* [[kanamycin]]
* [[tetracycline]]
* [[chloramphenicol]]

Industrially the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of [[auxotrophic]] bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.
