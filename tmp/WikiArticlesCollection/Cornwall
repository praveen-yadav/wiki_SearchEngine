Cornwall is a peninsula bordered to the north and west by the [[Celtic Sea]],<ref>International Hydrographic Organization</ref> to the south by the [[English Channel]], and to the east by the county of [[Devon]], over the [[River Tamar]]. Cornwall has a population of {{English cerem counties|POP=Cornwall}} and covers an area of {{convert|3563|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{English district population citation}}</ref><ref>{{English district area citation}}</ref> The administrative centre, and only [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in Cornwall, is [[Truro]], although the town of [[St Austell]] has a larger population.

Cornwall forms the westernmost part of the south-west peninsula of the island of Great Britain, and a large part of the [[Cornubian batholith]] is within Cornwall. This area was first inhabited in the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods. It continued to be occupied by [[Prehistoric Britain|Neolithic]] and then [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] peoples, and later (in the [[Iron Age]]) by [[Brythons]] with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring Wales and Brittany. There is little evidence that [[Roman Britain|Roman rule]] was effective west of [[Exeter]] and few Roman remains have been found. Cornwall was the home of a division of the [[Dumnonii]] tribe &ndash; whose tribal centre was in the modern county of Devon &ndash; known as the [[Cornovii (Cornish)|Cornovii]], separated from the Brythons of Wales after the [[Battle of Deorham]], often coming into conflict with the expanding English kingdom of [[Wessex]] before [[Æthelstan|King Athelstan]] in AD 936 set the boundary between English and [[Cornish people|Cornish]] at the Tamar.<ref name="Stenton, F. M. 1947 p. 337">Stenton, F. M. (1947) ''Anglo-Saxon England''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 337</ref> From the early Middle Ages, British language and culture was apparently shared by Brythons trading across both sides of the Channel, evidenced by the corresponding high medieval [[Breton people|Breton]] kingdoms of [[Domnonee]] and [[Cornouaille]] and the [[Celtic Christianity]] common to both territories.

Historically [[tin mining]] was important in the Cornish economy, becoming increasingly significant during the High Middle Ages and expanding greatly during the 19th century when rich copper mines were also in production. In the mid-19th century, however, the tin and copper mines entered a period of decline. Subsequently china clay extraction became more important and metal mining had virtually ended by the 1990s. Traditionally fishing (particularly of [[pilchards]]), and agriculture (particularly of dairy products and vegetables), were the other important sectors of the economy. The railways led to the growth of tourism during the 20th century, however, Cornwall's [[Economy of Cornwall|economy]] struggled after the decline of the [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|mining]] and [[Fishing in Cornwall|fishing]] industries. The area is noted for its wild [[moorland]] landscapes, its long and varied coastline, its many place-names derived from the [[Cornish language]], and its very mild [[Geography of Cornwall#Climate|climate]].  Extensive stretches of Cornwall's coastline, and [[Bodmin Moor]], are protected as [[Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].

Cornwall is the traditional homeland of the Cornish people and is recognised as one of the [[Celtic nations]], retaining a distinct [[Culture of Cornwall|cultural identity]] that reflects its [[History of Cornwall|history]]. Some people question the present [[constitutional status of Cornwall]], and a [[Cornish nationalism|nationalist movement]] seeks greater [[autonomy]] within the United Kingdom in the form of a devolved legislative [[Cornish Assembly|assembly]], and greater recognition of the Cornish people as a national minority.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/1704112.stm |title=Blair gets Cornish assembly call |publisher=BBC  |date=11 December 2001 |accessdate=22 May 2008}}</ref>

==Toponymy==
[[File:Saxon England according to the Saxon Chronicle.jpg|upright|thumb|"Cornweallas" shown on an early 19th-century map of "Saxon England" (and Wales) based on the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'']]
The name ''Cornwall'' derives from the combination of two separate terms from different languages. The ''Corn-'' part comes from the hypothesised original tribal name of the people who had lived here since the Iron Age, the ''[[Cornovii (Cornwall)|Cornowii]]''. The second element ''-wall'' derives from the [[Old English]] ''w(e)alh'', meaning a "foreigner" or "Welshman". The name first appears in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 891 as ''On Corn walum''. In the [[Domesday Book]] it was referred to as ''Cornualia'' and in c. 1198 as ''Cornwal''.<ref name=VW>{{cite book

|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
|edition=1st paperback|year=2010
|page=158
|isbn=978-0-521-16855-7}}</ref>

A [[latin]]isation of the name as ''Cornubia'' first appears in a mid-9th-century deed purporting to be a copy of one dating from c. 705. Another variation, with ''Wales'' reinterpreted as ''Gallia'', thus: ''Cornugallia'', is first attested in 1086. Finally, the Cornish language form of the name, ''Kernow'', which first appears around 1400, derives directly from the original ''Cornowii''.<ref name=VW />

The name ''Cornowii'' is postulated from a single mention in the [[Ravenna Cosmography]] of around 700 (but based on earlier sources) of ''Purocoronavis''. This is considered to be a corruption of ''Durocornovium'', 'a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii'.<ref>Payton (2004), p. 50.</ref> Its location is unidentified, but [[Tintagel]] or [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] have been suggested.<ref name=walesornot>{{cite web

===Prehistory, Roman and post-Roman periods===
{{See also|Dumnonia}}
The present human history of Cornwall begins with the reoccupation of Britain after the last Ice Age. The area now known as Cornwall was first inhabited in the [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] periods. It continued to be occupied by [[Prehistoric Britain|Neolithic]] and then [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]] peoples. According to [[John T. Koch]] and others, Cornwall in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-networked culture called the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]], in modern-day Ireland, England, France, Spain and Portugal.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cunliffe, Karl, Guerra, McEvoy, Bradley; Oppenheimer, Rrvik, Isaac, Parsons, Koch, Freeman and Wodtko|title=Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature|year=2010|publisher=Oxbow Books and Celtic Studies Publications|isbn=978-1-84217-410-4|page=384|url=http://www.oxbowbooks.com/bookinfo.cfm/ID/88298//Location/DBBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=A Race Apart: Insularity and Connectivity|journal= Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society|volume= 75 |year=2009 | pages=55–64 [61]|year=2008 |publisher=The Prehistoric Society}}</ref> During the [[British Iron Age]] Cornwall, like all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was inhabited by a [[Celts|Celtic]] people known as the [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]] with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring [[Wales]] and [[Brittany]]. The [[Common Brittonic]] spoken at the time eventually developed into several distinct tongues, including [[Cornish language|Cornish]].<ref>Payton (2004), p. 40.</ref>

The first account of Cornwall comes from the Sicilian Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (c. 90 BC&nbsp;– c. 30 BC), supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the 4th-century BC geographer [[Pytheas]], who had sailed to Britain:
{{quotation|The inhabitants of that part of Britain called ''Belerion'' (or Land's End) from their intercourse with foreign merchants, are civilised in their manner of life. They prepare the tin, working very carefully the earth in which it is produced ... Here then the merchants buy the tin from the natives and carry it over to [[Gaul]], and after travelling overland for about thirty days, they finally bring their loads on horses to the mouth of the Rhône.|Halliday (1959), p. 51.}}
[[Image:England Celtic tribes - South.png|thumb|right|Celtic tribes of Southern Britain]]
The identity of these merchants is unknown. It has been theorised that they were [[Phoenicia]]ns, but there is no evidence for this.<ref>Halliday (1959), p. 52.</ref> (For further discussion of tin mining see the section on the economy below.)

There is little evidence that [[Roman Britain|Roman rule]] was effective west of [[Exeter]] in [[Devon]] and few Roman remains have been found. However after [[410]], Cornwall appears to have reverted to rule by Romano-Celtic chieftains of the [[Cornovii (Cornwall)|Cornovii]] tribe as part of [[Dumnonia]] including one [[Marcus Cunomorus]] with at least one significant power base at [[Tintagel]]. 'King' [[Mark of Cornwall]] is a semi-historical figure known from Welsh literature, the [[Matter of Britain]], and in particular, the later Norman-Breton medieval romance of [[Tristan and Yseult]] where he is regarded as a close kinsman of [[King Arthur]]; himself usually considered to be born of the Cornish people in folklore traditions derived from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s [[Historia Regum Britanniae]].
Archaeology supports ecclesiatical, literary and legendary evidence for some relative economic stability and close cultural ties between the sub-Roman [[Westcountry]], South Wales, Brittany and Ireland through the fifth and sixth centuries.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/specials/the-timeline-of-britain/tintagel.htm |title=AD 500 – Tintagel |publisher=Archaeology.co.uk |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>

===Conflict with Wessex===
The [[Battle of Deorham]] in 577 saw the separation of Dumnonia (and therefore Cornwall) from Wales, following which the [[Dumnonii]] often came into conflict with the expanding English kingdom of [[Wessex]]. <!-- add Centwine and Linig here (Weatherhill, 10) -->The ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' report that in 722 AD the Britons of Cornwall won a battle at [[Battle of Hehil|"Hehil"]].<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/annalescambriae.html ''Annales Cambriae'']</ref> It seems likely that the enemy the Cornish fought was a West Saxon force, as evidenced by the naming of [[King Ine]] of Wessex and his kinsman Nonna in reference to an earlier Battle of Lining in 710.<ref>Weatherhill, Craig ''Cornovia''; p. 10</ref>

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' stated in 815 (adjusted date) "and in this year king Ecgbryht raided in Cornwall from east to west." and thenceforth apparently held it as a ducatus or dukedom annexed to his regnum or kingdom of Wessex, but not wholly incorporated with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.third-millennium-library.com/MedievalHistory/Book/CHAPTERS/XIV.html |title=The Foundation of the Kingdom of England |publisher=Third-millennium-library.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' states that in 825 (adjusted date) a battle took place between the Wealas (Cornish) and the Defnas (men of Devon) at [[Gafulforda]]. In the same year Ecgbert, as a later document expresses it, "disposed of their territory as it seemed fit to him, giving a tenth part of it to God." In other words he incorporated Cornwall [[Church polity|ecclesiastically]] with the West Saxon [[diocese of Sherborne]], and endowed [[Ealhstan]], his fighting bishop, who took part in the campaign, with an extensive Cornish estate consisting of [[Callington, Cornwall|Callington]] and [[Lawhitton]], both in the [[River Tamar|Tamar]] valley, and [[Pawton]] near [[Padstow]].

In 838, the Cornish and their Danish allies were defeated by Egbert at Hengestesdune (probably [[Hingston Down]] in Cornwall). In 875, the last recorded king of Cornwall, [[Donyarth|Dumgarth]], is said to have drowned.<ref>[[wikisource:Welsh Annals|Annales Cambriae]]</ref> Around the 880s, Anglo-Saxons from Wessex had established modest land holdings in the eastern part of Cornwall; notably [[Alfred the Great]] who had acquired a few estates.<ref>Keynes, Simon; Lapidge, Michael (tr.) (1983), ''Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and other contemporary sources'', London, Penguin Books, p. 175; cf. ''ibid'', p. 89</ref> [[William of Malmesbury]], writing around 1120, says that King [[Athelstan]] of England (924–939) fixed the boundary between English and Cornish people at the east bank of the River Tamar.<ref name="Stenton, F. M. 1947 p. 337"/>

===Norman-Breton period===
[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|right|The ancient [[Hundreds of Cornwall]]]]
One interpretation of the Domesday Book is that by this time the native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, particularly [[Harold Godwinson]] himself.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} However, the [[Bodmin manumissions]] show that two leading Cornish figures nominally had Saxon names, but these were both glossed with native Cornish names.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Naming evidence cited by medievalist [[E.M.R. Ditmas]] suggests that many post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans <ref>EMR Ditmas Breton Settlers in Cornwall after the Norman Conquest [http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1386666/llgc-id:1419899/llgc-id:1419912/getText welshjournals.llgc.org.uk]</ref> and further proposed ths period for the early composition of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] cycle by poets such as [[Beroul]] from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition.<ref>EMR Ditmas, Tristan and Iseult Twelth Century Romance by Beroul retold from Norman French 1969</ref>

Soon after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] most of the land was transferred to the new Breton-Norman aristocracy, with the lion's share going to [[Robert, Count of Mortain]], half-brother of [[William I of England|King William]] and the largest landholder in England after the king.<ref>Williams, Ann & Martin, G. H. (2002) (tr.) ''Domesday Book: a complete translation'', London: Penguin, pp. 341–357</ref> Cornwall showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of Saxon Wessex and places continued, even after 1066, to be named in the [[Celts|Celtic]] Cornish tradition with Saxon architecture being uncommon.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Later medieval administration and society===
Subsequently, however, Norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new Cornu-Norman elite. These families eventually became the new ruling class of Cornwall (typically speaking Norman French, Cornish, Latin and eventually English), many becoming involved in the operation of the [[Stannary Parliament]] system, Earldom and eventually the Duchy.<ref>Payton (2004), chapter 5.</ref> The [[Cornish language]] continued to be spoken and it acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from [[Breton language|Breton]].

==Christianity in Cornwall==
{{Main|Christianity in Cornwall}}
{{See also|List of Cornish saints}}

Many place names in Cornwall are associated with Christian missionaries described as coming from Ireland and Wales in the 5th century AD and usually called saints (''See'' [[List of Cornish saints]]). The historicity of some of these missionaries is problematic.<ref>[[Nicholas Orme|Orme, Nicholas]] (2000) ''The Saints of Cornwall''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lelant.info/uny.htm |title=uny |publisher=Lelant.info |date=2008-01-05 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref> The patron saint of [[Wendron]] Parish Church, "Saint Wendrona" is another example.</ref> and it has been pointed out by [[Gilbert Hunter Doble|Canon Doble]] that it was customary in the Middle Ages to ascribe such geographical origins to saints.<ref>[[Gilbert Hunter Doble|Doble, G. H.]] (1960) ''The Saints of Cornwall''. 5 vols. Truro: Dean and Chapter, 1960–70</ref> Some of these saints are not included in the early lists of saints.<ref>See for example absences from Olsen and Padel's "A tenth century list of Cornish parochial saints" in ''Cambridge Medieval Celtic Studies''; 12 (1986); and from ''[[Nova Legenda Angliae]]'' by [[John Capgrave]] (mid-15th century)</ref>

[[Saint Piran]], after whom [[Perranporth]] is named, is generally regarded as the patron saint of Cornwall.<ref>{{cite web| title =St. Piran – Sen Piran| publisher=St-Piran.com| url = http://www.st-piran.com/st-piran.htm| accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref> However in early Norman times it is likely that [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]] was recognised as the patron saint<ref>Henderson, Charles (1935) "Cornwall and her patron saint", In: his ''Essays in Cornish History''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; pp. 197–201</ref> and the title has also been claimed for [[Saint Petroc]].<ref>The cult of St Petroc was the most important in the [[Diocese of Cornwall]] since he was the founder of the monastery of Bodmin the most important in the diocese and, with St Germans, the seat of the bishops. He was the patron of the diocese and of Bodmin: Caroline Brett, "Petroc (fl. 6th cent.)", [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21757 accessed 16 December 2008]</ref>

===The church in Cornwall in Celtic and Anglo-Saxon times===
[[File:St Germans Church 1.jpg|thumb|St German's Priory Church (Norman)]]
[[File:Dupath well cornwall.jpg|thumb|Dupath Well, one of Cornwall's many holy wells]]
[[File:St Petroc's Church, Bodmin - geograph.org.uk - 51028.jpg|The Church of St Petroc at Bodmin (late 15th century)|thumb]]
The church in Cornwall until the time of Athelstan of Wessex observed more or less orthodox practices, being completely separate from the Anglo-Saxon church until then (and perhaps later). The See of Cornwall continued until much later: Bishop [[Conan of Cornwall|Conan]] apparently in place previously, but (re-?) consecrated in 931 AD by [[Athelstan]]. However, it is unclear whether he was the sole Bishop for Cornwall or the leading Bishop in the area. The situation in Cornwall may have been somewhat similar to Wales where each major religious house corresponded to a [[cantref]] (this has the same meaning as Cornish [[Constitutional status of Cornwall#Cornish "shires"|keverang]]) both being under the supervision of a Bishop.<ref>Charles-Edwards, T. (1970) "The Seven Bishop Houses of Dyfed," In: ''Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies'', vol. 24, (1970–1972), pp. 247–252.</ref> However if this was so the status of keverangow before the time of King Athelstan is not recorded. However it can be inferred from the districts included at this period that the minimum number would be three: Triggshire; Wivelshire; and the remaining area. Penwith, Kerrier, Pydar and Powder meet at a central point ([[Scorrier]]) which some have believed indicates a fourfold division imposed by Athelstan on a sub-kingdom.

===The church in Cornwall during the Middle Ages===
The whole of Cornwall was in this period in the [[List of Archdeacons of Cornwall|Archdeaconry of Cornwall]] within the Diocese of Exeter. From 1267 the archdeacons had a house at [[Glasney College|Glasney]] near Penryn. Their duties were to visit and inspect each parish annually and to execute the bishop's orders.<ref>Orme, Nicholas (2007) ''Cornwall and the Cross''. Chichester: Phillimore; p. 29</ref> The first recorded archdeacon was Archdeacon Roland (in the Domesday Book of 1086).<ref>Thorn, Caroline, et al., eds. (1979) ''Cornwall''. Chichester: Phillimore</ref> Most of the parish churches in Cornwall in Norman times were not in the larger settlements, and the medieval towns which developed thereafter usually had only a chapel of ease with the right of burial remaining at the ancient parish church.<ref>''Cornish Church Guide'' (1925) Truro: Blackford</ref> Over a hundred [[holy well]]s exist in Cornwall, each associated with a particular saint, though not always the same one as the dedication of the church.<ref>[[Henry Jenner|Jenner, Henry]] (1925) "The Holy Wells of Cornwall". In: ''Cornish Church Guide''. Truro: Blackford; pp. 249–257</ref><ref>[[Mabel Quiller-Couch|Quiller-Couch, M. & L.]] (1894) ''Ancient and Holy Wells of Cornwall''. London: Chas. J. Clark</ref>

Various kinds of religious houses existed in mediaeval Cornwall though none of them were nunneries; the benefices of the parishes were in many cases appropriated to religious houses within Cornwall or elsewhere in England or France.<ref>[[George Oliver (historian)|Oliver, George]] (1846) ''Monasticon Dioecesis Exoniensis: being a collection of records and instruments illustrating the ancient conventual, collegiate, and eleemosynary foundations, in the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, with historical notices, and a supplement, comprising a list of the dedications of churches in the Diocese, an amended edition of the taxation of Pope Nicholas, and an abstract of the Chantry Rolls'' [with supplement and index]. Exeter: P. A. Hannaford, 1846, 1854, 1889</ref>

===Religious history from the Reformation to the Victorian period===
In the 16th century there was some violent resistance to the replacement of Catholicism with Protestantism in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite web| title =The Prayer Book Rebellion 1549| publisher=TudorPlace.com.ar| url = http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/prayer_book_rebellion.htm| accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref> In 1548 the college at [[Glasney College|Glasney]], a centre of learning and study established by the Bishop of Exeter, had been closed and looted (many manuscripts and documents were destroyed) which aroused resentment among the Cornish. They, among other things, objected to the English language [[Book of Common Prayer]], protesting that the English language was still unknown to many at the time. The Prayer Book Rebellion was a cultural and social disaster for Cornwall; the reprisals taken by the forces of the Crown have been estimated to account for 10–11% of the civilian population of Cornwall. Culturally speaking, it saw the beginning of the slow decline of the [[Cornish language]].

From that time Christianity in Cornwall was in the main within the Church of England and subject to the national events which affected it in the next century and a half. Roman Catholicism never became extinct, though openly practised by very few; there were some converts to Puritanism, Anabaptism and Quakerism in certain areas though they suffered intermittent persecution which more or less came to an end in the reign of William and Mary. During the 18th century Cornish Anglicanism was very much in the same state as Anglicanism in most of England. Wesleyan Methodist missions began during [[John Wesley]]'s lifetime and had great success over a long period during which Methodism itself divided into a number of sects and established a definite separation from the Church of England.

[[File:Poughill Methodist Church - geograph.org.uk - 207036.jpg|thumb|Poughill Methodist Church]]
From the early 19th to the mid-20th century [[Methodism]] was the leading form of Christianity in Cornwall but it is now in decline.<ref>{{cite web| title =Methodism| publisher=Cornish-Mining.org.uk| url = http://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/story/religion.htm| accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>Shaw, Thomas (1967) ''A History of Cornish Methodism''. Truro: Bradford Barton</ref> The Church of England was in the majority from the reign of Queen Elizabeth until the Methodist revival of the 19th century: before the Wesleyan missions dissenters were very few in Cornwall. The county remained within the [[Diocese of Exeter]] until 1876 when the Anglican [[Diocese of Truro]] was created<ref>{{cite web| title =Truro Cathedral website – History page| publisher=TruroCathedral.org.uk| url = http://www.trurocathedral.org.uk/cathedral-story/story1.html| accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>Brown, H. Miles (1976) ''A Century for Cornwall''. Truro: Blackford</ref> (the first Bishop was appointed in 1877). Roman Catholicism was virtually extinct in Cornwall after the 17th century except for a few families such as the Arundells of [[St Mawgan|Lanherne]]. From the mid-19th century the church reestablished episcopal sees in England, one of these being at [[Diocese of Plymouth|Plymouth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth-diocese.org.uk/|title= Diocese of Plymouth|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref> Since then immigration to Cornwall has brought more Roman Catholics into the population.

==Physical geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cornwall|Geology of Cornwall}}
[[Image:Cw2.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image of Cornwall]]

Cornwall forms the tip of the south-west peninsula of the island of Great Britain, and is therefore exposed to the full force of the [[prevailing winds]] that blow in from the Atlantic Ocean. The coastline is composed mainly of [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] rocks that give rise in many places to impressive cliffs. Cornwall has a border with only one other county, [[Devon]].

===Coastal areas===
The north and south coasts have different characteristics. The north coast on the [[Celtic Sea]], part of the Atlantic Ocean, is more exposed and therefore has a wilder nature. The prosaically named ''High Cliff'', between [[Boscastle]] and [[St Gennys]], is the highest sheer-drop cliff in Cornwall at {{convert|223|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/main/sections/index.cfm?fsa=dspSectionDetail&w_id=147 |title=The Official Guide to the South West Coast Path |publisher=Southwestcoastpath.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> However, there are also many extensive stretches of fine golden sand which form the beaches that are so important to the tourist industry, such as those at [[Bude]], [[Polzeath]], [[Watergate Bay]], [[Perranporth]], [[Porthtowan]], [[Fistral Beach]], [[Newquay]], [[St Agnes, Cornwall|St Agnes]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], and on the south coast [[Gyllyngvase]] beach in [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]]. There are two river estuaries on the north coast: [[Hayle Estuary]] and the estuary of the [[River Camel]], which provides [[Padstow]] and [[Rock, Cornwall|Rock]] with a safe harbour.

[[Image:St-Michael Mount.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Michael's Mount]] in Marazion]]
The south coast, dubbed the "Cornish Riviera", is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages, such as at Falmouth and [[Fowey]]. Beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle, interspersed with rocky sections of [[wave-cut platform]]. Also on the south coast, the picturesque fishing village of [[Polperro]], at the mouth of the Pol River, and the fishing port of [[Looe]] on the [[River Looe]] are both popular with tourists.

===Inland areas===
The interior of the county consists of a roughly east-west spine of infertile and exposed upland, with a series of [[granite]] intrusions, such as [[Bodmin Moor]], which contains the highest land within Cornwall. From east to west, and with approximately descending altitude, these are Bodmin Moor, the area north of [[St Austell]], the area south of [[Camborne]], and the [[Penwith]] or [[Land's End]] peninsula. These intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the [[Cornubian batholith]] of south-west Britain, which also includes [[Dartmoor]] to the east in Devon and the [[Isles of Scilly]] to the west, the latter now being partially submerged.

[[Image:Porthcurno beach.jpg|thumb|Cornwall is known for its beaches (Porthcurno beach illustrated) and rugged coastline]]
The intrusion of the granite into the surrounding [[sedimentary]] rocks gave rise to extensive [[metamorphism]] and mineralisation, and this led to Cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought [[tin]] was mined here as early as the [[Bronze Age]], and copper, lead, [[zinc]] and silver have all been [[Mining in Cornwall|mined in Cornwall]]. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of [[Kaolinite|China Clay]], especially in the area to the north of St Austell, and the extraction of this remains an important industry.

The uplands are surrounded by more fertile, mainly [[pasture|pastoral]] farmland. Near the south coast, deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist, mild climate. These areas lie mainly on [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] and [[slate]]. The north east of Cornwall lies on [[Carboniferous]] rocks known as the [[Culm Measures]]. In places these have been subjected to severe folding, as can be seen on the north coast near [[Crackington Haven]] and in several other locations.

===The Lizard Peninsula===
{{Main|Lizard complex}}
The [[Geology of Lizard, Cornwall|geology of the Lizard peninsula]] is unusual, in that it is mainland Britain's only example of an [[ophiolite]], a section of oceanic crust now found on land.<ref>Britain's only other example on an ophiolite, the Shetland ophiolite, is older, and linked to the Grampian [[Orogeny]]</ref> Much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red [[Precambrian]] [[serpentinite]], which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at [[Kynance Cove]], and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This [[ultramafic rock]] also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the [[Cornish Heath]], which has been adopted as the [[county flower]].<ref>Cornwall County Council, "[http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5430 The County Flower]."</ref>

===Ecology===
{{See also|Flora and fauna of Cornwall}}

Cornwall has varied habitats including terrestrial and marine ecosystems. One noted species in decline locally is the [[Reindeer lichen]], which species has been made a priority for protection under the national UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]].<ref>Price, J. H., Hepton, C. E. L. and Honey, S. I. (1979). ''The Inshore Benthic Biota of the Lizard Peninsula'', south west Cornwall: the marine algae – History; Chlorophyta; Phaeophyta.

[[Image:Choughfly816.jpg|thumb|Red-billed chough: ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'']]

Botanists divide Cornwall and Scilly into two vice-counties: West (1) and East (2). The standard flora is by [[F. H. Davey]] ''Flora of Cornwall'' (1909). Davey was assisted by [[A. O. Hume]] and he thanks Hume, his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for help in the compilation of that Flora, publication of which was financed by him.

===Climate===
{{Main|Geography of Cornwall#Climate}}
Cornwall has a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Cfb) and has the mildest and sunniest climate in the United Kingdom, as a result of its southerly latitude and the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif Annual average temperature for the United Kingdom].</ref> The average annual temperature in Cornwall ranges from 11.6&nbsp;°C (53&nbsp;°F) on the [[Isles of Scilly]] to 9.8&nbsp;°C (50&nbsp;°F) in the central uplands. Winters are amongst the warmest in the country due to the southerly latitude and moderating effects of the warm ocean currents, and frost and snow are very rare at the coast and are also rare in the central upland areas. Summers are however not as warm as those of other parts of southern England. The surrounding sea and its southwesterly position mean that Cornwall's weather can be relatively changeable.

Cornwall is one of the sunniest areas in the UK, with over 1541 hours of sunshine per year, with the highest average of 7.6 hours of sunshine per day in July.<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif Annual average sunshine for the United Kingdom].</ref> The moist, mild air coming from the south west brings higher amounts of rainfall than in eastern Great Britain, at 1051 to 1290&nbsp;mm (41.4 to 50.8&nbsp;in) per year, however not as much as in more northern areas of the west coast.<ref>Met Office, 2000. [http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif Annual average rainfall for the United Kingdom].</ref> The Isles of Scilly, for example, where there are on average less than 2 days of air frost per year, is the only area in the UK to be in the [[USDA]] [[Hardiness zone]] 10. In Scilly there is on average less than 1 day of air temperature exceeding 30&nbsp;°C per year and it is in the AHS Heat Zone 1. Extreme temperatures in Cornwall are particularly rare; however, extreme weather in the form of storms and floods is common.

[[File:CornwallConstituencies2010.gif|thumb|From the 2010 general election, Cornwall has had six parliamentary constituencies]]
With the exception of the [[Isles of Scilly]], Cornwall is now governed by a [[unitary authority]] known as [[Cornwall Council]] which is based in [[Truro]]. The only Crown Court is based at the Courts of Justice in Truro. Magistrates' Courts are to be found in Truro (but at a different location to the Crown Court); Bodmin; Penzance and Liskeard.

The Isles of Scilly form part of the [[ceremonial county]] of Cornwall and have, at times, been served by the same county administration. However, since 1890 they have been administered by their own [[unitary authority]], now known as the Council of the Isles of Scilly. They are still grouped with Cornwall for other administrative purposes, such as the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] and [[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary|Devon and Cornwall Police]].<ref name=iosuatt>{{cite web| title = Isles of Scilly; Cornwall through time | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10076742&c_id=10171878 | publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk | accessdate =19 January 2007}}</ref><ref name=iosrdtt>{{cite web| title = Isles of Scilly RD; Cornwall through time | url = http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10026210&c_id=10001043 | publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk | accessdate =19 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Before reorganisation on 1 April 2009, council functions throughout the rest of Cornwall were organised on a two-tier basis, with a county council and district councils for the six districts of [[Caradon]], [[Carrick, Cornwall|Carrick]], [[Kerrier]], [[North Cornwall]], [[Penwith]], and [[Restormel]]. While projected to streamline services, cut red tape and save around £17&nbsp;million a year, the reorganisation was met with wide opposition, with a poll in 2008 giving a result of 89% disapproval from Cornish residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=37570 |title=One Cornwall – A unified council for Cornwall |publisher=Cornwall County Council |accessdate=22 May 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.onecornwall.cornwall.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=44400]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|publisher=BBC | title = Cornwall super-council go-ahead| date = 25 July 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6914947.stm| accessdate =25 July 2007 }}</ref>

The [[Cornwall Council election, 2009|first elections]] for the new unitary authority were held on 4 June 2009. The new council has 123 seats; the largest party (in 2012) is the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] with 46, followed by the [[Liberal Democrats]] with 37, [[Independent (politics)|Independent]]s with 23, [[Mebyon Kernow]] with 6 seats, 1 standalone independent and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] with 1 seat. There are currently 2 vacant seats.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Cornwall Council – Councillors|publisher=[[Cornwall Council]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}</ref>

Before the creation of the new unitary council, the former county council had 82 seats, the majority of which were held by the Liberal Democrats, elected at the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2005|2005 county council elections]]. The six former districts in Cornwall had a total of 249 council seats, and the groups with greatest numbers of councillors were Liberal Democrats, Conservatives, and Independents.

===Parliament and national politics===
Following a review by the [[Boundary Commission for England]] taking effect at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Cornwall is divided into six [[county constituencies]] to elect MPs to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

Before the 2010 boundary changes there were five constituencies in Cornwall, all of which were won by [[Liberal Democrats]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]]. However, at the 2010 general election Liberal Democrat candidates won three constituencies and Conservative candidates won three constituencies (''see also [[2010 United Kingdom general election result in Cornwall]]'').

Until 1832, Cornwall had 44 MPs &ndash; more than any other county &ndash; reflecting the importance of tin to the Crown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba31/ba31regs.html |title=British Archaeology, no 30, December 1997: Letters |publisher=Britarch.ac.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> Most of the increase came between 1529 and 1584 after which there was no change until 1832.<ref>[[A. L. Rowse|Rowse, A. L.]] (1941) ''Tudor Cornwall''. London: Cape; pp. 91–94</ref>

The chief registered parties contesting elections in Cornwall are Conservatives, [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]], Labour, Liberal Democrats, Mebyon Kernow, Liberal Party and the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP).

In 2007 [[David Cameron]], leader of the Conservative Party, in a departure from the Conservative Party's traditionally [[British Unionism|unionist]] stance, appointed Cornishman [[Mark Prisk]], MP for Hertford, Hertfordshire, England, as "[[Shadow Minister for Cornwall]]". This appointment was called "the fictional minister for Cornwall", by a Liberal Democrat MP, as there was no government minister to shadow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2009/03/conservative-party-local-mps |title=The fictional minister for Cornwall |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> The post was not continued following the 2010 election, and no longer exists.

===Self-rule movement===
Cornish nationalists have organised into two political parties: Mebyon Kernow, formed in 1951, and the [[Cornish Nationalist Party]]. In addition to the political parties, there are various interest groups such as the [[Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament]] and the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]]. The Cornish Constitutional Convention was formed in 2000 as a cross-party organisation including representatives from the private, public and voluntary sectors to campaign for the creation of a [[Cornish Assembly]],<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref name=ccc>{{cite web|author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/about.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly – Senedh Kernow |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |date=3 April 2005 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> along the lines of the [[National Assembly for Wales]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]]. Between 5 March 2000 and December 2001, the campaign collected the signatures of 41,650 Cornish residents endorsing the call for a devolved assembly, along with 8,896 signatories from outside Cornwall. The resulting petition was presented to the then Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />  The Liberal Democrats recognise Cornwall's claims for greater autonomy, as do the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]].

An additional political issue is the recognition of the [[Cornish people]] as a minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clip.local.gov.uk/lgv/core/page.do?pageId=40416 |title=Minutes for the Census Sub-Group Meeting held on 23 November 2006 |publisher=Central & Local Information Partnership |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=23 May 2008}}</ref>

==Cornish national identity==
{{Further|Cornish nationalism}}
Cornwall is recognised by several organisations, including the Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]], the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] and the [[Celtic Congress|International Celtic Congress]], as one of the six Celtic nations, alongside [[Brittany]], Ireland, the [[Isle of Man]], Scotland and Wales.<ref name="Teverson">{{cite web

Cornwall Council consider Cornwall's unique cultural heritage and distinctiveness to be one of the area's major assets. They see Cornwall's language; landscape; Celtic identity; political history; patterns of settlement; maritime tradition; industrial heritage; and non-conformist tradition, to be among the features comprising its "distinctive" culture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cornwall Council – part three |url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=14923 |accessdate=10 February&nbsp;2011 |publisher=[[Cornwall Council]] |date=18 March&nbsp;2010 |work=[[Cornwall Council]] website }}</ref> However, it is uncertain how many of the people living in Cornwall consider themselves to be Cornish; results from different surveys (including the national census) have varied. In the 2001 census, 7 percent of people in Cornwall identified themselves as Cornish, rather than British or English. However, activists have argued that this underestimated the true number as there was no explicit "Cornish" option included in the official census form.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-cornish-they-revolted-in-1497-now-theyre-at-it-again-1782535.html|title=The Cornish: they revolted in 1497, now they're at it again|last=Dugan|first=Emily|date=6 September 2009|publisher=Independent (The)|accessdate=14 July 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Subsequent surveys have suggested that as many as 44 percent identify as Cornish.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3527673.stm|title=Welsh are more patriotic|date=3 March 2004|publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> Many people in Cornwall say that this issue would be resolved if a Cornish option became available on the census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/recommended-questions---national-identity.pdf|title=Information paper: Recommended questions for the 2009 Census Rehearsal and 2011 Census: National Identity|format=PDF|publisher=Office for National Statistics|page=32|month=December | year=2008|accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref> The question and content recommendations for the 2011 Census provided an explanation of the process of selecting an ethnic identity which is relevant to the understanding of the often quoted figure of 37,000 who claim Cornish identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/question-and-content-recommendations-for-2011/ethnic-group-prioritisation-tool.pdf|title=2011 Census; 2011 census questionnaire content; question and content recommendations for 2011; ethnic group prioritisation tool|pages=20–22|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>

==Settlements and communication==
{{See also|Transport in Cornwall|Media in Cornwall}}
[[Image:Truro stmarysst.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Truro]], Cornwall's administrative centre]]

Cornwall's only city, and the home of the [[Cornwall Council|council headquarters]], is [[Truro]]. Nearby [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] is notable as a port, while other ports such as [[Penzance]], the most westerly coastal town in England, [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] and [[Padstow]] have declined. [[Newquay]] on the north coast is famous for its beaches and is a popular surfing destination, as is [[Bude]] further north. [[St Austell]] is Cornwall's largest town and more populous than the capital Truro; it was the centre of the [[kaolin|china clay]] industry in Cornwall. [[Redruth]] and [[Camborne]] together form the largest urban area in Cornwall, and both towns were significant as centres of the global tin mining industry in the 19th century (nearby copper mines were also very productive during that period).

Cornwall borders the county of [[Devon]] at the River Tamar. Major road links between Cornwall and the rest of Great Britain are the [[A38 road|A38]] which crosses the Tamar at [[Plymouth]] via the [[Tamar Bridge]] and the town of [[Saltash]], the [[A39 road]] (Atlantic Highway) from [[Barnstaple]], passing through [[North Cornwall]] to end eventually in Falmouth, and the [[A30 road|A30]] which crosses the border south of [[Launceston, England|Launceston]]. [[Torpoint Ferry]] also links Plymouth with the town of [[Torpoint]] on the opposite side of the [[Hamoaze]]. A rail bridge, the [[Royal Albert Bridge]], built by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] (1859) provides the only other major transport link. The major city of Plymouth being the large urban centre closest to east Cornwall has made it an important location for such services as hospitals, department stores, road and rail transport, and cultural venues.

[[Newquay Cornwall International Airport]] provides an airlink to the rest of the UK, Ireland and Europe.

[[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]], across the Bristol Channel, are connected to Cornwall by ferry, usually to Padstow. Swansea in particular has several boat companies who can arrange boat trips to north Cornwall, which allow the traveller to pass by the north Cornish coastline, including [[Tintagel Castle]] and Padstow harbour. Very occasionally, the ''[[PS Waverley|Waverley]]'' and ''[[MV Balmoral|Balmoral]]'' paddle steamers cruise from Swansea or [[Bristol]] to Padstow.

The [[Isles of Scilly]] are served by ferry (from Penzance) and by aeroplane ([[Land's End Airport]], near St Just) and from Newquay Airport. Further flights to [[St Mary's Airport (Isles of Scilly)|St. Mary's Airport]], Isles of Scilly, are available from [[Exeter International Airport]] in Devon.

==Flag==
{{Main|Saint Piran's Flag}}
[[Image:Pamiatka z Kornwalii.jpg|thumb|right|Souvenir flags outside a Cornish café]]
Saint Piran's Flag is regarded by many as the national flag of Cornwall,<ref name="Rendle">{{cite web|url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Phil%20Rendle.pdf|title=Cornwall – The Mysteries of St Piran|last=Rendle|first=Phil|work=Proceedings of the XIX International Congress of Vexillology|format=PDF|publisher=The Flag Institute|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="fotw">{{cite web| url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/gb-corn.html| title=Cross of Saint Piran|publisher=Flags of the World (FOTW)|accessdate=17 January 2010}}</ref> and an emblem of the Cornish people; and by others as the county flag. The banner of [[Saint Piran]] is a white cross on a black background (in terms of [[heraldry]] 'sable, a cross argent'). Saint Piran is supposed to have adopted these two colours from seeing the white tin in the black coals and ashes during his supposed discovery of tin. [[Davies Gilbert]] in 1826 described it as anciently the flag of St Piran and the banner of Cornwall,<ref>Payton (2004), p. 262.</ref> and another history of 1880 said that: "The white cross of St. Piran was the ancient banner of the Cornish people." The Cornish flag is an exact reverse of the former [[Brittany|Breton]] national flag (black cross) and is known by the same name "Kroaz Du".

There are also claims that the patron saint of Cornwall is [[Saint Michael]] or [[Saint Petroc]], but Saint Piran is by far the most popular of the three and his emblem is internationally<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-corn.html |title=Cornwall (United Kingdom) |publisher=Crwflags.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flags.net/UNKG12.htm#UNKG7400 |title=British Flags (United Kingdom) from The World Flag Database |publisher=Flags.net |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> recognised as the flag of Cornwall. [[St Piran's Day]] (5 March) is celebrated by the [[Cornish diaspora]] around the world.

Cornwall is one of the poorest parts of the United Kingdom in terms of per capita [[GDP]] and average household incomes. At the same time, parts of the county, especially on the coast, have high house prices, driven up by demand from relatively wealthy retired people and second-home owners.<ref name=Indypoverty>{{cite news|last=Dugan|first=Emily|title=Cornwall: A land of haves, and have nots|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/cornwall-a-land-of-haves-and-have-nots-878274.html|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> The [[Gross value added|GVA]] per head was 65% of the UK average for 2004.<ref>ONS December 2006</ref> The GDP per head for Cornwall and the [[Isles of Scilly]] was 79.2% of the EU-27 average for 2004, the UK per head average was 123.0%.<ref>Eurostat</ref>

Historically [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|mining of tin]] (and later also of copper) was important in the Cornish economy. The first reference to this appears to be by Pytheas: ''see above''. [[Julius Caesar]] was the last classical writer to mention the [[tin]] trade, which appears to have declined during the Roman occupation.<ref>Halliday (1959), p. 69.</ref> The tin trade revived in the Middle Ages and its importance to the Kings of England resulted in certain privileges being granted to the tinners; the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] is attributed to grievances of the tin miners.<ref>Halliday (1959), p. 182.</ref> In the mid-19th century, however, the tin trade again fell into decline. Other [[primary industries]] that have declined since the 1960s include [[china clay]] production, fishing and farming.

Today, the Cornish economy depends heavily on its tourist industry, which makes up around a quarter of the economy. The official measures of deprivation and poverty at district and 'sub-ward' level show that there is great variation in poverty and prosperity in Cornwall with some areas among the poorest in England and others among the top half in prosperity. For example, the ranking of 32,482 sub-wards in England in the index of multiple deprivation (2006) ranged from 819th (part of Penzance East) to 30,899th (part of Saltash Burraton in Caradon), where the lower number represents the greater deprivation.<ref>[http://www.cornwallstatistics.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=35740 ''Poverty and deprivation in Cornwall'' (June 2006)] and {{PDFlink|[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/Regional%20poverty_files/cornw/02SPA.pdf ''Poverty and neighbourhood renewal in west Cornwall'' (January 2002)]|756&nbsp;KB}}</ref>

Cornwall is one of four UK areas that qualify for poverty-related grants from the EU: it was granted [[Objective 1]] status by the [[European Commission]], followed by a further round of funding known as 'Convergence Funding'.

===Tourism===
Tourism is estimated to contribute up to 24% of Cornwall's gross domestic product.<ref>[http://db.cornwall.gov.uk/ltp/marchannex2/chapter_57.html Cornwall Council: Cornwall's Challenges and Concerns – The Evidence Base]. Retrieved 21 June 2011</ref> Cornwall's unique culture, spectacular landscape and mild climate make it a popular tourist destination, despite being somewhat distant from the United Kingdom's main centres of population. Surrounded on three sides by the [[English Channel]] and [[Celtic Sea]], Cornwall has many miles of beaches and cliffs; the [[South West Coast Path]] follows a complete circuit of both coasts. Other tourist attractions include moorland, country gardens, museums, historic and prehistoric sites, and wooded valleys. Five million tourists visit Cornwall each year, mostly drawn from within the UK.<ref>Visit Cornwall, 2007. {{PDFlink| The total number of visitors to the county includes those on business and visiting relatives. ''[http://www.visitcornwall.com/xsdbimgs/Tourism%20in%20Cornwall%202007.pdf Tourism in Cornwall]''|216&nbsp;KB}}</ref> Visitors to Cornwall are served by airports at [[Newquay]] and [[Exeter]], whilst private jets, charters and helicopters are also served by [[Perranporth]] airfield; nightsleeper and daily rail services run between Cornwall, London and other regions of the UK. Cornwall has a tourism-based [[seasonal economy]]

Newquay and [[Porthtowan]] are popular destinations for surfers. In recent years, the [[Eden Project]] near [[St Austell]] has been a major financial success, drawing one in eight of Cornwall's visitors.<ref>Scottish Executive, 2004. ''[http://www.scottishexecutive.gov.uk/library5/education/lrcas-14.asp A literature review of the evidence base for culture, the arts and sport policy]''.</ref>

===Internet===
Although Cornwall is remote and residential broadband is less common than in other parts of the UK it houses one of the world's fastest high-speed transatlantic fibre optic cables, making Cornwall an important hub within Europe's Internet infrastructure.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1196775/Web-trouble-The-hidden-cables-Cornish-beach-feeding-worlds-internet.html Web in trouble?

===Other industries===
[[Image:Tin-mining-cornwall-c1890.jpg|thumb|right|Redruth Mine in 1890]]
Other industries are [[Fishing in Cornwall|fishing]], although this has been significantly re-structured by EU fishing policies (the Southwest Handline Fishermen's Association has started to revive the fishing industry),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linecaught.org.uk/links.htm |title=Line-caught wild bass from Cornwall – South West Handline Fishermen's Association |publisher=Linecaught.org.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> and agriculture, which has also declined significantly. Mining of tin and copper was also an industry, but today the derelict mine workings survive only as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1215 UNESCO Page on the Cornwall & West Devon application]</ref> However, the [[Camborne School of Mines]], which was relocated to [[Tremough|Penryn]] in 2004, is still a world centre of excellence in the field of mining and applied geology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uec.ac.uk/csm/ |title=The University of Exeter – Cornwall Campus – Camborne School of Mines |publisher=Uec.ac.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> and the grant of World Heritage status has attracted funding for conservation and heritage tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornish-mining.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Cornish-mining.org.uk |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> [[China clay]] extraction has also been an important industry in the St Austell area, but this sector has been in decline, and this, coupled with increased mechanisation, has led to a decrease in employment in this sector, although the industry still employs around 2,133 people in Cornwall, and generates over £80 Million to the local economy <ref>Imerys Minerals Ltd (2003) ''Blueprint: Vision for the Future''</ref>

==Demographics==
{{main|Demography of Cornwall}}
[[Image:Cornwall population.png|thumb|Graph showing Cornwall's population from 1800 to 2000]]
Cornwall's population was 535,300 at the last count (2010), and population density 144 people per square kilometre, ranking it 40th and 41st respectively compared with the other 47 counties of England. Cornwall is 95.7% [[White British]] and has a relatively high level of population growth. At 11.2% in the 1980s and 5.3% in the 1990s, it has the fifth highest population growth of the English counties.<ref>Office for National Statistics, 2001. [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Facts/fact2.htm Population Change in England by County 1981–2000].</ref> The natural change has been a small population decline, and the population increase is due to inward migration into Cornwall.<ref>Office for National Statistics, 2001. [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Facts/fact74.htm Births, Deaths and Natural Change in Cornwall 1974&nbsp;– 2001].</ref> According to the 1991 census, the population was 469,800.

Cornwall has a relatively high retired population, with 22.9% of pensionable age, compared with 20.3% for the United Kingdom.<ref>Office for National Statistics, 1996. [http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/Transport/Ltp/Tables/Table004.htm % of Population of Pension Age (1996)].</ref> This may be due to a combination of Cornwall's rural and coastal geography increasing its popularity as a retirement location, and outward migration of younger residents to more economically diverse areas.

==Education system==
{{see also|List of schools in Cornwall}}
Cornwall has a comprehensive education system, with 31 state and 8 independent [[secondary school]]s. There are three further education colleges: [[Penwith College]] (a former sixth form college), [[Cornwall College]] (occupying the former home of the Camborne School of Mines) and [[Truro College]]. The Isles of Scilly only has one school while the former Restormel district has the highest school population, and school year sizes are around 200, with none above 270.

Higher education is provided by [[Falmouth University]], the [[University of Exeter]] (including [[Camborne School of Mines]]), the [[Combined Universities in Cornwall]], and by Truro College, Penwith College (which combined in 2008 to make [[Truro and Penwith College]]) and Cornwall College.

==Languages and dialects==
English is the main language used in Cornwall, although the revived [[Cornish language]] may be seen on road signs and is spoken fluently by a small minority of people.

===Cornish language===
[[File:Penzansagasdynerghcrop.jpeg|right|thumb|A [[welcome sign]] to [[Penzance]], in the English and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] languages]]
{{Main|Cornish language}}
The Cornish language is closely related to the other [[Brythonic languages]] of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]], and less so to the [[Goidelic languages]] of [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]] and [[Manx language|Manx]]. The language continued to function visibly as a community language in parts of Cornwall until the late 18th century, and it was claimed in 2011 that the last native speaker did not die until 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Legend-Dolly-Pentreath-outlived-native-tongue/story-13069391-detail/story.html|title=Legend of Dolly Pentreath outlived her native tongue|publisher=This is Cornwall|date=4 August 2011|accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref>

There has been a revival of the language since [[Henry Jenner]]'s ''Handbook of the Cornish Language'' was published in 1904. A study in 2000 suggested that there were around 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently.<ref>[http://www.gosw.gov.uk/gosw/docs/254795/mode_of_use.doc]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Cornish, however, had no legal status in the UK until 2002.

Since the 19th century, Cornwall, with its unspoilt maritime scenery and strong light, has sustained a vibrant visual art scene of international renown. Artistic activity within Cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of [[Newlyn]], most active at the turn of the 20th century. This [[Newlyn School]] is associated with the names of [[Stanhope Forbes]], [[Elizabeth Forbes (artist)|Elizabeth Forbes]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Elizabeth Adela Forbes | publisher=PenleeHouse.org.uk | url=http://www.penleehouse.org.uk/artists/elizabeth-forbes.htm | accessdate=11 May 2007 }}</ref> [[Norman Garstin]] and [[Lamorna Birch]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Samuel John Lamorna Birch | publisher=HayleGallery.co.uk | url=http://www.haylegallery.co.uk/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=59 | accessdate=11 May 2007 }}</ref> Modernist writers such as [[D.

===Music and festivals===
{{Main|Music of Cornwall}}
Cornwall has a full and vibrant [[folk music]] tradition which has survived into the present and is well known for its unusual folk survivals such as [[Mummers Play]]s, the [[Furry Dance]] in [[Helston]] played by the famous [[Helston Town Band]], and [[Obby Oss]] in [[Padstow]].

As in other former mining districts of Britain, male voice choirs and [[Brass band (British style)|Brass Band]]s, e.g. ''Brass on the Grass'' concerts during the summer at [[Constantine, Kerrier|Constantine]], are still very popular in Cornwall: Cornwall also has around 40 brass bands, including the six-times National Champions of Great Britain, Camborne Youth Band, and the bands of [[Lanner, Cornwall|Lanner]] and St Dennis.

Cornish players are regular participants in inter-Celtic festivals, and Cornwall itself has several lively inter-Celtic festivals such as [[Perranporth]]'s Lowender Peran folk festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.an-daras.com |title=An-Daras.com}}</ref>

On a more modern note, contemporary musician [[Aphex Twin|Richard D. James]] (also known as Aphex Twin) grew up in Cornwall, as did [[Luke Vibert]] and [[Alex Parks]] winner of [[Fame Academy]] 2003. [[Roger Taylor (Queen)|Roger Taylor]], the drummer from the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was also raised in the county, and currently lives not far from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]].

===Literature===
Cornwall's rich heritage and dramatic landscape have inspired writers since the 19th century.

====Fiction====
[[Arthur Quiller-Couch|Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch]], author of many novels and works of literary criticism, lived in Fowey: his novels are mainly set in Cornwall. [[Daphne du Maurier]] lived at [[Menabilly]] near Fowey and many of her novels had Cornish settings, including ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'', ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]'', ''[[Frenchman's Creek (novel)|Frenchman's Creek]]'', ''[[My Cousin Rachel]]'', and ''[[The House on the Strand]]''.<ref>{{cite web| title =Daphne du Maurier  | publisher=DuMaurier.org| url = http://www.DuMaurier.org/  | accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref> She is also noted for writing ''Vanishing Cornwall''.

====Poetry====
[[Image:ForTheFallenPlaqueCornwall.jpg|thumb|'For The Fallen' plaque with [[The Rumps]] promontory beyond]]
The late [[Poet Laureate]] [[John Betjeman|Sir John Betjeman]] was famously fond of Cornwall and it featured prominently in his poetry. He is buried in the churchyard at [[St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick]].<ref>{{cite web| title =St Enodoc Church| publisher=RockInfo.co.uk| url = http://www.rockinfo.co.uk/daymer/stenochc.html| accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref>
[[Charles Causley]], the poet, was born in Launceston and is perhaps the best known of Cornish poets. [[Jack Clemo]] and the scholar [[A. L. Rowse]] were also notable Cornishmen known for their poetry; The Rev. [[Robert Stephen Hawker|R. S. Hawker]] of Morwenstow wrote some poetry which was very popular in the Victorian period. The Scottish poet [[W. S. Graham]] lived in West Cornwall from 1944 until his death in 1986.<ref>{{cite web| title =William Sydney Graham | publisher=CPRW.com| url = http://www.cprw.com/Drexel/graham.htm| accessdate =11 May 2007 }}</ref>

The poet [[Laurence Binyon]] wrote "For the Fallen" (first published in 1914) while sitting on the cliffs between [[Pentire Point]] and The Rumps and a stone plaque was erected in 2001 to commemorate the fact. The plaque bears the inscription "FOR THE FALLEN / Composed on these cliffs, 1914". The plaque also bears below this the fourth stanza (sometimes referred to as [[Ode of Remembrance|"The Ode"]]) of the poem:
:''They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old''
:''Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn''<!-- "Condemn" is in fact the correct word. See the talk page for more. -->
:''At the going down of the sun and in the morning''
:''We will remember them''

====Other literary works====
Cornwall produced a substantial number of [[passion play]]s such as the [[Ordinalia]] during the Middle Ages. Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the Cornish language. See also [[Cornish literature]]

Prolific writer [[Colin Wilson]], best known for his debut work ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' (1956) and for ''[[The Mind Parasites]]'' (1967), lives in [[Gorran Haven]], a small village on the southern Cornish coast. The writer [[D. M. Thomas]] was born in Redruth but lived and worked in Australia and the United States before returning to his native Cornwall. He has written novels, poetry, and other works, including translations from Russian.

[[Thomas Hardy]]'s drama ''The Queen of Cornwall'' (1923) is a version of the Tristan story; the second act of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' takes place in Cornwall, as do [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s operettas ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]''.

With its comparatively small, and largely rural population, major contribution by the Cornish to national [[sport in the United Kingdom]] has been limited.<ref name="Clegg10">{{harvnb|Clegg|2005|p=10}}.</ref> There are no teams affiliated to the [[Cornwall County Football Association]] that play in [[the Football League]] of [[England and Wales]], and the [[Cornwall County Cricket Club]] plays as one of the [[minor counties of English cricket]].<ref name="Clegg10"/> Viewed as an "important identifier of ethnic affiliation", [[rugby union]] has become a sport strongly tied to notions of Cornishness.<ref name="Harv221">{{cite book |author=Harvey, David |year= 2002 |title=Celtic Geographies: Old Culture, New Times |location=London |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-22396-6|page=221}}</ref> and since the 20th century, [[rugby union in Cornwall]] has emerged as one of the most popular spectator and team sports in Cornwall (perhaps the most popular), with professional Cornish rugby footballers being described as a "formidable force",<ref name="Clegg10"/> "naturally independent, both in thought and deed, yet paradoxically staunch English patriots whose top players have represented England with pride and passion".<ref name="CornishRug">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/3247717/Cornish-rugby-union-celebrate-125-years-of-pride-and-passion---but-are-they-the-lost-tribe-Rugby.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|title=Cornish rugby union celebrate 125 years of pride and passion &ndash; but are they the lost tribe?|first=Brendan|last=Gallagher|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=7 September 2009 |ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In 1985, sports journalist [[Alan Gibson]] made a direct connection between love of rugby in Cornwall and the ancient parish games of hurling and wrestling that existed for centuries before rugby officially began.<ref name="CornishRug"/> Among Cornwall's native sports are a distinctive form of Celtic wrestling related to [[Brittany|Breton]] wrestling, and [[Hurling the Silver Ball|Cornish hurling]], a kind of mediaeval football played with a silver ball (distinct from [[Hurling|Irish Hurling]]). [[Cornish Wrestling]] is Cornwall's oldest sport and as Cornwall's native tradition it has travelled the world to places like [[Victoria, Australia]] and [[Grass Valley, California]] following the miners and [[gold rushes]]. Cornish hurling now takes place at [[St. Columb Major]], [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], and less frequently at [[Bodmin]].<ref>The Bodmin hurl is held whenever the ceremony of [[beating the bounds]] takes place: each occasion must be five years or more after the last one.</ref>

====Surfing and other water sports====

Due to its long coastline, various maritime sports are popular in Cornwall, notably sailing and [[surfing]]. International events in both are held in Cornwall. Cornwall hosted the Inter-Celtic [[Watersports]] Festival in 2006. Surfing in particular is very popular, as locations such as [[Bude]] and [[Newquay]] offer some of the best surf in the UK. [[Cornish pilot gig|Pilot gig]] rowing has been popular for many years and the World championships takes place annually on the [[Isles of Scilly]]. On 2 September 2007, 300 surfers at [[Polzeath]] beach set a new world record for the highest number of surfers riding the same wave as part of the Global Surf Challenge and part of a project called Earthwave to raise awareness about [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6974667.stm |title=BBC NEWS, Surfers aim to break world record |publisher=BBC News  |date=2 September 2007 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cornish cuisine}}
Cornwall has a strong culinary heritage. Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available; [[Newlyn]] is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.objectiveone.com/client/media/media-611.htm |title=Objective One media release |publisher=Objectiveone.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> Television chef [[Rick Stein]] has long operated a fish restaurant in [[Padstow]] for this reason, and [[Jamie Oliver]] recently chose to open his second restaurant, [[Fifteen (restaurant)|Fifteen]], in [[Watergate Bay]] near [[Newquay]]. [[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]] host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield, [[John Torode]], in 2007 purchased Seiners in [[Perranporth]]. One famous local fish dish is [[Stargazy pie]], a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though "star-gazing". The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for [[Tom Bawcock's Eve]], but is not generally eaten at any other time.

[[Image:Cornish pasty - cut.jpeg|thumb|right|A [[Pasty|Cornish pasty]]]]
Cornwall is perhaps best known though for its [[pasty|pasties]], a savoury dish made with pastry. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and [[Rutabaga|swede]] with salt and white pepper, but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings. "Turmut, 'tates and mate" (i.e. "Turnip, potatoes and meat", turnip being the local term for swede) describes a filling once very common. For instance, the licky pasty contained mostly leeks, and the herb pasty contained watercress, parsley, and shallots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanrichards.org/cornish3.htm |title=Cornish recipe site |publisher=Alanrichards.org |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> Pasties are often locally referred to as ''oggies''. Historically, pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam, apple and blackberry, plums or cherries.<ref name=Martin>{{Cite book| last=Martin | first=Edith | title=Cornish Recipes, Ancient & Modern. 22nd edition, 1965|year=1929 }}</ref>
The wet climate and relatively poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops. However, it is ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading to the production of Cornwall's other famous export, [[clotted cream]]. This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish [[fudge]] and Cornish [[ice cream]]. Cornish clotted cream has [[Protected Geographical Status]] under EU law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/en/uk_en.htm |title=Official list of British protected foods |publisher=Europa.eu.int |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> and cannot be made anywhere else. Its principal manufacturer is Rodda's, based at [[Scorrier]].

Local cakes and desserts include [[Saffron bun|Saffron cake]], [[Heavy cake|Cornish heavy (''hevva'') cake]], [[Cornish fairings]] biscuits, figgy 'obbin, [[Cream tea]] and whortleberry pie.<ref>Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith.

There are also many types of beers brewed in Cornwall&nbsp;– those produced by [[Sharp's Brewery]], [[Skinner's Brewery]] and [[St Austell Brewery]] are the best-known – including [[stout]]s, [[ale]]s and other beer types. There is some small scale production of wine, [[mead]] and [[cider]].
