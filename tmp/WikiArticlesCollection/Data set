{{about||IBM mainframe term for a file|Data set (IBM mainframe)|the telecommunications interface device|Modem}}

A '''dataset''' (or '''data set''') is a collection of [[data]].

Most commonly a dataset corresponds to the contents of a single [[table (database)|database table]], or a single statistical [[data matrix (multivariate statistics)|data matrix]], where each [[column (database)|column]] of the table represents a particular variable, and each [[row (database)|row]] corresponds to a given member of the dataset in question. The dataset lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the dataset.  Each value is known as a [[datum]]. The dataset may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows.

The term dataset may also be used more loosely, to refer to the data in a collection of closely related tables, corresponding to a particular experiment or event.

==History==
Historically, the term originated in the [[mainframe computer|mainframe field]], where it had a [[Data set (IBM mainframe)|well-defined meaning]], very close to contemporary ''[[computer file]]''{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

==Properties==
Several characteristics define a dataset's structure and properties.  These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various [[statistical measure]]s applicable to them, such as [[standard deviation]] and [[kurtosis]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uTzeRZFmaBgC&pg=PA100 |title=Principles of data mining and knowledge discovery |author=Jan M. Å»ytkow, Jan Rauch |postscript=<!--None--> |isbn=978-3-540-66490-1 |year=1999}}</ref>

In the simplest case, there is only one variable, and the dataset consists of a single column of values, often represented as a list. In spite of the name, such a [[univariate]] dataset is not a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] in the usual mathematical sense, since a given value may occur multiple times. Usually the order does not matter, and then the collection of values may be considered a [[multiset]] rather than an (ordered) list{{Or|date=August 2009}}.

The values may be numbers, such as [[real number]]s or [[integer]]s, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be [[nominal data]] (i.e., not consisting of [[numerical]] values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a [[level of measurement]]. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. However, there may also be ''[[missing values]]'', which must be indicated in some way.

In [[statistics]], datasets usually come from actual observations obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] a [[statistical population]], and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Datasets may further be generated by [[algorithms]] for the purpose of testing certain kinds of [[software]].  Some modern statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] still present their data in the classical dataset fashion

== Classic datasets ==
Several classic datasets have been used extensively in the [[statistical]] literature:
