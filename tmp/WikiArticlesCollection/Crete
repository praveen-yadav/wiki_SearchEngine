'''Crete''' ({{lang-el|Κρήτη}} ''{{transl|gr|Kríti}}''; {{IPA-el|kriti|}}) is the largest and most populous of the [[Greek islands]], the [[List of islands in the Mediterranean|fifth]]-largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and one of the thirteen [[Modern regions of Greece|administrative regions of Greece]]. It forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]], and [[Cretan music|music]]). Crete was once the center of the [[Minoan civilization]] ({{nowrap|c. 2700–1420 BC}}), which is currently regarded as the earliest recorded [[civilization]] in [[Europe]].<ref name="Ancient Crete">[http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 Ancient Crete] Oxford Bibliographies Online: Classics</ref>

==Name==
[[File:Island of Crete, Greece.JPG|thumb|[[NASA]] photograph of Crete.]]

The island is first referred to as ''Kaptara'' in texts from the [[Syria]]n city of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] dating from the 18th century BC,<ref>Stephanie Lynn Budin, ''The Ancient Greeks: An Introduction'' (New York: Oxford UP, 2004), 42.</ref> repeated later in [[Neo-Assyrian]] records and the [[Bible]] (''[[Caphtor]]''). It was also known in ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''Keftiu'', strongly suggesting some form similar to both was the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] name for the island.<ref>O. Dickinson, ''The Aegean Bronze Age'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1994), 241-244.</ref>

The current name of Crete first appears in [[Mycenaean Greek]] as ''ke-re-si-jo'' "Cretan" in [[Linear B]] texts. In [[Ancient Greek]], the name Crete (Κρήτη) first appears in [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]].<ref>Book 14, line 199; Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''</ref> Its etymology is unknown.  One speculative proposal derives it from a hypothetical [[Luwian language|Luvian]] word ''*kursatta'' (cf. ''kursawar'' "island", ''kursattar'' "cutting, sliver").<ref>Edwin L. Brown, "Linear A on Trojan Spindlewhorls, Luvian-Based ϜΑΝΑΞ at Cnossus", in ''Qui miscuit utile dulci: Festschrift Essays for Paul Lachlan MacKendrick'', eds., Gareth Schmeling, Jon D. Mikalson, 1998, p. 62.</ref> In [[Classical Latin|Latin]], it became ''Creta''.

The original Arabic name of Crete was ''Iqrīṭiš'' ({{lang-ar|اقريطش}} < (της) Κρήτης), but after the [[Emirate of Crete]]'s establishment of its new capital at ربض الخندق ''Rabḍ al-Ḫandaq'' (modern [[Iraklion]]), both the city and the island became known as Χάνδαξ (Khandhax) or Χάνδακας (Khandhakas), which gave Latin and Venetian ''Candia'', from which French ''Candie'' and English ''Candy'' or ''Candia''. Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], Crete was called ''Girit'' (كريت).

==Physical geography==

[[File:HaGorgeExit.jpg|thumb|[[Ha Gorge]].]]
[[File:Vai R03.jpg|thumb|The palm beach of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]].]]

Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is located in the southern part of the [[Aegean Sea]] separating the Aegean from the [[Libyan Sea]].

===Island morphology===
The island has an elongated shape: it spans {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} at its widest point, and narrows to as little as {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} (close to [[Ierapetra]]). Crete covers an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|1046|km|mi|abbr=on}}; to the north, it broaches the [[Sea of Crete]] (Greek: Κρητικό Πέλαγος); to the south, the [[Libyan Sea]] (Greek: Λιβυκό Πέλαγος); in the west, the [[Myrtoan Sea]], and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.

===Mountains and valleys===
Crete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by three different groups of mountains:
*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] {{convert|2452|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]] {{Coord|35.18|N|24.82|E|}} {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] {{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] {{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*Thripti {{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}}

These mountains lavished Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Diktaion]] and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.

===Gorges, rivers, and lakes===
The island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samariá Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge|Platania gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |date= |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

The rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes: Lake [[Kournas]] and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit.<ref>[http://www.crete.tournet.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1155&lang=en Photos of Agia Lake] Crete TOURnet.</ref> [[Lake Voulismeni]] at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a sweetwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi.<ref>[http://www.aghiosnikolaos.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=24&Itemid=35 Lake Voulismeni] aghiosnikolaos.eu</ref>

===Surrounding islands===
{{Main|List of Greek islands}}

A large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are visited only by archaeologists and biologists. Some are environmentally protected. A small sample of the islands include:
*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], [[Chania]]) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon
*[[Elafonisi]] ([[Chania]]), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre
*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural [[Lebanon cedar]] forest in Europe
*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born
*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]], [[Lasithi]])
*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], [[Lasithi]]

Off the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Greece}}
Crete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[temperate]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low lying areas. While mountain tops remain snow-capped year long, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.

The south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[Date Palm|date palms]] bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.<ref>Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996. ''The Making of the Cretan Landscape'', Manchester University Press, http://books.google.gr/books?id=k4dHmA9jq4wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cretan+landscape&source=bl&ots=Getzm4MGUe&sig=zmyzZT89lwQXQeVPZP9_dXXzxG0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RQFwUNSFJMLQtAbS1oGQCg&redir_esc=y</ref>

==Human geography==
Crete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&pg=PA43&dq=population+statistics+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false Crete, p.44], by Victoria Kyriakopoulos.</ref>

===Administration===
Crete with its nearby islands form the '''Crete Region''' ({{lang-el|Περιφέρεια Κρήτης}}), one of the 13 [[Modern regions of Greece|regions of Greece]] which were established in the 1987 administrative reform.<ref>Π.Δ. 51/87 "Καθορισμός των Περιφερειών της Χώρας για το σχεδιασμό κ.λ.π. της Περιφερειακής Ανάπτυξης" (''Determination of the Regions of the Country for the planning etc. of the development of the Region, [[Efimeris tis Kyverniseos|ΦΕΚ]] A 26/06.03.1987</ref> With the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at [[Heraklion]] and is divided into four [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (pre-Kallikratis [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]). From west to east these are: [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]], [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]], [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]], and [[Lasithi]]. These are further subdivided into 24 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]].

The region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, [[Stavros Arnaoutakis]], who was elected in the [[Greek local elections, 2010|November 2010 local administration elections]] for the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]].

===Cities===
{{Main|Cities of Greece}}
[[File:Heraklion port.png|thumb|[[Heraklion]].]]
[[File:Chania Crete Panoram.JPG|thumb|[[Chania]].]]

[[Heraklion]] is the largest city and capital of Crete. The principal cities are:
*[[Heraklion]] (''Iraklion'' or ''Candia'') (130,914 inhabitants)<ref name=census>2001 Census</ref>
*[[Chania]] (''Haniá'') (53,373 inhabitants)<ref name=census/>
*[[Rethymno]] (27,868 inhabitants)<ref name=census/>
*[[Ierapetra]] (23,707 inhabitants)
*[[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] (19,462 inhabitants)
*[[Sitia]] (14,338 inhabitants)

===Economy===
{{Main|Economy of Greece}}
[[File:Heraklion Kohlekraftwerk.jpg|thumb|Coal-fired power plant near Heraklion.]]

The economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism, however agriculture plays also an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11&dq=economy+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q=economy%20Crete&f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. While an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, due to the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, while unemployment is at approximately 4%, half of that of the country overall.

As in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[Greek citron|citrons]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].

===Transport infrastructure===

The island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, "Nikos Kazantzakis"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a smaller one in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers.  There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.

The island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].

Although the road network leads almost everywhere (the network is larger than in Britain <ref name="books.google.gr">Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996. The Making of the Cretan Landscape, Manchester University Press, http://books.google.gr/books?id=k4dHmA9jq4wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=cretan+landscape&source=bl&ots=Getzm4MGUe&sig=zmyzZ</ref>), there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}.

Also, during 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port.  There are now no railway lines on Crete.<ref name="books.google.gr"/><ref>ΤΟΠΙΟ: Αγνωστα Βιομηχανικά Μνημεία Ι: υπολείμματα του βιομηχανικού σιδηροδρόμου Ηρακλείου http://to-pio.blogspot.gr/2011/11/blog-post_17.html</ref>

===Development===
Newspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, [[South Korea]], [[Dubai Ports World]] and [[China]] for the construction of a large international [[container (cargo)|container]] port and [[free trade zone]] in southern Crete near [[Tympaki]]; the plan is to expropriate 850&nbsp;ha of land. The port would handle 2&nbsp;million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed due to its environmental, economic and cultural impact.<ref name=ncp>[http://www.no-container-port-in-timbaki.net/facts_en.php No Container Transshipment Hub in Timbaki]. Retrieved 27 May 2007.</ref> As of January 2013, the project has still not been confirmed, although there is mounting pressure to agree it, arising from Greece's difficult economic situation.

==Tourism==
{{Main|Tourism in Greece}}
[[File:Ammoudi 07.jpg|thumb|Ammoudi beach.]]
[[File:Kreta-Matala07.jpg|thumb|[[Matala, Crete|Matala]] beach.]]

Crete is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. Fifteen percent of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of [[Heraklion]] (port and airport), while charter journeys to [[Heraklion]] last year made up 20% of all charter flights in Greece.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete last year,{{When|date=August 2011}} and this increase in tourism is reflected on the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991, when the rest of Greece saw increases of only 25%. Today, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and [[Chania]] and a smaller airport in [[Sitia]] (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012)<ref>[http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html Charter flights to Sitia in 2012]{{Dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, [[Rethimno]], [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] and [[Sitia]]. Popular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of [[Chania]], the Venetian castle at [[Rethymno]], the gorge of [[Samariá Gorge|Samaria]], the islands of [[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]], [[Elafonisi]], [[Gramvousa]], and [[Spinalonga]] and the Palm Beach of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]], which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.

=== Holiday homes and immigration ===
Crete's mild climate attracts interest from [[northern Europe]]ans who want a holiday home or residence on the island. [[European Union|EU]] citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0035:0048:EN:PDF On the Rights of Citizens of the Union'', EC Directive 2004/58 EC (2004)] Eur-lex.europa.eu</ref> A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British expatriates, followed by [[Germany|German]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Scandinavia]]n and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The [[United Kingdom|British]] expatriates are concentrated in the western regional units of [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]] and [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]] and to a lesser extent in [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]] and [[Lasithi]].<ref name="books.google.gr"/>

===Archaeological sites and museums===
{{Main|List of museums in Greece#Crete}}
[[File:Knossos - 09.jpg|thumb|[[Knossos]].]]
[[File:Festos1(js).jpg|thumb|[[Phaistos]].]]

There is a large number of archaeological sites which include the Minoan sites of [[Knossos]] and [[Phaistos]], the classical site of [[Gortys]], and the diverse archaeology of the island of [[Koufonisi]] which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II ruins.

There are a number of museums throughout Crete. The [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] displays most of the archaeological finds of the Minoan era.<ref>[http://www.explorecrete.com/archaeology/antiquities-crete.html Archaeological sites and Museums in Crete] ExploreCrete.com</ref>
At present ( 12 August 2012) the museum is closed for refurbishment but there is a temporary museum, on the site, where all their 'star finds' are displayed.

== Fauna and flora ==
[[File:Kri-kri 1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Kri-kri]] (the Cretan ibex) lives in protected natural parks at the gorge of Samaria and the island of Agios Theodoros.]]
[[File:Kritikos Lagonikos 02.jpg|thumb|200px|''Kritikos Lagonikos''.]]

[[File:Ophrys cretica-001.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Ophrys|Ophrys Cretica]] orchid.]]

Crete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all "harmful" and "poisonous" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a [[Natural History Museum of Crete|Natural History Museum]] operating under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums - [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.

===Prehistoric fauna===
[[Dwarf elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus creutzburgi|dwarf hippopotamus]], and [[Candiacervus|dwarf deer]] were native to [[Pleistocene]] Crete.<ref>Van der Geer, A.A.E., Dermitzakis, M., De Vos, J., 2006.

===Arthropods===
Crete has an unusual variety of insects. [[Xylophagidae|Xylophagous]], known locally as ''Tzitzikia'', make a distinctive repetitive ''tzi tzi'' noise that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the [[swallowtail butterfly]].<ref name=icw/> Moth species include the [[hummingbird moth]].<ref>[http://www.picturenation.co.uk/view/info/77283/hummingbird-moth-flower?s=hummingbird&page=1 Feeding time for a hummingbird moth] PictureNation.co.uk</ref> There are several species of scorpion such as [[Euscorpius]] carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.

===Crustaceans and molluscs===
River crabs include the semi-terrestrial [[potamon potamios]] crab.<ref name=icw/> Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.

===Sealife===
Apart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos, indicate that Minoans knew many things about these creatures and respected them. Apart from the famous endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]], which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts [[whale]]s, [[sperm whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s.<ref>[http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/fauna-of-crete/marine-mammals.html Marine mammals of Crete] CretanBeaches.com</ref> These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean, or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. [[Squid]] and [[octopus]] can be found along the coast and [[sea turtle]]s and [[hammerhead shark]]s swim in the sea around the coast. The [[Cretaquarium]] and the [[Aquaworld Aquarium]], are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece.  They are located in [[Gournes]] and [[Hersonissos]] respectively, and examples of the local sealife can be seen there.<ref>[http://www.cretaquarium.gr/indexen.php Cretaquarium] Cretaquarium.gr</ref><ref name=scot>[http://www.britsincrete.net/john_mclaren_aquaworld.html Great Britons in Crete, John Bryce McLaren] BritsinCrete.net</ref>

Some of the fish that can be seen in the waters around Crete include: [[scorpion fish]], [[dusky grouper]], east Atlantic peacock [[wrasse]], five-spotted wrasse, [[weever fish]], [[common stingray]], [[brown ray]], [[mediterranean black goby]], [[pearly razorfish]], [[star-gazer]], [[painted comber]], [[damselfish]], and the [[flying gurnard]].<ref>[http://www.aquaworld-crete.com/fish.html Fish from Crete at Aquaworld] Aquaworld Aquarium</ref>

===Flora===
Common wildflowers include: camomile, daisy, gladiolus, hyacinth, [[Iris flower|iris]], poppy, cyclamen and tulip, among others. There are more than 200 different species of wild [[orchid]] on the island and this includes 14 varieties of [[Ophrys Cretica]].<ref name=flora>[http://books.google.com/books?id=KVYFI9NzLz0C&pg=PA68&dq=Crete+insects&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Crete%20insects&f=false Crete p.68] by Victoria Kyriakopoulos</ref> Crete has a rich variety of indigenous herbs including common [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[thyme]], and [[oregano]].<ref name=flora/><ref name=expcrete>[http://www.explorecrete.com/nature/flora.html The Flora of Crete] ExploreCrete.com</ref> Rare herbs include the endemic [[Origanum dictamus|Cretan dittany]].<ref name=flora/><ref name=expcrete/> and [[Ironwort]], ''Sideritis syriaca L'', known as [[Malotira]] (Μαλοτήρα). Varieties of cactus include the edible [[Prickly Pear]]. Common trees on the island include the [[chestnut tree|chestnut]], [[cypress tree|cypress]], [[oak tree|oak]], [[Olea europaea|olive tree]], [[pine tree|pine]], [[plane tree|plane]], and [[tamarisk tree|tamarisk]].<ref name=expcrete/> Trees tend to be taller to the west of the island where water is more abundant.

===Environmentally protected areas===

There are a number of environmentally protected areas. One such area is located at the island of [[Elafonisi]] on the coast of southwestern Crete. Also, the palm forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in eastern Crete and the [[Dionysades]] (both in the municipality of [[Sitia]], [[Lasithi]]), have diverse animal and plant life. [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] has a palm beach and is the largest natural palm forest in Europe. The island of [[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]], {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Ierapetra]], has the largest naturally grown [[Lebanon Cedar]] forest in Europe. [[Samaria Gorge]] is a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|World Biosphere Reserve]] and [[Richtis Gorge]] is protected for its landscape diversity.

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
[[File:Bull-leaping.jpg|thumb|200px|Minoan fresco from [[Knossos]], [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]].]]

Crete has a rich mythology mostly connected with the ancient [[Greek Gods]] but also connected with the Minoan civilization.

The Idaion cave at [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]] was the birthplace of the god [[Zeus]]. The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] ("featherless") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).<ref>Caroline M. Galt, "A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera", ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).</ref> [[Hercules]], in one of his labors, took the [[Cretan bull]] to the Peloponnese. [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and [[Zeus]] made love at [[Gortys]] and conceived the Kings of the Minoan civilization, [[Rhadamanthys]], [[Sarpedon]], and [[Minos]].

The [[labyrinth]] of the palace of Knossos has the myth of [[Theseus#Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]] where the [[Minotaur]] was slain by [[Theseus]]. [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of [[King Minos]] and crafted wings to escape. After death King [[Minos]] became a judge of the dead in [[Hades]], while [[Rhadamanthys]] the ruler of the Elysian fields.

Hominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age period, under the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Emirate of Crete]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After a brief period of autonomy (1897–1913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].

===Prehistoric Crete===

The first human settlement in Crete dates before 130,000 years ago, during the [[Paleolithic]] age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/45324652/Strasser-et-al-2010-Stone-Age-Seafaring-in-the-Mediterranean-Plakias-Region-for-Lower-Palaeolithic-and-Mesolithic-Habitation-of-Crete-Hesperia-79 |title=Strasser F.

===Minoan civilization===
{{Main|Minoan civilization}}
Crete was the center of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoan]] ({{nowrap|c. 2700–1420 BC}}).<ref name="Ancient Crete"/> This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as [[Linear A]]. Early [[Cretan]] history is replete with legends such as those of [[Minos|King Minos]], [[Theseus]], and the [[Minotaur]], passed on orally via poets such as [[Homer]]. The [[Minoan eruption|volcanic eruption]] of [[Thera]] devastated the Minoan civilization.

===Mycenean civilization===
{{Main|Mycenean Greece}}
Beginning in 1420&nbsp;BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenean Greece|Mycenean civilization]] from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by [[Michael Ventris]], is the [[Linear B]] archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425–1375&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia|last=Shelmerdine|title=Where Do We Go From Here?

===Roman rule===
{{Main|Creta et Cyrenaica}}
Crete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BCE. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BCE, earning for Metellus the title "''Creticus''". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. When Diocletian redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the diocese of Moesia, and later by Constantine I to the diocese of Macedonia.

===Byzantine Empire – first period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}
[[File:Byzantine attack on Crete.jpg|thumb|A Byzantine attempt to take back Crete ca. 828, as depicted by [[John Skylitzes|Ioannes Scylitzes]] (see [[Skylitzes Chronicle]]).]]
[[File:Romans (Niketas Oryphas) punish Cretan Saracens.jpg|thumb|Romans ([[Niketas Oryphas]]) punish Cretan [[Saracens]].]]

Crete was separated from Cyrenaica ca. 297. It remained a part of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Byzantine Empire after 600 A.D. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of 365 and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. Circa 732, the Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the [[Pope]] to that of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].<ref name="ODB546">Kazhdan (1991), p. 546</ref>

===Emirate of Crete===
{{Main|Emirate of Crete}}

In the 820s when Crete was part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], it was captured by [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Muladi]]s led by [[Abu Hafs (pirate)|Abu Hafs]]<ref name="Iberia">Reinhart Dozy, ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne: jusqu'à la conquête de l'Andalousie par les Almoravides'' (French) pg. 711–1110, Leiden, 1861 & 1881, 2nd edition</ref> who established the [[Emirate of Crete]]. Byzantium launched a campaign to take the island back in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]] with some success. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1 [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]' campaign successfully restored Crete to Byzantium.

===Byzantine Empire – second period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}
In 961, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]] returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs.<ref name=intro>Panagiotakis, Introduction, p. XVI.</ref> In 1204, the [[Fourth Crusade]] seized and sacked the Imperial capital of [[Constantinople]].  Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader [[Boniface of Montferrat]]<ref name=intro/> in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the [[Republic of Venice]],<ref name=intro/> whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade.   Venice's rival the [[Republic of Genoa]] immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.

===Venetian rule===
{{Main|Kingdom of Candia}}
[[File:Kreta1719.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of Crete, Venetian period.]]
[[File:Frangokastello R03.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Frangokastello]].]]

From 1212, during [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]'s rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a [[Renaissance]] swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as [[The Cretan School]] or [[Post-Byzantine Art]], it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire.  The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter [[El Greco]] and the writers [[Nicholas Kalliakis]] (1645–1707), [[Georgios Kalafatis (professor)]] (ca. 1652–1720), [[Andreas Musalus]] (ca. 1665–1721) and [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Tiepolo, Maria Francesca; Tonetti, Eurigio|title=I greci a Venezia| publisher=Istituto veneto di scienze|year=2002|page=201|isbn=978-88-88143-07-1 |quote= Cretese Nikolaos Kalliakis}}</ref><ref name=" Boehm, Eric H. 1995 755 ">{{cite book | author= Boehm, Eric H. |title= Historical abstracts: Modern history abstracts, 1450-1914, Volume 46, Issues 3-4 |publisher= American Bibliographical Center of ABC-Clio |year= 1995 |page=755 |oclc= 701679973 |quote= Between the 15th and 19th centuries the University of Padua attracted a great number of Greek students who wanted to study medicine.

Under the rule of the [[Catholic]] [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the city of [[Heraklion|Candia]] was reputed to be the best fortified city of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].<ref name="Greene">M. Greene. 2001. Ruling an island without a navy. A comparative view of Venetian and Ottoman Crete.

According to Starr (1942), the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a dark age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of [[Herakleion|Candia]], about seven percent of the city's population.<ref>Starr,J.

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|conquered Crete]] in 1669, after the [[siege of Candia]]. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the [[Republic of Venice]] after the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars (disambiguation)|Ottoman–Venetian Wars]], some even prospering such as the family of [[Simone Stratigo]] (ca. 1733 – ca. 1824) who migrated to Dalamatia from Crete in 1669.<ref name=" Carlo Capra, Franco Della Peruta, Fernando Mazzocca 2002 pp.200">{{cite book | author= Carlo Capra, Franco Della Peruta, Fernando Mazzocca |title= Napoleone e la repubblica italiana: 1802-1805 |publisher= Skira |year= 2002 |page=200 |isbn=978-88-8491-415-6 |quote= Simone Stratico, nato a Zara nel 1733 da famiglia originaria di Creta (abbandonata a seguito della conquista turca del 1669)}}</ref> [[Islamic]] presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the [[Emirate of Crete|Arab occupation]], was cemented by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman conquest]]. Most [[Cretan Muslims]] were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan [[Greek language|Greek]], but in the island's 19th century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks.<ref>Demetres Tziovas, ''Greece and the Balkans: Identities, Perceptions and Cultural Encounters Since the Enlightenment''; William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1958)</ref> Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence, as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.<ref>William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' by  (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1958)</ref> A number of [[Sufi]] orders were widespread throughout the island, the [[Bektashi]] order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five [[tekkes]]. Many among them were [[crypto-Christians]] who converted back to Christianity in subsequent years, while many [[Cretan Turks]] fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in 1924 [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].

During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by [[Daskalogiannis]], a shipowner from [[Sfakia]] who was promised support by [[Orlov Revolt|Orlov's fleet]] which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.

Crete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol of 1830]], and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on 3 July 1840.

[[File:Extérieur de l'église du monastère d'Arkadi - 2.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Arkadi Monastery]].]]

Heraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, "the deserted city".<ref name="Greene"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name="Greene"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.

The [[Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869]] or Great Cretan Revolution (Greek: Κρητική Επανάσταση του 1866) was a three year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.

===Cretan State 1898-1908===
{{Main|Cretan State|Theriso revolt}}
[[File:Flag of Cretan State.svg|thumb|200px|Flag of the [[Cretan State]].]]
[[File:Revolutionnaires therissos.jpg|thumb|200px|Revolutionaries at [[Theriso]].]]

Following the repeated uprisings by the Cretan people, in 1889, 1895 and 1897, the [[Great powers#history|Great Powers]] decided to restore order by governing the island temporarily through a committee of four admirals.

On 25 August 1898, a Turkish mob massacred hundreds of Cretan Greeks, the British Consul and 17 British soldiers. As a result, the Turkish forces were expelled from the island by the Great Powers in November 1898, and an autonomous Cretan State was founded, under Ottoman [[suzerainty]], symbolized by the white star in the red quadrant of the flag. It was garrisoned by an international military force, and its High Commissioner was [[Prince George of Greece]], who took charge on 9 December 1898.

Prince George was replaced as High Commissioner by [[Alexandros Zaimis]] in 1906, and in 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.  However, this was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.

===World War II===
{{Main|Battle of Crete|Cretan resistance}}
During [[World War II]], the island was the scene of the famous [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941. [[Germany|German]] [[paratrooper]]s sustained almost 7,000 casualties, meeting fierce resistance from the Cretan locals and as a result, [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large-scale airborne operations. During the occupation, German firing squads were routinely used to execute male civilians, who were randomly gathered at local villages, in reprisal for the death of German soldiers, such as at [[Massacre of Kondomari|Kondomari]].

[[File:Koukouvagia.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Dakos]], traditional Cretan salad.]]

Crete has its own distinctive [[Mantinada|Mantinades]] poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]].

Cretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th century epic romance [[Erotokritos]] (Greek Ερωτόκριτος), and in the 20th century [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the [[Cretan School]] of icon painting, which influenced [[El Greco]] and through him subsequent European painting.

Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (''stivania''), [[Breeches#Types of breeches|''vráka'' breeches]] tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (the ''sariki''). Black is the color of mourning, and since Cretan families are notionally considered so extended as to include great-grandparents or second cousins (although they may have little actual contact) as well as all their respective in-laws, one is theoretically justified to be in continuous mourning for some relative or other, however distant. On festive occasions those who are not in mourning wear white, most notably white boots and headdress. In the small villages in the mountains some men unabashedly carry weapons including knives and guns which also appear at special occasions such as weddings.

Cretan society is well known for notorious family and clan [[feud|vendettas]] which remain on the island to date.<ref name="feud">Brian Murphy: [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990114&slug=2938763 Vendetta Victims: People, A Village -- Crete's `Cycle Of Blood' Survives The Centuries] at ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', 14 January 1999.</ref><ref>Aris Tsantiropoulos: {{PDF|[http://www.pbs.plymouth.ac.uk/solon/journal/issue%202.1/Tsantiropoulos_Article_final%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.pdf Collective Memory and Blood Feud: The Case of Mountainous Crete]|254&nbsp;KB}}, ''Crimes and Misdemeanours'' 2/1 (2008), [[University of Crete]].</ref> Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the [[Ottoman Empire]].
