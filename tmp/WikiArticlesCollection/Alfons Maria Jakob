}}'''Alfons Maria Jakob''' (2 July 1884, [[Aschaffenburg]]/[[Bavaria]]&ndash;17 October 1931, [[Hamburg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[neurologist]] with important contributions on [[neuropathology]].

Alfons Maria Jakob was born to Jewish parents, his father was a shopkeeper. He studied [[medicine]] in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], and [[Strasbourg]], where obtained his doctorate in 1908. In 1909 he commenced clinical work under the [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] and did laboratory work with [[Franz Nissl]] and [[Alois Alzheimer]] in [[Munich]].

In 1911 he went to [[Hamburg]] to work with [[Theodor Kaes]] and became head of the laboratory of [[anatomical pathology]] at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as [[prosector]]. After serving in the [[Germany|German]] army in [[World War I]], he returned to Hamburg and climbed the academic ladder. He was habilitated in [[neurology]] in 1919 and in 1924 became professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made notable contributions to knowledge on [[concussion]] and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of [[neuropathology]].

Jakob published five monographs and more than 75 papers. His neuropathological studies contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He first recognised and described [[Alper's disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (the latter with [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]]). He accumulated immense experience in [[neurosyphilis]], having a 200-bedded ward devoted exclusively to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the [[United States]] and [[South America]] where he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of [[yellow fever]].

He suffered from chronic [[osteomyelitis]] for the last 7 years of his life. This eventually caused a retroperitoneal [[abscess]] and [[Paralysis|paralytic]] [[ileus]] from which he died following operation.
