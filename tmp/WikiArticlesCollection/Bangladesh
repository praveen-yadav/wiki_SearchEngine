If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant-->[[:bn:বাংলাদেশ|বাংলাদেশ]]}}, {{IPA-bn|ˈbaŋlad̪eʃ|pron|Bangladesh.ogg}}), officially the '''People's Republic of Bangladesh''' ({{lang-bn|গণপ্রজাতন্ত্রী বাংলাদেশ}} ''{{lang|inc-Latn|Gônôprôjatôntri Bangladesh}}''), is a country in [[South Asia]], located on the fertile [[Ganges delta|Bengal delta]]. It is bordered by the [[Republic of India]] to its north, west and east, by the [[Myanmar|Union of Myanmar (Burma)]] to its south-east and by the [[Bay of Bengal]] to its south. It is separated from the [[Nepal|Democratic Republic of Nepal]] and the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]] by the narrow Indian [[Siliguri Corridor]]. Together with the neighbouring Indian state of [[West Bengal]], it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. The name ''Bangladesh'' means "Country of Bengal" in the official [[Bengali language]].

The borders of modern Bangladesh took shape during the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|British India]] in 1947, when the region became the [[East Bengal|eastern wing]] of the newly formed state of [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. Following years of political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination, and economic neglect by the politically dominant [[West Pakistan|western wing]], a surge of popular agitation, [[Bengali nationalism|nationalism]] and [[civil disobedience]] led in 1971 to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], resulting in the separation of the region from [[Pakistan]] and the formation of an independent Bangladesh. [[Independence day of Bangladesh|After independence]], the new state proclaimed a [[secular]] [[multiparty]] [[democracy]]. The country then endured decades of poverty, famine, political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|numerous military coups]]. Since the restoration of democracy in 1991, the country has experienced relative calm and economic progress, though the country's main political parties remain polarized.

Bangladesh is a [[parliamentary republic]] with an elected parliament called the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. With a population of more than [[Demographics of Bangladesh|160 million people]] in a territory of 56,977 sq mi, Bangladesh is the [[List of countries by population|world's eighth most populous country]], as well as one of [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|the world's most densely populated countries]]. The [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] form the country's predominant ethnic group, whereas the [[Ethnic groups in Bangladesh|indigenous peoples]] in northern and [[Chittagong Hill Tracts|southeastern]] districts form a significant and diverse ethnic minority. The Bengal delta region has a rich and diverse [[cultural heritage]]. The four largest religions in the country are [[Islam in Bangladesh|Islam]] (89%), [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Hinduism]] (9%), [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhism]] (1%) and [[Christianity in Bangladesh|Christianity]] (0.5%).

Bangladesh is identified as a [[Next Eleven|Next Eleven economy]]. According to the [[United Nations]] in 2010, the country is making major strides in [[human development (humanity)|human development]], including significant progress in the areas of gender equity, universal primary education, the empowerment of women, reducing population growth, food production, health and renewable energy.<ref>United Nations Development Programme in Bangladesh: ''[http://www.undp.org.bd/info/events.php?newsid=734 HDR 2010 recognises Bangladesh's great progress over time]''. 5 November 2010.

Major cities such as [[Dhaka]] and [[Chittagong]] have been the driving forces behind much of the recent growth. However, the country continues to face a number of major political and social challenges, including endemic bureaucratic and political [[corruption in Bangladesh|corruption]], [[poverty in Bangladesh|widespread poverty]], [[political instability]], [[overpopulation]] and vulnerability to global [[climate change]].

Bangladesh is a pioneer and founding member of [[SAARC]]. It is the world’s [[Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force|largest contributor]] to [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeeping operations]]. It is a founding member of the [[Developing 8 Countries]] and [[BIMSTEC]] and a member of the [[Commonwealth]], the [[OIC]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]] and the [[Group of 77|G-77]].

Remnants of [[civilization]] in the greater Bengal region date back four thousand years to when the region was settled by ancient [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] peoples. The exact origin of the word "Bangla" or "Bengal" is unclear, though it is believed to be derived from ''Bang/Vanga'', the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000&nbsp;BCE.<ref name="congress">{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/bdtoc.html |chapter=Early History, 1000 B.C.-A.D. 1202 |title=Bangladesh: A country study |editor=James Heitzman and Robert L.

The region was known to the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world as ''[[Gangaridai]]'', or "Nation of Ganges". The early history of Bengal featured the rise of numerous city states, or ''janapadas'', including [[Vanga]], [[Samatata]] and [[Pundravardhana]]. The [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Ashoka]] conquered Bengal in the second century BC, and the region was absorbed into the rule of successive [[Magadha]]n dynasties for several centuries. Following the collapse of the Magadhan empire, a local ruler named [[Shashanka]] rose to power and founded an impresseive but short-lived kingdom. After a period of anarchy, the Bengali [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by the Hindu [[Sena Dynasty]].

[[Islam]] was introduced to the Bengal region in the 8th century by Arab Muslim traders and [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries, and the subsequent Muslim conquest of Bengal in the 12th century helped spread Islam throughout the region.<ref name="eaton">{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=R |year=1996 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |oclc=26634922 76881262}}</ref> [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal in the year 1204. The region was ruled by the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] and the [[Baro-Bhuiyan#Baro-Bhuyians of Bengal|Baro-Bhuiyan confederacy]] for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.

Medieval European geographers located paradise at the mouth of the [[Ganges]], and although this was overhopeful, Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent until the 16th century. From 1517 onwards, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders from Goa were traversing the sea route to Bengal. Only in 1537 were they allowed to settle and open customs houses at Chittagong. In 1577, the Mughal emperor Akbar permitted the Portuguese to build permanent settlements and churches in Bengal.<ref name="D'Costa">{{cite book

The [[Maratha Empire]], a Hindu empire which overran the Mughals in the 18th century, also devastated the territories controlled by the Nawab of Bengal between 1742 and 1751. In a series of raids on Bengal and Bihar, then ruled by the Nawab, Maratha demolished much of the Bengali economy, which was unable to withstand the continuous onslaught of Maratha for long. Nawab Ali Vardi Khan made peace with [[Maratha]] by ceding the whole of Orissa and parts of Western Bengal to the empire. In addition, a tax – the ''Chauth'', amounting to a quarter of total revenue – was imposed on other parts of Bengal and Bihar. This tax amounted to twenty [[lakh]]s (of rupees?) for Bengal and 12 lakhs for Bihar per year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stewart Gordon |title=The Marathas 1600–1818 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&pg=PA133 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-26883-7 |pages=133–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Brijen Kishore Gupta |title=Sirajuddaullah and the East India company, 1756–1757, background to the foundation of British power in India |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o-MUAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA134 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |year=1966 |publisher=Brill Archive |pages=134– |id=GGKEY:RS7D7HRH8KA}}</ref> After Maratha's defeat in Panipat by a coalition of Muslim forces, the empire returned under the Maratha general Madhoji Sindhia and raided Bengal again. The British Empire stopped payment of the Chauth, invading the territory of Bengal in the 1760s. The raids continued until Maratha was finally defeated by the British over the course of three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]] lasting from 1777 to 1818.

It agitated for [[Six point movement|autonomy]] in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] (Mujib), was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1483615/Bangladesh-cyclone-of-1991 Bangladesh cyclone of 1991].

The Bengali population's anger was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose [[Awami League]] won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections,<ref>Baxter, pp. 78–79</ref> was blocked from taking office.

After staging compromise talks with Mujib, President [[Yahya Khan]] and military officials launched [[Operation Searchlight]],<ref name="salik">{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-577264-4}}</ref> a sustained military assault on East Pakistan and arrested him in the early hours of 26 March 1971.

Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The exile government formally took oath at Meherpur, in Kustia district of East Pakistan on 17 April 1971, with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first Prime Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Acting President. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for nine months. The [[Bangladesh Forces]] formed within 11 [[list of Sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|sectors]] led by General M.A.G. Osmani consisting of Bengali Regular forces conducted a massive guerilla war against the Pakistan Forces with support from the [[Mukti Bahini]]s consisting of Kaderia Bahni, Hemayet Bahini, and others financed and equipped by [[Indian Armed Forces]] Maj. Gen. Sujat Singh Uban. The Indian Army, assisted by Bangladeshi forces, negotiated a cease-fire and surrounded the Dhaka Area. The Indian Army remained in Bangladesh until 19 March 1972.

After its independence, Bangladesh was governed by an Awami League government, with Mujib as the Prime Minister, without holding any elections. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,<ref name="sen"/> and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers.<ref name="mascarenhas">{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton, London |isbn=0-340-39420-X |oclc=13004864 16583315 242251870}}</ref> Vice President Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed was sworn in as President with most of Mujib's cabinet intact. Two Army uprisings on 3 November and the other on 7 November 1975 led to the reorganised structure of power. Emergency was declared to restore order and calm, Mushtaq resigned and the country was placed under temporary martial law, with three service chiefs serving as deputies to the new president Justice Abu Satem, who also became the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Lieutenant General [[Ziaur Rahman]], took over the presidency in 1977 as Justice Sayem resigned. President Zia reinstated multi-party politics, introduced free markets, and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981.<ref name="mascarenhas"/>

Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a coup on 24 March 1982, and ruled until 6 December 1990, when he was forced to resign after a revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from Western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union). Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991, and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. However, the Awami League, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. It lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001.

Widespread political unrest followed the resignation of the BNP in late October 2006, but the caretaker government worked to bring the parties to election within the required 90 days. At the last minute in early January, the Awami League withdrew from the scheduled election later that month. On 11 January 2007, the military intervened to support a [[state of emergency]], and a continued but neutral caretaker government, under a newly appointed [[Chief Advisor]] who was not a politician. The country had suffered from extensive corruption for decades,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm |title=Bangladesh tops most corrupt list |publisher=BBC News |date=18 October 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2007 |first=Waliur |last=Rahman}}</ref> disorder and political violence. The caretaker government worked to root out corruption from all levels of government. It arrested more than 160 persons on corruption charges, including politicians, civil servants and businessmen, among whom were both major party leaders, some of their senior staff and two sons of Khaleda Zia.

After working to clean up the system, the caretaker government held what was described by observers as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/world/asia/30iht-bangla.5.19007747.html|title=Bangladesh election seen as fair, though loser disputes result|work=The New York Times|date=30 November 2008}}</ref> The Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won with a two-thirds landslide in the elections; she took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/06/us-bangladesh-hasina-idUSTRE5053GG20090106 |title= Hasina takes oath as new Bangladesh prime minister|agency=Reuters |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

Bangladesh lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[27th parallel north|27°N]], and longitudes [[88th meridian east|88°]] and [[93rd meridian east|93°E]].
Bangladesh is in the low-lying [[Ganges Delta]]. This delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna'' also known as "Yamuna"), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve&nbsp;– in most cases as the lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Suvedī | first = Sūryaprasāda | title = International watercourses law for the 21st century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = 154–166 | isbn = 0-7546-4527-4}}</ref>

Most parts of Bangladesh are less than {{convert|12|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above the sea level, and it is believed that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by {{convert|1|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ali">{{cite journal |last=Ali |first=A |year=1996 |title=Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges |doi = 10.1007/BF00175563|journal=Water, Air, & Soil Pollution |volume=92 |issue=1–2 |pages=171–179}}</ref>

In southeast Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. By implementing cross dams, the natural accretion of silt has created new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has since become a multiagency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|27000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} to 21,000 families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change |title="Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change," by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladeshi climate is tropical with a mild winter from October to March, and a hot, humid summer from March to June.

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of embankment, 1,000&nbsp;people were killed and 30&nbsp;million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of land destroyed and {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.<ref name="EWG">{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |url= http://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&pg=PA2634|accessdate=2 May 2008 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |year= 2002|location= New York |isbn=0-7614-7308-4 |oclc= 46578454|pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |origyear=2002 }}</ref>

==Politics and law==
{{Main|Politics of Bangladesh}}

===Political system===
[[File:Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban (Roehl).jpg|thumb|The [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] houses the Parliament of Bangladesh. Designed by American architect [[Louis Kahn]], it is considered to be one of the landmarks of 20th-century architecture, and is one of the largest legislative complexes in the world.]]
Bangladesh is a [[unitary state]] and [[parliamentary democracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.bd/Constitution_English/index.htm |title=Constitution of Bangladesh |publisher=Parliament.gov.bd |accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> Direct elections in which all citizens, aged 18 or over, can vote are held every five years for the [[unicameral]] parliament known as the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. Currently it has 350 members (including 50 reserved seats for women) elected from single-member constituencies. The [[Prime Minister]], as the [[head of government]], forms the cabinet and runs the day-to-day affairs of state. While the [[Prime Minister]] is formally appointed by the [[President of Bangladesh|President]], he or she must be a [[member of parliament]] who commands the confidence of the majority.

The President is the [[head of state]], albeit mainly ceremonially in his/her elected post;<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm Background Note: Bangladesh], US Department of State, May 2007</ref> however, the President's powers are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalised in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.<ref name="amendments">{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/as.1997.37.6.01p0256x|last=Khan|first=Zillur R.|title=Bangladesh's experiments with parliamentary democracy|journal=Asian Survey|year=1997|volume=37|issue=6|pages=575–589|jstor=2645531}}</ref>

[[List of political parties in Bangladesh|Major parties]] in Bangladesh include the [[Awami League]], the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP), the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]] (BJI), and the [[Jatiya Party]] of former military dictator Ershad. [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s Awami League aligns with more [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] parties, whereas [[Khaleda Zia]]'s BNP has politically been allied with [[Islamist]] parties like the BJI but practices secular politics. The former two have been bitter, dominant political rivals for over 15 years; each is related to one of the leaders of the independence movement. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics are particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era, as almost all parties have highly active student wings, and student leaders have been elected to the Jatiyo Sangshad.

On 11 January 2007, following widespread political unrest, emergency law was declared and a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The 22 January 2007 election was postponed indefinitely as the Army-backed caretaker government of [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] aimed to prepare a new voter list and crack down on corruption. They also assisted the interim government of Bangladesh in a drive against corruption, which resulted in Bangladesh's position in [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] changed from the very bottom, where they had been for 3 years in a row, to 147th in just 1 year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table |title=cpi 2008 table /cpi2008/2008/in focus/news room |publisher=Transparency.org |accessdate=3 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100614084815/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table| archivedate= 14 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> A large alliance led by the Bangladesh Awami League won in a 29 December 2008 landslide victory, gaining 230 seats among 300 seats in the parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://123.49.39.5/result/report4.php?lang=en |title=Bangladesh Election Commission |publisher=123.49.39.5 |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

===Legal system===
{{main|Law of Bangladesh}}
Bangladeshi law is primarily in accordance with the [[English legal system]], although since 1947 the legal scenario of Bangladesh has significantly drifted from the West owing to differences in socio-cultural values and religious guidelines. Laws are loosely based on [[English law|English common law]], but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scriptures, and therefore differ between religious communities. The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was drafted in 1972 and has undergone 15 [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]].<ref name="amendments"/>

The highest [[judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]], with justices appointed by the President. The judicial and law enforcement institutions are comparatively weak.<ref name="ICG">[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/south-asia/bangladesh/121-bangladesh-today.aspx Bangladesh Today], Asia Report N°121, [[International Crisis Group]], 23 October 2006</ref> On 1 November 2007, Bangladesh successfully separated the Judiciary Branch from the Executive, but several black laws, including the Special Powers Act, still influence the rulers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/bangla/details.php?id=67213&cid=4 |title=বিচার বিভাগের পৃথক যাত্রাইতিহাসের খেরো খাতা থেকে &#124; অর্থনীতি |publisher=bdnews24.com |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-08}} {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> It is expected that this separation will make the judiciary stronger and more impartial.

Bangladesh pursues a foreign policy which places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In 1974, Bangladesh joined both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] and has since been elected to serve two terms on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]&nbsp;– in 1978–1979 and 2000–2001. In the 1980s, Bangladesh pioneered the formation of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), envisioning a South Asian version of [[ASEAN]]. In more recent years, Bangladesh has revived policies of promoting regional economic integration in South Asia, as well as the wider neighborhood.

Bangladesh's most important foreign [[Bangladesh-India relations|relationship]] is with neighbouring [[India]]. This complex relationship has grown out of historical and cultural affinities, as well as India's alliance with Bangladeshi nationalists during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation of Bangladesh]] in 1971. However, Bangladesh-India relations have gone through several hiccups in the last forty years. A major source of tension is water-sharing on 56 common rivers, as well as border security and barriers to trade and investments. Also, both countries have accused each other of harbouring insurgent groups.<ref name="MMAli">{{cite journal |first=M.M.|last=Ali |title= India's Major Gains and Losses in World Affairs |url= http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0397/9703025.htm|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050410152043/http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0397/9703025.htm|archivedate= 10 April 2005|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date= March 1997|accessdate=29 April 2008|page=25|volume=0397}}</ref> Recognising the importance of good relations, regional security and South Asian economic integration, the two countries have sought to revive relations in recent years, and have formed strategic partnerships to develop regional [[Interconnectivity|connectivity]], infrastructure, greater trade, mutual access to markets, hydropower, energy, environmental protection and cultural projects.

Bangladesh enjoys very warm ties with the [[People's Republic of China]], and particularly in the last decade there has been increased economic cooperation between them. Between 2006 and 2007, trade between the two nations rose by 28.5% and there have been agreements to grant various Bangladeshi commodities tariff-free access to the Chinese market. Cooperation between the [[Military of Bangladesh]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] is also increasing, with joint military agreements signed and Bangladesh purchasing Chinese arms which range from small arms to large naval surface combat ships such as the Chinese [[Jianghu class frigate|Type 053H1]] Missile Frigate.
[[File:Bangladesh Navy Ship Bangabandhu (F-25).jpg|thumb|A [[Bangladesh Navy]] [[Ulsan-class frigate|F-25]] frigate in the [[Bay of Bengal]].]]
The [[United States]] is a major development partner of Bangladesh, providing over six billion dollars in aid since 1972. American companies are the largest foreign investors in the country, and the US is also the largest market for Bangladeshi exports. Bangladesh participated in the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|US-led coalition]] during the [[1991 Gulf War]] to liberate [[Kuwait]], and supports the US-led reconstruction of [[Afghanistan]]. The [[US Military]] has taken part in several disaster management and relief operations in aftermath of devastating floods and cyclones to have hit Bangladesh, including [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone|Cyclone O2B]] and [[Cyclone Sidr]].<ref name="state.gov"/>

Bangladesh also enjoys close ties with the [[European Union]] and [[Japan]], involving politics, trade, development, defence, business, education and culture. It is a founding member of the [[Developing 8 Countries]]. As the world's fourth largest Muslim nation and third largest democracy in the [[Muslim world]], it is an important member of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]].

==Divisions==
{{Further|Divisions of Bangladesh|Districts of Bangladesh|Upazilas of Bangladesh}}
{{stack|{{Bangladesh Divisions Image Map}}}}
Bangladesh is divided into seven administrative divisions,<ref name=CIA /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151976&cid=2 |title=Rangpur becomes a division |publisher=bdnews24.com |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]], [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]], [[Khulna Division|Khulna]], [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] and [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]].

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.<ref>''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997</ref>

[[Dhaka]] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. The cities with a [[city corporation]], having mayoral elections, include [[Dhaka|Dhaka South]], [[Dhaka|Dhaka North]], [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Barisal]], [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Comilla]] and [[Gazipur, Dhaka Division|Gazipur]]. Other major cities, these and other municipalities electing a chairperson, include [[Mymensingh]], [[Gopalganj, Bangladesh|Gopalganj]], [[Jessore]], [[Bogra]], [[Dinajpur Sadar|Dinajpur]], [[Saidpur, Rangpur Division|Saidapur]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Rangamati]]. Both the municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.

There has also been a significant growth to Bangladesh's ship building industry in the last few years. The required ships and vessels in the country are being produced by the local shipbuilders. Furthermore, they have already started taking orders and executing them perfectly for foreign companies from Germany, Denmark and other European countries who prefer the cheap market of Bangladesh over their local market. The [[Khulna Shipyard]] have successfully completed building a Khulna Class LPC(Large [[Patrol Craft]]) and a [[LCVP]](Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) for the [[Bangladesh Navy]] and [[Bangladesh Army]] respectively, the cost being almost half of their import price. They are to build 5 more LPCs of the same class in the coming year.

The tourism sector in Bangladesh has experienced massive growth in recent years. The majority of growth is contributed by local tourists. It is believed to be a major tourist destination if properly advertised. Nonetheless, few government and [[private sector|private]] initiatives have been taken to attract [[Alien (law)|foreign]] tourists.

Though small in area, Bangladesh is quite rich in heritage with numerous historical and [[archeological]] sites. It has the longest natural unbroken sea beach and five [[World Heritage Site]]s. Among those are famous eighty one domed Shat Gombuj Mosque in Bagerhat, made by great Muslim saint Khan Jahan Ali in the 15th century; world's largest Mangrove forest [[Sundarbans]] which is also renowned for its world famous [[Royal Bengal Tiger]].

There are several exotic archaeological sites in the northern parts of Bangladesh, including the temple city [[Puthia Upazila|Puthia]] in [[Rajshahi]]; the largest and most ancient archaeological site, [[Mahasthangarh]] in [[Bogra]]; Among the best known Buddhist viharas in the Indian Subcontinent and one of the most important archaeological sites in the country, [[Somapura Mahavihara|Paharpur]] in [[Naogaon]], declared as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1985; [[Kantaji Temple]], the most ornamental [[terracota]] Hindu temple in Bangladesh and many rajbaris or palaces of old [[zamindar]]s. There are historic mosques too with vast architectural beauty like [[Shona Mosque]] built in 1493, [[Bagha Mosque]], in 1523, [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] in 1459, etc.

Bangladesh has the largest [[shopping mall]] in [[South Asia]], which is 13th largest in the world. It is [[Bashundhara City]] Shopping Mall which is situated at [[Karwan Bazar]] in [[Dhaka]].

Bangladesh has a low [[literacy rate]], estimated at 61.3% for males and 52.2% for females in 2010.<ref name=CIA/> The educational system in Bangladesh is three-tiered and highly subsidized. The government of Bangladesh operates many schools in the primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels. It also subsidises parts of the funding for many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the government also funds more than 15 state universities through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 5), Junior Secondary (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary.<ref name=CompEd>{{Cite book|author=T.

Reflecting the long history of the region, Bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new.

===Literature===
{{see also|Bengali literature}}
[[File:Tagorenazrul.png|thumb|250px|left|Poets [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Bengali culture is renowned for its [[Bengali literature|literature]], [[Bengali poetry|poetry]], [[Music of Bengal|music]] and [[Bangladeshi art|art]].]]
The [[Bengali language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the Indian state of West [[Bengal]]. The earliest literary text in Bengali is the 8th century [[Charyapada]]. Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious (for example, [[Chandidas]]), or adapted from other languages (for example, [[Alaol]]). Bengali literature reached its full expression in the 19th century, with its greatest icons being poets, the national poet [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay|Sarat Chandra]], [[Jasim Uddin]], [[Jibanananda Das]], [[Shamsur Rahman]], [[Al Mahmud]], [[Sukanta Bhattacharya]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]] and present day [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Muhammed Zafar Iqbal]]. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, for example ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' and stories related to ''[[Gopal Bhar]]'', ''Birbal'' and ''Molla Nasiruddin''.

===Film industries===
{{Main|Cinema of Bangladesh}}
The Bangladeshi film industry has been based in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, since 1956. As of 2004, it produced approximately 100 movies a year, with an average movie budget of about 20,000,000 Bangladeshi taka. The film industry is known as ''Dhallywood'', a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Logan | first = Stephen | title = Asian communication handbook 2008 | publisher = AMIC | year = 2008  | page = 115 | isbn = 981-4136-10-7}}</ref> Mainstream [[Bollywood|Hindi films]] are also quite popular.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Reuters |title= Cinemas in Bangladesh, Pakistan squeezed by Bollywood |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/835893/3362663.xhtml |publisher=NewIndPress.Com |date= 25 September 2006|accessdate=2 May 2008}}</ref>

===Music and arts===
{{Main|Music of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi art}}
The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Numerous musical traditions exist including [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]], varying from one region to the next. Folk music is accompanied by the [[ektara]], an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = London | first = Ellen | title = Bangladesh | publisher = Gareth Stevens Pub. | year = 2004 | page = 29 | isbn = 0-8368-3107-1}}</ref>

===Media===

Around 200 daily newspapers are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 500 periodicals. However, regular readership is low at just under 15% of the population.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Islam | first = Roumeen | title = The right to tell: the role of mass media in economic development | publisher = World Bank Publications | year = 2002 | page = 268 | isbn = 0-8213-5203-2}}</ref> Bangladeshis listen to a variety of local and national radio programs like [[Bangladesh Betar]]. Several private FM radio stations ([[Radio Foorti]], [[ABC Radio (Bangladesh)|ABC Radio]], [[Radio Today]], [[Radio Amar]] etc.) are popular among urban youths. International Bengali-language broadcasts include [[BBC Bangla]] and [[Voice of America]]. The dominant television channel is the state-owned [[Bangladesh Television]], but in the last few years, privately owned channels have developed considerably. Some popular privately owned TV channels are [[ATN Bangla]], [[Channel i]], [[NTV (Bangladesh)|NTV]], [[Ekushey Television]], [[Desh TV]], [[RTV (Bangladesh)|RTV]], [[Banglavision]], [[Islamic TV]], [[Boishakhi TV]], [[Mohona TV]], [[ATN News]], [[Somoy TV]], [[Independent Television (Bangladesh)|Independent TV]], [[Channel 9 Bangladesh]] etc.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bangladeshi cuisine}}
[[File:Bengali spices.JPG|thumb|Bengali spices are an important part of the local cuisine]]
The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to surrounding Bengali and North-East Indian cuisine as well as having its own unique traits. Rice and fish are traditional favourites. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet. [[Biryani]] is a favourite dish of Bangladesh and this includes egg biryani, mutton biryani and beef biryani.  Bengaladeshi cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] from milk products, some common ones being ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rasmalai'', ''Rôshomalai'', ''chômchôm'' and ''kalojam''.
It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service à la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine|French]] cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.

===Dress===
The [[Sari]] ({{lang|bn|শাড়ি}} ''shaŗi'') is by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi women. A guild of weavers in Dhaka is renowned for producing saris from exquisite [[Jamdani]] [[muslin]]. The [[salwar kameez]] ''(shaloar kamiz)'' is also quite popular, especially among the younger females, and in urban areas some women wear western attire. Among men, western attire is more widely adopted. Men also wear the ''[[kurta]]-paejama'' combination, often on special occasions, and the [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt for men.

===Festivals===
{{Main|Public holidays in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Pohela boishakh 2.jpg|thumb|right|Celebrations of the ''[[Pohela Boishakh]]'' (Bengali new year) in [[Dhaka]].]]

The Muslim holidays of [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]], the [[Pohela Boishakh|Bengali New Year]], [[Independence Day of Bangladesh|Independence day]], and [[Durga Puja]] by the significant Hindu community of Bangladesh,<!--Please note that remembrance is a major part of Language Movement Day and therefore can't be classed as a celebration--> see the most widespread celebrations in the country.  Other major Hindu festivals are [[Kali Puja]], [[Saraswati Puja]], and [[Krishna Janmashtami]]; alongside the Buddhist festival of [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and Christmas, called ''Borodin'' ("Great day"), are all (except Saraswati and Kali Puja) [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]].

''[[Pohela Boishakh]]'', the Bengali new year, is the major festival of [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and sees widespread festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only ''Pohela Boishakh'' comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). Unlike holidays like Eid ul-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is really about celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include [[Nabanna|Nabonno]], and ''Poush porbon'' (festival of [[Poush]]), both Bengali harvest festivals.

Alongside these are national days like the remembrance of 21 February 1952 [[Language Movement Day]] ([[International Mother Language Day]]), [[Independence Day of Bangladesh|Independence Day]] and [[Victory Day (Bangladesh)|Victory Day]]. On Language Movement Day, people congregate at the [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] in Dhaka to remember the national heroes of the [[Bengali Language Movement]], and at the [[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]] on Independence Day and Victory Day to remember the national heroes of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society can participate.

In 2011, Bangladesh successfully co-hosted the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2011]] with India and [[Sri Lanka]]. In 2012, the country hosted the [[Asia Cup]]. The team beat India and Sri Lanka but failed to keep the reputation in the final game against Pakistan. However, it was the first time Bangladesh had advanced to the final of any major cricket tournament.

They participated at the [[2010 Asian Games]] in Guangzhou, defeating Afghanistan to claim their Gold Medal in the first ever cricket tournament held in the Asian Games. [[Kabaddi]] is a very popular game in Bangladesh, especially in the villages. Often called the 'game of rural Bengal', it is now the National Game of Bangladesh.
