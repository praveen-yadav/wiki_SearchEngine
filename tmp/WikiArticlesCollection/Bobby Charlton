'''Sir Robert''' "'''Bobby'''" '''Charlton''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 11 October 1937) is an English former [[association football|football]] player, regarded as one of the greatest [[midfielder]]s of all time, and an essential member of the England team who won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and also won the [[Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or for European Footballer of the Year]] in 1966. He played almost all of his club football at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he became renowned for his attacking instincts and passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot. He was also well known for his fitness and stamina. His elder brother [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], who was also in the World Cup-winning team, is a former [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and international manager.

Born in [[Ashington]], [[Northumberland]], Charlton made his debut for the Manchester United first-team in 1956, and over the next two seasons gained a regular place in the team, during which time he survived the [[Munich air disaster]] of 1958 after being rescued by [[Harry Gregg]]. After helping United to win [[the Football League]] in 1965, he won a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] medal with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and another Football League title with United the following year. In 1968, he captained the Manchester United team that won the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]], scoring two goals in the final to help his team be the first English side to win the competition. He has scored more goals for England and United than any other player. Charlton held the record for most appearances for Manchester United (758),<ref>{{cite news | title=Giggs nears Reds all-time record |work=BBC Sport | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7382189.stm | date=3 May 2008 | accessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref> before being surpassed by [[Ryan Giggs]].

He was selected for four World Cups ([[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]], and [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]]), and helped England to win the competition in [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966]]. At the time of his retirement from the England team in 1970, he was the nation's most capped player, having turned out 106 times at the highest level. This record has since been eclipsed by [[Bobby Moore]], [[Peter Shilton]] and then [[David Beckham]].

He left Manchester United to become manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] for the 1973–74 season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bobby Charlton |work=britannica.com/eb |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002215 |accessdate=28 January 2006 }}</ref> He changed to player-manager the following season. He next accepted a post as a director with [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], then became a member of Manchester United's board of directors in 1984<ref>{{cite web | title=Bobby Charlton | work=fifaworldcup.yahoo.com| url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/cp/eng/charlton.html | accessdate=23 January 2006}}</ref> and remains one as of May 2013.

==Early life==
Charlton is related to several professional footballers on his mother's side of the family: his uncles were [[Jack Milburn (footballer born 1908)|Jack Milburn]] (Leeds United and Bradford City), [[George Milburn]] (Leeds United and Chesterfield), [[Jim Milburn]] (Leeds United and Bradford City) and [[Stanley Milburn|Stan Milburn]] (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer [[Jackie Milburn]], was his mother's cousin. However, Charlton credits much of the early development of his career to his grandfather Tanner and his mother Cissie.<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=19}}</ref> His elder brother, [[Jack Charlton|Jack]], initially went to work applying to the [[police|Police Service]] before also becoming a professional footballer with Leeds United.

==Club career==
On 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] chief scout [[Joe Armstrong (football scout)|Joe Armstrong]].<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=46}}</ref> Charlton went on to play for England schoolboys and the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with [[Wilf McGuinness]], also aged 15.<ref>{{Cite book|last=White|first=John D.T.|title=The Official Manchester United Almanac|edition=1st edition|date=29 May 2008|publisher=Orion Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-7528-9192-7|page=2|chapter=January}}</ref> Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an [[apprenticeship]] as an electrical engineer; however he went on to turn professional in October 1954.<ref>{{harvnb|Charlton|2007|p=62}}</ref>

Charlton became one of the famed [[Busby Babes]], the collection of talented footballers who emerged through the system at [[Old Trafford]] in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s as Matt Busby set about a long-term plan of rebuilding the club after the [[Second World War]]. He worked his way through the pecking order of teams, scoring regularly for the youth and reserve sides before he was handed his first team debut against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in October 1956. At the same time, he was doing his [[National service]] with the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] in [[Shrewsbury]], where Busby had advised him to apply as it meant he could still play for United at the weekend. Also doing his army service in  Shrewsbury at the same time was his United team-mate [[Duncan Edwards]].<ref>Charlton 2007, p.70</ref>

Charlton played 14 times for United in that first season, scoring twice on his debut and managing a total of 12 goals in all competitions, and including a hat-trick in a 5–1 away win over [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the February. United won the [[list of English football champions|league championship]] but were denied the 20th century's first "double" when they controversially lost the [[1957 FA Cup Final]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Charlton, still only 19, was selected for the game, which saw United goalkeeper [[Ray Wood]] carried off with a broken [[cheek]]bone after a clash with Villa centre forward [[Peter McParland]]. Though Charlton was a candidate to go in goal to replace Wood (in the days before substitutes, and certainly before goalkeeping substitutes), it was teammate [[Jackie Blanchflower]] who ended up between the posts.

Charlton was an established player by the time the next season was fully underway, which saw United, as current League champions, become the first English team to compete in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]]. Previously, [[the Football Association]] had scorned the competition but United made progress, reaching the semi-finals where they lost to holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. Their reputation was further enhanced the next season as they reached the quarter finals to play [[Red Star Belgrade]]. In the first leg at home, United won 2–1. The return in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] saw Charlton score twice as United stormed 3–0 ahead, although the hosts came back to earn a 3–3 draw. However, United maintained their [[aggregate score|aggregate]] lead to reach the last four and were in jubilant mood as they left to catch their flight home, thinking of an important League game against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] at the weekend. But the plane, carrying 44 passengers and crew (including the 17-strong Manchester United squad) crashed on take-off after re-fuelling at Munich. Charlton survived with minor injuries, but 23 people (eight of them Manchester United players) died as a result of their injures in the crash. Of the eight other players who survived, two of them were injured so badly that they never played again.

Further success with Manchester United came at last when they beat [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] 3–1 in the FA Cup final of 1963, with Charlton finally earning a winners' medal in his third final. Busby's post-Munich rebuilding programme continued to progress with two League championships within three seasons, with United taking the title in 1965 and 1967. A successful (though trophyless) season with Manchester United had seen him take the honours of ''[[Football Writers' Association|Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]]'' and ''[[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer Of The Year]]'' into the competition.

In 1968, Manchester United reached the [[1968 European Cup Final|European Cup final]], ten seasons after Munich. Even though other clubs had taken part in the competition in the intervening decade, the team which got to this final was still the first English side to do so. On a highly emotional night at Wembley, Charlton scored twice in a 4–1 win after extra time against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] and, as United captain, lifted the trophy.

During the early 1970s, Manchester United were no longer competing among the top teams in [[Football in England|England]], and at several stages were battling against relegation. At times, Charlton was not on speaking terms with United's other superstars [[George Best]] and [[Denis Law]], and Best refused to play in Charlton's testimonial match against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], saying that "to do so would be hypocritical".<ref>{{Cite book | title =Manchester United: The Betrayal of a Legend | pages =100–101 }}</ref> Charlton left Manchester United at the end of the [[1972–73 Manchester United F.C. season|1972–73 season]], having scored 249 goals and set a club record of 758 appearances, a record which [[Ryan Giggs]] broke in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final]]. His goalscoring record remains intact. 

His last game was against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] on 28 April 1973, and before the game the BBC cameras for ''[[Match of the Day]]'' captured the Chelsea chairman handing Charlton a commemorative cigarette case. The match  ended in a 1-0 defeat.<ref>{{cite web|title=28 April 1973 League Division One vs Chelsea|url=http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-matches/28-04-1973-chelsea.html|work=aboutmanutd.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> His final goal came a month earlier, on 31 March, in a 2-0 win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], also in the First Division.<ref>{{cite web|title=31 March 1973 League Division One vs Southampton|url=http://www.aboutmanutd.com/man-u-matches/31-03-1973-southampton.html|work=aboutmanutd.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>

==International career==
[[File:Bobby charlton elgrafico.JPG|thumb|upright|Charlton on the cover of the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] sports magazine [[El Gráfico]] on 27 June 1962]]
Charlton's emergence as the country's leading young football talent was completed when he was called up to join the [[England national football team|England]] squad for a [[British Home Championship]] game against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Hampden Park]] on 19 April 1958, just over two months after he had survived the Munich air disaster. 

Charlton was handed his debut as England romped home 4–0, with the new player gaining even more admirers after scoring a magnificent thumping volley dispatched with authority after a cross by the left winger [[Tom Finney]]. He scored both goals in his second game as England beat [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 2–1 in a friendly at Wembley; and overcame obvious nerves on a return to [[Belgrade]] to play his third match against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. England lost that game 5–0 and Charlton played poorly.

===1958 World Cup===
He was selected for the squad which competed at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958 World Cup]] in [[Sweden]], but didn't kick a ball, something at which critics expressed surprise and bewilderment,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} even allowing for his lacklustre performance in Belgrade.

In 1959 he scored a [[hat-trick]] as England demolished the [[United States men's national soccer team|US]] 8–1; and his second England hat-trick came in 1961 in an 8–0 thrashing of [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. He also managed to score in every [[British Home Championship]] tournament he played in except [[1963 British Home Championship|1963]] in an association with the tournament which lasted from 1958 to 1970 and included 16 goals and ten tournament victories (five shared).
[[File:Manchester The United trinity.jpg|thumb|upright|The "United Trinity" statue of Charlton (right) alongside [[Denis Law]] (centre) and [[George Best]] (left) outside [[Old Trafford]]]]

===1962 World Cup===
He played in qualifiers for the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]] in [[Chile]] against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] and Portugal and was named in the squad for the finals themselves. His goal in the 3–1 group win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] was his 25th for England in just 38 appearances, and he was still only 24 years old, but his individual success could not be replicated by that of the team, which was eliminated in the quarter final by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], who went on to win the tournament.

By now, England were coached by [[Alf Ramsey]] who had managed to gain sole control of the recruitment and team selection procedure from the [[committee]]-based call-up system which had lasted up to the previous World Cup. Ramsey had already cleared out some of the older players who had been reliant on the loyalty of the committee for their continued selection – it was well known that decorum on the pitch at club level had been just as big a factor in playing for England as ability and form.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Luckily for Charlton, he had all three.

A hat-trick in the 8–1 rout of [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in June 1963 took Charlton's England goal tally to 30, equalling the [[Progression of England association football goalscoring record|record]] jointly held by [[Tom Finney]] and [[Nat Lofthouse]] and Charlton's 31st goal against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in October the same year gave him the record alone. Charlton's role was developing from traditional inside-forward to what today would be termed an attacking midfield player, with Ramsey planning to build the team for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] around him. When England beat the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] 10-0 in a friendly on 27 May 1964, he scored one goal, his 33rd at senior level for England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.englandfc.com/Profiles/php/PlayerProfileByName.php?id=216|work=englandfc.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>

His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed [[Jimmy Greaves]], playing purely as a striker, would overtake Charlton's England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, he was still scoring and creating freely and as the tournament was about to start, he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.

===1966 World Cup===
England drew the opening game of the tournament 0–0 with Uruguay, and Charlton scored the first goal in the 2–0 win over Mexico. This was followed by an identical scoreline against [[France national football team|France]], allowing England to qualify for the quarter finals.

England defeated Argentina 1–0 – the game was the only one in which Charlton received a caution – and faced Portugal in the semi finals. This turned out to be one of Charlton's most important games for England.

Charlton opened the scoring with a crisp side-footed finish after a run by [[Roger Hunt]] had forced the Portuguese goalkeeper out of his net; his second was a sweetly struck shot after a run and pull-back from [[Geoff Hurst]]. Charlton and Hunt were now England's joint-highest scorers in the tournament with three each, and a final against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] beckoned.

The final turned out to be one of Charlton's quieter days; he and a young [[Franz Beckenbauer]] effectively marked each other out of the game. England won 4–2 after extra time.

===Euro 1968===
Charlton's next England game was his 75th as England beat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]; 2 caps later and he had become England's second most-capped player, behind the veteran [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]], who was approaching his 100th appearance when Charlton was starting out and ended with 105 caps.

Weeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by [[Jimmy Greaves]]. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championships]] where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in [[Florence]]. During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post. England defeated the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]] 2–0 in the third place match.

In 1969, Charlton was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to football. More milestones followed as he won his 100th England cap on 21 April 1970 against Northern Ireland, and was made captain by Ramsey for the occasion. Inevitably, he scored. This was his 48th goal for his country – his 49th and final goal would follow a month later in a 4–0 win over [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] during a warm-up tour for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], designed to get the players adapted to altitude conditions. Charlton's inevitable selection by Ramsey for the tournament made him the first – and still, to date, only – England player to feature in four World Cup squads.

===1970 World Cup===
Shortly before the World Cup Charlton was involved in the [[Bogotá Bracelet]] incident in which he and Bobby Moore were accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery store. Moore was later arrested and detained for four days before being granted a conditional release, while Charlton was not arrested.

England began the tournament with two victories in the group stages, plus a memorable defeat against Brazil. Charlton played in all three, though was substituted for [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] in the final game of the group against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. Ramsey, confident of victory and progress to the quarter final, wanted Charlton to rest.

England duly reached the last eight where they again faced West Germany. Charlton controlled the midfield and suppressed [[Franz Beckenbauer]]'s runs from deep as England coasted to a 2–0 lead. Beckenbauer pulled a goal back for the Germans and Ramsey replaced the ageing and tired Charlton with [[Colin Bell]] who further tested the German keeper [[Sepp Maier|Maier]] and also provided a great cross for [[Geoff Hurst]] who uncharacteristically squandered the chance. West Germany, who had a habit of coming back from behind, eventually scored twice – a back header from [[Uwe Seeler]] made it 2–2. In extra-time, Geoff Hurst had a goal mysteriously ruled out<ref>England: The Official F.A History, Niall Edworthy, Virgin Publishers, 1997, ISBN 1-85227-699-1. p. 101</ref> after which [[Gerd Müller]]'s goal won the match 2-3. England were out and, after a record 106 caps and 49 goals, Charlton decided to end his international career at the age of 32. On the flight home from Mexico, he asked Ramsey not to consider him again. His brother Jack, two years his senior but 71 caps his junior, did likewise.

Despite popular opinion the substitution did not change the game as Franz Beckenbauer had scored before Charlton left the field, hence Charlton had failed to cancel out the German. Charlton himself conceded that the substitution did not affect the game in a [[BBC]] documentary. His [[Progression of England association football caps record|caps record]] lasted until 1973 when [[Bobby Moore]] overtook him, and Charlton currently lies fourth in the all-time England appearances list behind Moore, [[David Beckham]] and [[Peter Shilton]], whose own England career began in the first game after Charlton's had ended. As of June 2013, Charlton's goalscoring record still stands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/Archive/|title=England Archive|accessdate=5 October 2008|publisher=The Football Association}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Munich air disaster==
{{see also|Munich air disaster}}

The aeroplane which took the United players and staff home from [[Zemun|Zemun Airport]] needed to stop in [[Munich]] to refuel. This was carried out in worsening weather, and by the time the refuelling was complete and the call was made for the passengers to re-board the aircraft, the wintry showers had taken hold and snow had settled heavily on the runway and around the airport. There were two aborted take-offs which led to concern on board, and the passengers were advised by a stewardess to disembark again while a minor technical error was fixed.

The team was back in the airport terminal barely ten minutes when the call to reconvene on the plane came, and a number of passengers began to feel nervous. Charlton and teammate [[Dennis Viollet]] swapped places with [[Tommy Taylor]] and [[David Pegg]], who had decided they would be safer at the back of the plane.

The plane clipped the fence at the end of the runway on its next take-off attempt and a wing tore through a nearby house, setting it alight. The wing and part of the tail came off and hit a tree and a wooden hut, the plane spinning along the snow until coming to a halt. It had been cut in half.

Charlton, strapped into his seat, had fallen out of the cabin and when United goalkeeper [[Harry Gregg]] (who had somehow got through a hole in the plane unscathed and begun a one-man rescue mission) found him, he thought he was dead. That said, he grabbed both Charlton and Viollet by their trouser waistbands and dragged them away from the plane in constant fear that it would explode. Gregg returned to the plane to try to help the appallingly injured Busby and Blanchflower, and when he turned around again, he was relieved to see that Charlton and Viollet, both of whom he had presumed to be dead, had got out of their detached seats and were looking into the wreckage.

Charlton suffered cuts to his head and severe [[shock (circulatory)|shock]] and was in hospital for a week. Seven of his teammates had perished at the scene, including Taylor and Pegg, with whom he and Viollet had swapped seats prior to the fatal take-off attempt. Club captain [[Roger Byrne]] was also killed, along with [[Mark Jones (footballer)|Mark Jones]], [[Liam Whelan|Billy Whelan]], [[Eddie Colman]] and [[Geoff Bent]]. [[Duncan Edwards]] died a fortnight later from the injuries he had sustained. In total, the crash claimed 23 lives. Initially, ice on the wings was blamed, but a later inquiry declared that [[slush]] on the runway had made a safe take-off almost impossible.

Charlton was the first injured survivor to leave hospital. [[Harry Gregg]] and [[Bill Foulkes]] were not hospitalized since they escaped uninjured. He arrived back in [[England]] on 14 February 1958, eight days after the crash. As he convalesced with family in Ashington, he spent some time kicking a ball around with local youths, and a famous photograph of him was taken. He was still only 20 years old, yet now there was an expectation that he would help with the rebuilding of the club as Busby's aides tried to piece together what remained of the season. He returned to playing in an FA cup tie against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March; the game was a draw and United won the replay 1–0.
 
Not unexpectedly, United went out of the European Cup to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the semi-finals to a 5–2 aggregate defeat and fell behind in the League. Yet somehow they reached their second consecutive FA Cup final, and the big day at Wembley coincided with Busby's return to work. However, his words could not inspire a side which was playing on a nation's goodwill and sentiment, and [[Nat Lofthouse]] scored twice to give  [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] side a 2–0 win.

==Management career and directorships==
[[File:Bobby2.jpg|right|thumb|Charlton at an explosives demonstration for the [[Mines Advisory Group]] and his own land mine clearance charity Find a Better Way in 2008]]
Charlton became the manager of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1973, signing his former United and England team-mate [[Nobby Stiles]] as player-coach. His first season ended in relegation and although he began playing again he left Preston early in the 1975–76 season after a disagreement with the board over the transfer of [[John Bird (footballer)|John Bird]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.leylandguardian.co.uk/news/big_interview_john_bird_1_163431 |title=Big Interview – John Bird |newspaper=Leyland Guardian |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=no9AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5aQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2250%2C4339777 |title=Charlton wanted |newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=24 |date=22 August 1975 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] that year and began a casual association with the [[BBC]] for punditry on matches which continued for many years. In early 1976, he scored once in 3 league appearances for [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]].

He joined [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] as a director, and was briefly caretaker manager there in 1983. He then spent some time playing in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web | title=Seven of my former 1966 World Cup winning team mates all played in South Africa. |work=Soccer Through The Years |url=http://www.soccerthroughtheyears.com/reviews.html|accessdate=20 October 2006}}</ref> He also built up several businesses in areas such as travel, jewellery and hampers, and ran soccer schools in the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and China. In 1984, he was invited to become member of the [[board of directors]] at Manchester United, partly because of his football knowledge and partly because it was felt that the club needed a "name" on the board after the resignation of [[Matt Busby|Sir Matt Busby]].<ref>{{Cite book | title =Manchester United: The Betrayal of a Legend | pages =181–182 }}</ref> He remains a director of Manchester United as of 2013 and his continued presence was a factor in placating many fans opposed to the club's takeover by [[Malcolm Glazer]].

==Personal life and retirement==
He met his wife, Norma Ball, at an [[ice rink]] in Manchester in 1959<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-389630/Footballers-wives-1966-relive-memories.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Footballers' wives of 1966 relive the memories | date=8 June 2006}}</ref> and they married in 1961. They have two daughters – [[Suzanne Charlton|Suzanne]] and Andrea. Suzanne was a weather forecaster for the [[BBC]] during the 1990s. They now have grandchildren, including Suzanne's son Robert, who is named in honour of his grandfather.

In 2007, while publicising his forthcoming autobiography, Charlton revealed that he had a long-running feud with his brother, [[Jack Charlton|Jack]]. They have rarely spoken since a falling-out between his wife Norma and his mother Cissie (who died on 25 March 1996 at the age of 83).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2156415,00.html |title=Sir Bobby reopens the family feud |accessdate=27 August 2007 |authorlink=David Smith |date=27 August 2007 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | location=London}}</ref> Charlton did not see his mother after 1992 as a result of the feud.<ref>[http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/mirror-football-blog/The-mums-of-Cristiano-Ronaldo-George-Best-Ashley-Cole-Bobby-and-Jack-Charlton-Frank-Lampard-Jose-Antonio-Reyes-Theo-Walcott-and-more-Football-s-10-most-important-mothers-article351987.html The mums of Cristiano Ronaldo, George Best, Ashley Cole, Bobby and Jack Charlton, Frank Lampard, Jose Antonio Reyes, Theo Walcott and more: Football's 10 most important mother...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Jack presented him with his [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] on 14 December 2008. He said that he was 'knocked out' as he was presented the award by his brother. He received a standing ovation as he stood waiting for his prize.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7775752.stm| title=Sports Personality 2008: Charlton given BBC Lifetime award| publisher=BBC| date=14 December 2008| accessdate=20 December 2008}}</ref>

Charlton helped to promote Manchester's bids for the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games and the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]], England's bid for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|London]]'s successful bid for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=Charlton leads tributes to Banks |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4594202.stm | accessdate=28 January 2006 | date=9 January 2006}}</ref> He received a knighthood in 1994 and was an Inaugural Inductee to the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002. On accepting his award he commented "I'm really proud to be included in the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. It's a great honour. If you look at the names included I have to say I couldn't argue with them. They are all great players and people I would love to have played with." He is also the (honorary) president of the [[National Football Museum]], an organisation about which he said "I can't think of a better Museum anywhere in the world." On 14 December 2008 Charlton was awarded the prestigious [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>{{Cite news | title=Charlton given BBC Lifetime award |publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7775752.stm | accessdate=14 December 2008 | date=14 December 2008}}</ref>

On 2 March 2009, Charlton was given the freedom of the city of Manchester, stating "I'm just so proud, it's fantastic. It's a great city. I have always been very proud of it." <ref>{{Cite news | title=Sir Bobby given freedom of city|publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7919176.stm | accessdate=2 March 2009 | date=2 March 2009}}</ref>

In January 2011 Charlton was voted the 4th greatest Manchester United player of all time by the readers of Inside United and ManUtd.com, behind [[Ryan Giggs]] (who topped the poll), [[Eric Cantona]] and [[George Best]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Giggs United's Greatest |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United | url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2011/Jan/Giggs-is-the-greatest.aspx?pageNo=2 | date=31 January 2011 | accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>
