It was named by Scottish squatter Archibald Yuille who established the first settlement—his sheep run called '''Ballaarat'''—in 1837,<ref>[http://www.ballaratreformleague.org.au/buninyong.htm Buninyong monument]. Ballarat Reform League.

It is one of the most significant Victorian era boomtowns in Australia. Just months after Victoria was granted separation from New South Wales, the [[Victorian gold rush]] transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement. Gold was discovered at [[Golden Point, Victoria|Poverty Point]] on 18 August 1851 and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted. Within months, approximately 20,000 migrants had rushed the district.<ref name='Ballarat Population 1852'>{{cite news | title = Victoria - Mount Alexander | date = 11 December 1852 | work = Sydney Morning Herald | page = 2 | accessdate =6 May 2012 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12942220}}</ref> Several Australian mining innovations were made at the Ballarat diggings including the first use of a Chilean mill in 1851 and the first use of a mine cage in 1861.<ref>Davey, Christopher.

The [[Eureka Rebellion]] began in Ballarat and the only armed rebellion in [[Australian history]], the Battle of Eureka Stockade, took place on 3 December 1854. In response to the event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]]  was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The gold rush and boom gave birth in many other significant cultural legacies. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]] has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat.

Proclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th&nbsp;century, after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and the largest city in the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]]—a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well preserved Victorian era heritage.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and European settlement ===

Prior to the [[European settlement of Australia]], the Ballarat region was populated by the [[Wathaurong]] people, an [[Indigenous Australian]] people.<ref name="history">{{cite web|title=Ballarat’s Indigenous Heritage|url=http://sheducationcom.ascetinteractive.biz/uploads//SovHill%20indigenousheritage%20notes%20ss1.pdf|work=Sovereign Hill Education|accessdate=19 August 2010}}</ref>  The Boro gundidj tribe's territory was based along the Yarrowee River.

The first Europeans to sight the area were an 1837 party of six mostly Scottish squatters from Geelong led by Somerville Learmonth who were in search of land less affected by the severe drought for their sheep to graze.  The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]], among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson all three of which later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.

The Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|km2|adj=on}} sheep run.  The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area "Ballaarat" which it is thought he derived from local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] words for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain, however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean 'resting place'. In some dialects, ''balla'' means "bent elbow" which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning "place".

=== 1850s: Gold rush ===
[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853–1854 oil painting from an original sketch by [[Eugene von Guerard]].]]

The first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] in 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, "Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1837–1901", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851, John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name="The Courier 1851-11-05">{{cite news | title = Victoria | date = 5 November 1851 | work = The Courier | page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find, a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings. Yields were particularly high with the first prospectors in the area extracting between half-an-ounce<ref>Ballarat Diggings: From the Correspondent of the Geelong Advertiser. pg 2. The Argus. 13 September 1851</ref> (which was more than the average wage of the time) and up to five ounces of alluvial gold per day. As news of the [[Australian gold rushes]] reached the world, Ballarat gained an international reputation as a particularly rich goldfield. As a result, a huge influx of immigrants occurred, including many from Ireland and China, gathering in a collection of prospecting [[shanty town]]s around the creeks and hills.  In just a few months, numerous alluvial runs were established, several deep mining leads began, and the population had swelled to over 20,000 people.<ref name='Ballarat Population 1852'/>

The first Post Office opened on 1 November 1851. It was the first Victorian post office to open in a gold-mining settlement.<ref name = "a">{{cite web| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate =11 April 2008| postscript =  }}</ref>  Parts of the district were first surveyed by [[William Urquhart]] as early as October 1851.<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Ken|title=The surveying career of William Swan Urquhart, 1845–1864|url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provenance/no8/SurveyingCareer1.asp|work=Public Record Office Victoria|publisher=Government of Victoria|accessdate=19 August 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091027064407/http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/provenance/no8/SurveyingCareer1.asp |archivedate = 27 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> By 1852 his [[grid plan]] and wide streets for land sales in the new township of West Ballarat<ref name='Ballarat: A Guide to Buildings'>{{cite book | last1 = Jacobs | first1 = Wendy | last2 = Nigel | first2 = Lewis | last3 = Elizabeth | first3 = Vines | last4 = Richard | first4 = Aitken | title = Ballarat: A Guide to Buildings and Areas 1851–1940 | publisher = Jacobs Lewis Vines Architects and Conservation Planners | year = 1981 | page = 11 | isbn = 0-9593970-0-0}}</ref> built upon a [[plateau]] of [[basalt]] contrasted markedly with the existing narrow unplanned streets, tents and gullies of the original East Ballarat settlement.

The first newspaper, The Banner, published on 11 September 1853, was one of many to be distributed during the gold-rush period. Print media played a large role in the early history of the settlement.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Cornfield | first1 = Jason | last2 = Wickham | first2 = Dorothy | last3 = Gervasoni | first3 = Clare | title = The Eureka Encyclopedia | publisher = Ballarat Heritage Services | year = 2004 | page = 391 | isbn = 1-876478-61-6}}</ref> Ballarat attracted a sizable number of miners from the Californian 1848 gold rush and some were known as Ballafornians.<ref>K.

[[File:Eureka stockade battle.jpg|thumb|right|Battle of the Eureka Stockade. J. B. Henderson (1854) Watercolour]]
Civil disobedience in Ballarat led to Australia's first and only armed civil uprising, the [[Eureka Rebellion]] (colloquially referred to as the ''Eureka Stockade'') which took place in Ballarat on 3 December 1854. The event, in which 22 miners died, is considered to be a defining moment in Australian history.

The city earned the nickname "The Golden City" in the 1850s.<ref>Perkin, Corrie [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/golden-city-of-ballarat-comes-into-the-picture/story-e6frg8n6-1225768084821 Golden city of Ballarat comes into the picture] The Australian 1 September 2009</ref> The gold rush population peaked at almost 60,000, mostly male diggers, by 1858.<ref>{{cite news | title = Gold Rush Population Peak 1858-9-23 | date = 23 September 1858 | work = The Star | page = 2 | accessdate =6 May 2012 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/6460448?zoomLevel=1}}</ref>  However the early population was largely itinerant. As quickly as the alluvial deposits drew prospectors to Ballarat, the rate of gold extraction fluctuated and, as they were rapidly worked dry, many quickly moved to rush other fields as new findings were announced, particularly [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Mount Alexander]] in 1852, [[Beaufort, Victoria|Fiery Creek]]<ref name='Fiery Creek 1855-11-03'>{{cite news | title = Colonial News, Victoria | date = 3 November 1855 | work = The Maitland Mercury & Hunter River General Advertiser | page = 3 | accessdate =6 May 2012 | url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/page/129327?zoomLevel=1}}</ref> in 1855, [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] in 1857.

Confidence of the city's early citizens in the enduring future of their city is evident in the sheer scale of many of the early public buildings, generous public recreational spaces, and opulence of many of its commercial establishments and private housing. A local steam locomotive industry developed from 1854 with the Phoenix Foundry operating until 1906.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butrims |first1=Robert |last2=Macartney |first2=David |title=The Phoenix Foundry: Locomotive Builders of Ballarat |publisher=Australian Railway History Society | year=2013 |isbn=978-0-646-90402-3}}</ref> The railway came to the town with the opening of the [[Geelong-Ballarat railway line|Geelong-Ballarat line]] in 1862,<ref name="rg">{{cite web

[[File:Sturt and lydiard streets in 1899.jpg|thumb|right|The intersection of Lydiard and Sturt Street in about 1905 was the heart of a bustling city of trams, horses and pedestrians.]]
From the late 1860s to the early 20th century, Ballarat made a successful transition from a gold rush town to an industrial-age city.  The ramshackle tents and timber buildings gradually made way for permanent buildings, many impressive structures of solid stone and brick mainly built from wealth generated by early mining.

[[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited between 9 and 13 December 1867 and, as the first ever royal visit, the occasion was met with great fanfare.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly">{{cite book | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Jan | title = Speak Out Boldly : The first 125 years of the Ballarat Courier | publisher = The Courier | year = 1992 | location = Ballarat | page = 12 | isbn =978-0-646-09971-2}}</ref> The Prince Room was prepared at Craigs Royal Hotel for his stay.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.craigsroyal.com.au/accommodation/Video/history/ | title = Craig's Royal Hotel - History | accessdate =30 June 2012 | publisher = craigsroyal.com.au}}</ref> The city's first civic centre—Prince Alfred Hall—erected over the Yarrowee between the two municipalities, was named in his honour during his visit.

Ballarat was proclaimed a city in 1871. Gong Gong reservoir was built in 1877 to alleviate flooding and to provide a permanent water supply. A [[Serviceton railway line|direct railway to Melbourne]] was completed in December 1889.<ref name="newsrail-line">{{cite journal

=== Declining fortunes ===
[[File:Ballarat North Workshops.jpg|thumb|Development of the Ballarat North Workshops was a major initiative to capitalise on the city's burgeoning role as a railway town and transition from a declining gold mining industry]]
Following the start of the 20th century, however, mining activity slowed and Ballarat's growth all but stopped—the city went into a period of decline.

The [[Sunshine rail disaster]] in 1908 resulted in the death of dozens of Ballarat residents.<ref name=age>{{Citation | title = Terrible railway disaster | newspaper = [[The Age]] |  publication-place = Melbourne | publisher = David Syme & Co | date = 21 August 1908}}</ref>  On 19 August 1909, a great storm lashed the city, resulting in the death of one person and injury of seven others. During the storm, a tornado swept across the city's northern and eastern suburbs destroying numerous homes in [[Ballarat North, Victoria|Ballarat North]], [[Soldiers Hill, Victoria|Soldiers Hill]], [[Black Hill, Victoria|Black Hill]] and [[Ballarat East, Victoria|Ballarat East]], lifting and then again touching down at [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka]] where it destroyed more homes before dissipating.<ref>"The Ballarat Tornado" p6.

Ballarat's significant representation during WWI resulted in heavy human loss.  The city eventually lost first provincial status to Geelong.<ref>Progressive Geelong – Industrial Expansion. Development of the Harbour. [[The Argus, Melbourne]] 14 October 1921 p 8</ref> In response, local lobbyists continually pushed the Victorian government for [[decentralisation]], the greatest success being the [[Victorian Railways]] opening the [[Ballarat North Workshops]] in April 1917.<ref name="lee144">{{cite book| author = Lee, Robert| coauthors = Rosemary Annable, Donald Stuart Garden| title = The Railways of Victoria 1854–2004| date = 1 August 2007| publisher = Melbourne University Publishing Ltd| isbn = 978-0-522-85134-2| page = 144 }}</ref>  The [[Great Depression]] proved a further setback for Ballarat, with the closure of many institutions and causing the worst unemployment in the city's history, with over a thousand people in the dole queue.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/>{{rp|38}}

The city's two municipalities, Ballarat East and West Town Councils finally amalgamated in 1921 to form the City of Ballarat.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/>{{rp|32}}

=== Since the 20th century ===
While deep, the depression was also brief. The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.<ref>Geelong Ousts Ballarat. Population Surprises. The Argus (Melbourne) Tuesday 28 April 1936, page 10</ref>  During World War II an expanded Ballarat airport was the base of the [[RAAF]] Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for [[USAAF]] Liberator bomber squadrons. In 1942, Ballarat became connected to the state electricity grid by a 66,000 kV line.<ref name='Courier 1993-02-20'>{{cite news | first = Julia | last = Balderstone | title = SEC offers historic lake property for sale | date = 1993-02-20 | work = The Courier }}</ref> Prior to this, power supply was generated locally.

[[File:Civic Hall Ballarat.jpg|thumb|Civic Hall, Mair Street shortly after completion. Intended as a new civic centre and the largest community construction project undertaken in the postwar era.]]
In the [[Post-war]] era, Ballarat's growth continued. In response to an acute housing shortage, significantly suburban expansion occurred. An extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm| archivedate= 9 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. Whilst planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 to 1962. During the 1970s a further 300 houses were constructed. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city.

The 1950s brought a new optimism to the city. On 17 April 1952 it was announced that Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics,<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/>{{rp|55}} work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission.<ref>Ballarat 'B' Power Station.

During the following decades, the city saw increased threats to its heritage. In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar supported verandahs in the CBD which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust who had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name="Speak Out Boldly"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination visited by thousands each year.

The city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.<ref name="ReferenceB">http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr| archivedate= 18 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Mount Warrenheip Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Ballarat's skyline hidden from this view of the city looking east across Lake Wendouree to Mount Warrenheip.]]
Ballarat lies at the foothills of the [[Great Dividing Range]] in Central Western Victoria. Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.

Geologically the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip which are the area's tallest peaks.  As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location – http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>  Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz.  Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.

There are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat, however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex.  Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.

The contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately 90&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of the local government area's {{convert|740|km|0|abbr=off}}.<sup>2</sup><ref name='Land Use'>{{cite web | url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf | title = Ballarat Planning Scheme - Land Use | accessdate =14 May 2012 | date = 18 March 2010 | work = City of Ballarat | publisher = City of Ballarat}}</ref> Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.<ref name='Land Use'/>  From the city centre this area extends north to approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north to the hills around Invermay, approximately {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on}} east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west along the plains to Lucas and approximately {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on}} south along the Yarrowee river and Canadian creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.<ref name="HIS 2011-10"/>  The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs. The reach of the Yarrowee toward Ballarat Central becomes a stormwater drain and is completely covered over as it flows under the CBD.

===City and suburbs===

{{see also|Ballarat Central}}
Ballarat is a primarily low-rise city though apart from the area around Ballarat Airport there are few established height limits for buildings. The City of Ballarat defines two [[activity centre|Major Activity Centre]]s within the urban area - the Central Business District (CBD) and Wendouree with a high concentration of business, retail and community function based primarily on the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning model and a further 11 neighbourhood activity centres.<ref>http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/991206/ballarat_c151_panel_report.pdf</ref> The tallest building in urban Ballarat is the seven-storey Henry Bolte wing of the Ballarat Base Hospital (1994).
Beyond the central area, urban Ballarat extends into several suburban areas. Settlement patterns around Ballarat consist of small villages and country towns, some with less than a few thousand people.

The Central Business District (located in [[Ballarat Central]]) is a large mixed-use office and retail district bounded to the north by railway lines, to the west by Drummond Street, to the south to Grant street and to the east by Princes Street and spanning the floodplain of the Yarrowee River. Lydiard, Sturt Streets, Armstrong, Doveton, Dana Street and Bridge Street (known as Bridge Mall) along with the historic centre of East Ballarat—Main Street and Bakery Hill have retained stands of commercial and civic buildings of state and national heritage significance.

The inner established suburbs were initially laid out around the key mining areas and include [[Ballarat East, Victoria|Ballarat East]], [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]], [[Golden Point, Victoria|Golden Point]], [[Soldiers Hill, Victoria|Soldiers Hill]], [[Black Hill, Ballarat|Black Hill]], [[Brown Hill, Victoria|Brown Hill]], [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka]], [[Canadian, Victoria|Canadian]], [[Mount Pleasant, Victoria|Mount Pleasant]], [[Redan, Victoria|Redan]], [[Sebastopol, Victoria|Sebastopol]] and [[Newington, Victoria|Newington]].

The post gold rush era has seen a boom in expansion, extending the [[conurbation]] north, south and west. To the west, Ballarat has expanded to [[Alfredton, Victoria|Alfredton]], [[Delacombe, Victoria|Delacombe]] and [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]]; to the north it has expanded to [[Ballarat North, Victoria|Ballarat North]], [[Invermay Park, Victoria|Invermay Park]], [[Invermay, Victoria|Invermay]] and [[Nerrina, Victoria|Nerrina]]; to the east to [[Warrenheip, Victoria|Warrenheip]] and south to [[Sebastopol, Victoria|Sebastopol]], [[Mount Clear, Victoria|Mount Clear]] and [[Mount Helen, Victoria|Mount Helen]] with the urban area encroaching the large town of [[Buninyong, Victoria|Buninyong]].

Wendouree is currently the only major suburban activity centre with a large indoor shopping mall—Stockland Shopping Centre (expanded in 2007<ref>[http://www.stockland.com.au/assets/shopping-centres_vic/DEV24467_WEN_FlashTower.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>) and also has a number of surrounding retail parks including a strip shopping centre along Howitt Street including the large retail chain [[Harvey Norman]]. Elsewhere are small suburban hubs with supermarkets such as [[IGA (supermarkets)]] and small stretches of shopfronts.

Unlike Melbourne, Ballarat does not have a defined urban growth boundary.<ref>[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/melbourne2030online/content/policies_initiatives/02a_policy21.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>  This has put continuing pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe. In response to lobbying by landholders, the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major greenfield land development plan, was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents, effectively doubling the city's urban area by extending the urban sprawl from Sebastopol, Delacombe and Alfredton west toward [[Bonshaw, Victoria|Bonshaw]], [[Smythes Creek, Victoria|Smythes Creek]] and [[Cardigan, Victoria|Cardigan]]<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr| archivedate= 18 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> with a new suburb to be known as [[Lucas, Victoria|Lucas]] to be created.<ref>Henderson, Fiona [http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/ballarat-west-suburb-to-be-named-lucas/2071841.aspx Ballarat west suburb to be named Lucas] The Courier 10 February 2011</ref>  New activity centres are to be developed at Delacombe and Alfredton.

Light snowfall typically falls on nearby Mount Buninyong and Mount Warrenheip at least once a year but only in the urban area during heavy winters. Widespread frosts and fog are more common during the cooler months. Snow has been known to fall heavily. Heavy snow seasons occurred in 1900–1902, 1905–1907 (with record falls in 1906) and moderate snow seasons during the 1940s and 1980s.

==Economy==
The economy of Ballarat is driven by all three [[economic sector]]s, though contemporary Ballarat has emerged as a primarily [[service economy]] with its main industry being the [[service industry]] and its key areas of business including [[tourism]], [[hospitality]], [[retail]], [[professional services]], government administration and [[education]].  [[Secondary industry]] including [[manufacturing]], which had grown in the 20th century remains an important sector. The city's historic [[primary industry]] roots including [[mining]] and [[agriculture]] continue to play a role, though one that has declined since the 20th century. Industries emerging this century include [[information technology]] service sector and [[renewable energy]].

===Service industries===
As a major service centre for the populous goldfields region, Ballarat has large sectors of employment in business including retail, professional services and [[tradespeople|trades]] as well as state and federal government branch offices for [[public services]] and [[health care]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-government]] [[service organisation]]s. Collectively these industries employ more than half of the city's workforce and generate the bulk of the city's economic activity.

Ballarat is the main retail economy in the region. The city has several key retail districts including a [[pedestrian mall]] known as Bridge Mall comprising over 100 traders. There are also indoor shopping malls including [[Central Square, Ballarat|Central Square Shopping Centre]] and [[Stockland Wendouree]]. better known as Wendouree Village, with a large number of [[specialty store]]s. Major department stores include [[Myer]], [[Target Australia|Target]], [[Big W]], [[Kmart]], [[Harvey Norman]] and [[Harris Scarfe]].<ref>Harris Scarfe Ballarat store opens. The Courier. 
15 June 2011</ref> Additionally each of the major supermarkets ([[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]], [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]], [[IGA (Australian supermarket group)|IGA]] and [[Aldi]]) are represented.

A significant [[heritage tourism]] industry has grown substantially in Ballarat since the 1960s. Ballarat is most notable for the award-winning [[open-air museum]] known as [[Sovereign Hill]], a recreated 1850s gold mining settlement opened in 1970. Sovereign Hill is Ballarat's biggest tourism drawcard and is consistently rated among one of the best outdoor museums in the world and continues to expand. Sovereign Hill accounts for over half a million of Ballarat's visitors and $40&nbsp;million in tourism revenue.<ref>[http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=sovereignhil Business Ballarat – Sovereign Hill]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>

Several [[tourist trap]]s and spin-offs have capitalised on Sovereign Hill's tourism popularity, most of these have sprung up near the eastern entrance of the Western Freeway between Melbourne and Ballarat. They include [[Kryal Castle]] (1972), "Gold Rush Mini Golf" (2002) featuring the "Big Miner" (2006) one of [[Australia's big things]] (although the original proposal appeared larger and for the miner to hold the Eureka Flag)<ref>http://www.goldrushgolf.com.au/uploads/GoldrushEditorial_4_web.pdf</ref> at Ballarat's eastern entrance.

Other tourist attractions include the [[Eureka Centre]]; [[The Gold Museum, Ballarat|The Gold Museum]]; Ballarat Botanic gardens and Lake Wendouree; the [[Ballarat Tramway Museum]] and [http://www.eerietours.com.au/ Ballarat Ghost Tours]. A large number of Ballarat hotels, motels and restaurants service the tourism industry. The Ballarat Tourist Association is an industry based non-profit, membership organisation representing the city's tourism industry.

As a goldrush boomtown, Ballarat began as a centre of primary industry. Thought gold no longer plays a pivotal role in the economy of the city, gold mining continues to the present date on a smaller scale with a main mine operating. There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves in the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies to extract potentially as much gold as the [[Victorian gold rush|Gold Rush]] days in the mid-1800s.

===Television===
Television station BTV Channel 6 Ballarat commenced transmission of test patterns on 17 March 1962. Among the many local programs BTV6 produced, the 90&nbsp;minute live variety program "Six Tonight" (1971–1983) hosted by local Ballarat identity Fred Fargher, was one of the few live Australian programs of this type being presented in Australia.

In his 1999 book ''And Now Here's...'' (Four Decades of Behind the Scenes Fun in Australian Television), Mike McColl Jones fondly remembers local live television variety.
"...and in Ballarat, Victoria, a Tonight show ("Six Tonight") was carving its name into Australian television history. The show, hosted by Fred Fargher, ran for 13 years, and managed to attract many of the top name entertainers in the world, simply by offering them a limo ride to this beautiful country centre, a no-pressure spot on the show, and then a great dinner afterwards at one of the city's excellent restaurants. The sheer bravado of the offer enticed some of show business' biggest names".

Today Ballarat is serviced by numerous "free to air" High Definition and Standard Definition Digital television services. Two television broadcasting stations are located in the city including [[WIN Television|WIN]], [[GEM HD]] and [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]] (sub-licensees of [[Nine Network]]) and [[Prime7]], [[7Two]], [[7mate]] (a sub-licensee of [[Seven Network]]). These two stations broadcast relayed services throughout regional Victoria. The city also receives [[Southern Cross Ten]], [[One HD]] and [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]] (sub-licensee's of [[Network Ten]]) that is based in [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] but operates a local office.

Ballarat television maintains a similar schedule to the national television network but maintains local commercials and regional news programming[[VTV (TV station)|WIN]] produces a 30-minute local news bulletin each weeknight from its studios in the city, where bulletins for [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], [[Bendigo]], [[Gippsland]], [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]] and [[Mildura]] also originate. [[GLV/BCV|Southern Cross Ten]] provides short local news updates from its Canberra studios throughout the day. In addition to commercial television services, Ballarat receives Government [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] (ABC1, ABC2, ABC3, ABC News 24) and [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] (SBS One and Two) television services.

On Friday 5 May 2011, Analog television transmissions ceased in most areas of regional Victoria and some border regions including Ballarat and surrounding areas. All local free-to-air television services are now broadcasting in digital transmission only. This was done as part of the Federal Government`s plan for [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia]], where all analogue transmission systems are gradually turned off and replaced with modern [[DVB-T]] transmission systems.

Subscription television services are provided by [[Neighbourhood Cable]], [[Foxtel]], and [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]].
