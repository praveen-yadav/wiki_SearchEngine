The United States provided emergency [[humanitarian aid]] and economic assistance to Cape Verde in the period immediately following Cape Verde's independence, as well as after natural disasters, including a [[hurricane]] that struck the island of Brava in 1982, and after a severe [[volcanic eruption]] on Fogo in 1995. Cape Verde also is eligible for trade benefits under the [[African Growth and Opportunity Act]] (AGOA), and has signed an Open Skies agreement to facilitate air travel safety and expansion. On July 4, 2005, Cape Verde became the third country to sign a compact with the U.S. Government-funded [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC); the five-year assistance package is worth over $110 million in addressing rural economic expansion, [[infrastructure]] development, and development of the credit sector.
