'''Actium''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἄκτιον) was the ancient name of a [[promontory]] of western Greece in northwestern [[Acarnania]], at the mouth of the Sinus Ambracius ([[Gulf of Arta]]) opposite [[Nicopolis]], built by [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] on the north side of the strait.<ref>http://www.enotes.com/occc-encyclopedia/actium</ref>

On the promontory was an ancient temple of [[Apollo|Apollo Actius]], which was enlarged by Augustus, who, to memorialize the [[Battle of Actium]], instituted or renewed the quinquennial games known as [[Actia]] or [[Ludi]] Actiaci. Actiaca Aera was a computation of time from the battle. There was on the promontory a small town, or rather village, also called Actium.

==History==
[[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Actium]]. Note anachronisms.]]
Actium belonged originally to the [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]]ian [[colonists]] of Anactorium, who probably founded the [[worship]] of Apollo Actius and the Actia games; in the 3rd century BC it fell to the [[Acarnanians]], who subsequently held their synods there. Actium is chiefly famous as the site of the Naval [[Battle of Actium]], in which [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]] won a decisive victory over [[Mark Antony]] on (September 2, 31 BC). This battle ended a long series of ineffectual operations. The final conflict was provoked by Antony, who is said to have been persuaded by his lover, the queen [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt|of Egypt]], to retire to her land and give battle to mask his retreat; but lack of provisions and the growing demoralization of his [[army]] would eventually account for this decision.<ref>http://ehistory.osu.edu/world/articles/ArticleView.cfm?AID=16</ref> An ancient Roman festival, [[Actia]], was named after Actium, in Nicopolis, the new city (today [[Preveza]], Greece). Since 2002, Actium is linked with [[Preveza]] on the north shore of the [[Ambracian Gulf]] by the [[Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel]], or [[Aktio-Preveza Immersed Tunnel]] (traffic labels). Also during Summer of 2009 archaeologists discovered in Actium the ruins of the Temple of Apollo (in Greek Ναός του Ακτίου Απόλλωνος) and found two statues' heads, one of Apollo, one of Artemis (Diana).<ref>Dr. Harry Gouvas:History of Preveza Prefecture, 2009, ISBN 978-960-87328-2-7</ref>
