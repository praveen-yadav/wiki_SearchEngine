The '''Christian Social Union in Bavaria''' ({{Audio|De-CSU.ogg|'''CSU''' – ''Christlich-Soziale Union in Bayern''}}) is a [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] [[list of political parties in Germany|political party in Germany]]. It operates only in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], while its larger sister party, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), operates in the other 15 [[states of Germany]]. The CSU has 45 seats in the [[Bundestag]], making it the smallest of the five parties represented.
{{Politics of Bavaria}}

The CSU was founded in some ways as a continuation of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Catholic [[Bavarian People's Party]]. At the federal level, the CSU forms a common '[[CDU/CSU]]' faction in the Bundestag with the CDU, which is frequently referred to as the Union Faction (''die Unionsfraktion''). Until the 2013 election, the CSU governed at the federal level along with the CDU in a [[coalition government]] with the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP). In the state of Bavaria, the CSU governs as the major party in a coalition government with the FDP.

The CSU is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and its [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] sit in the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]]. The CSU currently has three ministers in the [[cabinet of Germany]] of the federal government in Berlin, while party leader [[Horst Seehofer]] serves as [[Minister-President of Bavaria]]: a position that CSU representatives have held since 1957.

==History==

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F049272-0002, München, CSU-Bundestagswahlkampf, Strauß.jpg|thumb|Chairman Franz Josef Strauß in 1976]]
[[Franz Josef Strauß]] (1915–1988) had left behind the strongest legacy as a leader of the party, having led the party from 1961 until his death in 1988. His political career in the federal cabinet was unique in that he had served four ministerial posts in the years between 1953 and 1969. From 1978 until his death in 1988 he served as the minister-president of Bavaria. He was the first leader of the CSU to be a candidate for the German chancellery, in 1980. In the [[German federal election, 1980|1980 elections]] he ran against the incumbent [[Helmut Schmidt]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), but lost thereafter, as the SPD and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) managed to secure an absolute majority together, forming a [[Social-liberal coalition]].

The CSU has led the Bavarian government since it came into existence in 1946, save from 1950 to 1953 when the [[Bavaria Party]] formed a state government in coalition with the German Branches of the SPD and FDP. The CSU currently governs with the FDP. Before the 2008 elections in Bavaria, the CSU perennially achieved absolute majorities at the state level by itself. This level of dominance is unique among Germany's 16 states. [[Edmund Stoiber]] took over the CSU leadership in 1999. He ran for [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Federal Chancellor]] in 2002, but his preferred [[CDU/CSU]] and FDP coalition lost against the SPD candidate [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s [[red-green alliance|SPD-Green alliance]]. In 2003, the CSU was [[Bavaria state election, 2003|re-elected]] as the Bavarian government with a majority (60.7% and 124 of 180 seats in the state parliament). On 18 January 2007, Stoiber announced his decision to step down from the posts of Minister-President and CSU chairman by 30 September of that year.

On 28 September 2008, the CSU failed to gain an absolute majority, attaining 43%, of the vote in the [[Bavaria state election, 2008|Bavaria state election]] for the first time since 1966 on a percentage basis and was forced into a coalition with the FDP. Even after the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 general election]], the CDU/CSU emerged as the largest party in Germany, yet both lost votes predominantly to the FDP. The CSU received only 42.5% of the vote in Bavaria in the 2009 election, which constitutes its weakest showing in the party's history. They have three ministers in Berlin: [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]] ([[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]), Peter Ramsauer (Federal Minister of Transport, Building and Urban Affairs) and [[Ilse Aigner]] (Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection).

==Relationship with the CDU==
The CSU is the sister party of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]].<ref name=spiegelquickguide>{{cite news|title=A Quick Guide to Germany's Political Parties|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/where-do-they-stand-a-quick-guide-to-germany-s-political-parties-a-651388.html|accessdate=1 December 2012|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=25 September 2009}}</ref>  Together, they are called 'The Union'.<ref name=spiegelquickguide/> The CSU operates only within Bavaria, and the CDU operates in all other states, but not Bavaria.  While virtually independent,<ref>{{cite book |title=Political Europe |last1=The Economist |first1= |year=1983 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-27793-8 |page=16 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dIeR88JDzSgC }}</ref> at the federal level, the parties form a common [[CDU/CSU]] faction.  No [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] has ever come from the CSU, although Strauß and [[Edmund Stoiber]] were CDU/CSU candidates for Chancellor in the [[West German federal election, 1980|1980 election]] and the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]], respectively, which were both won by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].  Below the federal level, the parties are entirely independent.<ref>{{cite book |title=Germany: A Country Study |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |year=1999 |publisher=DANE Publishing |location=Quezon |isbn=978-0-521-27793-8 |page=375 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dIeR88JDzSgC }}</ref>

Since its formation, the CSU has been more [[conservatism|conservative]] than the CDU.<ref name="Robertson 296" /> The CSU and the state of Bavaria decided not to sign the [[GrundungsVertrag]] of the Federal Republic of Germany, as they could not agree with the division of Germany into two states, after World War 2. Although Bavaria has a separate police and justice system (distinctive and non-federal), the CSU has actively participated in all political affairs of the German Parliament, the German Government, the German Bundesrat, the parliamentary elections of the German President, the European Parliament, and meetings with Gorbachev in Russia.
