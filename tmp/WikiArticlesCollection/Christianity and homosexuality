{{LGBT topics and Christianity}}
Within [[Christianity]] there are a variety of views on the issues of [[sexual orientation]] and [[homosexuality]]. The many [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as sinful, through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality.

The Bible [[The Bible and homosexuality|refers several times]] to homosexual acts. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however, the extent to which the Bible mentions the subject and whether or not it is condemned, has become the subject of debate.  This debate concerns proper interpretation of the Levitical code, the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and various Pauline passages and whether these verses condemn same-sex sexual activities.

==Scriptural views==
{{See|The Bible and homosexuality|Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible|Homosexuality in the New Testament}}

The Bible refers to sexual practices that may be called "homosexual" in today's world, but the original language texts of the Bible do not refer explicitly to homosexuality as a [[sexual orientation]]. For example, passages in the [[Old Testament]] book [[Leviticus]] prohibit "lying with mankind as with womankind" and the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 19) has been interpreted by some as condemning homosexual ''practice''. 

[[File:John Martin - Sodom and Gomorrah.jpg|thumb|''The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah'', [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]], 1852.]]
The story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah  does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Most interpreters find this story and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests, rather than homosexuality,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=z8UMY_7jQ50C&pg=RA3-PT593&dq=Powell+%22possibly+coined%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k_akUcLdMozy7AaRgYGgAw&redir_esc=y Mark Allan Powell, ''HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'' (HarperCollins 2011 ISBN 978-0-06207859-9), entry "homosexuality"]</ref> but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape the angels who retrieved Lot.

The [[New Testament]] refers to "[[sexual immorality]]" on multiple occasions including Matthew 15:19, Mark 7:21, Acts 15:20 and 29, and many more. The definition of "sexual immorality" is disputed among scholars, but it is often included in lists along with [[adultery]] (e.g. Matthew 15:19) indicating it is much more than just adultery. Many scholars believe that everything in Leviticus referring to immoral "sexual relations" would be included in the New Testament's "sexual immorality". As such, homosexuality would be included in all of these passages which condemn sexual immorality. 

Other interpreters, however, maintain that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality, arguing any of several points: (i) that the passages yield different meanings if placed in historical context, for instance the historical interpretation of Sodom's sins as being other than homosexuality; (ii) there may be questions surrounding the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages that some interpret as referring to homosexuals; (iii) both the Old Testament and New Testament contain passages that describe same-sex relationships; and/or (iv) that loving and committed relationships are not condemned in the passages.<ref name="cand">[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/ Religion Dispatches magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge]</ref>  All of these assertions are disputed by other scholars, however.

The [[Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals]] (GAAAP), traces its roots back to 1980, making it the oldest LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostal denomination in existence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.affirmingapostolic.com |title=GAAAP |publisher=Affirmingapostolic.com |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Another such organization is the [[Affirming Pentecostal Church International]], currently the largest affirming Pentecostal organization, with churches in the US, UK, Central and South America, Europe and Africa.

Some denominations state opposing positions. Various parts of the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran Church]] hold stances on the issue ranging from declaring homosexual acts as sin to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations.<ref name="LCMS - Homosexuality">{{cite web|url = http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_homosexuality.pdf| title = What about Homosexuality?|publisher = [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}</ref><ref name="WELS - Homosexuality">{{cite web|url = http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/christian-living/acceptance-homosexuals| title = Are homosexuals accepted in WELS?|publisher = [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}</ref> However, the [[Church of Sweden]] conducts [[same-sex marriage]]s, while the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.<ref name="ELCA - Sodomy">{{cite web|url = http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4253| title = ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans|publisher = [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}</ref> The [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) is also much like Lutheranism in regards to homosexuality.

}}</ref> and [[Lutheran]]<ref name="LCMS - Homosexuality" /> churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The [[United Church of Canada]] also allows same-sex marriage, and views [[sexual orientation]] as a gift from God. Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, [[Gene Robinson]] is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, bishop [[Eva Brunne]] is an openly lesbian Bishop in the [[Church of Sweden]]. Such religious groups and denominations interpretation of scripture and doctrine leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the [[United Church of Canada]], that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that "a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full member of the Church''; and ''b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry."<ref>[http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 Chronology of Marriage and Equality Rights in the United Church]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation."<ref>"Same-Sex Marriage Legislation Offers a Win-Win Solution, Says The United Church of Canada," 2005-FEB-01, United Church of Canada, at: http://www.united-church.ca/</ref>

In addition, some Christian denominations such as the [[Moravian Church]], believe that the [[Holy Bible]] speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy for ordination and homosexuality.<ref name="The Moravian Interprovincial Faith & Order Commission">{{cite web|url = http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html| title = On Homosexuality and Ordination|publisher = The Moravian Interprovincial Faith & Order Commission|accessdate = 2009-11-22}}</ref>

Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.

As an alternative to a school-sponsored [[Day of Silence]] opposing bullying of LGBT students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying "As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect."<ref>{{cite news

In the 20th century, theologians like [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Hans Küng]], [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]], [[David Edward Jenkins|Bishop David Jenkins]], [[Don Cupitt]], [[John Shelby Spong|Bishop Jack Spong]] and [[Matthew Vines]] challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as "homosexuality."<ref>See generally http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm and subpages therein.</ref>  Clay Witt, a minister in the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], explains how theologians and commentators like [[John Shelby Spong]], George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding [[Paganism|pagan]] faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: "England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibition in  {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV|}} suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm |title=Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev.

Some Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBT orientation as currently understood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |title=The Bible and Homosexuality |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work=SisterFriends Together |publisher=Grace Unfolding Ministries }}</ref>  Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars.<ref name = SLAVERY/><ref name = WOMEN/><ref name = ROGERS/> There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles.<ref name = SLAVERY/><ref name = WOMEN/><ref name = ROGERS/> They consider some verses such as those they say support [[slavery]]<ref name = SLAVERY>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm |title=What the Bible says about slavery |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> or the inferior treatment of women<ref name = WOMEN>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ofe_bibl.htm ReligiousTolerance.org].</ref> as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible.

Yale scholar [[John Boswell]] has argued that a number of [[Early Christians]] entered into homosexual relationships,<ref name=BOS>{{Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | title= The Marriage of Likeness. Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe | publisher= Fontana | year= 1996}}</ref> and that certain Biblical figures had homosexual relationships, such as [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] and her mother-in-law [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and the court official Ashpenaz, and [[David and Jonathan|David]] and King [[Saul]]'s son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar.htm |title=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Boswell has also argued that [[adelphopoiesis]], a rite bonding two men, was akin to a religiously sanctioned same-sex union. Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite.<ref name=BOS/><ref>Robin Darling Young, "[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9411/articles/darling.html Gay Marriage: Reimagining Church History]", [[First Things]] 47 (November 1994), p. 43-48.</ref><ref name="Halsall">Paul Halsall, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/bosrevdisc-kennedy1.html Reviewing Boswell]'' (1995).</ref> His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a [[Platonic love|Platonic]] brotherly bond, not a homosexual union.<ref name="Halsall"/> He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century.<ref name="Boswell2">John Boswell, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/1979boswell.html The Church and the Homosexual- An Historical Perspective]'' (1979).</ref> Critics{{who|date=March 2011}} of Boswell have pointed out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality in ethical terms without prescribing a punishment, and that Boswell's citations reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties from the 12th century onwards.

[[Desmond Tutu]], the former [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has described homophobia as a "crime against humanity" and "every bit as unjust" as apartheid:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/13584 |title=Desmond Tutu: "Homophobia equals apartheid" |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> "We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. ... We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities. We make them doubt that they too are children of God – and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy. We blame them for what they are."<ref>Sex, Love & Homophobia, published by Amnesty International UK, 2005, foreword by Desmund Tutu.</ref>

Modern gay Christian leader [[Justin R. Cannon]] promotes what he calls "Inclusive Orthodoxy" (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: "Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/about.htm |title=INCLUSIVE ORTHODOXY: Gay Christian Ministry- Bible and Homosexuality? |publisher=Truthsetsfree.net |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> Cannon's ministry takes a unique approach quite distinct from modern liberal Christians, yet which still supports homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says "...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/index.html |title=Inclusive Orthodoxy ~ The Rev.

[[George Barna]], a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed.  "People who portray gay adults as [[Godlessness|godless]], [[hedonistic]], Christian bashers are not working with the facts," he said. "A substantial majority of gays cite their [[faith]] as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] active in their life today."<ref>Quoted in Chellew-Hodge, Candace. "[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God]." ''ReligionDispatches''. 25 June [[2009 in literature|2009]]. . Retrieved 2009-06-27.</ref>  The study of 20 faith-oriented attributes revealed significant differences between the United States heterosexual and homosexual populations sampled, homosexual respondents being less likely to be ''born again Christians'' than heterosexual respondents (27% compared to 47%), and the degree of commitment to their faith and families also differed. Other significant contrasts were seen in regards to "liberal" versus "conservative" social positions, as well as in one’s understanding of God, with 43% of homosexual participants sharing the "orthodox, biblical" understanding of God which 71% of heterosexual participants indicate they do. Respondents were not asked to describe themselves as  "[[born again Christian|born again]]", but as is standard in Barna studies, this classification was defined according to basic standard criteria.<ref name = BARNAGAY/> Barna concluded, “The data indicates that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians." And that "Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God."<ref name = BARNAGAY>{{cite web|url=http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |title=Spiritual Profile of Homosexual Adults Provides Surprising Insights |publisher=Barna.org |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

Candace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of online magazine ''Whoseoever'', responded to the findings:

<blockquote>All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian [[religion|religious belief]]. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old "gays vs. God" [[dichotomy]] that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians – they're just not as good as straight ones.<ref name="Chellew-Hodge 2009">{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god |title=New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God, Candace Chellew-Hodge, ReligionDispatches, 25 June 2009 (accessed 2009-06-27) |publisher=Religiondispatches.org |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref></blockquote>

She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his "arrière pensée."  The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad [[internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]].<ref name="Chellew-Hodge 2009"/>

Organizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational [[Gay Christian Network]] has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as "[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side A]]" and "[[Gay Christian Network#Sex and Christianity|Side B]]", respectively.<ref>[http://www.gaychristian.net/index.php?

Some organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as [[Courage International]] and [[North Star (organization)|North Star]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://northstarlds.org |title=North Star web site |publisher=Northstarlds.org |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>  Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate [[same-sex attraction]]s.  [[Exodus International]] and the associated [[Love Won Out]] are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as [[ex-gay]] organizations, though many no longer use the term.  [[Alan Chambers (Exodus International)|Alan Chambers]], the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/nation/na-exgay18 |title=Approaching agreement in debate over homosexuality |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> though the group [[Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays]] continues to use the term.

Gay Christian writer and actor [[Peterson Toscano]] argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a "ruse."<ref>{{cite news |title=Turning off gays |first=Mark |last=Benjamin |newspaper=Salon.com |date=18 July 2005 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/18/ungay/index.html}}</ref> An organization he co-founded, [[Beyond Ex-Gay]], supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondexgay.com/ |title=Beyond Ex-Gay Group for survivors of Ex-Gay ministries |publisher=Beyondexgay.com |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

[[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Other groups]] support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, [[IntegrityUSA]] represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.integrityusa.org/ |title=Integrity (US Episcopal) |publisher=Integrityusa.org |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> while [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] have the [[Reconciling Ministries Network]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians have ''Evangelicals Concerned''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecwr.org/index.php |title=Evangelicals Concerned: Gay Christians |publisher=Ecwr.org |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref>

In Europe, lesbian and gay evangelical Christians have a European forum.<ref>[http://www.euroforumlgbtchristians.eu/home/home.asp European Forum of LGBT Christian Groups]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>  Working within the worldwide Anglican Communion on a range of discrimination issues, including those of LGBT clergy and people in the church, is ''Inclusive Church''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusive-church.org.uk/ |title=Inclusive Church (Anglican) |publisher=Inclusive Church |accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref>  The longest standing group for lesbian and gay Christians in the UK, founded in 1976, is the non-denominational [[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgcm.org.uk/ |title=Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement (UK) |publisher=Lgcm.org.uk |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> specifically aimed to meet the needs of lesbian and gay evangelicals, there is the ''Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians'';<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eflgc.org.uk/ |title=Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians (UK) |publisher=Eflgc.org.uk |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> specifically working within the Church of England is ''Changing Attitude'',<ref>[http://www.changingattitude.org.uk/home/home.asp Changing Attitude (UK)]</ref> which also takes an international focus in working for gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender affirmation within the Anglican Communion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.changingattitude.org/home/home.asp |title=(International) |publisher=Changing Attitude |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}</ref> such as [[Davis Mac-Iyalla|gay Anglicans in Nigeria]].

Sociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBT members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric.  His research shows that those GLBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches "kill the messenger"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART |title=Pitt, Richard N.
