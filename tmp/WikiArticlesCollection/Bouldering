'''Bouldering''' is a form of [[rock climbing]] that is performed without the use of ropes or [[Climbing harness|harnesses]]. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use [[climbing shoe]]s to help secure footholds, [[Magnesium carbonate|chalk]] to keep their hands dry, and [[bouldering mat]]s to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike [[free solo climbing]], which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 20 feet tall. [[Indoor climbing|Artificial climbing walls]] allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. [[Competition climbing|Bouldering competitions]], which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.<ref>See [http://www.stonecountry.co.uk/page11.html ''The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering'' (Stone Country Press], by Francis Sanzaro, for a more on bouldering movement, and its relation to other sports.</ref>

The sport originated as a method of training for roped climbs and [[mountaineering]]. Bouldering enabled [[top rope climbing|top rope climbers]] to practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground. Additionally, the sport <ref>{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Pete|title=The Complete Guide to Climbing and Mountaineering|year=2008|publisher=David&Charles|location=Cincinnati, OH 45236|isbn=978-0-7153-2842-2|page=94}}</ref> served to build stamina and increase finger strength.  Throughout the 1900s, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline. Individual problems are assigned ratings based on their difficulty. There have been many different [[Grade (bouldering)|rating systems]] used throughout the history of the sport, but modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the [[Fontainebleau rock climbing|Fontainebleau]] scale.

The growing popularity of the sport has caused several environmental concerns, including soil [[erosion]] and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites. This has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether.

== Overview ==
Bouldering is a form of [[rock climbing]] which takes place on [[boulder]]s and other small rock formations, usually measuring less than {{convert|20|ft|m}} from ground to top. Unlike [[top rope climbing]] and [[lead climbing]], no ropes are used to protect or aid the climber. Bouldering routes or "problems" require the climber to reach the top of a boulder, usually from a specified start position. Some boulder problems, known as "traverses," require the climber to climb horizontally from one position to another.<ref name="Access2006"/>{{rp|p. 3}}

The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed. [[Granite]], for example, often features long [[Crack climbing|cracks]] and [[slab climbing|slab]]s. [[Sandstone]] rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Other common bouldering rocks include [[limestone]] and [[volcanic rock]].<ref name="Lourens2005"/>{{rp|p. 21&ndash;22}}

There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States, including [[Hueco Tanks]] in Texas, [[Yellowstone National Park]] in Wyoming, and [[Mount Evans]] in Colorado. [[Squamish, British Columbia]] is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada.<ref name="Robinson2013"/>{{rp|p. 80&ndash;81}} Europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites, such as [[Fontainebleau]] in France, [[Albarracín]] in Spain, and various mountains throughout [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climb-europe.com/areas.htm|title=Rock climbing in Europe |publisher=Climb Europe |year=2013 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>

=== Indoor bouldering ===
{{details|Indoor climbing}}
Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at [[climbing gym]]s. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, [[polymer]] cement panels, [[concrete]] shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls.<ref name="StiehlRamsey2005">{{cite book |title=Climbing Walls |author=Stiehl, Jim and Ramsey, Tim B. |year=2005 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=9780736048316 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KErVkX-YESoC}}</ref>{{rp|p. 49&ndash;51}} Holds, usually made of [[plastic]], are then bolted onto the wall to create problems.<ref name="Lourens2005"/>{{rp|p. 18}} The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.<ref name="Burbach2005"/>{{rp|p. 133}}

[[File:BW 2012-08-26 Dorothea Karalus GER 0541.JPG|right|thumb|150px|A competitor at the 2012 Boulder World Cup]]

Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall. Routesetters designate the intended route for a particular problem by placing colored tape next to each hold—for example, holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem, while green tape would be used to set off a different problem in the same area.<ref name="Burbach2005">{{cite book | title=Gym Climbing |author=Burbach, Matt |publisher=The Mountaineers Books |year=2005 |isbn=9781594854804 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=48IYcqzwfHoC}}</ref>{{rp|p. 48}}

=== Competitions ===
Bouldering competitions occur in both indoor and outdoor settings.<ref name="Lourens2005">{{cite book |title=Guide to Climbing |author=Lourens, Tony |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2005 |isbn=9780811701525 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mdQcBNKK1iIC}}</ref>{{rp|p. 18}} The [[International Federation of Sport Climbing]] (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets of four or five boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems.<ref name="IFSC Rules">{{cite web |title=IFSC Rules 2013 |url=http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/images/World_competitions/Event_regulations/IFSC_Rules_2013_V1-2.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=International Federation of Sport Climbing |date=March 2013 |accessdate=25 June 2013 }}</ref>

There are several other formats used for bouldering competitions. Some competitions give climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose.<ref name="Hague2011">{{cite book |title=Redpoint |author=Hague, Dan and Hunter, Douglas |year=2011 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811745079 }}</ref>{{rp|p. 175}} In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.<ref name="Schmid2011">{{cite book |title=Climbing - Philosophy for Everyone |author = Schmid, Stephen E. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2011 |isbn=9781444341461 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ilq1usRiD2EC}}</ref>{{rp|p. 201}}

In 2012, the IFSC submitted a proposal to the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) to include [[lead climbing]] in the [[2020 Summer Olympics]]. The proposal was later revised to an "overall" competition, which would feature bouldering, lead climbing, and [[speed climbing]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.climbing.com/news/new-olympic-plan-climbers-must-compete-in-bouldering-lead-and-speed/ |title=New Olympic Plan: Climbers Must Compete in Bouldering, Lead, and Speed |author=Dougald MacDonald |publisher=Climbing.com |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013 }}</ref> In May 2013, the IOC announced that climbing would not be added to the 2020 Olympic program.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.climbing.com/news/climbing-out-of-the-olympic-games-running/ |title=Climbing Out of the Running for Olympic Games |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
Rock climbing first emerged as a sport in the mid-1800s. Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering, not as a separate discipline, but as a form of training for larger ascents. In the early 20th century, the [[Fontainebleau]] area of [[France]] established itself as a prominent climbing area, where some of the first dedicated ''bleausards'' (or "boulderers") emerged. The specialized rock climbing shoe was invented by one such athlete, [[Pierre Allain]].<ref name="Beal2011"/>{{rp|Ch. 1}}

In the 1960s, the sport was pushed forward by American mathematician [[John Gill (climber)|John Gill]], who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was [[gymnastics]], a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds.<ref name="Beal2011"/>{{rp|Ch. 1}} Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.<ref name="Sherman2001"/>{{rp|p. 64&ndash;65}}

Gill introduced [[magnesium carbonate|chalk]] as a method of keeping the climber's hands dry. He also emphasized the importance of [[strength training]] to complement technical skill.<ref>For more on Gill's bouldering philosophy, see [http://www.stonecountry.co.uk/page11.html ''The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering'' (Stone Country Press], by Francis Sanzaro (Stone Country press, 2013).</ref> Neither of these practices had been popular among climbers, but as Gill's ability level and influence grew, his ideas became the norm.<ref name="Beal2011"/>{{rp|Ch. 1}}

Two important training tools emerged in the 1980s: [[Bouldering mat]]s and artificial climbing walls. The former, also referred to as "crash pads", prevented injuries from falling, and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous to attempt otherwise. Indoor climbing walls helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing, and allowed serious climbers to train year-round regardless of weather conditions.<ref name="Beal2011"/>{{rp|Ch. 1}}

As the sport grew in popularity, new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States, and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions. The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s, as [[YouTube]] videos and climbing [[blog]]s helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques, find hard problems, and announce newly completed projects.<ref name="Beal2011"/>{{rp|Ch. 1}}

In early 2010, two American climbers claimed first ascents on boulder problems that have come to be regarded as the most difficult in the world: ''The Game'' near [[Boulder, Colorado]], established by [[Daniel Woods]];<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.planetmountain.com/english/News/shownews1.lasso?l=2&keyid=37243 |title=Daniel Woods plays The Game Fb8C+ |publisher=PlanetMountain |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> and ''Lucid Dreaming'' near [[Bishop, California]], established by [[Paul Robinson (climber)|Paul Robinson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.planetmountain.com/english/News/shownews1.lasso?l=2&keyid=37330 |title=Lucid Dreaming, new extreme boulder problem at the Buttermilks, Bishop |publisher=PlanetMountain |date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> The following year, fellow American [[Carlo Traversi]] claimed the second ascent of ''The Game'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dpmclimbing.com/articles/view/carlo-traversi-sends-game-v1516 |title=Carlo Traversi Sends The Game (V15/16) |publisher=DPM Climbing |date=12 March 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> while as of March 2013, ''Lucid Dreaming'' remains unrepeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rvproj.com/2013/03/08/daniel-woods-on-lucid-dreaming/ |title=Daniel Woods on Lucid Dreaming |publisher=The RV Project |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref> In 2011, Czech climber [[Adam Ondra]] claimed the second ascent of ''Gioia'', originally established three years earlier by Italian boulderer [[Christian Core]], and suggested that it was among the world's most challenging boulder problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adamondra.com/adam-ondra-repeats-gioia-varezze |title=Adam Ondra repeats Gioia 8c+ at Varezze |publisher=AdamOndra.com |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>

== Equipment ==
{{Main|Rock-climbing equipment}}

Unlike other climbing sports, bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers.<ref name="Beal2011">{{cite book |title= Bouldering: Movement, Tactics, and Problem Solving |author = Beal, Peter | year=2011 | publisher = The Mountaineers Books | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Ei5GEfWDrKYC | isbn=9781594855016 }}</ref>{{rp|Ch. 2}} Bouldering pioneer [[John Sherman (climber)|John Sherman]] asserted that "The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders".<ref name="Sherman2011">{{cite book |title= Better Bouldering | author = Sherman, John | edition = 2nd | year = 2011 | publisher = Globe Pequot | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=AqYzRslaVYAC | isbn=9780762775583 }}</ref>{{rp|p. 1}} Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum, while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes, chalk, brushes, crash pads, and a skincare kit.<ref name="Beal2011" />{{rp|Ch. 2}}

[[File:Quechua climbing shoes.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A modern climbing shoe manufactured by [[Quechua (brand)|Quechua]] ]]

Of the aforementioned equipment, climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance. Besides protecting the climber's feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure and maintain footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear, and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations: High-top shoes, for example, provide better protection for the ankle, while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The front of the shoe, called the "toe box", can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and [[slab climbing|slabs]].<ref name="Beal2011"/>{{rp|Ch. 2,}} <ref name="Sherman2011"/>{{rp|p. 1,}} <ref name="Kidd2009">{{cite book |title= Rock Climbing |author=Kidd, Timothy W. and Hazelrigs, Jennifer |year=2009 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=9781450409001 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OUYSi6Zem6gC }}</ref>{{rp|p. 116}}

Most boulderers use [[magnesium carbonate|gymnastics chalk]] on their hands to absorb [[sweat]]. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb.<ref name="Kidd2009"/>{{rp|p. 119}} [[Brush]]es are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached to the end of a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds.<ref name="Sherman2011"/>{{rp|p. 6}} Crash pads, also referred to as [[bouldering mat]]s, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.<ref name="Sherman2011"/>{{rp|p. 6&ndash;7}}

== Safety ==
Boulder problems are generally shorter than {{convert|20|ft|m}} from ground to top.<ref name="Access2006">{{cite web |url=http://www.accessfund.org/atf/cf/%7B1F5726D5-6646-4050-AA6E-C275DF6CA8E3%7D/BoulderingPaper.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bouldering: Understanding and Managing Climbing on Small Rock Formations |year=2006 |accessdate=4 August 2013 |publisher=The Access Fund}}</ref>{{rp|p. 3}} This makes the sport significantly safer than [[free solo climbing]], which is also performed without ropes, but with no upper limit on the height of the climb.<ref name="Hattingh2000">{{cite book |title=Rock and Wall Climbing | author = Hattingh, Garth | publisher = Stackpole Books | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780811729161 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-RZvVKB4600C }}</ref>{{rp|p. 10&ndash;11}} However, minor injuries are common in bouldering, particularly [[sprained ankle]]s and [[sprained wrist|wrists]]. Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering: first, boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines, making falls more common. Second, without ropes to arrest the climber's descent, every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground.<ref name="Sherman2001"/>

To prevent injuries, boulderers position [[bouldering mat|crash pads]] near the boulder to provide a softer landing, as well as one or more [[Spotting (climbing)|spotters]] to help redirect the climber towards the pads.<ref name="Access2006"/>{{rp|p. 3}} Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in [[gymnastics]]: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid [[bone fracture]]s, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bouldering Safety |url=http://www.mec.ca/AST/ContentPrimary/Learn/Climbing/IntroToClimbing/SaferBouldering.jsp |publisher= Mountain Equipment Co-op |author=Thomson, Jeff and Bourdon, Marc |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref>

== Technique ==
As with other forms of climbing, bouldering technique is largely centered around proper footwork. [[Leg muscles]] are significantly stronger than [[arm|arm muscles]]; as such, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder.<ref name="Sherman2011"/>{{rp|p. 52}} Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.<ref name="Long1997">{{cite book | title=Sport Climbing | author=Long, John | year=1997 | edition = 3rd | publisher = Globe Pequot | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=YZSAnneM-OkC | isbn = 9781575400785}}</ref>{{rp|p. 60&ndash;61}}

Bouldering movements are described as either "static" or "dynamic". Static movements are those that are performed slowly, with the climber's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs. Dynamic movements use the climber's [[momentum]] to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically, with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately.<ref name="Humi2002">{{cite book |title=Coaching Climbing |author=Humi, Michelle |year=2002 |publisher=Globe Pequot |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=giNqB3LifocC |isbn=9780762725342}}</ref>{{rp|p. 70}}

== Grading ==
[[File:Indoor Bouldering V3 Rock Spot.webm|right|thumb|150px|A climber sending an indoor V3 problem]]

{{Main|Grade (bouldering)}}

Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by routesetters and climbers. The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system.<ref name="Hill2008">{{cite book |title=The Complete Guide to Climbing and Mountaineering |author=Hill, Pete |publisher=David & Charles |year=2008 |isbn=9780715328422 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OsL2ifP6JucC }}</ref> {{rp|p. 234}}

The V-scale, which originated in the [[United States]], is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts.<ref name="Sherman2001">{{cite book | title=Sherman Exposed | author=Sherman, John | publisher=The Mountaineers Books |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Tp7eUBRn4M4C |isbn=9781594853968}}</ref>{{rp|p. 66}} The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V16.<ref name="Robinson2013">{{cite book |title=Rock Climbing |year=2013 |author= Robinson, Victoria |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313378621 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3OkUEt8CuXQC }}</ref>{{rp|p. 8,}} <ref name="Horst2012">{{cite book|title=Learning to Climb Indoors |author=Horst, Eric J. |edition =2nd | year=2012 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wrekMmogxqoC |isbn=9780762780051 |publisher=Globe Pequot}}</ref>{{rp|p. 12}} Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spadout.com/wiki/index.php/Climbing_Grades |title=Climbing Grades |publisher=Spadout |accessdate=4 August 2013 |year=2012}}</ref>

The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system, with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. For example, Fontainebleau 7a roughly corresponds with V7, while Fontainebleau 7c is equivalent to V10.<ref name="Horan2008">{{cite book |title=Falcon Guides Bouldering Colorado |author=Horan, Bob |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2008 |isbn=9780762736386 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UqWepPShgIoC}}</ref>{{rp|p. 3}} In both systems, grades are further differentiated by appending "+" to indicate a small increase in difficulty. Despite this level of specificity, ratings of individual problems are often controversial, as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber. Height, arm length, [[flexibility]], and other body characteristics can also be relevant.<ref name="Horst2012"/>{{rp|p. 11&ndash;12}}

== Environmental impact ==

Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks, such as [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s. This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. [[Soil erosion]] can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer.<ref name="Access2006"/>{{rp|p. 4&ndash;6}} Other environmental concerns include [[littering]], improperly disposed [[feces]], and [[graffiti]]. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in [[Rocklands, South Africa]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.planetmountain.com/english/News/shownews1.lasso?l=2&keyid=41107 |title=Rocklands bouldering at risk |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate= 4 August 2013 |publisher=PlanetMountain}}</ref>
