The '''Commodores''' is an American [[funk]]/[[soul music|soul]] band of the 1970s and 1980s. The members of the group met as mostly [[freshmen]] at Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]) in 1968, and signed with [[Motown]] in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for [[The Jackson 5]] while on [[concert tour|tour]].

The group is best known for their [[ballad]]s, such as "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]" and "[[Three Times a Lady]]", but, for the most part, the group recorded [[funk]]y, driven dance-floor [[hit record|hit]]s which include "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]", "The Bump", "Fancy Dancer", and "Too Hot ta Trot".

==Band history==
The Commodores originally came together from two former groups the Mystics and the Jays, but wanted to change the name. To choose a new name William "WAK" King opened a dictionary and randomly picked a word. "We lucked out," he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine. "We almost became The Commodes!".

"[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]", the instrumental title track from the band's debut album, became a staple at American sporting events,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and is similarly featured in many films, including ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]''. It reached No. 22 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1975. Another instrumental, "[[Cebu]]" (named after an [[Cebu Province|island]] in the [[Philippines]]), later became a staple{{by whom|date=November 2012}} in the [[Quiet storm]] format. Three albums released in years 1975 and 1976 (''[[Caught in the Act (Commodores album)|Caught in the Act]]'', ''[[Movin' On (Commodores album)|Movin' On]]'', ''[[Hot On The Tracks]]'') are considered the peak of their harder funk period. After those recordings the group started to move towards a softer sound. That move was hinted at in their 1976 Top Ten hits "Sweet Love" and "[[Just to Be Close to You]]." In 1977 the Commodores released "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", which became the group's biggest hit yet, reaching No. 4 in the U.S., followed by "Brick House", also Top 5, both from their landmark album "The Commodores", as was "Zoom". The group reached No. 1 in 1978 with the sweet "[[Three Times a Lady]]." The year 1979 saw the Commodores score another Top Five ballad hit, "Sail On", before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad, "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]". In 1981 they released two Top Ten hits with "Oh No" (#4 U.S.) and their first upbeat single in almost five years, "[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]" (#8 U.S.)

The band originated while its members attended [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama.  After winning the University's annual Freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties, as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to the College students. They performed mostly cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram (not the [[James Ingram|famous solo artist]], but another "James Ingram"). Ingram, older than the rest of the members of the band, left to serve active duty in [[Vietnam]], and was later replaced by Walter "Clyde" Orange, the second lead singer who wrote or co-wrote many of their hit tunes. Richie and fellow Commodore Walter "Clyde" Orange alternated as lead singers. Orange was also the lead singer on the Top 10 hits, "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]" and "Brick House" among others.

The Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film ''[[Thank God It's Friday]]''. They performed the song "Too Hot ta Trot" during the dance contest; their songs "Brick House" and "Easy" were also played during the movie.

In 1982, Lionel Richie left to pursue a solo career, in 1983, [[Skyler Jett]], replaced Lionel Richie as the co-lead singer for The Commodores, and toured the world, performing in over 32 countries in a two year span.
[[File:CommodoresPerforming.jpg|thumb|right|Band performance in Florida on October 1, 2006]]
Over time, several founding members left. [[Thomas McClary (musician)|Thomas McClary]] left in 1982 (shortly after Richie left) to pursue a solo career and to develop a [[gospel music]] company. McClary was replaced by guitarist/vocalist [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]]. LaPread left in 1986 and moved to Auckland, New Zealand, and Reynolds departed for [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] in 1987, which prompted trumpeter William "WAK" King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances. Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989. The group also gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial pop arena. In 1984 former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] singer J.D. Nicholas assumed co-lead vocal duties with drummer Walter Orange. The band remained hitless for several years till 1985 with their final [[Motown]] release of the album "Nightshift" produced by Dennis Lambert (all prior albums were produced by [[James Anthony Carmichael]]) delivered the Grammy Award-winning title track "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]" (#3 in the U.S., a tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Jackie Wilson]]; in 2010 a new version was recorded dedicated to [[Michael Jackson]]),<ref>[http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&catid=85:latest-news&Itemid=82 Commodores Re-record "Nightshift" As MJ Tribute]</ref> The Commodores were on their European Tour, performing at Wembley Arena, London on June 25, 2009, when they were advised that Michael Jackson had died. Initially the band thought it was a hoax, however back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation, and broke down in tears. The next night in Birmingham the NIA Arena, J.D. Nicholas added Jackson's name into the lyrics of the song, and from then onwards the Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other R&B singers. From this came the inspiration upon the one year anniversary of Jackson's death, to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song "Nightshift" as a tribute. Initially, "Nightshift" won The Commodores their first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in 1985.

In 1990 the Commodores formed Commodores Records and re-recorded the Commodores 20 greatest hits "Commodores Hits Vol. I & II", have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a live album "Commodores Live" along with a DVD by the same name, and a Christmas album titled "Commodores Christmas. In 2012, the band has been working on new material, some contributions written by current and former members.

Today, the Commodores consist of Walter "Clyde" Orange, J.D. Nicholas and King "WAK", along with their five piece band, known as the "Mean Machine". The group continues to perform, playing at arenas, theaters and festivals around the world.
