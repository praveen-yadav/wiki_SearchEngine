'''Anton Drexler''' (13 June 1884 – 24 February 1942) was a [[German far-right]] political leader of the 1920s, he became instrumental in the formation of the pan-German and anti-Semitic [[German Workers' Party]] (''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' - DAP), the antecedent of the [[Nazi Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' - NSDAP). Drexler served as mentor to [[Adolf Hitler]] during his early days in politics.

==Biography==

Born in [[Munich]], Drexler was a machine-fitter before becoming a railway [[locksmith]] in [[Berlin]] in 1902. He joined the [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]] during [[World War I]]. He was a poet and a member of the [[Völkisch movement|völkisch]] agitators who, together with journalist [[Karl Harrer]], founded the German Workers' Party (DAP), in Munich with [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Dietrich Eckart]] on 5 January 1919.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}

At a meeting of the Party in Munich in September 1919, the main speaker was Gottfried Feder. When he had finished speaking, Hitler got involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann who questioned the soundness of Feder's arguments against capitalism and proposed that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and found a new South German nation with [[Austria]]. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and, according to Hitler, the "professor" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Drexler approached Hitler and thrust a booklet into his hand. It was ''My Political Awakening'' and, according to Hitler, it reflected the ideals he already believed in.<ref>Hitler, Adolf. ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', 1925.</ref> Impressed with Hitler, Drexler invited him to join the DAP. Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919,{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=9}} becoming the party's 55th member.{{sfn|Mitcham|1996|p=67}} In less than a week, Hitler received a postcard from Drexler stating he had officially been accepted as a DAP member and he should come to a "committee" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the "committee" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}}

By 1921, Hitler was rapidly becoming the undisputed leader of the Party. In June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich. Members of its executive committee, some of whom considered Hitler to be too overbearing, wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised his resignation would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed; he rejoined the party as member 3,680. Drexler was thereafter moved to the purely symbolic position of honorary president, and left the Party in 1923.<ref>Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 41</ref>

Drexler was also a member of a ''völkisch'' political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the [[Thule Society]]. His membership in the NSDAP ended when it was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], in which Drexler had not taken part. In 1924 he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for another party, in which he served as vice-president until 1928. He had no part in the NSDAP's refounding in 1925, and rejoined only after Hitler had come to power in 1933. He received the party's [[Blood Order]] in 1934 and was still occasionally used as a [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] tool until about 1937, but he was never again allowed any real power.

==In popular culture==
In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[Southern Victory Series]] of [[alternate history]] novels, the character Anthony Dresser appears to be based on Drexler.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In the 2003 film ''[[Hitler: The Rise of Evil]]'', British actor [[Robert Glenister]] plays Drexler, although Drexler is portrayed without his trademark spectacles and moustache.
