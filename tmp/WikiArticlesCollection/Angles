The '''Angles''' (Latin '''''Anglii''''') were one of the main [[Germanic peoples]] who settled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Fall of the Roman Empire|post-Roman]] period. They founded several of the [[monarchy|kingdoms]] of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], and their name is the root of the name ''England''. The name comes from the district of [[Angeln]], an area located on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] shore of what is now [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in Germany.

==Name==
{{further|Angeln#Name}}
The name of the Angles is first recorded in Latinized form, as ''Anglii'', in the ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]]. It is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited: ''Angeln'' in modern German, ''Angel'' in [[Danish language|Danish]]. This name has been hypothesized to originate from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root for "narrow" (compare German ''eng'' = "narrow"), meaning "the Narrow [Water]", i.e. the [[Schlei]] [[estuary]]; the root would be angh, "tight". Another theory is that the name meant "hook", as in [[angling]] for fish; [[Julius Pokorny]], a major Indo-European linguist, derives it from *ang-, "bend" (see ankle).

[[Gregory the Great]] in an epistle simplified the Latinized name ''Anglii'' to ''Angli'', the latter form developing into the preferred form of the word. The country remained ''Anglia'' in Latin. [[King Alfred]]'s ([[Alfred the Great]]) translation of [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]' history of the world uses ''Angelcynn'' (-kin) to describe England and the English people; [[Bede]] used ''Angelfolc'' (-folk); there are also such forms as ''Engel'', ''Englan'' (the people), ''Englaland'', and ''Englisc'', all showing [[i-mutation]].

==Greco-Roman historiography==

===Tacitus===
[[File:Angeln.svg|thumb|right|200px|The map shows both the Angeln and the Schwansen peninsulas]]

The earliest recorded mention of the Angles may be in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', chapter [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]]. Tacitus describes the "Anglii" as one of the more remote [[Suebi]]c tribes compared to the [[Semnones]] and [[Langobardi]], who lived on the [[Elbe]] and were better known to the Romans. He grouped the Angles with several other tribes in that region, the [[Reudigni]], [[Aviones]], [[Varini]], [[Eudoses]], [[Suarini]] and [[Nuitones]].<ref>Tacitus, ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]], Medieval Source Book. Code and format by Northvegr.[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/tacitus/009.php]</ref> These were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods;<ref>Tacitus (1877), ''Germania'', [[wikisource:Germania#XL|40]]; translation from ''The Agricola and Germania'', A. J. Church and W. J. Brodribb, trans., London: Macmillan, pp. 87–110(?), as recorded in the ''Medieval Sourcebook'' [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/tacitus1.html]</ref> and therefore inaccessible to attack.

He gives no precise indication of their geographical situation but states that, together with six other tribes, they worshiped [[Nerthus]], or Mother Earth, whose sanctuary was located on "an island in the Ocean". As the Eudoses are the [[Jutes]], these names probably refer to localities in [[Jutland]] or on the Baltic coast, in which case their inhabitants would be Cimbri or Teutones for [[Pliny]]. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who considered it unknown, inaccessible, with a small population and of little economic interest.

The majority of scholars believe that the Anglii lived on the coasts of the [[Baltic Sea]], probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula. This view is based partly on Old English and Danish traditions regarding persons and events of the 4th century, and partly on the fact that striking affinities to the cult of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to be found in pre-Christian [[Scandinavia]]n, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.

===Ptolemy===
[[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' (2.10), half a century later, describes the ''Sueboi Angeilloi'', Latinized to ''Suevi Angili'', further south, living in a stretch of land between the northern Rhine and central Elbe, but apparently not touching either river, with the Suebic [[Langobardi]] on the Rhine to their west, and the Suebic [[Semnones]] on the Elbe stretching to their east.

These Suevi Angili would have been in [[Lower Saxony]] or near it, but they are not coastal. The three Suebic peoples are separated from the coastal [[Chauci]], (between [[Ems (river)|Ems]] and [[Elbe]]), and [[Saxones]], (east of the Elbe mouth), by a series of tribes including, between [[Weser]] and Elbe, the [[Angrivarii]], "Laccobardi" (more Langobardi?), and [[Dulgubnii]]. South of the Saxons, and east of the Elbe, Ptolemy lists "Ouirounoi" (Latinized as Viruni) and Teutonoari, which either denotes "men" (wer); i.e., "the Teuton men", or else it denotes people living in the area where the Teutons had previously lived (who Ptolemy places still living to the east of the Teutonoari). Ptolemy describes the coast to the east of the Saxons as inhabited by the [[Farodini]], a name not known from any other sources.

Owing to the uncertainty of this passage, there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the Anglii. One theory is that they or part of them dwelt or moved among other coastal people perhaps confederated up to the basin of the [[Saale]] (in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of [[Unstruttal (Verwaltungsgemeinschaft)|Engilin]]) on the [[Unstrut]] valleys below the [[Kyffhäuserkreis]], from which region the ''Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum'' is believed by many to have come. The ethnic names of [[Frisii|Frisians]] and [[Warini|Warines]] are attested in the neighbourhood names of this [[Saxon]] or [[Swabia]]n lands.

A second possible solution is that these Angles of Ptolemy are not those of Schleswig at all. According to [[Julius Pokorny]] the Angri- in [[Angrivarii]], the -angr in [[Hardanger]] and the Angl- in Anglii all come from the same root meaning "bend", but in different senses. In other words, the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond Germanic.

On the other hand, Gudmund Schütte, in his analysis of Ptolemy, believes that the Angles have simply been moved by an error coming from Ptolemy's use of imperfect sources. He points out that Angles are placed correctly just to the northeast of the [[Langobardi]], but that these have been duplicated, so that they appear once, correctly, on the lower Elbe, and a second time, incorrectly, at the northern Rhine.<ref>Schütte, ''Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe'', pages [http://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/34/mode/2up/search/angles 34], and [http://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/118/mode/2up/search/angles 118]</ref>

==Medieval historiography==
{{further|kings of the Angles}}
[[Image:Beda Petersburgiensis f3v.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript of Bede]]
[[Bede]] states that the Anglii, before coming to Great Britain, dwelt in a land called Angulus, "which lies between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons, and remains unpopulated to this day."
Similar evidence is given by the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]''. King [[Alfred the Great]] and the chronicler [[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]] identified this place with the district that is now called [[Angeln]], in the province of [[Schleswig]] (Slesvig) (though it may then have been of greater extent), and this identification agrees with the indications given by Bede.

In the Norwegian seafarer [[Ohthere of Hålogaland]]'s account of a two-day voyage from the Oslo fjord to Schleswig, he reported the lands on his starboard bow, and Alfred appended the note "on these islands dwelt the ''Engle'' before they came hither".<ref>''King Alfred's Orosius'', ed. H. Sweet (Early English Text Society) 1883:19, noted in H.R. Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:24.</ref>
Confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named [[Wermund]] and [[Offa of Angel]], from whom the [[Mercia]]n royal family claimed descent and whose exploits are connected with Angeln, Schleswig, and [[Rendsburg]]. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, [[Frowinus]] ([[Freawine]]) and [[Ket and Wig|Wigo]] (Wig), from whom the royal family of [[Wessex]] claimed descent. During the 5th century, the Anglii invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recur on the continent except in the title of ''Suevi Angili''.

The Angles are the subject of a legend about [[Pope Gregory I]], who happened to see a group of Angle children from [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] for sale as slaves in the Roman market. As the story would later be told by the Anglo-Saxon monk and historian [[Bede]], Gregory was struck by the unusual appearance of the slaves and asked about their background. When told they were called "''Anglii''" (Angles), he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English: “''Bene, nam et angelicam habent faciem, et tales angelorum in caelis decet esse coheredes''” ("It is well, for they have an angelic face, and such people ought to be co-heirs of the [[angel]]s in heaven"). Supposedly, this encounter inspired the Pope to launch a mission to bring Christianity to their countrymen.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede2.shtml ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', book 2] by Bede</ref>

==Archaeology==
The province of Schleswig has proved rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries. A broad cremation cemetery has been found at [[Borgstedterfeld]], between Rendsburg and [[Eckernförde]], and it has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in pagan graves in England.
Of still greater importance are the great deposits at [[Thorsberg moor]] (in Angeln) and [[Nydam Mose|Nydam]], which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, etc., and in Nydam even ships. By the help of these discoveries, Angle culture in the age preceding the invasion of Britannia can be fitted together.

==Anglian kingdoms in England==
{{see also|Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxons|History of Anglo-Saxon England}}
[[Image:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|thumb|right|Angles, Saxons and Jutes throughout England]]
According to sources such as the History of Bede, after the invasion of Britannia, the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of the ''Nord Angelnen'' ([[Northumbria]]), ''Ost Angelnen'' ([[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Anglia]]), and the ''Mittlere Angelnen'' ([[Mercia]]). H.R. Loyn has observed in this context that "a sea voyage is perilous to tribal institutions,"<ref>Loyn, ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest'', 2nd ed. 1991:25.</ref> and the apparently tribally-based kingdoms were produced in England. In early times there were two northern kingdoms (Bernicia and Deira) and two midland ones (Middle Anglia and Mercia). As a result of influence from the West Saxons, the tribes were collectively called [[Anglo-Saxons]] by the [[Normans]], the West Saxon kingdom having conquered, united and founded the [[Kingdom of England]] by the 10th century. The regions of East Anglia and Northumbria are still known by their original titles. Northumbria once stretched as far north as what is now southeast [[Scotland]], including [[Edinburgh]], and as far south as the [[Humber Estuary]].

The rest of that people stayed at the centre of the Angle homeland in the northeastern portion of the modern German ''Bundesland'' of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], on the [[Jutland Peninsula]]. There, a small peninsular area is still called "[[Angeln]]" today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern [[Flensburg]] on the Flensburger Fjord to the [[City of Schleswig]] and then to Maasholm, on the [[Schlei]] inlet.
