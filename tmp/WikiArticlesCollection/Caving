'''Caving'''—also occasionally known as '''spelunking''' in the United States and Canada and '''potholing''' in the United Kingdom and Ireland—is the recreational [[pastime]] of exploring wild (generally non-[[Show cave|commercial]]) [[cave]] systems. In contrast, [[speleology]] is the scientific study of caves and the cave environment.<ref name="CAVE1">[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/3/en Caving in New Zealand] (from [[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]], Accessed 2012-11.)</ref>

The challenges involved in the activity depend on the cave being visited, but often include the negotiation of [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitches]], squeezes,<ref name=CHALL/> and [[water]]<ref name=CAVENZ>{{cite news|title=Caving in New Zealand|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/new-zealand/4118082/Caving-in-New-Zealand|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Stuff.co.nz - Fairfax NZ News|author=Pearson, Anna}}</ref> (although actual [[cave diving]] is a separate, and much more dangerous, sub-specialty undertaken by very few cavers<ref>{{cite news|title=Cave Diving - The Extreme of the Extreme|url=http://wow.gm/africa/article/2007/9/4/cave-diving-the-extreme-of-the-extreme|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Wow.gm|author=Jenkins, Andy}}</ref>).

In recent decades, caving has changed considerably due to the availability of modern protective wear and equipment. It has recently come to be known as an "[[extreme sport]]" by some (though not commonly considered as such by its practitioners, who may dislike the term for its perceived connotation of disregard for safety).<ref name=CHALL>{{cite news|title=Many find caving's challenges, thrills illuminating|url=http://newsok.com/many-find-cavings-challenges-thrills-illuminating/article/3253500/|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=NewsOK|date=8 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Extreme Caving - Gorgeous settings present dangers and challenges in Omnimax film|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_YZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bHADAAAAIBAJ&pg=3867,4897282&dq=caving+extreme-sport&hl=en|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=6 April 2001|author=Chiacchia, Ken}}</ref>

Many of the skills involved in caving can also be put to use in [[mine exploration]] and [[urban exploration]].

== Motivation ==
Caving is often undertaken for the enjoyment of the [[outdoor activity]] or for physical exercise, as well as original exploration, similar to [[mountaineering]] or [[diving]]. Physical or biological science is also an important goal for some cavers, while others are engaged in cave photography.<ref name=CHALL/> Virgin cave systems comprise some of the last unexplored regions on [[Earth]] and much effort is put into trying to locate, enter and survey them. In well-explored regions (such as most developed nations), the most accessible caves have already been explored, and gaining access to new caves often requires [[cave digging]] or cave diving.

Caving has also been described as an "individualist's team sport" by some,<ref name=CAVENZ/> as cavers can often make a trip without direct physical assistance from others but will generally go in a group for companionship or to provide emergency help if needed. Some however consider the assistance cavers give each other as a typical team sport activity.<ref name=REALU>{{cite news|title=Plunge into Roanoke's real underground|url=http://www.roanoke.com/neighbors/columnists/foley/wb/153436|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Roanoke Times|date=7 March 2008}}</ref>

Too much emphasis on the labeling of caving as a sport can narrow the goals of caving as a whole. Caving often puts the needs and welfare of a cave before those of the active participants. It is fair to say that while caving shares some attributes of sport activities, for many it transcends sports as many cavers pursue cave science, mapping, photography, and the management and conservation of cave resources.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Etymology ==
[[File:Caveman-ic.jpg|thumb|right|Caving in the north of [[England]], an area that is also popular for [[pit cave|pothole exploring]]]]
[[Clay Perry]], an American caver of the 1940s, wrote about a group of men and boys who explored and studied caves throughout [[New England]]. This group referred to themselves as ''spelunkers'', a term derived from the Latin ''spēlunca''<ref>http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spelunca</ref> and Greek ''σπῆλυγξ (spēlunks)''<ref>http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%CF%80%E1%BF%86%CE%BB%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BE#Ancient_Greek</ref> meaning "a cave". This is regarded as the first use of the word in the [[Americas]]. Throughout the 1950s, ''spelunking'' was the general term used for exploring caves in [[American English|US English]]. It was used freely, without any positive or negative connotations, although only rarely outside the US.

In the 1960s, the terms ''spelunking'' and ''spelunker'' began to be considered [[wiktionary:déclassé|déclassé]] among experienced enthusiasts. They began to convey the idea of inexperienced cavers, using unreliable light sources and cotton clothing. In 1985, Steve Knutson (editor of the [[National Speleological Society]] (NSS) publication ''American Caving Accidents'') made the following distinction:

{{quote|…Note that I use the term 'spelunker' to denote someone untrained and unknowledgeable in current exploration techniques, and 'caver' for those who are.}}

This sentiment is exemplified by [[bumper sticker]]s and t-shirts displayed by many cavers: "Cavers rescue spelunkers".

''Potholing'' refers to the act of exploring ''potholes'', a word originating in the north of [[England]] for predominantly [[vertical caving|vertical caves]]. The term is often used as a synonym for caving.

== History ==
Caving was pioneered by [[Édouard-Alfred Martel]] (1859–1938) who first achieved the descent and exploration of the [[Gouffre de Padirac]], France as early as 1889 and the first complete descent of a 110 metre wet vertical shaft at [[Gaping Gill]], in [[Yorkshire]], England in 1895. He developed his own techniques based on ropes and metallic ladders. Martel visited [[Kentucky]] and notably [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] in October 1912. In the 1920s famous US caver [[Floyd Collins]] made  important explorations in the area and in the 1930s, as caving became increasingly popular, small exploration teams both in the [[Alps]] and in the karstic high plateaus of southwest France ([[Causses]] and [[Pyrenees]]) transformed cave exploration in both a scientific and recreational activity. [[Robert de Joly]],  [[Guy de Lavaur]]  and [[Norbert Casteret]] were prominent figures of that time. They surveyed  mostly caves in Southwest France.  During [[World War II]], an alpine team  composed of [[Pierre Chevalier (caver)|Pierre Chevalier]], [[Fernand Petzl]], Charles Petit-Didier and others explored the [[Dent de Crolles]] cave system near [[Grenoble]], France which became the deepest explored system in the world (-658m) at that time. The lack of available equipment during the war forced Pierre Chevalier and the rest of the team to develop their own equipment, leading to technical innovation. The scaling-pole (1940), nylon ropes (1942), use of explosives in caves (1947) and mechanical rope-ascenders (Henri Brenot's "monkeys", first used by Chevalier and Brenot in a cave in 1934) can be directly associated to the exploration of the Dent de Crolles cave system.

In 1941, American cavers organized themselves into the National Speleological Society (NSS) to advance the exploration, conservation, study, and understanding of caves in the United States. American caver [[Bill Cuddington]], known as "Vertical Bill", developed the [[single rope technique]] (SRT) in the late 1950s. In 1958, two Swiss alpinists, Juesi and Marti teamed together, creating the first rope ascender known as the [[Jumar]]. In 1968 Bruno Dressler asked Fernand Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the [[Petzl Croll]], that he had developed by adapting the Jumar to pit caving. Pursuing these developments, Petzl started in the 1970s a caving equipment manufacturing company named [[Petzl]].  The development of the [[rappel rack]] and the evolution of mechanical ascension systems extended the practice and safety of pit exploration to a larger venue of cavers.

== Practice and equipment ==
{{Main|Caving equipment}}
[[Image:caving1.jpg|thumb|Caver in an [[Alabama]] cave showing common caving wear: coveralls, helmet-mounted lights, heavy boots and gloves.]]

[[Hard hat]]s are worn to protect the head from bumps and falling rocks. The caver's primary light source is usually mounted on the helmet in order to keep the hands free. Electric lights are most common, with [[halogen lamp]]s being standard and white [[LED]]s as the new competing technology. Many cavers carry two or more sources of light - one as primary and the others as backup in case the first fails.  More often than not, a second light will be mounted to the helmet for quick transition if the primary fails. [[Carbide lamp]]s systems are an older form of illumination, inspired by miner's equipment, and are still used by some cavers.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/4/en Caving equipment and culture] (from [[Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])</ref>

The type of [[clothes]] worn underground varies according to the environment of the cave being explored, and the local culture. In cold caves, the caver may wear a warm base layer that retains its insulating properties when wet, such as a [[Wool|fleece]] ("furry") suit and/or polypropylene underwear, and an oversuit of hard-wearing (e.g., [[cordura]]) and/or waterproof (e.g., [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]) material. Lighter clothing may be worn in warm caves, particularly if the cave is dry, and in tropical caves thin polypropylene clothing is used, to provide some abrasion protection whilst remaining as cool as possible. [[Wetsuit]]s may be worn if the cave is particularly wet or involves stream passages.  On the feet [[boot]]s are worn - hiking-style boots in drier caves, or rubber boots (such as [[wellies]]) often with [[neoprene]] socks ("wetsocks") in wetter caves. [[Knee]]-pads (and sometimes [[Elbow-joint|elbow]]-pads) are popular for protecting joints during crawls. Depending on the nature of the cave, gloves are sometimes worn to protect the hands against abrasion and/or cold.  In pristine areas and for restoration, clean oversuits and powder-free, non-latex [[Medical gloves|surgical gloves]] are used to protect the cave itself from contaminants.
Ropes are used for descending or ascending pitches (single rope technique or SRT) or for protection. [[Knot]]s commonly used in caving are the [[figure-of-eight loop|figure-of-eight]]- (or [[figure-of-nine loop|figure-of-nine]]-) loop, [[bowline]], [[alpine butterfly knot|alpine butterfly]], and [[Italian hitch]]. Ropes are usually rigged using [[bolt (climbing)|bolts]], [[sling (climbing equipment)|sling]]s, and [[carabiner]]s. In some cases cavers may choose to bring and use a flexible metal [[ladder]].

In addition to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing [[First aid|first-aid]] kits, emergency equipment, and food. Containers for securely transporting [[urine]] are also commonly carried.  On longer trips, containers for securely transporting [[feces]] out of the cave are carried.

During very long trips, it may be necessary to camp in the cave - some cavers have stayed underground for many days, or in particularly extreme cases, for weeks at a time. This is particularly the case when exploring or mapping very extended cave systems, where it would be impractical to retrace the route back to the surface regularly. Such long trips necessitate the cavers carrying provisions, sleeping and cooking equipment.

== Safety ==
[[Image:Caving3.jpg|thumb|right|A caver begins rope descent of a vertical shaft using an abseil rack.]]
{{Main|Cave rescue}}
Caves can be dangerous places; hypothermia, [[falling (accident)|falling]], [[flooding]], falling rocks and physical [[exhaustion]] are the main risks. Rescuing people from underground is difficult and time-consuming, and requires special skills, training, and equipment. Full-scale cave rescues often involve the efforts of dozens of rescue workers (often other long-time cavers who have participated in specialized courses, as normal rescue staff are not sufficiently experienced in cave environments), who may themselves be put in jeopardy in effecting the rescue. This said, caving is not necessarily a high-risk sport (especially if it does not involve difficult climbs or diving). As in all physical sports, knowing one's limitations is key.

Caving in the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio River valley]]s carries the risk of contracting [[Histoplasma]]. [[Histoplasmosis]] is a fungal infection that is contracted from bird or bat droppings. It can cause [[pneumonia]] and can disseminate in the body to cause continued infections.

Safety risks while caving can be minimized by using a number of techniques:

* Checking that there is no danger of flooding during the expedition. Rainwater funneled underground can flood a cave very quickly, trapping people in cut-off passages and [[drowning]] them. After falling, this is the most likely fatal accident in caving.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
* Using teams of several cavers, preferably at least four. If an injury occurs, one caver stays with the injured person while the other two go out for help, providing assistance to each other on their way out.
* Notifying people outside the cave as to the intended return time. After an appropriate delay without a return, these will then organize a search party (usually made up by other cavers trained in [[cave rescue]]s, as even professional emergency personnel are unlikely to have the skills to effect a rescue in difficult conditions).
* Use of helmet-mounted lights (hands-free) with extra batteries. American cavers recommend a minimum of three independent sources of light per person, but two lights is common practice among European cavers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
* Sturdy clothing and footwear, as well as a [[helmet]], are necessary to reduce the impact of abrasions, falls, and falling objects. Synthetic fibers and woolens, which dry quickly, shed water, and are warm when wet, are vastly preferred to cotton materials, which retain water and increase the risk of hypothermia. It is also helpful to have several layers of clothing, which can be shed (and stored in the pack) or added as needed. In watery cave passages, [[polypropylene]] thermal underwear or wetsuits may be required to avoid [[hypothermia]].
* Cave passages look different from different directions. In long or complex caves, even experienced cavers can become lost. To reduce the risk of becoming lost, it is necessary to memorize the appearance of key navigational points in the cave as they are passed by the exploring party. Each member of a cave party shares responsibility for being able to remember the route out of the cave. In some caves it may be acceptable to mark a small number of key junctions with small stacks or "cairns" of rocks, or to leave a non-permanent mark such as high-visibility [[flagging (tape)|flagging tape]] tied to a projection.
* [[Pit cave|Vertical caving]] using ladders or single rope technique (SRT) to avoid the need for climbing passages that are too difficult. SRT however is a complex skill and requires proper training before use underground and needs well-maintained equipment. Some drops that are [[abseiling|abseiled]] down may be as deep as several hundred meters (for example [[Harwood Hole]]).

==Cave conservation==
Many cave environments are very fragile.  Many [[speleothem]]s can be damaged by even the slightest touch and some by impacts as slight as a breath. Research suggests that increased carbon dioxide levels can lead to "a higher equilibrium concentration of calcium within the drip waters feeding the speleothems, and hence causes dissolution of existing features."<ref name="Baker 1998 165–175">{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=A.|coauthors=Genty, D.|title=Environmental pressures on conserving cave speleothems: effects of changing surface land use and increased cave tourism.|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|year=1998|month=June|volume=53|issue=2|pages=165–175|accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>  In 2008, researchers found evidence that respiration from cave visitors may generate elevated carbon dioxide concentrations in caves, leading to increased temperatures of up to 3°C and a dissolution of existing features.<ref name="Baker 1998 165–175"/>

Pollution is also of concern.  Since water that flows through a cave eventually comes out in streams and rivers, any pollution may ultimately end up in someone's drinking water, and can even seriously affect the surface environment, as well.  Even minor pollution such as dropping [[organic material]] can have a dramatic effect on the cave biota.

Cave-dwelling species are also very fragile, and often, a particular species found in a cave may live within that cave alone, and be found nowhere else in the world, such as [[Alabama cave shrimp]].  Cave-dwelling species are accustomed to a near-constant climate of temperature and humidity, and any disturbance can be disruptive to the species' life cycles. Though cave wildlife may not always be immediately visible, it is typically nonetheless present in most caves.

[[Bat]]s are one such fragile species of cave-dwelling animal. Bats which [[hibernation|hibernate]] are most vulnerable during the winter season, when no food supply exists on the surface to replenish the bat's store of energy should it be awakened from hibernation. Bats which [[Bird migration|migrate]] are most sensitive during the summer months when they are raising their young.  For these reasons, visiting caves inhabited by hibernating bats is discouraged during cold months; and visiting caves inhabited by migratory bats is discouraged during the warmer months when they are most sensitive and vulnerable.  Due to an affliction affecting bats in the northeastern US known as [[white nose syndrome]] (WNS),<ref>http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html</ref> the US Fish & Wildlife Service has called for a moratorium [http://www.caves.org/WNS/USFWS-WNS_cave_advisory_news_rls_2009-03-26_final-1.pdf] effective March 26, 2009 on caving activity in states known to have hibernacula (MD, NY, VT, NH, MA, CT, NJ, PA, VA, and WV) affected by WNS, as well as adjoining states.

Some cave passages may be marked with flagging tape or other indicators to show biologically, aesthetically, or archaeologically sensitive areas. Marked paths may show ways around notably fragile areas such as a pristine floor of [[sand]] or [[silt]] which may be thousands of years old, dating from the last time water flowed through the cave. Such deposits may easily be spoiled forever by a single misplaced step. Active formations such as [[flowstone]] can be similarly marred with a muddy footprint or handprint, and ancient human artifacts, such as fiber products, may even crumble to dust under all but the most gentle touch.

In 1988, concerned that cave resources were becoming increasingly damaged through unregulated use, Congress enacted the Federal Cave Resources Protection Act, giving land management agencies in the United States expanded authority to manage cave conservation on public land.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iraola|first=Roberto|title=Statutory overview: The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988..|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Review|year=2005|month=October|volume=17|pages=89–271|accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref>

== Caving organizations ==
{{main|Caving organizations}}
Cavers in many countries have created organizations for the administration and oversight of caving activities within their nations. The oldest of these is the [[French Federation of Speleology]] (originally Société de spéléologie) founded by Édouard-Alfred Martel in 1895, which produced the first periodical journal in speleology, ''Spelunca''. The National Speleological Society of the USA was later founded in 1941 (originally formed as the Speleological Society of [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] on May 6, 1939) and the [[Swiss Society of Speleology]] created in 1939 in Geneva, but the first speleological institute in the world was founded in 1920 in [[Cluj-Napoca]], Romania, by [[Emil Racovita]], a Romanian biologist, zoologist, speleologist and explorer of Antarctica. The [[Pakistan Cave Research & Caving Federation]] was founded in Pakistan in 1997.
