The '''Doctrine and Covenants''' (sometimes abbreviated and cited as '''D&C''' or '''D. and C.''') is a part of the [[continuous revelation|open]] [[scripture|scriptural]] [[biblical canon|canon]] of several denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. Originally published in 1835 as '''Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God''', editions of the book continue to be printed mainly by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and the [[Community of Christ]] (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church)).

The book originally contained two parts: a sequence of [[Lectures on Faith|lectures]] setting forth basic church doctrine, followed by a compilation of important revelations, or "covenants" of the church: thus the name ''Doctrine and Covenants''. The "doctrine" portion of the book, however, has been removed by both the LDS Church and the Community of Christ. The remaining portion of the book contains many revelations on numerous topics, most of which were dictated by the movement's founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], supplemented by materials periodically added by each denomination.

Controversy has existed between the two largest denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] over some sections added to the 1876 LDS edition, attributed to founder Smith. Whereas the LDS Church believes these sections to have been revelations to Smith,<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/dc/132 ''Section 132'', scriptures.lds.org], accessed December 26, 2008</ref> the RLDS Church traditionally disputed their authenticity.<ref>[http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/dc/ldc-marr.htm ''Differences between the RLDS and LDS Doctrine and Covenants on the subject of Marriage''], accessed December 26, 2008</ref>

==History==
The Doctrine and Covenants was first published in 1835 as a later version of the [[Book of Commandments]], which had been partially printed in 1833. This earlier book contained 65 early [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] to church leaders including [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Before many copies of the book could be printed, the printing press and most of the printed copies were destroyed by a mob in [[Missouri]].
[[File:Book of Commandments.jpg|thumb|125px|left|<center>Title page of the 1903 reprint of the Book of Commandments.</center>]]
On September 24, 1834 a committee was appointed by the general assembly of the church to organize a new volume containing the most significant [[Latter Day Saint]] [[revelation]]s. This committee of Presiding [[Elder (Mormonism)|Elder]]s, consisting of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], and [[Frederick G. Williams]], began to review and revise numerous revelations for inclusion in the new work. The committee eventually organized the book into two parts: a "Doctrine" part followed by a "Covenants" part.
[[File:D&C 1835.jpg|thumb|125px|<center>Title page of the original 1835 edition</center>]]
The "Doctrine" part of the book consisted of a theological course now called the "[[Lectures on Faith]]". The Lectures were a series of doctrinal courses used in the [[School of the Prophets]] which had recently been completed in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]. According to the committee, these Lectures were included in the compilation "in consequence of their embracing the important doctrine of salvation."<ref>''See'' 1835 D&C, Preface.</ref>
The "Covenants" part of the book, labeled "Covenants and Commandments of the Lord, to his servants of the church of the Latter Day Saints", contained a total of 103 revelations on church governance. These 103 revelations were said to "contain items or principles for the regulation of the church, as taken from the revelations which have been given since its organization, as well as from former ones."<ref name="See id">''See'' ''id.''</ref> Each of the 103 revelations was assigned a "section number"; however, section 66 was used twice. Thus, the sections of the original work numbered only to 102.

On February 17, 1835, after the committee had selected the book's contents, the committee wrote that the resulting work represents "our belief, and when we say this, humbly trust, the faith and principles of this society as a body."<ref name="See id"/>

The book was first introduced to the church body in a general conference on August 17, 1835. [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Frederick G. Williams]], two of the Presiding Elders on the committee, were absent, but [[Oliver Cowdery]] and [[Sidney Rigdon]] were present. The church membership at the time had not yet seen the ''Doctrine and Covenants'' manuscript as it had been compiled and revised solely by the committee; however, various church members who were familiar with the work "bore record" of the book's truth. At the end of the conference, the church "by a unanimous vote" agreed to accept the compilation as "the doctrine and covenants of their faith" and to make arrangements for its printing.<ref>Joseph Smith, B.F. Roberts (ed.) (1902). ''History of the Church'', '''2''':243-46.</ref>

In 1835, the book was printed and published under the title ''Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of the Latter Day Saints: Carefully Selected from the Revelations of God''.

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints editions==
In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), '''The Doctrine and Covenants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' stands alongside the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], and [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|The Pearl of Great Price]] as holy scripture. Together they are referred to as the "[[Standard Works of the LDS Church|Standard Works]]". The LDS Church's version of the Doctrine and Covenants is officially described by the church as "containing revelations given to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, with some additions by his successors in the Presidency of the Church."<ref>[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/contents LDS 1981 D&C Title Page]</ref>

===Sections added to LDS edition===
The 138 Sections in LDS Church's Doctrine and Covenants break down as follows:
*Sections 1–134, 137 — From the presidency of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] (1828–1844)
*Sections 135–136 — During the administration of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Twelve]] (1844–1847)
*[[Official Declaration—1]] — From the presidency of [[Wilford Woodruff]] (1889–1898)
*Section 138 — From the presidency of [[Joseph F. Smith]] (1901–1918)
*[[Official Declaration—2]] — From the presidency of [[Spencer W. Kimball]] (1973–1985)

The following sections are not revelations, but letters, reports, statements, and so forth: 102, 123, 127–131, 134, and 135

In 1844, the church added eight sections not included in the 1835 edition. In the current edition, these added sections are numbered 103, 105, 112, 119, 124, 127, 128, and 135.

In 1876, a new LDS Church edition renumbered most of the sections in a roughly chronological order instead of the earlier topical order, and included 26 revelations not included in previous editions, now numbered as Sections 2, 13, 77, 85, 87, 108–111, 113–118, 120–123, 125, 126, 129–132, and 136. Previous editions had been divided into verses, however, the early versifications generally followed the paragraph structure of the original text. It was with the 1876 edition that the currently used versification was first employed.

During the 1880s, five foreign editions contained two revelations to [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]] that were received in 1882 and 1883; these revelations "set in order" the priesthood, gave more clarification about the roles of priesthood offices—especially the [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Seventy]]—and required [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Priesthood]] leaders to live [[plural marriage]] in order to qualify to hold their church positions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Probably due to the LDS Church's change in attitude to [[polygamy]] in 1890, these sections were not included in future English editions of the Doctrine and Covenants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1930, a small volume edited by [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[James E. Talmage]] titled ''Latter-day Revelations'' was published, which was a highly edited selective version of the Doctrine and Covenants. Some believe it was intended to replace the Doctrine and Covenants, but that due to the controversy that arose this plan was dropped.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Talmage's work did not contain the section on plural marriage.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Covenant 132}}</ref>

Sections 137 and 138 were added to the LDS Church's 1981 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, which is the edition currently in use by the church. These were accounts of two visions, one from [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]] and the other from his nephew, [[Joseph F. Smith]] in 1918. The revelations were earlier accepted as scripture when added to The Pearl of Great Price in April 1976.<ref>{{cite journal

The LDS Church's 1981 edition also contains two "Official Declarations" at the book's conclusion, the first [[1890 Manifesto|renouncing polygamy]] in 1890, and the second in 1978 announcing the opening of [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] ordination to all worthy male members including previously restricted members of [[African people|African descent]]. These two "Official Declarations" are not revelations, but they serve as the formal announcements that a revelation was received. In neither case is the entire revelation included in the Doctrine and Covenants.  The text of [[Official Declaration—1]] has been included in every LDS Church printing of the Doctrine and Covenants since 1908.

===Portions removed from the LDS edition===

In 1876, Section 101 from the 1835 Edition (and subsequent printings) was removed. Section 101 was a ''Statement on Marriage'' as adopted by a conference of the church,<ref>''History of the Church, vol. 2, at 247 (August 1835)''</ref><ref>''Messenger and Advocate'' (Aug 1835), at 163</ref> and contained the following text: 
{{quote|Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy, we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife, and one woman but one husband, except in the case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.<ref>[http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835#259 ''Doctrine and Covenants'' (1835 Edition) 101:4]</ref> }} 
It was superseded by section 132 of the modern LDS edition, recorded in 1843, which contains a revelation received by Joseph Smith on eternal marriage and teaches the doctrine of plural marriage, the principles of which can be dated to as early as 1831.

In 1921, the LDS Church removed the "[[Lectures on Faith]]" portion of the book, with an explanation that the Lectures "were never presented to nor accepted by the Church as being otherwise than theological lectures or lessons".<ref>''See'' Introduction, 1921 edition.</ref> The Lectures contain theology concerning the [[Godhead (Mormonism)|Godhead]] and emphasize the importance of faith and works.

Until 1981, editions of the book used [[List of code names in the Doctrine and Covenants|code names for certain people and places]] in those sections that dealt with the [[United Order]]. The 1981 LDS edition replaced these with the real names, relegating the code names to footnotes. The Community of Christ edition still uses the code names.

==Community of Christ editions==
Officials of [[Community of Christ]] (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) first published an edition of the Doctrine and Covenants in 1864, based on the previous 1844 edition. A [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|General Conference]] of the church in 1878 approved a resolution that declared that the revelations of the [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|Prophet–President]] [[Joseph Smith III]] had equal standing to those previously included in the work. Since that time, the church has continually added sections to its edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, containing the revelations of succeeding Prophet-Presidents. The most recent addition was formally authorized on April 14, 2010, after being presented to the church for informal consideration on January 17, 2010. The numbers of the sections and versification differ from the edition published by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and both modern editions differ from the original 1835 edition numeration.

===Sections added to Community of Christ edition===
The 166 Sections of the Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants break down as follows:
*Sections 1–113 (includes 108A) — From the presidency of [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] (1828–1844)
*Sections 114–131 — From the presidency of [[Joseph Smith III]] (1860–1914)
*Sections 132–138 — From the presidency of [[Frederick Madison Smith|Frederick M. Smith]] (1914–1946)
*Sections 139–144 — From the presidency of [[Israel Alexander Smith|Israel A. Smith]] (1946–1958)
*Sections 145–152 (includes 149A) — From the presidency of [[W. Wallace Smith]] (1958–1978)
*Sections 153–160 — From the presidency of [[Wallace B. Smith]] (1978–1996)
*Sections 161–162 — From the presidency of [[W. Grant McMurray]] (1996–2004)
*Sections 163–164 — From the presidency of [[Stephen M. Veazey]] (2005– )

The following sections are not revelations, but letters, reports, statements, and so forth: 99, 108A, 109–113, and 123.

Based on the above, the number of revelations (accounting for sections that are not revelations) presented by each Community of Christ prophet, are as follows:

*Joseph Smith II: 107
*Joseph Smith III: 17
*Frederick M. Smith: 7
*Israel A. Smith: 6
*W. Wallace Smith: 9
*Wallace B. Smith: 8
*W. Grant McMurray: 2
*Stephen M. Veazey: 2

===Portions removed from the Community of Christ edition===
Community of Christ removed the "Lectures on Faith" ("Doctrine" portion of the work) in 1897. The 1970 [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] concluded that several sections that had been added between the 1835 and 1844 editions—mainly dealing with the subjects of [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple worship]] and [[baptism for the dead]]—had been published without proper approval of a church conference. The World Conference removed Sections 107, 109, 110, 113 and 123 to a historical appendix (which also included documents that were never published as sections). Of these, only Section 107 was a revelation. The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants. Section 108A contained the minutes of a business meeting, which, because of its historical nature, was moved to the Introduction in the 1970s. After 1990, the Introduction was updated, and what was section 108A was removed entirely.

===Doctrinal developments in the Community of Christ edition===
The ongoing additions to the Community of Christ edition provide a record of the leadership changes and doctrinal developments within the denomination. When W. Grant McMurray became Prophet–President, he declared that instruction specific to leadership changes would no longer be included, so that the focus of the work could be more doctrinal in nature, and less administrative. The record of these leadership changes are still maintained in the form of published ''letters of counsel.'' Prophet–President Stephen M. Veazey has conformed to this pattern. Although these letters are not formally published in the Doctrine and Covenants, they are still deemed to be inspired, and are dealt with in the same manner that revelations are (that is, they must be deliberated and approved by the voting members of a World Conference).

A modern revelation that resulted in some "disaffection" and "led to intense conflict in scattered areas of the RLDS Church"<ref>[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/EoM&CISOPTR=4391&REC=1|&CISOSHOW=4127  Howard, R.P. (1992) ''Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church)''], Encyclopedia of Mormonism, New York: Macmillan, 1:1211</ref> is contained in the Community of Christ version's Section 156,<ref>[http://www.centerplace.org/library/study/dc/rdc-156.htm D&C Section 156]</ref> presented by Prophet-President Wallace B. Smith and added in 1984, which called for construction of the [[Independence Temple]] and the [[ordination of women]] to the priesthood, among other changes. A resulting schism over the legitimacy of these changes led to the formation of the [[Restoration Branches]] movement, the [[Restoration Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] and the [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].

While some of the prose in the new revelations seems designed to guide the denomination on matters of church governance and doctrine, others are seen as inspirational. One such example can be cited from Section 161, presented as counsel to the church by [[W. Grant McMurray]] in 1996: "Become a people of the Temple—those who see violence but proclaim peace, who feel conflict yet extend the hand of reconciliation, who encounter broken spirits and find pathways for healing."

==Editions used by other denominations==
The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)]] uses the 1846 edition that was published in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]; this version is virtually identical to the 1844 edition. Most recently a facsimile reprint was produced for the church at [[Voree, Wisconsin]] by Richard Drew in 1993.

The [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] contends that the thousands of changes made to the original revelations as published in the [[Book of Commandments]] (including the change of the church's name) are not doctrinal and result from Joseph Smith's fall from his original calling. As a result, the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) prefers to use reprints of the Book of Commandments text.

The [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]] accepts the 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, including the Lectures on Faith, which it insists are as much inspired as the revelations themselves.

The [[Restoration Branches]] generally use the older RLDS Church Doctrine and Covenants, typically sections 1–144.

The [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] also uses the older RLDS Church version of the Doctrine and Covenants up to section 144, and also contains new revelations from their prophet–president [[Frederick Niels Larsen]]. These new sections are R 145–R 153.

==Chart comparison of editions==
The following chart compares the current editions of the Doctrine and Covenants used by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ('''LDS ed.''') and the [[Community of Christ]] ('''CofC ed.''') with the 1833 [[Book of Commandments]] ('''BofC'''), the 1835 edition published in '''Kirtland''', and the 1844 edition published in '''Nauvoo'''. Unless otherwise specified, the document is styled a "revelation" of the person delivering it.
