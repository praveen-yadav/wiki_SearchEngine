'''Astatine''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[chemical symbol]] '''At''' and atomic number 85. It occurs on Earth only as the result of the radioactive decay of certain heavier elements. All of its [[isotope]]s are short-lived; the most stable is astatine-210, with a [[half-life]] of 8.5 hours.<ref>Price, Andy (2004-12-20). "Francium". Retrieved 2012-02-19.
</ref> Accordingly, much less is known about astatine than most other elements. The observed properties are consistent with it being a heavier analog of [[iodine]]; many other properties have been estimated based on this resemblance.

Elemental astatine has never been viewed, because a mass large enough to be seen (by the naked human eye) would be immediately vaporized by the heat generated by its own radioactivity. Astatine may be dark, or it may have a metallic appearance and be a semiconductor, or it may even be a metal. It is likely to have a much higher melting point than iodine, on par with those of [[bismuth]] and polonium. Chemically, astatine behaves more or less as a [[halogen]] (the group including [[chlorine]] and [[fluorine]]), being expected to form ionic astatides with [[alkali metal|alkali]] or [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] metals; it is known to form covalent compounds with nonmetals, including [[interhalogen|other halogens]]. It does, however, also have a notable cationic chemistry that distinguishes it from the lighter halogens. The second longest-lived isotope of astatine, astatine-211, is the only one currently having any commercial application, being employed in medicine to diagnose and treat some diseases via its emission of [[alpha particles]] (helium-4 nuclei). Only extremely small quantities are used, however, due to its intense radioactivity.

The element was first produced by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[Kenneth Ross MacKenzie]], and [[Emilio Segrè]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1940. They named the element "astatine", a name coming from the great instability of the synthesized matter (the source Greek word αστατος (''astatos'') means "unstable"). Three years later it was found in nature, although it is the least abundant element in the Earth's crust among the non-[[transuranic element]]s, with a total existing amount of much less than one gram at any given time.<ref name="Hollerman 2001 423">{{cite book|last=Hollerman|first=Arnold|title=Inorganic Chemistry|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|location=Berlin|isbn=0123526515|page=423|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Inorganic_Chemistry.html?id=Mtth5g59dEIC}}</ref> Six [[Isotopes of astatine|astatine isotopes]], with [[mass number]]s of 214 to 219, are present in nature as the products of various decay routes of heavier elements, but neither the most stable isotope of astatine (with mass number 210) nor astatine-211 (which is used in medicine) is produced naturally.

==Characteristics==
Astatine is an extremely radioactive element; all its isotopes have [[Half-life|half-lives]] of less than 12 hours, decaying into [[bismuth]], [[polonium]], [[radon]], or other astatine isotopes. Among the first 101 elements in the periodic table, only [[francium]] is less stable.<ref name="ffff">{{cite journal |first1=G.|last1=Audi|first2=A.

Astatine has 23 [[nuclear isomer]]s, which are nuclei with one or more [[nucleon]]s ([[proton]]s or [[neutron]]s) in an [[excited state]]. A nuclear isomer may also be called a "[[metastability|meta]]-state", meaning the system has more [[internal energy]] than the "[[ground state]]" (the state with the lowest possible internal energy), making the former likely to decay into the latter. There may be more than one isomer for each isotope. The most stable of these nuclear isomers is astatine-202m1,{{efn|"m1" means that this state of the isotope is the next possible one above&nbsp;– with an energy greater than&nbsp;– the ground state. "m2" and similar designations refer to further higher energy states. The number may be dropped if there is only one well-established meta state, such as astatine-216m. Note that other designation techniques are sometimes used.}} which has a half-life of about 3 minutes, longer than those of all the ground states except for those of isotopes 203–211 and 220. The least stable one is astatine-214m1; its half-life of 265 [[nanoseconds]] is shorter than those of all ground states except that of astatine-213.<ref name="ffff" />

Astatine's [[alpha decay]] energies follow the same trend as for other heavy elements.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=232}} Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211, however, has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, because it has a nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1&nbsp;hours for astatine-210 and 7.2&nbsp;hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%.<ref name="ffff" />{{efn|This means that, if decay modes other than alpha are omitted, then astatine-210 has an alpha half-life of 4,628.6&nbsp;hours (128.9&nbsp;days) and astatine-211 has one of only 17.2 hours (0.7&nbsp;days). Therefore, astatine-211 is very much less stable toward alpha decay than the previous isotope.}} The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the highest amount of energy of all astatine isotopes. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=232}} Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, due to the increasing role of [[beta decay]] (electron emission).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=232}} This decay mode is especially important for astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that the element has no beta-stable isotopes (i.e., ones that do not beta decay at all).<ref>{{cite book|title=Isotope geology|edition=2nd|publisher=Pergamon Press|page=403|year=1956 | isbn = 978-0-470-70800-2 |first=Kalervo|last=Rankama}}</ref> Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, astatine-214, astatine-215, and astatine-216m.<ref name="ffff" /> Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay ([[positron emission]]), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes [[electron capture]] instead.<ref name="ffff" />

The most stable isotope is astatine-210, which has a half-life of 8.1&nbsp;hours. This isotope's primary decay mode is beta plus decay to the relatively long-lived (in comparison to astatine isotopes) alpha emitter [[polonium-210]]. In total, only five isotopes have half-lives exceeding one hour (those with mass numbers between 207 and 211). The least stable ground state isotope is astatine-213, with a half-life of 125 nanoseconds. It alpha decays to the extremely long-lived (in practice, stable) bismuth-209.<ref name="ffff" />

==Natural occurrence==
Astatine is the rarest naturally occurring element that is not a [[transuranium element|transuranic element]], with the total amount in Earth's crust estimated to be less than one gram at any given time.<ref name="Hollerman 2001 423"/> Any astatine that was present at the Earth's formation has long since decayed, and the minute amounts of astatine existing currently have formed through the decay of heavier elements. While it was previously thought to be the rarest element occurring on the Earth, astatine has lost this status to [[berkelium]], atoms of which can be produced by [[Neutron capture|neutron capture reactions]] and beta decay in very highly concentrated [[uranium]]-bearing deposits.<ref name="Emsley">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-19-960563-7 |pages=57–58}}</ref>

Six astatine isotopes occur naturally (astatine-214 to astatine-219).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=231}} Because of their short [[half-lives]], they are found only in [[trace radioisotope|trace]] amounts.<ref name="chain">{{cite book|title=Chemistry and Analysis of Radionuclides: Laboratory Techniques and Methodology|publisher=Wiley-VCH|pages=2–3|year=2011 | isbn = 978-3-527-32658-7 |first1=Jukka|last1=Lehto|first2=Xiaolin|last2=Hou}}</ref> There is no data indicating that astatine occurs in stars.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=230}}

Four out of these isotopes (astatine-215, astatine-217, astatine-218, and astatine-219) are found due to their production in major natural [[decay chains]]. Francium-223, the father isotope of astatine-219, alpha decays with a probability of only 0.006%, making this astatine isotope extremely rare even compared to the other astatine isotopes; this is in spite of its half-life being the longest of the natural astatine isotopes (56 seconds).<ref name="ffff" /> Astatine-219 decays to polonium-215, which itself beta decays to astatine-215 with an even smaller probability of 0.00023%. The entirety of North and South America combined, considered to a depth of 16 kilometers (10 miles), contain only about one [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] astatine-215 atoms at any given time.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=1RMLAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Only+a+trillion&q=astatine-215#search_anchor | title = Only a Trillion| first = Isaac | last = Asimov | authorlink = Isaac Asimov | publisher = Abelard-Schuman | year = 1957 | page = 24}}</ref> Astatine-218 is found in nature as a result of polonium-218 beta decay; as with francium-223 and polonium-215, decay to an astatine isotope is not the primary decay mode.<ref name="chain" /> However, the astatine-217 isotope has a straight chain leading directly to astatine; its father isotope (francium-221) decays exclusively to this [[nuclide]]. Given that its fathers, grandfathers, and so on each decay exclusively to only one nuclide, this gives only one possible way for the starting nuclide in the [[neptunium series]] ([[neptunium]]-237) to decay&nbsp;– via eventual production of astatine-217.<ref name="chain" />

The isotopes with mass numbers 214 through 216 are found as the result of triple alpha decay of the naturally present [[protactinium]] isotopes protactinium-226, protactinium-227, and protactinium-228.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=231}} However, these isotopes are extremely rare, so much so that they are often not cited as natural astatine isotopes.<ref name="MoreAt" /><ref name="Qaaa">{{cite book|title=Advances in inorganic chemistry|page=43|publisher=Academic Press|volume=31 |year=1987|author=Emeléus, Harry Julius | isbn = 978-0-12-023631-2}}</ref>

Astatine was first produced by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, and this is still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in microscopic quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of 2&nbsp;[[tera-|tera]][[becquerel]]s (about 25&nbsp;[[micrograms]]).<ref name="211A">{{cite book|title=Prostate Cancer Methods and Protocols|first1=Pamela Joan|last1=Russell|first2=Paul|last2=Jackson|first3=Elizabeth Anne|last3=Kingsley|year=1989|page=335|publisher=Humana Press | isbn = 978-0-89603-978-0 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=K1y6k5bdlWkC&lpg=PA335&vq=astatine&dq=%22Prostate%20Cancer%20Methods%20and%20Protocols%22&pg=PA335#v=snippet&q=astatine&f=false}}</ref>

The most important isotope is astatine-211, the only one to currently have a commercial use.<ref>{{cite book|edition=2nd|title=The History and Use of Our Earth's Chemical Elements: A Reference Guide|year=2006|last=Krebs|first=Robert E.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | isbn = 978-0-313-33438-2 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&lpg=PA259&vq=astatine&dq=%22The%20history%20and%20use%20of%20our%20earth's%20chemical%20elements%3A%20a%20reference%20guide%22&pg=PA257#v=snippet&q=astatine&f=false | pages=257–259}}</ref> To produce the bismuth target, the metal is [[sputtering|sputtered]] onto a gold, copper, or aluminum surface at 50 to 100 milligrams per square centimeter.

Even though there is only one bismuth isotope used (bismuth-209), the reaction may occur in three possible ways, producing astatine-209, astatine-210, or astatine-211. In order to eliminate undesired nuclides, the maximum energy of the particle accelerator is set to any value (such as 30&nbsp;MeV) above that for the reaction producing astatine-211 (to produce the desired isotope) and below the one producing astatine-210 (to avoid producing other astatine isotopes).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=234}}

===Separation===
<!-- The technique given below (dry distillation) is the only technique commonly cited as the main one, even though solution distillation or purely chemical methods also exist.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|pp=243–254}}

Astatine is very volatile, though less so than iodine in acidic solutions. Out of such solutions, an iron(II) sulfate/sulfuric acid solution seems the most promising, possibly providing [[distillation]] of up to 90% of the element (85% of the solution distilled).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=254}} -->

Since the element is the main product of the synthesis, after its formation it must only be separated from the target and traces of other radioisotopes.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=254}} The astatine-containing target is heated to 270&nbsp;°C (520&nbsp;°F) to vaporize away volatile traces of radioisotopes, after which the temperature is raised to 800&nbsp;°C (1450&nbsp;°F). Although 80% of astatine may vaporize at this temperature, bismuth begins to vaporize as well.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=254}} Astatine's vaporization does not occur at an adequate rate at temperatures below 600&nbsp;°C (1100&nbsp;°F), but at temperatures above 800&nbsp;°C (1450&nbsp;°F), astatine's volatility from a bismuth surface increases significantly.{{efn|Astatine is thought to react with bismuth at lower temperatures to form non-volatile compounds, which prevent the astatine from vaporizing, but these compounds are believed to decompose at 700–800&nbsp;°C (1275–1450&nbsp;°F).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=254}} }} The condensed vapor ([[distillation|distillate]]) is collected on a water-cooled platinum surface, which is later moved into a U-like [[quartz]] vessel. The quartz container vessel is heated to 130&nbsp;°C (270&nbsp;°F) to remove further traces of impurities (typically polonium) and then to 500&nbsp;°C (930&nbsp;°F) to remove astatine, which is collected on a [[cold finger]].{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=254}} The purified element is then washed off the cold finger with a weak nitric acid solution. Using this technique, yields of astatine of up to 30% may be achieved.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=254}}<!-- The target is heated to 300–600&nbsp;°C (575–1100&nbsp;°F).

====Chemical routes====
Astatine may be extracted from acidic aqueous solutions using organic solvents. The distribution factor varies on the solvent: the highest one is 200, found in 0.01&nbsp;M nitric acid/benzene system (the second highest is 91, in 0.01&nbsp;M nitric acid/tetrachloromethane system).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=245}} In general, it is similar to iodine in that it dissolves in [[benzene]], [[carbon disulfide]], and [[tetrachloromethane]] (therefore, they have high distribution factors in systems with water), but, unlike iodine, it cannot be extracted from alkaline solutions of organic solvents, as it reacts with [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and [[disproportionation|disproportionates]].<ref name="MoreAt" /> Diatomic [[interhalogen]] molecules (with iodine and bromine) have smaller distribution factors than dihalogens (where both atoms are the same), as the former are dipoles.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=245}} Separation from other elements is done via extraction from [[hydrochloric acid]]/isopropyl ether solutions. [[Iron(III) hydroxide]] may be used to remove the further traces. Using 8&nbsp;M HCl solutions, outcome may be as high as 90%.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=245}}

When astatine is introduced into negatively charged chloro complexes and dissolved in chloride or hydrogen chloride (at best at 5–8&nbsp;M, because the complex decomposes on a lower chloride concentration), such a complex can be sorbed on a cation resin; the same is true for the astatine cation.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=246}} Such astatine is originally inserted into tellurium, which is (together with polonium impurity) later washer away with hydrochloric acid/chlorine solution. Astatine is later desorbed via chloric water. The cation resin is processed with nitric acid solution (with a small dichromate content), and the solution is introduced to it, and later to nitric acid solution (to remove the chloride ions). Thereafter, astatine is desorbed with nitric acid/dichromate solution.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=247}}

Astatine partially coprecipitates from weakly acidic solutions with several hydroxides, [[silver(I) iodide|silver(I)]] and [[thallium(I) iodide|thallium(I)]] iodides, several [[sulfide]]s of [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], silver metal, and tellurium. This is likely to be caused by adsorbation on the surface of the precipitate.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=250}} The adsorbation is suppressed by increasing the acidity of the solution, washing off the precipitate with [[acetone]], or adding iodine; the latter proves the adsorbation character of the astatine coprecipitation.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=250}} The most important such a reaction is the one with tellurium, which is catalyzed by reducers like [[tin dichloride]]; however, the reaction does not occur in alkaline solutions. The amount of astatine precipitated does not rely on tellurium amount, reaching 90% in concentrated HCl (this reaction also eliminates different impurities).{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=250}} Astatide and astatate have been shown to coprecipitate with iodide and iodate; they, however, cannot be washed off with acetone.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=251}} These methods are used most typically only when astatine is the result of a different, way rarer reaction of bismuth, [[lead]], or [[thorium]] with high-energy protons.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=251}} Since such reactions produces hundreds less times astatine than the one involving bismuth and alpha particles. Therefore, the method used of separation should be effective; this one has proved to be so.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=251}} -->

The newly formed astatine-211 is important in [[nuclear medicine]].<ref name="211Att" /> Once produced, astatine must be used quickly, as it decays with a half-life of 7.2&nbsp;hours; this is, however, long enough to permit multi-step labeling strategies. Astatine-211 can be used for targeted alpha particle [[radiotherapy]], since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via [[electron capture]] (to an extremely short-lived nuclide of polonium-211, which itself undergoes further alpha decay).<ref name="211Att" />

In a manner similar to iodine, astatine is preferentially concentrated in the [[thyroid gland]], although to a lesser extent. However, it tends to concentrate in the [[liver]] in the form of a radiocolloid if it is released into the systemic circulation.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=234}} The principal medicinal difference between astatine-211 and [[iodine-131]] (a radioactive iodine isotope also used in medicine) is that astatine does not emit high energy beta particles (electrons), as does iodine-131. Beta particles have considerably greater penetrating power through tissues than do the much heavier alpha particles. While an average energy alpha particle released by decay of astatine-211 can travel up to 70&nbsp;µm through the surrounding tissues, an average energy beta particle emitted by iodine-131 can travel nearly 30 times as far, to about 2&nbsp;mm.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=234}} Thus, using astatine-211 instead of iodine-131 enables the thyroid to be dosed appropriately, while the neighboring [[parathyroid gland]] is spared. The short half-life and limited penetrating power of its radiation through tissues renders astatine generally preferable to iodine-131 when used in diagnosis as well.{{sfn|Lavrukhina|Pozdnyakov|1966|p=234}}

Experiments in rats and monkeys, however, suggest that astatine causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the nuclide resulting in necrosis and cell [[dysplasia]] within the gland. These experiments also suggest that astatine could cause damage to the thyroid of any organism.<ref name="1988At">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/096032718800700602 | title = Toxicity of Astatine-211 in the Mouse | year = 1988 | month = November | last1 = Cobb | first1 = L.
