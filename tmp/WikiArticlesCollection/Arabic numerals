The Indian numerals are traditionally thought to have been adopted by the Muslim [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] in India, and passed on to the Arabs further west. 

There is some evidence which suggests that the numerals in their current form developed from [[Abjad numerals|Arabic letters]] in the [[Maghreb|western regions]] of the [[Arab World]].<ref>[http://xxx.lanl.gov/ftp/math/papers/0304/0304219.pdf On the Origin of Arabic Numerals] - A.

It was in the North African city of [[Bejaia]] that the Italian scholar [[Fibonacci]] first encountered the numerals; his work was crucial in making them known throughout Europe, and then further to the Europeans who spread it worldwide. The use of Arabic numerals spread around the world through European trade, books and [[colonialism]]. Today they are the most common symbolic representation of numbers in the world. 

The reason the digits are more commonly known as "Arabic numerals" in Europe and the Americas is that they were introduced to Europe in the 10th century by Arabic-speakers of North Africa, who were then using the digits from Libya to Morocco. Arabs, on the other hand, call the system "[[Hindu]] numerals",<ref name="UniOfNthC1">{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and "Arabic" Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=4 July 2004|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="TWPTakeANo">{{Citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-909875.html|title=Article: Take a Number, Please. |last=Achenbach|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Achenbach|date=16 September 1994|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref> referring to their origin in India.  This is not to be confused with what the Arabs call the "Hindi numerals", namely the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] ({{script/Arabic|٠}} - {{script/Arabic|١}} - {{script/Arabic|٢}} - {{script/Arabic|٣}} - {{script/Arabic|٤}} - {{script/Arabic|٥}} - {{script/Arabic|٦}} - {{script/Arabic|٧}} - {{script/Arabic|٨}} - {{script/Arabic|٩}}) used in the Middle East, or any of the [[Glyphs used with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system|numerals currently used]] in [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] (e.g. [[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|०.१.२.३.४.५.६.७.८.९}}).<ref name=ifrah/>

In English, the term ''Arabic numerals'' can be ambiguous. It most commonly refers to the numeral system widely used in Europe and the Americas.  ''Arabic numerals'' is the conventional name for the entire family of related systems of Arabic and [[Indian numerals]].  It may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs, in which case it generally refers to the [[Eastern Arabic numerals]].

The decimal Hindu-Arabic numeral system was invented in India around 500 [[Common Era|CE]].<ref name=ifrah>Ifrah, Georges. 1999. ''The Universal History of Numbers : From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'', Wiley. ISBN 0-471-37568-3.</ref><ref name=oconnor>O'Connor, J.J. and E.F. Robertson.  2000.  [http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html 'Indian Numerals'], ''MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive'', School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St. Andrews, Scotland.</ref> The system was revolutionary by including a [[zero]] and [[positional notation]].  It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics. One may distinguish between this positional ''system'', which is identical throughout the family, and the precise [[glyph]]s used to write the numerals, which vary regionally. The glyphs most commonly used in conjunction with the [[Latin script]] since [[Early modern period|early modern times]] are <big>[[0 (number)|0]] [[1 (number)|1]] [[2 (number)|2]] [[3 (number)|3]] [[4 (number)|4]] [[5 (number)|5]] [[6 (number)|6]] [[7 (number)|7]] [[8 (number)|8]] [[9 (number)|9]]</big>.

Although the phrase "Arabic numeral" is frequently capitalized, it is sometimes written in lower case: for instance, in its entry in the [[Oxford English dictionary]].<ref>"Arabic", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd edition</ref> This helps distinguish it from "Arabic numerals" as the East Arabic numerals specific to the Arabs.

==History==
===Origins===

{{Main|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}

The [[numerical digit|digits]] 1 to 9 in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]]. [[Buddhist]] inscriptions from around 300 [[Common Era|BCE]] use the symbols which became 1, 4 and 6. 

By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the [[Babylonian mathematics]] had a sophisticated [[sexagesimal]] positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a ''space'' between sexagesimal numerals. By 300&nbsp;BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholder]] in the same [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian system]]. In a tablet unearthed at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (dating from about 700&nbsp;BC), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.<ref name="multiref1">Kaplan, Robert. (2000). ''The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>

The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.

The first universally accepted inscription containing the use of the 0 glyph is first recorded in the 9th century, in an inscription at [[Gwalior]] in [[Central India]] dated to 870.  By this time, the use of the glyph had already reached Persia, and was mentioned in [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]]'s descriptions of [[Indian numerals]].  Numerous Indian documents on [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper plates]] exist, with the same symbol for zero in them, dated back as far as the 6th century CE.<ref>Kaplan, Robert. (2000). ''The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero'', Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref>

[[Image:EgyptphoneKeypad.jpg|right|thumb|Modern-day Arab telephone keypad with two forms of Arabic numerals: [[Western Arabic/European numerals]] on the left and [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] on the right]]

The [[numeral system]] came to be known to both the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarizmi]], whose book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'' written about 825 in [[Arabic]], and the [[Arab]] mathematician [[Al-Kindi]], who wrote four volumes, "On the Use of the Indian Numerals" (''Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi'') about 830.  Their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle East and the West.<ref>[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]</ref> In the 10th century, [[Middle-East]]ern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include [[fractions]], as recorded in a treatise by [[Syrian]] mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] in 952–953. The [[decimal point]] notation was introduced by [[Sind ibn Ali]], he also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.

A distinctive West Arabic variant of the symbols begins to emerge around the 10th century in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Al-Andalus]], called ''ghubar'' ("sand-table" or "dust-table") numerals, which are the direct ancestor of the modern Western Arabic numerals used throughout the world. Ghubar numerals themselves are probably of Roman origin.<ref>{{citation|title=The Origin of the Ghubār Numerals, or the Arabian Abacus and the Articuli|first=Solomon|last=Gandz|journal=[[Isis (Journal)|Isis]]|volume=16|issue=2|date=November 1931|pages=393–424|doi=10.1086/346615}}</ref>

====Folk etymologies====
Some folk etymologies have argued that the original forms of these symbols indicated their value through the number of angles they contained, but no proof exists of any such origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/13244252/Number-Story |title=Number Story |publisher=Scribd.com |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-05 |author=bigstrand4476}}</ref>

===Adoption in Europe===

[[Image:Clock-french-republic.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Late 18th-century French revolutionary "decimal" clockface.]]
In 825 [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]] wrote a treatise in Arabic, ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'',<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DuyMjOwWWnUC&pg=PA38 Philosophy Of Mathematics] Francis, John – 2008 – Page 38</ref> which survives only as the 12th-century Latin translation, ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=twWkDe1Y9YQC&pg=PT99 The Ellipse: A Historical and Mathematical Journey] Arthur Mazer – 2011</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/317171/al-Khwarizmi Encyclopaedia Brittanica: al-Khwārizmī]</ref>  ''Algoritmi'', the translator's rendition of the author's name, gave rise to the word ''[[algorithm]]'' (Latin ''algorithmus'', "calculation method").<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=FPFsnzzebhQC&pg=PA1 Models of Computation: An Introduction to Computability Theory – Page 1] Maribel Fernández – 2009</ref>

The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the ''[[Codex Vigilanus]]'' of 976.<ref>[http://www.mathorigins.com/V.htm Mathorigins.com]</ref>

From the 980s, Gerbert of Aurillac (later, [[Pope Sylvester II]]) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe.  Gerbert studied in [[Barcelona]] in his youth.  He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the [[astrolabe]] from [[Lupitus of Barcelona]] after he had returned to France.

[[Leonardo Fibonacci]] ([[Leonardo of Pisa]]), a mathematician born in the [[Republic of Pisa]] who had studied in [[Béjaïa]] (Bougie), [[Algeria]], promoted the Indian numeral system in Europe with his 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'':

:"When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at [[Béjaïa|Bugia]] acting for the [[Pisa]]n merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it."

The numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left-to-right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet. Hence, from the point of view of the reader, numerals in Western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in Arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first.

The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the [[printing press]], and they became widely known during the 15th century. Early evidence of their use in [[Great Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] includes: an equal hour horary [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] from 1396,<ref>{{cite news |title=14th century timepiece unearthed in Qld farm shed |publisher=ABC News |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-09/one-man27s-trash-is-another27s-centuries-old-treasure/3654974}}</ref> in England, a 1445 inscription on the tower of [[Heathfield and Waldron|Heathfield]] Church, [[Sussex]]; a 1448 inscription on a wooden lych-gate of [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]] Church, [[Berkshire]]; and a 1487 inscription on the belfry door at [[Piddletrenthide]] church, [[Dorset]]; and in [[Scotland]] a 1470 inscription on the tomb of the first Earl of Huntly in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]] Cathedral. (See G.F. Hill, ''The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe'' for more examples.) In central Europe, the [[King of Hungary]] [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], started the use of Arabic numerals, which appear for the first time in a royal document of 1456.<ref>Erdélyi: Magyar művelődéstörténet 1-2. kötet. Kolozsvár, 1913, 1918</ref> By the mid-16th century, they were in common use in most of Europe.<ref>[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52545.html Mathforum.org]</ref>  Roman numerals remained in use mostly for the notation of [[Anno Domini]] years, and for numbers on clockfaces.  Sometimes, [[Roman numerals]] are still used for enumeration of lists (as an alternative to alphabetical enumeration), for sequential volumes, to differentiate monarchs or family members with the same first names, and (in lower case) to number pages in prefatory material in books.

===Adoption in Russia===
[[Cyrillic numerals]] were a numbering system derived from the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]], used by [[South Slavs|South]] and [[East Slavs|East]] [[Slavic peoples]]. The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century when [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] replaced it with Arabic numerals.

===Adoption in China===
[[File:Yuan dynasty iron magic square.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Iron plate with an order 6 [[magic square]] in Persian/ Arabic numbers from China, dating to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368).]]
Arabic numerals were introduced to China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) by the Muslim [[Hui people]]. In the early 17th century, European-style Arabic numerals were introduced by the Jesuits.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&pg=PA198|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=31 July 1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=198–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Meuleman|first=Johan H.|title=Islam in the era of globalization: Muslim attitudes towards modernity and identity|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YNArhqy4emwC&pg=PA272|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=23 August 2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1691-3|page=272}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peng Yoke Ho|title=Li, Qi and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_P6C4JO4JCUC&pg=PA106|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=16 October 2000|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-41445-4|page=106}}</ref>

==Evolution of symbols==
{{main|Algorism|glyphs used with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system}}

The numeral system employed, known as [[algorism]], is [[positional notation|positional]] [[decimal]] notation.  Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, all of which evolved from the [[Brahmi numerals]].  The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]]:

*The widespread Western Arabic numerals used with the [[Latin script]], in the table below labelled ''European'', descended from the West Arabic numerals developed in [[al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]]. (There are two [[typographic]] styles for rendering European numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).
*The Arabic–Indic or [[Eastern Arabic numerals]], used with the [[Arabic script]], developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]]. A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Persian and Urdu languages is shown as East Arabic-Indic. There is substantial variation in usage of glyphs for the Eastern Arabic-Indic digits, especially for the digits four, five, six, and seven.<ref>[http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/ch08.pdf The Unicode Standard 5.0 – Electronic edition, Chapter 8 Middle Eastern Scripts]</ref>
*The [[Devanagari numerals]] used with [[Devanagari]] and related variants are grouped as [[Indian numerals]].
 
The evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown on a table created by the French scholar J.E. Montucla in his ''Histoire de la Mathematique'', which was published in 1757:

[[Image:EuropeanFormOfArabianDigits.png|500px|Table of numerals]]

[[Image:Apices du moyen-âge.PNG|500px]]

The Arabic numeral glyphs 0-9 are encoded in [[ASCII]] and [[Unicode|UTF-8]] at positions 0x30 to 0x39, matching up with the second hex-digit for convenience:
