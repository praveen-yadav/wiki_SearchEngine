'''[[Denmark]] is a [[Nordic country]] located in [[Northern Europe]].''' It consists of the [[Jutland]] peninsula and several islands in the Baltic sea, referred to as the Danish Archipelago. Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) [[Schleswig-Holstein]] to the south.

Denmark borders both the Baltic and [[North Sea]]s along its {{convert|7,314|km|mi|abbr=on}} tidal shoreline. Denmark's general coastline is much shorter, at {{convert|1,701|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as it would, among other geographical features, not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180&nbsp;km long [[Limfjorden]], which separates Denmark's second largest island, [[North Jutlandic Island]], 4,686&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in size, from the rest of Jutland. Denmark has 443 named islands,<ref>[http://www2.kms.dk/C1256AED004EA666/(AllDocsByDocId)/1D7EE8822587E667C1256AEF0030ABF6?open&page=strste&omr=KORT_DK_I_TAL Islands in total and named islands]</ref> of which 72 are inhabited ({{as of|2007|01|01|lc=on}}, Statistics Denmark). 

Denmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat with a few gently rolling [[plain]]s. The territory of Denmark includes the island of [[Bornholm]] in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]]. Its position gives Denmark complete control of the [[Danish Straits]] ([[Skagerrak]] and [[Kattegat]]) linking Baltic and North Seas. The country's natural resources include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[fish]], [[salt]], [[limestone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]].
