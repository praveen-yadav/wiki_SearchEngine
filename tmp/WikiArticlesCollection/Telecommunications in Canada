==Telegraphy==
{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}
The history of [[telegraphy]] in Canada dates back to the [[Province of Canada]].  While the first telegraph company was the Toronto, Hamilton and Niagara Electro-Magnetic Telegraph Company, founded in 1846, it was the Montreal Telegraph Company, controlled by [[Hugh Allan]] and founded a year later, that dominated in Canada during the technology's early years.<ref name="canencyclo"/>

Following the 1852 Telegraph Act, Canada's first permanent transatlantic telegraph link was a submarine cable built in 1866 between Ireland and Newfoundland.<ref name="CRTC"/>[[Telegram]]s were sent through networks built by [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]] and [[Canadian National]].

In 1868 Montreal Telegraph began facing competition from the newly established Dominion Telegraph Company.<ref name="canencyclo"/> 1880 saw the Great North Western Telegraph Company established to connect Ontario and Manitoba but within a year it was taken over by Western Union, leading briefly to that company's control of almost all telegraphy in Canada.<ref name="canencyclo"/>  In 1882, Canadian Pacific transmitted its first commercial telegram over telegraph lines they had erected alongside its tracks,<ref name="CPRail"/> breaking Western Union's monopoly. Great North Western Telegraph, facing bankruptcy, was taken over in 1915 by Canadian Northern.<ref name="canencyclo"/>

By the end of [[World War II]], Canadians communicated by telephone, more than any other country.<ref>{{cite web|url=|title=Canada Says Hello: The FIrst Century of the Telephone |publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=2012-03-10}}</ref>  In 1967 the CP and CN networks were merged to form [[CNCP Telecommunications]].

As of 1951, approximately 7000 messages were sent daily from the United States to Canada.<ref name="wutr1951"/>  An agreement with [[Western Union]] required that U.S. company to route messages in a specified ratio of 3:1, with three telegraphic messages transmitted to Canadian National for every message transmitted to Canadian Pacific.<ref name="wutr1951"/> The agreement was complicated by the fact that some Canadian destinations were served by only one of the two networks.<ref name="wutr1951"/>
