A '''boat''' is a [[watercraft]] of any size designed to float or [[Planing (boat)|plane]], to [[boating|work or travel on water]]. For small boats, this is typically inland ([[lake]]s) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the [[whaleboat]] were designed to be operated from a [[ship]] in an offshore environment. In [[Navy|naval]] terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as 1000-foot bulk freighters on the Great Lakes are called [[lake freighter|oreboats]].

Boats come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and construction due to intended purpose, available materials and local traditions. [[Canoe]] type boats have a long history and various versions are used throughout the world for transportation, fishing or sport. [[Fishing boat]]s vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. [[Pleasure boat]]s represent a less practical approach, including [[ski boat]]s, [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon boats]], [[sailboat]]s. [[House boat]]s may be a vacation or provide long-term housing. Small boats also provide transport or move cargo ([[lightering]]) from large ships. [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|Lifeboat]]s are an important safety measure.

==Types==
{{main|List of boat types}}
[[Image:Tug Boat NY 1.jpg|right|thumb|A [[tug boat]] is used for towing or pushing other, larger [[Ship|vessels]].]]

Boats can be categorized into three types:
* Unpowered or human-powered boats. Unpowered boats include [[raft]]s and floats meant for one-way downstream travel. Human-powered boats include [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[gondola]]s and boats propelled by poles like a [[Punt (boat)|punt]].
* [[Sailboat]]s, which are boats propelled solely by means of [[sail]]s.
* [[Motorboat]]s, which are boats propelled by mechanical means, such as engines.
** ''Ski boats'' are specialized motorboats specifically designed to safely [[towing|tow]] one or more [[water ski]]ers.  This is achieved by using a high-[[horsepower]], marinized [[automobile engine]], usually positioned in the midsection and driven through a direct drive to the propeller. A skier is pulled on a towrope attached to a tow bar located in front of the drive motor and affixed to the bottom of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]].  Each approved towboat must meet or exceed a preset set of standards defined by the USA Water Ski Federation, Formerly American Water Ski Association, AWSA.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Parts and terminology==
{{details|Glossary of nautical terms}}
[[Image:Oldboats.JPG|thumb|Aluminum [[flat-bottomed boat]]s ashore for storage]]
Several key components make up the main structure of most boats. The [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the main structural component of the boat which actually provides buoyancy for the boat. Also there is the [[Gunnel (ship element)|gunnel]] which is the sides of the boat. They offer protection from the water and makes the boat harder to sink. The roughly horizontal, but chambered structures spanning the hull of the boat are referred to as the deck. In a ship there are often several decks, but a boat is unlikely to have more than one, if any at all. Above the deck are the [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructures]]. The underside of a deck is the deck head.

An enclosed space on a boat is referred to as a cabin. Several structures make up a cabin: the similar but usually lighter structure which spans a raised cabin is a coach-roof. The "floor" of a cabin is properly known as the sole, but is more likely to be called the floor (a floor is properly, a structural member which ties a frame to the keelson and keel). The vertical surfaces dividing the internal space are bulkheads.

The [[keel]] is a lengthwise structural member to which the frames are fixed (sometimes referred to as a backbone).

The front (or fore end) of a boat is called the bow. Boats of earlier times often featured a [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] protruding from the front of the bows. The rear (or aft end) of the boat is called the stern. The right side (facing forward) is starboard and the left side is port.

== Building materials ==
{{see also|Boat building}}

[[Image:DerelictBoatFollyIs.jpg|thumb|upright|Derelict|A ship's [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]], built of steel, rusting away in the wetlands of [[Folly Island]], [[South Carolina]], [[United States]].]]
Until the mid-19th century most boats were of all natural materials; primarily wood although [[Reed (plant)|reed]], bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the [[birch bark]] [[canoe]], the animal hide-covered [[kayak]] and [[coracle]] and the [[dugout canoe]] made from a single log.

Bill Streever describes a boat made by the native [[Inupiat people]] in [[Barrow, Alaska]] as "a skin boat, an ''umiaq'', built from the stitched hides of [[bearded seal]]s and used to hunt [[bowhead whale]]s in the open-water leads during spring...".<ref>{{cite book |last= Streever |first= Bill |title= Cold: Adventures in the World's Frozen Places |location= New York |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |year= 2009 |page= 154}}</ref>

By the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French as Ferciment. This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered ([[trowell]]ed) over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure, it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode. These materials and methods were copied all over the world, and have faded in and out of popularity to the present. As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the [[Bessemer process]] ([[patent]]ed in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built of all steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses, even the fishing fleets. Private recreational boats in steel are uncommon. In the mid-20th century [[aluminium]] gained popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, there are now aluminium alloys available that will not corrode in salt water, and an aluminium boat built to similar load carrying standards could be built lighter than steel.
[[Image:Boating in fair weather.jpg|thumb|left|A wooden boat operating near shore]]
Around the mid-1960s, boats made  of [[glass-reinforced plastic]], more commonly known as [[fibreglass]], became popular, especially for recreational boats. The [[United States Coast Guard]] refers to such boats as 'FRP' (for fibre-reinforced plastic) boats.

Fibreglass boats are strong, and do not rust (iron oxide), corrode, or rot. They are, however susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. Fibreglass provides structural strength, especially when long woven strands are laid, sometimes from bow to stern, and then soaked in epoxy or polyester resin to form the hull of the boat. Whether hand laid or built in a mould, FRP boats usually have an outer coating of [[gelcoat]] which is a thin solid colored layer of polyester resin that adds no structural strength, but does create a smooth surface which can be buffed to a high shine and also acts as a protective layer against sunlight. FRP structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the FRP encloses a lightweight core such as balsa or foam. Cored FRP is most often found in decking which helps keep down weight that will be carried above the waterline. The addition of wood makes the cored structure of the boat susceptible to rotting which puts a greater emphasis on not allowing damaged sandwich structures to go unrepaired. Plastic based foam cores are less vulnerable. The phrase 'advanced composites' in FRP construction may indicate the addition of carbon fibre, [[Kevlar]] or other similar materials, but it may also indicate other methods designed to introduce less expensive and, by at least one [[yacht]] surveyor's eyewitness accounts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yachtsurvey.com/Fiberglass_Boats.htm |title=Are They Fiberglass Boats Anymore? by David Pascoe, Marine Surveyor |publisher=Yachtsurvey.com |date=2000-01-12 |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref> less structurally sound materials.

Cold moulding is similar to FRP in as much as it involves the use of epoxy or polyester resins, but the structural component is wood instead of fibreglass. In cold moulding very thin strips of wood are laid over a form or mould in layers. This layer is then coated with resin and another directionally alternating layer is laid on top. In some processes the subsequent layers are stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous layers, but in other processes the layers are weighted or even vacuum bagged to hold layers together while the resin sets. Layers are built up thus to create the required thickness of hull.

People have even made their own boats or watercraft out of materials such as [[Extruded polystyrene|foam]] or plastic, but most homebuilts today are built of plywood and either painted or covered in a layer of fibreglass and resin.

==Propulsion==
{{See also|Marine propulsion}}
The most common means of boat propulsion are:
[[Image:Jiajing Emperor on his state barge.jpg|thumb|[[Ming Dynasty]] Chinese painting of the [[Wanli Emperor]] enjoying a boat ride on a river with an entourage of guards and courtiers]]
* Human power ([[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[Watercraft paddling|paddling]], [[setting pole]] etc.)
* Wind power ([[Sails|sail]]ing)
* Engine powered [[propeller]]s
** [[Inboard motor|Inboard]]
** [[Stern drive|Inboard/Outboard]] (sterndrive)
** [[Outboard motor|Outboard]]
** [[Paddle steamer|Paddle wheel]]
** Water jet ([[personal water craft]], [[jetboat]])
** Air fans ([[hovercraft]], [[air boat]])

An early uncommon means of boat propulsion was the [[water caterpillar]].  This moved a series of paddles on chains along the bottom of the boat to propel it over the water and preceded the development of [[tracked vehicle]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bonnier Corporation|title=The Caterpillar Is Now Being Applied to Ships|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68|series=Popular Science|date=December 1918|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|page=68}}</ref>

==Buoyancy==
{{see also|Buoyancy}}

A floating boat [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] its weight in water. The material of the boat hull may be denser than water, but if this is the case then it forms only the outer layer. If the boat floats, the mass of the boat (plus contents) ''as a whole'' divided by the volume ''below the waterline'' is equal to the [[density]] of water (1&nbsp;kg/l). If weight is added to the boat, the volume below the waterline will increase to keep the weight balance equal, and so the boat sinks a little to compensate.
