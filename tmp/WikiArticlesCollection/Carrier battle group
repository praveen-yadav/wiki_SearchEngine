A '''carrier battle group''' ('''CVBG''') consists of an [[aircraft carrier]] (designated CV) and its escorts, together comprising the group. The first naval task forces built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II. The Imperial Japanese Navy, IJN, was the first to assemble a large number of carriers into a single task force, known as [[Kido Butai]]. This task force was used with devastating effect during the [[Pearl Harbor Attack]]. [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]]. In contrast, the United States Navy deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own cruiser and destroyer escorts. These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway. By 1943 however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers. These carrier groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle force of the U.S. Fifth and Third Fleets.

With the construction of the large supercarriers of the Cold War era, the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived. During the [[Cold War]], the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and Europe, while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task. Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely. However, a primary mission of the Soviet Navy's [[attack submarine]]s was to track every ailied CVBG and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers. Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.

[[File:HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}, which took part in the [[Falklands War]].]]
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, most of the uses of CVBGs by the United States as well as that of other nations have been in situations in which their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces.

===Carriers in the 1956 Suez Crisis===
British and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].

===Carriers in the 1982 Falklands War===
During the [[Cold War]], an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using a large number of [[antiship missile]]s.

The first attempted use of antiship missiles against a carrier battle group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]]. Interestingly, this was the last conflict so far in which two belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], originally built in [[Great Britain]].

===Lebanon===
The [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].

===Gulf of Sidra===
Carrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the "[[Line of Death]]" proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].

===Libya===
During the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[French Navy]] deployed its aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, off [[Libya]]. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' was accompanied by several frigates as {{ship|French frigate|Forbin|D620|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Dupleix|D641|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Aconit|F 713|2}}, the replenishment tanker ''[[Durance-class tanker|Meuse]]'' and two {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} nuclear attack submarines.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=6007194&c=EUR&s=AIR</ref>

==The U.S. Navy Battle Groups==

===Carrier strike group===
[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|right|The USS ''George Washington'' [[Carrier Strike Group]] sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006. Such a formation, referred to derisively as the "bullseye" formation, would not be used in combat.]]
In [[modern United States Navy carrier air operations]], [[Carrier strike group]] (CSG) has replaced the traditional term of carrier battle group (CVBG or CARBATGRU). The Navy maintains 11 carrier strike groups, 9 of which are based in the United States and one that is forward deployed in Japan. CSG or CVBG normally consist of 1 Aircraft Carrier, 2 Guided Missile Cruisers, 2 Anti Aircraft Warships, and 1-2 Anti Submarine Destroyers or Frigates.<ref>{{cite web|author=This story was written by USS George Washington Public Affairs |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=39259 |title=USS George Washington Departs for Japan |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> The large number of CSGs used by the United States reflects, in part, a division of roles and missions allotted during the Cold War, in which the United States assumed primary responsibility for [[blue-water navy|blue water]] operations and for safeguarding supply lines between the United States and [[Europe]], while the [[NATO]] allies assumed responsibility for [[brown-water navy|brown]] and [[green-water navy|green water]] operations.

===Expeditionary Strike Group===
An [[Expeditionary Strike Group]] is composed of an [[Amphibious Assault Ship]] (LHA/LHD), a [[Dock Landing Ship]] (LSD), an [[Amphibious transport dock]] (LPD), a Marine expeditionary unit, AV-8B Harrier II aircraft, CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters and CH-46E Sea Knight helicopters or, more recently, MV-22B tiltrotors. [[Cruisers]], [[destroyers]] and attack [[submarines]] are deployed with either an Expeditionary Strike Group.

===Battleship battle group===
During the period when the American navy recommissioned all four of its {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s, it sometimes used a similar formation centered on a [[battleship]], referred to as a '''battleship battle group''' (BBBG). It was alternately referred to as a Surface Action Group (SAG).

The Battleship battle group, typically consisted of one modernized battleship, one {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser}}, one {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer}} or {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|2}}, one {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|2}}, three {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate}}s and one support ship, such as a fleet oiler.<ref>Lightbody and Poyer, pp. 338–339.</ref>

==Carrier battle groups==

===Chinese carrier battle groups===
C4 Type 052C/Type 052D destroyers,
2 Type 052B destroyers,
2-4 Type 054A frigates,
1-2 Type 093 Shang nuclear submarine and
1 supply ship

===British carrier battle groups===
The [[Royal Navy]] did maintain two task forces concurrently (one based on an aircraft carrier and one based on an Amphibious Command Ship). At least one task group would be deployed at any one time. There is currently one {{sclass-|Invincible|aircraft carrier}} in operation with the Royal Navy although due to the retirement of the [[BAE Harrier]] it will serve as a [[helicopter carrier]], the other two are now [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]]. The Royal Navy also utilises the [[HMS Ocean (L12)|''Ocean''-class]] [[Landing Platform, Helicopter|LPH]] as well as the two {{sclass-|Albion|landing platform dock|0}} [[Amphibious transport dock|LPDs]] as Amphibious Command Ships at the centre of a task group.
The two new {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier}}s are currently under construction and will operate the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]], replacing the aging ''Invincible'' class in 2019.

===French carrier battle groups===
The only serving French carrier is the {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, which also serves as the flagship of the Marine Nationale.

The Carrier Battle Group (Groupe Aéronaval, GAN, in French) of the [[Force d'Action Navale]] is usually composed, in addition to the aircraft carrier, of :
*a [[carrier air wing]] (Groupe Aérien Embarqué, GAE, in French), a complement composed of about 60 aircraft :
**[[Dassault Rafale|Rafale F3]] and [[Dassault Super Étendard|Super Étendard]] (up to 30)
**[[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] (2)
**[[Eurocopter Dauphin|SA365 Dauphin]] (3) for RESCO and [[Eurocopter EC725|EC725 Caracal]] for CSAR (2)
*one {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine}}
*two anti-submarine destroyers (currently {{sclass-|Tourville|frigate|5}} or {{sclass-|Georges Leygues|frigate|4}})
*one or two anti-air destroyers ({{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|5}} or {{sclass-|Cassard|frigate|4}})
*one stealth frigate in forward patrol (usually a {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}})
*one supply ship

This group is commanded by a rear admiral ([[Counter Admiral|contre-amiral]], in French) on board the aircraft carrier. The commanding officer of the air group (usually a capitaine de frégate—equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains.

===Italian carrier battle group===
The CVS–ASW (Aircraft Carrier with Anti-Submarine Warfare) {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Giuseppe Garibaldi|551|6}} is Italy's first carrier. The battle group based in Taranto called COMFORAL is formed by the carrier ''Giuseppe Garibaldi'', two {{sclass-|Durand de la Penne|destroyer}}s, two support ships ''Etna'' and ''Elettra'', and three amphibious/support ships (''San Giusto'', ''San Marco'' and ''San Giorgio'').

After 2010 the Italian battle group will be formed by the new carrier {{ship|Italian aircraft carrier|Cavour|550|6}}, 5-6 new warships (including destroyers ''Horizon'' and frigates FREMM), one new support ship, some minehunters and new submarines (the COMFORAL will be a reserve group).<ref>[http://www.camera.it/cartellecomuni/leg15/RapportoAttivitaCommissioni/commissioni/allegati/04/04_all_appnavi.pdf New ships of the Italian battle group (in Italian)]</ref>

===Spanish carrier battle group===
The Spanish Navy currently operates the Buque de Proyección Estratégica (Strategic Projection Vessel) {{ship|Spanish ship|Juan Carlos I|L61|6}}, which can be used as a light aircraft carrier.<ref name="nameoftheship">{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/bpe-program.htm |title=Juan Carlos I Strategic Projection Vessel - Program|accessdate=02-11-2012 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2011-11-15 |publisher=globalsecurity.org }}</ref>

The group includes two escort squadrons: the 41st, with ASW {{sclass-|Santa María|frigate}}s, and the 31st, with [[Aegis Combat System|AEGIS]] {{sclass-|Álvaro de Bazán|frigate|0}} AAW frigates.

===Indian carrier battle group===
The centrepiece of the Indian carrier battle group is currently the {{INS|Viraat}}, an updated ''Centaur''-class light carrier originally built for the Royal Navy as {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}}, which was laid down in 1944 and commissioned in 1959. It was purchased by India in 1986. India will commission a second aircraft carrier, {{INS|Vikramaditya}}, in 2012 and will follow this with a third carrier, [[Vikrant-class aircraft carrier|INS ''Vikrant 2'']], in 2015. Whilst INS ''Vikramaditya'' is a former Soviet {{sclass-|Kiev|aircraft carrier}}, the {{ship|Soviet aircraft carrier|Admiral Gorshkov||2}}, the ''Vikrant'' will be the first indigenous Indian aircraft carrier. India eventually will have 3 Carrier battle groups by 2017 (''Viraat'', ''Vikramaditya'', ''Vikrant 2'').<ref>[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/brand-new-indian-navy-with-long-legs-by-2027-verma/208124-3.html Brand new Indian Navy with long legs by 2027: Admiral Verma]</ref><ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-08/rest-of-world/27886608_1_carrier-battle-aircraft-carrier-admiral-gorshkov Carrier battle groups will add muscle to Navy power]</ref>

The [[Indian Navy]]'s CBG usually consists of two destroyers (usually of the {{sclass-|Delhi|destroyer|4}}, previously {{sclass-|Kashin|destroyer|5}}s were used) and two or more frigates, (usually a combination of {{sclass-|Brahmaputra|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Talwar|frigate|5}} or {{sclass-|Shivalik|frigate|4}}es) and one support ship.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Russian carrier battle group===
The sole Russian aircraft carrier, the {{ship|Russian aircraft carrier|Admiral Kuznetsov||2}} is rarely out to sea. Of the few sorties the carrier has conducted, most have been solo missions and without a large escort. However, the ''Kuznetsov'' has been observed sailing together with a {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|0}} cruiser (CGN), {{sclass-|Slava|cruiser}} (CG), {{sclass-|Sovremenny|destroyer|2}} (ASuW), {{sclass-|Udaloy|destroyer|2}} (ASW) and [[Krivak-class frigate|''Krivak'' I/II FFG (ASW)]]. These escorts, especially the heavily armed ''Kirov''-class cruiser, use advanced sensors and carry a variety of weaponry. However, ships like the ''Kirov'' would likely be used in offensive operations rather than fleet escort in the event of war. Carrier escort would then be conducted by smaller vessels such as a ''Slava'' class accompanied by several ''Sovremenny'', ''Udaloy'' and ''Krivak'' vessels.

The ''Admiral Kuznetsov'' is designed specifically to sail alone and carries greater firepower than its U.S. counterparts. This includes 12x SS-N-19 'Shipwreck' (long range, high speed, sea-skimming) SSMs, 24x VLS units loaded with 192 SA-N-9 'Gauntlet' SAMs, and 8x Kashtan CIWS with dual 30&nbsp;mm guns, and 8x AK-630 CIWS. Compared to the 4x Phalanx CIWS and 4x Sea Sparrow launchers, each with 6 missiles carried by the ''Nimitz'' class, the ''Kuznetsov'' is well armed for both air-defence and offensive operations against hostile shipping.

===Brazilian carrier battle group===
The {{ship|Brazilian aircraft carrier|São Paulo|A12|2}} forms Brazil's only carrier battle group, together with 4 frigates from Type-22/1 class frigates and Vosper Mk.10 class frigates (known as the {{sclass-|Niteroi|frigate|4}}), 1 or 2 {{sclass-|Tupi|submarine|2}}s, and one replenishment oiler ({{ship|Brazilian tanker|Almirante Gastão Motta|G23|2}}), with VF-1 "Falcão" Air Wing equipped with 6 to 9 Attack Aircraft AF-1 Skyhawk (A-4Ku), and 3 more Helicopters Squadrons for Attack, ASW and Multi-Mission (between AS332 Super Puma, AS532 Cougar, Super Lynx, Esquilo, EC 725 (16 ordered) SH-3 (being replaced by 6 new SH-60B)) and 2 more Fixed Wings Squadrons for AEW, COD and REVO (C-1A Trader and S-2 Tracker ordered). The ''São Paulo'' was formerly the {{sclass-|Clemenceau|aircraft carrier|0}} {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Foch|R_99|2}}, a design used by the French Navy until 1997.

===Thai carrier battle group===
{{ship|HTMS|Chakri Naruebet||6}} is Thailand's only aircraft carrier, and is based upon the {{ship|Spanish aircraft carrier|Príncipe de Asturias||2}} of the Spanish Navy.  The Thai Navy no longer operates Harrier fighters.  Escorts if it were to be deployed for non-humanitarian missions would likely consist of the mostly Chinese and US supplied frigates found in the Thai fleet.  It is not clear that the Thai navy has plans or ability to use the ''Chakri Naruebet'' in any fleet or power projection missions.

==Underway replenishment==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Reagan CSG 060520-N-7130B-135.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Ronald Reagan'' conducting underway replenishment at same time as an ''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyer]] -->
Since its origins, the viability of the carrier battle group has been dependent on its ability to remain at sea for extended periods. Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fuelling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.

==Debate on future viability==
There is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched firepower and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] flight and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as CEC ([[cooperative engagement capability]]), DEW technology and missile technology.

However, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.

The [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] (GWOT) has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed. This precedent was established during [[World War II]] in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] and still remains viable today.

Regardless of the debate over viability, the United States has made a major investment in the development of a new carrier class—the {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier|}}s (formerly designated CVN-X, or the X Carrier)—to replace the existing {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier}}s. The new ''Ford''-class carriers are designed to be modular and are easily adaptable as technology and equipment needed on board changes.<ref>GlobalSecurity.org - http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvx.htm</ref>
