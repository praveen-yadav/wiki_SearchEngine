'''Christine Lavin''' (born  January 2, 1952) is a [[New York City]]-based [[singer-songwriter]] and promoter of contemporary [[folk music]].  She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name [[Four Bitchin' Babes]].  She has also put together several compilation albums of contemporary folk artists, including her latest ''Just One Angel'', 22 singer/songwriters singing Christmas/Hanukah/Solstice/New Year's songs including actor [[Jeff Daniels]], Grammy-winners [[Janis Ian]] and [[Julie Gold]], and the Guitar Man Of Central Park [[David Ippolito]].

She is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. Many of her songs alternate between emotional reflections on romance and outright comedy. Two of her more famous songs are "Sensitive New Age Guys" and "Bald Headed Men".

One of Lavin's songs, "Regretting What I Said to You When You Called Me 11:00 On a Friday Morning to Tell Me that at 1:00 Friday Afternoon You're Gonna Leave Your Office, Go Downstairs, Hail a Cab to Go Out to the Airport to Catch a Plane to Go Skiing in the Alps for Two Weeks, Not that I Wanted to Go With You, I Wasn't Able to Leave Town, I'm Not a Very Good Skier, I Couldn't Expect You to Pay My Way, But After Going Out With You for Three Years I DON'T Like Surprises!! Subtitled: A Musical Apology" is notable for having the longest known song title.<ref>[http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_longest_song_title What is the longest song title?]</ref> It is the eighth song on her 1984 album ''Future Fossils'', and is 3:04 (3 minutes and 4 seconds) long.

In her youth, Lavin was a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] in [[Peekskill, New York]], and she still has impressive baton-twirling skills; she often ends a concert by twirling a glow-in-the-dark [[Baton (twirling)|baton]] with the house lights turned off as she leaves the stage.

Lavin worked at [[Caffe Lena]] in Saratoga, New York, until [[Dave Van Ronk]] convinced her to move to New York City and make a career as a singer-songwriter. She followed his advice and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. She has lived in the City ever since.

Lavin was the original host of ''Sunday Breakfast'' on [[WFUV]] in New York City.

Lavin was a founding member of the [[Four Bitchin' Babes]] when they were formed in 1990.

In recent years Lavin has been known to host knitting circles before her shows, inviting any knitters, hookers (people who crochet), or other crafters to join her.
