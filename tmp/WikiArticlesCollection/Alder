'''Alder''' is the common name of a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s ('''''Alnus''''') belonging to the birch [[family (biology)|family]] [[Betulaceae]]. The genus comprises about 30 [[species]] of [[Plant sexual morphology|monoecious]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s, a few reaching a large size, distributed throughout the [[Temperate climate|north temperate zone]].

== Etymology ==

The common name "alder" evolved from Old English "alor", which in turn is derived from [[Proto-Germanic]] root [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=alder&allowed_in_frame=0] aliso. The generic name ''Alnus'' is the equivalent [[Latin]] name. Both the Latin and the Germanic words derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''el-'', meaning "red" or "brown", which is also a root for the English words "[[Elk (disambiguation)|elk]]" and another tree: "[[elm]]", a tree distantly related to the alders.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=elk&allowed_in_frame=0].

== Description ==

With a few exceptions, alders are [[deciduous]], and the leaves are alternate, simple, and [[serration|serrated]]. The [[flower]]s are [[catkin]]s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by bees to a small extent. These trees differ from the [[birch]]es (''Betula'', the other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many [[conifer cone]]s.

The largest species are [[red alder]] (''A. rubra'') on the west coast of North America, and [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]] (''A. glutinosa''), [[native plant|native]] to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching over 30 m. By contrast, the widespread ''[[Alnus viridis]]'' (green alder) is rarely more than a 5-m-tall shrub.

== Ecology ==

Alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on alders|butterflies and moths]].

''A. glutinosa'' and ''A. viridis'' are classed as environmental weeds in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clayson|first=Howell|title=Consolidated list of environmental weeds in New Zealand|publisher=Department of Conservation|location=Wellington|date=May 2008|isbn=978-0-478-14412-3}}</ref>

=== Nitrogen fixation ===

Alder is particularly noted for its important [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with ''[[Frankia alni]]'', an [[actinomycete]], [[Filamentation|filamentous]], nitrogen-fixing [[bacteria|bacterium]]. This bacterium is found in [[root nodule]]s, which may be as large as a human fist, with many small lobes, and light brown in colour. The bacterium absorbs [[nitrogen]] from the air and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with [[sugar]]s, which it produces through [[photosynthesis]]. As a result of this mutually beneficial relationship, alder improves the [[Fertility (soil)|fertility]] of the [[soil]] where it grows, and as a [[pioneer species]], it helps provide additional nitrogen for the [[Ecological succession|successional]] species which follow.

=== Parasites ===

Alder roots are parasitized by [[Boschniakia rossica| northern groundcone]].

== Uses ==
[[File:Wappen at grossarl.png|thumb|right|Alder coat of arms of [[Grossarl]], [[Austria]]]]

The [[catkin]]s of some alder species have a degree of edibility,<ref name="Edible Alder Catkins">[http://www.pfaf.org/user/DatabaseSearhResult.aspx Plants For A Future (Database)]</ref> and may be rich in protein. Reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste, they are more useful for survival purposes. The wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items, especially salmon and other seafood.

Most of the pilings that form the foundation of Venice were made from alder trees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/mythfolk/alder.html|title=Mythology and Folklore of the Alder|last=Kendall|first=Paul|date=25 August 2010|publisher=Trees for life|accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>

Alder bark contains the anti-inflammatory [[salicin]], which is metabolized into [[salicylic acid]] in the body.<ref>Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref> Native Americans used red alder bark ''([[Alnus rubra]])'' to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations.  Blackfeet Indians used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis.  Recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains [[betulin]] and [[lupeol]], compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors.<ref>Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, ISBN 0-87842-359-1</ref>

The inner bark of the alder, as well as red osier dogwood, or chokecherry, was also used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in their smoking mixtures, known as ''kinnikinnick'', to improve the taste of the [[bearberry]] leaf.<ref>Staff (2009) [http://lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=1355 "Bearberry"] ''Discovering Lewis and Clark''  The Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan Foundation</ref>

Alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the Austrian town of [[Grossarl]].

Electric guitars, most notably the [[Fender Jazz Bass]], [[Fender Precision Bass]], [[Fender Stratocaster]] and [[Fender Telecaster]], have been built with alder bodies since the 1950s.  Alder is appreciated for its claimed tight and even balanced tone, especially when compared to mahogany, and has been adopted by many electric guitar manufacturers.

As a hardwood, alder is used in making furniture, cabinets, and other woodworking products. For example, in the television series ''[[Northern Exposure]]'' 1992 season 3 episode "Things Become Extinct", Native American Ira Wingfeather makes duck [[flute]]s out of Alder tree branches while [[Ed Chigliak]] films.
