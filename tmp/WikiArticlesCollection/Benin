'''Benin''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Benin.ogg|b|ɨ|ˈ|n|iː|n}} ({{lang-fr|Bénin}}, formerly '''Dahomey'''), officially the '''Republic of Benin''' ({{lang-fr|République du Bénin}}), is a country in [[West Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Togo]] to the west, by [[Nigeria]] to the east and by [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]] to the north. A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the [[Bight of Benin]].<ref>R. H. Hughes, J. S. Hughes. A directory of African wetlands, p. 301. IUCN, 1992. ISBN 2-88032-949-3</ref> The capital of Benin is [[Porto-Novo]], but the [[seat of government]] is in [[Cotonou]], the country's largest city. Benin covers an area of approximately 110,000 square kilometers (42,000 sq mi), with a population of approximately 9.05 million. Benin is a [[tropical]], [[sub-Saharan]] nation, highly dependent on [[agriculture]], with substantial employment and income arising from [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]].<ref>[http://www.fao.org/isfp/country-information/benin/en/ "Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations"]. United Nations, June 29th, 2010</ref>

The [[official language]] of Benin is [[French language|French]]. However, indigenous languages such as [[Fon language|Fon]] and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] are commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is [[Roman Catholicism]], followed closely by [[Islam]], [[Vodun]] and [[Protestants|Protestantism]]. Benin is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]], the [[African Petroleum Producers Association]] and the [[Niger Basin Authority]].<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Benin-INTERNATIONAL-COOPERATION.html "Benin – International Cooperation"]. Nation Encyclopedia (2010-06-29).</ref>

From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] along with the city-state of [[Porto-Novo]] and a large area with many different tribes to the north. This region was referred to as the [[Slave Coast]] from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. After slavery was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France, and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments, many military coups and military governments.

A [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] [[Sovereign state|state]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed between 1972 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the current [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] Republic of Benin.<ref name="Ibp Usa p85">Ibp Usa.

During the colonial period and at independence, the country was [[Geographical renaming|known as]] '''Dahomey'''. It was renamed on November 30, 1975, to '''Benin'''<ref>Annamarie Rowe. A political chronology of Africa, p. 33. Taylor & Francis, 2001. ISBN 1-85743-116-2</ref>  after the body of water on which the country lies – the [[Bight of Benin]] – which, in turn, had been named after the [[Benin Empire]]. The country of Benin has no connection to [[Benin City]] in modern Nigeria, nor to the [[Benin bronzes]].

The new name, Benin, was chosen for its neutrality. Dahomey was the name of the former [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], which covered only most of the southern third of the present country and therefore did not represent [[Porto-Novo]] (a rival state in the south), the northwestern sector [[Atakora]], nor the kingdom of [[Borgu]], which covered the northeastern third.<ref>Bonnie G.

{{History of Benin}}
{{main|History of Benin}}
===Precolonial history===
The current country of Benin combines three areas which had different political and ethnic systems prior to French colonial control. Before 1700, there were a few important city states along the coast (primarily of the Aja ethnic group, but also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples) and a mass of tribal regions inland (composed of Bariba, Mahi, Gedevi, and Kabye peoples). The [[Oyo Empire]], located primarily to the east of modern Benin, was the most significant large-scale military force in the region and it would regularly conduct raids and exact tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions.<ref name=Bay-1998>{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virigina Press}}</ref> The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], which was of the Fon ethnicity, was founded on the [[Abomey]] plateau and began taking over areas along the coast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Akinjogbin|first=I.A.|title=Dahomey and Its Neighbors: 1708-1818|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|oclc=469476592|ref=harv}}</ref> By 1727, king [[Agaja]] of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of [[Allada]] and [[Whydah]], but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of [[Porto-Novo]].<ref name=Law-1986>{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=Dahomey and the Slave Trade: Reflections on the Historiography of the Rise of Dahomey|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1986|volume=27|issue=2|pages=237–267}}</ref> The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey, the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo, and the continued tribal politics of the northern region.

[[File:Armed women with the King at their head, going to war-1793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dahomey Amazons]] with the King at their head, going to war-1793]] 

The [[Dahomey|Dahomey Kingdom]] was known for its culture and traditions. Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers, and taught the kingdom's military customs until they were old enough to join the army.<ref>Robert Harms. The Diligent: Worlds Of The Slave Trade, p. 172. Basic Books, 2002. ISBN 0-465-02872-1</ref> Dahomey was also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corps, called [[Ahosi]] or "our mothers" in the [[Fongbe]] language, and known by many Europeans as the Dahomean [[Amazons]]. This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of "black [[Sparta]]" from European observers and 19th century explorers like [[Sir Richard Burton]].<ref>Stanley B. Alpern. Amazons of Black Sparta: the women warriors of Dahomey, p. 37. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 1998. ISBN 1-85065-362-3</ref>

The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into transatlantic slavery;<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,91575,00.html African Ambassador Apologizes for Slavery Role]. FOXNews.com. July 10, 2003.</ref> otherwise the captives would have been killed in a ceremony known as the [[The annual customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]]. By about 1750, the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated £250,000 per year by selling Africans to the European slave-traders.<ref name="dahomey">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/9chapter2.shtml African Slave Owners]. the story of South Africa | BBC World Service.</ref> Though the leaders of Dahomey appeared initially to resist the slave trade, it flourished in the region of Dahomey for almost three hundred years (beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] merchants), leading to the area being named "the Slave Coast". Court protocols, which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's many battles be decapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area. The number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Patrick|title=Slavery, Colonialism and Economic Growth in Dahomey, 1640-1960|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London}}</ref>  The decline was partly due to the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|banning]] of the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] by Britain and other countries.<ref name="dahomey"/> This decline continued until 1885, when the last slave ship departed from the coast of the present-day Benin Republic bound for Brazil.

===Colonial period (1900 until 1958)===
By the middle of the nineteenth century, Dahomey started to lose its status as the regional power. This enabled the French to take over the area in 1892. In 1899, the French included the land called [[French Dahomey]] within the [[French West Africa]] colony. In 1958, France granted autonomy to the [[Republic of Dahomey]], and full independence as of August 1, 1960. The president who led them to independence was Hubert Maga.<ref>Jamie Stokes.

===Post-colonial period===
For the next twelve years, ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence. There were several coups and regime changes, with four figures dominating — [[Hubert Maga]], [[Sourou Migan Apithy|Sourou Apithy]], [[Justin Ahomadegbé]] and [[Emile Derlin Zinsou]] — the first three representing a different area and ethnicity of the country. These three agreed to form a [[Presidential Council (Benin)|Presidential Council]] after violence marred the 1970 elections.

On May 7, 1972, Maga turned over power to Ahomadegbe. On October 26, 1972, Lt. Col. [[Mathieu Kérékou]] overthrew the ruling triumvirate, becoming president and stating that the country will not "burden itself by copying foreign [[ideology]], and wants neither Capitalism, Communism, nor Socialism". On November 30, however, he announced that the country was officially [[Marxism|Marxist]], under the control of the Military Council of the Revolution (CNR), which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks. On November 30, 1975, he renamed the country to the '''[[People's Republic of Benin]]'''.<ref name="Dickovick2012">{{cite book|author=J.

[[File:Mathieu Kérékou 2006Feb10.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mathieu Kérékou]] in 2006]]
In 1979, the CNR was dissolved, and Kérékou arranged [[show election]]s where he was the only allowed candidate. Establishing relations with the [[People's Republic of China]], [[North Korea]], and [[Libya]], he put nearly all businesses and economic activities under state control, causing foreign investment in Benin to dry up.<ref name="kneib">{{Cite book|title=Benin|author=Martha Kneib|pages=22–25|isbn=0-7614-2328-1}}</ref> Kérékou attempted to reorganize education, pushing his own aphorisms such as "Poverty is not a fatality", resulting in a mass [[emigration|exodus]] of teachers, along with a large number of other professionals.<ref name="kneib"/> The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste first from the Soviet Union and later from France.<ref name="kneib"/>

In 1980, Kérékou converted to [[Islam]] and changed his first name to Ahmed, then changed his name back after claiming to be a [[born-again Christian]].

In 1989, riots broke out after the regime did not have money to pay its army. The banking system collapsed. Eventually Kérékou renounced [[Marxism]] and a convention forced Kérékou to release political prisoners and arrange elections.<ref name="kneib"/> [[Marxism-Leninism]] was also abolished as the nation's form of government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socialist.net/history-people-s-republic-of-benin.htm |title=A short history of the People's Republic of Benin (1974–1990) |publisher=Socialist.net |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

The name of the country was officially changed to the '''Republic of Benin''' on March 1, 1990, once the newly formed country's [[constitution]] was complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flagspot.net/flags/bj.html |title=Benin |publisher=Flagspot.net|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

In 1991, Kérékou was defeated by [[Nicéphore Soglo]], and became the first black African president to step down after an election. Kérékou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote. In 2001, a closely fought election resulted in Kérékou winning another term, after which his opponents claimed election irregularities.

In 1999, Kérékou issued a national apology for the central role Africans played in the Atlantic slave trade.<ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23gates.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Ending the Slavery Blame-Game ]". ''The New York Times''. April 22, 2010.</ref>

Kérékou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections, as both were barred by the constitution's restrictions on age and total terms of candidates. 

On March 5, 2006, an election was held that was considered free and fair. It resulted in a [[Two-round system|runoff]] between [[Yayi Boni]] and [[Adrien Houngbédji]]. The runoff election was held on March 19, and was won by Boni, who assumed office on April 6. The success of the fair multi-party elections in Benin won praise internationally.  Boni was [[Beninese presidential election, 2011|reelected in 2011]], taking 53.18% of the vote in the first round—enough to avoid a runoff election, becoming the first president to win an election without a runoff since the restoration of democracy in 1991.

{{main|Politics of Benin}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->

[[File:Parliament building of Benin, 2007.jpg|thumb|[[National Assembly of Benin]] in [[Cotonou]].]]
Benin's politics take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], where the [[President of Benin]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], within a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the legislature. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The political system is derived from the 1990 [[Constitution of Benin]] and the subsequent transition to [[democracy]] in 1991.

Benin scored highly in the 2009 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]], which comprehensively measures the state of governance across the continent. Benin was ranked 15th out of 53 African countries, and scored particularly well in the categories of Safety & Security and Participation & Human Rights.<ref>[http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/pressrelease/media-centre/press-releases/benin-ranks-15th-out-of-53-african-countries-in-latest-assessment-of-african-governance.html Benin ranks 15th out of 53 African countries in latest assessment of African Governance] Media release at [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]]</ref>

In its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked Benin 53rd out of 169 countries.

== Geography ==
[[File:Benin map.png|thumb|Map of Benin.]]
{{main|Geography of Benin|Climate of Benin}}

Benin, a narrow, north-south strip of land in west Africa, lies between the [[Equator]] and the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. Benin lies between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0°]] and [[4th meridian east|4°E]]. Benin is bounded by Togo to the west, [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Niger]] to the north, [[Nigeria]] to the east, and the [[Bight of Benin]] to the south.

With an area of {{convert|112622|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Benin extends from the [[Niger River]] in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the south, a distance of {{convert|650|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Although the coastline measures {{convert|121|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} the country measures about {{convert|325|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} at its widest point.

It is one of the smaller countries in West Africa, one-eighth the size of Nigeria, its neighbor to the east. It is, however, twice as large as [[Togo]], its neighbor to the west.

Benin shows little variation in elevation and can be divided into four areas from the south to the north, starting with the low-lying, sandy, coastal plain (highest elevation {{convert|10|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}) which is, at most, {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} wide. It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean. Behind the coast lies the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]]-covered plateaus of southern Benin (altitude between {{convert|20|and|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}), which are split by valleys running north to south along the [[Couffo River|Couffo]], [[Zou River|Zou]], and [[Oueme River]]s.

Then an area of flat lands dotted with rocky hills whose altitude seldom reaches {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} extends around Nikki and Save. Finally, a range of mountains extends along the northwest border and into Togo; this is the Atacora, with the highest point, [[Mont Sokbaro]], at {{convert|658|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Atakora Benin Batia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Atakora]], one of Benin's two northernmost departments.]]
Benin has fields of lying fallow, mangroves, and remnants of large sacred forests. In the rest of the country, the savanna is covered with thorny scrubs and dotted with huge [[baobab]] trees. Some forests line the banks of rivers. In the north and the northwest of Benin the [[W National Park|Reserve du W du Niger]] and [[Pendjari National Park]] attract tourists eager to see elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos, and monkeys.<ref name=bn>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm "Background Note: Benin"]. U.S. Department of State (June 2008). {{PD-notice}}</ref> Historically Benin has served as habitat for the [[endangered]] [[Painted Hunting Dog]], ''[[Lycaon pictus]]'';<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg]</ref> however, this canid is thought to have been locally extirpated.

Benin's climate is hot and humid. Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300&nbsp;mm or about 51&nbsp;inches. Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September. Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast. In [[Cotonou]], the average maximum temperature is {{convert|31|°C|1}}; the minimum is {{convert|24|°C|1}}.<ref name=bn/>

Variations in temperature increase when moving north through a [[savanna]] and plateau toward the Sahel. A dry wind from the Sahara called the [[Harmattan]] blows from December to March, during which grass dries up, the vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be overcast. It also is the season when farmers burn brush in the fields.<ref name=bn/>

== Economy ==
[[File:Gossypium sp MS4007.JPG|thumb|Cotton field in northern Benin.]]
{{main|Economy of Benin}}

The economy of Benin is dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Cotton accounts for 40 percent of GDP and roughly 80 percent of official export receipts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6761.htm |title=Background Note: Benin |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> Growth in real output has averaged around 5 percent in the past seven years, but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase. Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Benin uses the [[CFA franc]], which is pegged to the euro.

Benin’s economy has continued to strengthen over the past years, with real GDP growth estimated at 5.1 and 5.7 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The main driver of growth is the agricultural sector, with cotton being the country’s main export, while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP largely because of Benin’s geographical location, enabling trade, transportation, transit and tourism activities with its neighbouring states.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110513105544/http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html Benin: Financial Sector profile]. MFW4A.org</ref>

In order to raise growth still further, Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and communication technology. Projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's US$307 million [[Millennium Challenge Account]] grant signed in February 2006.<ref>[http://www.mcc.gov/mcc/countries/benin/index.shtm Benin] at Millennium Challenge Corporation{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation, with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production.<ref name=cia>{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Benin |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bn.html |year=2009|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}</ref>

Although [[trade unions in Benin]] represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of [[child labour]], and the continuing issue of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Serious violations of core labour standards in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali |work=ICFTU Online |url=http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=991220267&Language=EN |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>

Benin is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] ([[OHADA]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=OHADA.com: The business law portal in Africa |url=http://www.ohada.com/index.php |accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref>

Cotonou harbors the country's only seaport and international airport. A new port is currently under construction between Cotonou and Porto Novo. Benin is connected by 2 lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries (Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria). Mobile telephone service is available across the country through various [[Mobile Network Code|operators]]. ADSL connections are available in some areas. Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections (since 1998) and a single submarine cable [[SAT-3/WASC (cable system)|SAT-3/WASC]] (since 2001), keeping the price of data extremely high. Relief is expected with initiation of the [[ACE (cable system)|Africa Coast to Europe]] cable in 2011.

Currently, about a third of the population live below the international poverty line of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.25 per day.<ref name="UNDP1">[http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf Human Development Indices], Table 3: Human and income poverty, p. 35. undp.org.

{{main|Demography of Benin|Languages of Benin}}

The majority of Benin's population lives in the south. The population is young, with a [[life expectancy]] of 59 years. About 42 African ethnic groups live in this country; these various groups settled in Benin at different times and also migrated within the country. Ethnic groups include the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] in the southeast (migrated from Nigeria in the 12th century); the [[Dendi people|Dendi]] in the north-central area (they came from Mali in the 16th century); the [[Bariba people|Bariba]] and the [[Fula people|Fula]] ({{lang-fr|Peul ''or'' Peulh}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}) in the northeast; the [[Betammaribe]] and the [[Somba people|Somba]] in the [[Atacora Range]]; the [[Fon people|Fon]] in the area around [[Abomey]] in the South Central and the [[Mina people|Mina]], [[Xueda people|Xueda]], and [[Aja people|Aja]] (who came from Togo) on the coast.<ref name=bn/>

Recent migrations have brought other African nationals to Benin that include Nigerians, Togolese, and Malians. The foreign community also includes many Lebanese and Indians involved in trade and commerce. The personnel of the many European embassies and foreign aid missions and of nongovernmental organizations and various missionary groups account for a large part of the {{gaps|5|500}} European population.<ref name=bn/> A small part of the European population consists of Beninese citizens of [[French people|French ancestry]], whose ancestors ruled Benin and left after independence.

{{see also|HIV/AIDS in Benin}}

During the 1980s, less than 30% of the population had access to primary health care services. Benin had one of the highest death rates for children under the age of five in the world. Its [[infant mortality rate]] stood at 203 deaths for every {{gaps|1|000}} live births. Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services. The [[Bamako Initiative]] changed that dramatically by introducing community-based health care reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/inf-new/child6.htm |title=Bamako Initiative revitalizes primary health care in Benin |publisher= WHO.int|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10173105&dopt=Abstract |title=Implementation of the Bamako Initiative: strategies in Benin and Guinea |publisher=NIH.gov |accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] has completed three surveys in Benin since 1996.<ref name="Benin Surveys">[http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/country_main.cfm?ctry_id=52&c=Benin Benin Surveys], measuredhs.com</ref>

Beninese literature had a strong oral tradition long before French became the dominant language.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benin |url=http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/CountryBeninEN.html |accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> [[Felix Couchoro]] wrote the first Beninese novel, ''[[L'Esclave (Beninese novel)|L'Esclave]]'' in [[1929 in literature|1929]].

Post-independence, the country was home to a vibrant and innovative music scene, where native folk music combined with [[Ghana]]ian [[highlife]], French [[cabaret]], American [[rock and roll|rock]], [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]], and [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[African Rumba|rumba]].

Singer [[Angélique Kidjo]] and actor [[Djimon Hounsou]] were both born in Cotonou, Benin. Filmmaker and actor [[Didier Chabi]] was born in Kandi, Benin. Composer [[Wally Badarou]] and singer [[Gnonnas Pedro]] are also of Beninese descent.

Biennale Benin, continuing the projects of several organizations and artists started in the country in 2010 as a collaborative event called "Regard Benin". In 2012, the project become a Biennial coordinated by the Consortium, a federation of local associations. The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012 Biennale Benin is curated by Abdellah Karroum and the Curatorial Delegation.

===Customary names===
Many Beninois in the south of the country have [[Akan name|Akan-based names]] indicating the day of the week on which they were born. This is due to influence of the [[Akan people]] likely the [[Akwamu]] and others.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/concise/Akwamu Akwamu – Encyclopedia Article and More from]. Merriam-Webster (2010-08-13). Retrieved on 2012-08-15.</ref>

===Language===
{{main|Languages of Benin}}
Local languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools, with French only introduced after several years. In wealthier cities, however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s written ''é è, ô, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, ɛ, o, ɔ}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''ŋ'' and ''c.'' However, digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/fõ ɡ͡be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.

===Religion===

{{main|Religion in Benin}}
In the 2002 census, 42.8% of the population of Benin were [[Christianity|Christian]] (27.1% [[Roman Catholic]], 5% [[Celestial Church of Christ]], 3.2% [[Methodist]], 7.5% other Christian denominations), 24.4% were [[Muslim]], 17.3% practiced [[Vodun]], 6% other traditional local religious groups, 1.9% other religious groups, and 6.5% claim no religious affiliation.<ref name=report>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90082.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Benin]. United States [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor]] (September 14, 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>

Indigenous religions include local [[animism|animistic]] religions in the [[Atakora]] (Atakora and Donga provinces) and [[Vodun]] and [[Orisha]] or [[Orisa]] veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples in the center and south of the country. The town of [[Ouidah]] on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun.

The major introduced religions are Christianity, followed throughout the south and center of Benin and in [[Otammari]] country in the [[Atakora]], and Islam, introduced by the [[Songhai Empire]] and Hausa merchants, and now followed throughout [[Alibori]], [[Borgou]], and [[Donga Department|Donga]] provinces, as well as among the Yoruba (who also follow Christianity). Many, however, continue to hold Vodun and Orisha beliefs and have incorporated the pantheon of Vodun and Orisha into Christianity. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], a sect originating in the 19th century is also present, in a significant minority.

===Education===

===Cuisine===
[[File:Bahia acaraje.jpg|thumb|[[Acarajé]] is peeled [[black-eyed pea]]s formed into a ball and then deep-fried.]]
{{main|Benin cuisine}}
Beninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes. Beninese cuisine involves lots of fresh meals served with a variety of sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, the most common ingredient is [[Maize|corn]], often used to prepare [[dough]] which is mainly served with [[peanut]]- or [[tomato]]-based [[sauce]]s. [[Fish]] and [[chicken]] are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine, but [[beef]], [[goat]], and [[Aethomys|bush rat]] are also consumed. The main staple in northern Benin is [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and [[pork]] meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. [[Cheese]] is used in some dishes. [[Couscous]], rice, and [[bean]]s are commonly eaten, along with fruits such as [[mango]]es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.

Meat is usually quite expensive, and meals are generally light on meat and generous on [[vegetable fat]]. Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation, and [[smoked fish]] is commonly prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare [[Cornmeal|corn flour]], which is made into a dough and served with sauces. "Chicken on the spit" is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over fire on wooden sticks. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with saltwater and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.
