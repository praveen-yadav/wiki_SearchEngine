The '''Symphony No. 9 in D minor''', [[Opus number|Op.]] 125 (sometimes known simply as "the Choral"), is the final complete [[symphony]] of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770–1827). Completed in 1824, the symphony is one of the best-known works of the repertoire of [[classical music]].<ref name=NCookblurb>''Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks)'', Nicholas Cook, Cambridge University Press (24 Jun 1993), product description (blurb). ISBN 9780521399241. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."</ref> Among [[music criticism|critics]], it is almost universally considered to be among Beethoven's greatest [[List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven|works]], and is considered by some to be the greatest piece of music ever written.<ref name=NCookblurb />

The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony<ref name="bonds24837">Bonds, Mark Evan, "Symphony: II. The 19th century", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition'' (London: Macmillan, 2001), 29 vols. ISBN 0-333-60800-3, 24:837.</ref> (thus making it a [[choral symphony]]). The words are sung during the final [[movement (music)|movement]] by four vocal soloists and a [[choir|chorus]]. They were taken from the "[[Ode to Joy]]", a poem written by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1785 and revised in 1803, with additions made by the composer. Today, it stands as one of the most played symphonies in the world.

In 2002, Beethoven's autograph score of the Ninth Symphony, held by the [[Berlin State Library]], was added to the [[United Nations]] [[World Heritage List]], becoming the first musical score to be so honoured.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_21-12-2002_pg9_5 "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony joins UN world heritage list"], ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'', Lahore, 21 December 2002.

==History==

===Composition===
[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven in 1820. Beethoven was almost completely deaf when he composed his ninth symphony.]]

The [[Philharmonic Society of London]] originally commissioned the symphony in 1817.<ref>Solomon, Maynard. ''Beethoven''. New York: Schirmer Books, 1997, p. 251.</ref> The main composition work was done between autumn 1822 and the completion of the autograph in February 1824.<ref>[[Breitkopf & Härtel|Breitkopf]] [[Urtext]], Beethoven: [http://www.breitkopf.com/feature/download/3738/3667 Symphonie Nr. 9 d-moll], op. 125, pbl.: Hauschild, Peter, p. VIII</ref>

The symphony emerged from other pieces by Beethoven that, while completed works in their own right, are also in some sense sketches for the future symphony. The [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]] Opus. 80 (1808), basically a piano concerto movement, brings in a chorus and vocal soloists near the end to form the climax. As in the Ninth Symphony, the vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is highly reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]). Going further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song "Gegenliebe" ("Returned Love"), for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.<ref>Hopkins (1981, 249)</ref> According to Robert W. Gutman, Mozart's K. 222 Offertory in D minor, "Misericordias Domini", written in 1775, contains a melody that foreshadows "Ode to Joy".<ref>Robert W. Gutman, ''Mozart: A Cultural Biography'', 1999, pg. 344</ref>

===Premiere===
Although his major works had primarily been premiered in Vienna, Beethoven was eager to have his latest composition performed in Berlin as soon as possible after finishing it, since he thought that musical taste in Vienna had become dominated by Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]].<ref name="The Ninth">[[Harvey Sachs|Sachs, Harvey]] (2010), ''The Ninth: Beethoven and the World in 1824'', [[Faber and Faber|Faber]]</ref> When his friends and financiers heard this, they urged him to premiere the symphony in Vienna in the form of a petition signed by a number of prominent Viennese music patrons and performers.<ref name="The Ninth" />

Beethoven was flattered by the adoration of Vienna, so the Ninth Symphony was premiered on 7 May 1824 in the [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] in Vienna, along with the overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' ({{lang|de|Die Weihe des Hauses}}) and the first three parts of the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' (the Kyrie, Credo, and the Agnus Dei).

This was the composer's first on-stage appearance in 12 years; the hall was packed with an eager audience and a number of musicians.<ref name="Levy David">Levy, David Benjamin. Beethoven: The Ninth Symphony. Yale University Press 2003.</ref>

The premiere of Symphony No. 9 involved the largest orchestra ever assembled by Beethoven<ref name="Levy David" /> and required the combined efforts of the Kärntnertor house orchestra, The Vienna Music Society ([[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]]), along with a select group of capable amateurs. While no complete list of premiere performers exists, many of Vienna's most elite performers are known to have participated.<ref name="First Nights">Kelly, Thomas Forrest (2000). First Nights: Five Musical Premiers (Chapter 3). Yale University Press, 2001.</ref>

The [[soprano]] and [[alto]] parts were interpreted by two famous young singers: [[Henriette Sontag]] and [[Caroline Unger]]. German Soprano Henriette Sontag (1806–1854) was eighteen years old when Beethoven personally recruited her to perform in the premiere of the Ninth Symphony. Sontag, who had been performing since the age of six, won the hearts of Vienna concert goers as the lead in [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''[[Euryanthe]]'' in 1823. After performing for Beethoven in 1824, she toured Germany, sparking such enthusiasm that the term "Sontag Fever" was coined to describe the fanaticism which followed her.<ref name="First Nights" /> After marriage and a lengthy hiatus, Sontag toured America and Mexico under her married name Countess de Rossi.<ref>Elson, Louis, Chief Editor. ''University Musical Encyclopedia of Vocal Music''. University Society, New York, 1912</ref><ref>Life of Henriette Sontag, Countess de Rossi. (Various Authors) Stringer & Townsend, publishers. New York, 1852.</ref>

Also personally recruited by Beethoven, 21 year old contralto Caroline Unger (1803–1877), a native of Vienna, had gained critical praise in 1821 appearing in [[Giachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[Tancredi]]''. After performing in Beethoven's 1824 premiere, Unger found fame in Italy and Paris. Italian composers [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were known to have written roles specifically for her voice.<ref>Kennedy, Michael & Bourne, Joyce(1996). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music''. Oxford University Press, 2007.</ref>

Although the performance was officially directed by [[Michael Umlauf]], the theatre's [[Kapellmeister]], Beethoven shared the stage with him. However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the [[tempo]]s. He was turning the pages of his [[sheet music|score]] and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.

There are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was under-rehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution. On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph Böhm]] recalled: "Beethoven directed the piece himself; that is, he stood before the lectern and gesticulated furiously. At times he rose, at other times he shrank to the ground, he moved as if he wanted to play all the instruments himself and sing for the whole chorus. All the musicians minded his rhythm alone while playing".

When the audience applauded—testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or the whole symphony—Beethoven was several measures off and still conducting. Because of that, the [[contralto]] Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to one witness, "the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them." The whole audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovation gestures.

===Editions===
The first German edition was printed by [[Schott Music|B. Schott's Sōhne]] (Mainz) in 1826. The [[Breitkopf & Härtel]] edition dating from 1864 has been used widely by orchestras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/review/02-99b/24-delmar.html|publisher=British Academy Review|author=Del Mar, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Del Mar|year=1999|month=July–December|title=Jonathan Del Mar, New Urtext Edition: Beethoven Symphonies 1–9|accessdate=13 November 2007}}</ref> In 1997 [[Bärenreiter]] published an edition by [[Jonathan Del Mar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/html/lvb/index.html|title=Ludwig van Beethoven The Nine Symphonies The New Bärenreiter Urtext Edition|accessdate=13 November 2007}}</ref> According to Del Mar, this edition corrects nearly 3000 mistakes in the Breitkopf edition, some of which were "remarkable".<ref name="Zander">{{cite web|url=http://www.benjaminzander.com/recordings/boston-philharmonic/beet9/review/130|title=Beethoven 9 The fundamental reappraisal of a classic|author=Zander, Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Zander|accessdate=13 November 2007}}</ref> [[David Benjamin Levy|David Levy]], however, criticized this edition, saying that it could create "quite possibly false" traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://bf.press.uiuc.edu/10.1/delmar.html|title=Concerning the Review of the Urtext Edition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|accessdate=13 November 2007}}</ref> Breitkopf also published a new edition by [[Peter Hauschild]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.breitkopf.com/downloads/kataloge/pdf_en/33_Beeth_Symph_en.pdf|title=Beethoven The Nine Symphonies}}{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref>

While many of the modifications in the newer editions make minor alterations to dynamics and articulation, both editions change the orchestral lead-in to the final statement of the choral theme in the fourth movement (IV: m525 m542). The newer versions alter the articulation of the horn calls, creating syncopation that no longer relates to the previous motive. The new [[Breitkopf & Härtel]] and [[Bärenreiter]] make this alteration differently, but the result is a reading that is different from what was commonly accepted based on the 1864 Breitkopf edition. While both [[Breitkopf & Härtel]] and [[Bärenreiter]] consider their editions the most accurate versions available—labeling them [[Urtext edition]]s—their conclusions are not universally accepted. In his monograph "Beethoven—the ninth symphony", David Levy describes the rationale for these changes and the danger of calling the editions Urtext.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following orchestra. These are by far the largest forces needed for any Beethoven symphony; at the premiere, Beethoven augmented them further by assigning two players to each wind part.<ref>[[Alexander Wheelock Thayer|Thayer, Alexander Wheelock]].

==Form==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The symphony is in four movements, marked as follows:
# Allegro ma non troppo, un poco [[maestoso]]
# Scherzo: Molto [[vivace]] – Presto
# Adagio molto e [[cantabile]] – Andante moderato – Tempo primo – Andante moderato – Adagio – Lo stesso tempo
# [[Recitative]]: (Presto – Allegro ma non troppo – Vivace – Adagio cantabile – Allegro assai – Presto: ''{{Lang|de|O Freunde}}'') – Allegro molto assai: ''{{Lang|de|Freude, schöner Götterfunken}}'' – Alla marcia – Allegro assai vivace: ''{{Lang|de|Froh, wie seine Sonnen}}'' – Andante maestoso: ''{{Lang|de|Seid umschlungen, Millionen!}}'' – Adagio ma non troppo, ma divoto: ''{{Lang|de|Ihr, stürzt nieder}}'' – Allegro energico, sempre ben [[marcato]]: (''{{Lang|de|Freude, schöner Götterfunken}}'' – ''{{Lang|de|Seid umschlungen, Millionen!}}'') – Allegro ma non tanto: ''{{Lang|de|Freude, Tochter aus Elysium!}}'' – Prestissimo, Maestoso, Molto prestissimo: ''{{Lang|de|Seid umschlungen, Millionen!}}''

Beethoven changes the usual pattern of [[Classical music era|Classical]] symphonies in placing the [[scherzo]] movement before the slow movement (in symphonies, slow movements are usually placed before scherzi).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} This was the first time that he did this in a symphony, although he had done so in some previous works (including the [[string quartet|quartets]] Op. 18 no. 5, the "Archduke" [[piano trio]] Op. 97, the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|"Hammerklavier"]] piano sonata Op. 106). [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30]] in E-flat major.

===First movement===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=PMLP01607-Symphony No.9, Op.125 (Beethoven, Ludwig van), I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso.ogg|title=First movement}}
Allegro ma non troppo, un poco [[maestoso]]. Duration approx. 15 mins.

The first movement is in [[sonata form]], and the mood is often stormy. The opening theme, played ''pianissimo'' over string tremolos, so much resembles the sound of an orchestra tuning, many commentators have suggested that was Beethoven's inspiration. But from within that musical limbo emerges a theme of power and clarity which will drive the entire movement. Later, at the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] section, it returns ''fortissimo'' in D major, rather than the opening's D minor. The introduction also employs the use of the mediant to tonic relationship which further distorts the tonic key until it is finally played by the bassoon in the lowest possible register.

The coda employs the [[chromatic fourth]] interval.

===Second movement===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=PMLP01607-Symphony No.9, Op.125 (Beethoven, Ludwig van), II. Scherzo, Molto vivace - Presto.ogg|title=Second movement}}
Scherzo: Molto vivace – Presto. Duration approx. 12 mins.

The second movement, a [[scherzo|scherzo and trio]], is also in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Hammerklavier]] piano sonata, written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven directs that the beat should be one downbeat every three bars, perhaps because of the very fast pace of the movement, with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' ("rhythm of three bars"), and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' ("rhythm of four bars").

Beethoven had been criticised before for failing to adhere to standard form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics. Normally, scherzi are written in triple time. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time, but it is punctuated in a way that, when coupled with the speed of the metre, makes it sound as though it is in quadruple time.

While adhering to the standard [[ternary form|ternary design]] of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo, or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition starts out with a [[fugue]] before modulating to [[C major]] for the second part of the exposition. The exposition is then repeated before a short development section. The recapitulation further develops the exposition, also containing [[timpani]] solos. A new development section is played before the recapitulation is repeated, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].

The contrasting trio section is in D major and in duple time. The trio is the first time the [[trombone]]s play in the movement. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.

===Third movement===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=PMLP01607-Symphony No.9, Op.125 (Beethoven, Ludwig van), III. Adagio molto e cantabile.ogg|title=Third movement}}
Adagio molto e cantabile – Andante Moderato – Tempo Primo – Andante Moderato – Adagio – Lo Stesso Tempo. Duration approx. 16 mins.

The lyrical slow movement, in B-flat major, is in a loose [[variation (music)|variation]] form, with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melody. The first variation, like the theme, is in 4/4 time, the second in 12/8. The variations are separated by passages in 3/4, the first in D major, the second in G major. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud fanfares for the full orchestra are answered by octaves played by the first violins alone. A prominent [[horn (instrument)|horn]] solo is assigned to the fourth player. [[Trombone]]s are [[tacet]] for the movement.

===Fourth movement===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=PMLP01607-Symphony No.9, Op.125 (Beethoven, Ludwig van), IV Presto.ogg|title=Fourth movement}}
Presto; Allegro molto assai (Alla marcia); Andante maestoso; Allegro energico, sempre ben marcato. Duration approx. 24 mins.

The famous choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of Universal Brotherhood. American pianist and music author [[Charles Rosen]] has characterized it as a symphony within a symphony, played without interruption.<ref>Rosen, Charles. "The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven". page 440. New York: Norton, 1997.</ref> This "inner symphony" follows the same overall pattern as the Ninth Symphony as a whole. The scheme is as follows:

*First "movement": theme and variations with slow introduction. Main theme which first appears in the cellos and basses is later "recapitulated" with voices.
*Second "movement": 6/8 scherzo in military style (begins at "Alla marcia", words "Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen"), in the "[[Turkish music (style)|Turkish style]]". Concludes with 6/8 variation of the main theme with chorus.
*Third "movement": slow meditation with a new theme on the text "Seid umschlungen, Millionen!" (begins at "[[Andante]] maestoso")
*Fourth "movement": [[fugue|fugato]] finale on the themes of the first and third "movements" (begins at "[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] energico")

The movement has a thematic unity, in which every part may be shown to be based on either the main theme, the "Seid umschlungen" theme, or some combination of the two.

The first "movement within a movement" itself is organized into sections:

*An introduction, which starts with a stormy ''[[Presto (music)|Presto]]'' passage. It then briefly quotes all three of the previous movements in order, each dismissed by the cellos and basses which then play in an instrumental foreshadowing of the vocal [[recitative]]. At the introduction of the main theme, the cellos and basses take it up and play it through.
*The main theme forms the basis of a series of [[variation (music)|variations]] for orchestra alone.
*The introduction is then repeated from the ''Presto'' passage, this time with the bass soloist singing the recitatives previously suggested by cellos and basses.
*The main theme again undergoes variations, this time for vocal soloists and chorus.<ref>Other writers have interpreted the form of the last movement in different terms, including [[Heinrich Schenker]] and [[Donald Tovey]].</ref>

====Text of the fourth movement====
The text is largely taken from [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s "[[Ode to Joy]]", with a few additional introductory words written specifically by Beethoven (shown in italics).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raptusassociation.org/ode1785.html|title=Beethoven Foundation – Schiller's "An die Freude" and Authoritative Translation}}</ref>

This concert was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 and later on BBC4 television on 6 September 2013, where the same translation was used as subtitles.</ref>  The score includes many repeats.

Towards the end of the movement, the choir sings the last four lines of the main theme, concluding with "''Alle Menschen''", before the soloists sing for one last time the song of joy at a slower tempo.  The chorus repeats parts of "''Seid umschlungen, Millionen! ...''", then quietly sings, "''Tochter aus Elysium''". And finally, "''Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Götterfunken!''".<ref name=dew /> with the orchestra playing [[prestissimo]].

==Reception==
Among music critics, the Ninth Symphony is almost universally considered to be among Beethoven's greatest works, and is considered by some to be the greatest piece of music ever written.<ref name=NCookblurb /> "Yet early critics rejected it as cryptic and eccentric, the product of a deaf and aging composer."<ref name=NCookblurb />
The finale of the Ninth has had detractors. [[Giuseppe Verdi]] complained about the vocal writing; in a letter he wrote to Clarina Maffei dated 20 April 1878, he stated that the symphony was:
<blockquote>...marvelous in its first three movements, very badly set in the last. No one will ever surpass the sublimity of the first movement, but it will be an easy task to write as badly for voices as is done in the last movement.</blockquote>
[[Gustav Leonhardt]] objected to the text itself, saying: "That 'Ode to Joy', talk about vulgarity! And the text! Completely puerile!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21543464|title=Gustav Leonhardt|work=[[The Economist]]|date=31 January 2012|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref>

==Performance challenges==

===Metronome markings===
Conductors in the [[historically informed performance]] movement, notably [[Roger Norrington]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Norrington|first=Roger|title=In tune with the time|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/14/beethoven|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Norrington|first=Roger|title=In tune with the time|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/mar/14/beethoven|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref> have used Beethoven's suggested tempos, to mixed reviews. [[Benjamin Zander]] has made a case for following Beethoven's metronome markings, both in writing<ref name="Zander" /> and in performances with the [[Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Philharmonia Orchestra of London.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/arts/concert-beethoven-9th.html "Concert: Beethoven 9th, Benjamin Zander and the Boston Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall"] by Bernhard Holland, ''The New York Times'', 11 October 1983</ref><ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphony-No-Dominique-Labelle/dp/B00000IGQ6 Recording of the Beethoven 9th] with Benjamin Zander, Dominique Labelle, D'Anna Fortunato, Brad Cresswell, David Arnold, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chorus Pro Musica</ref>

Beethoven's metronome still exists, and it has been tested and found to be accurate.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5-9Cdy-Y-M8C&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=accuracy+beethoven%27s+metronome&source=bl&ots=2zLJCFMxPO&sig=MBHGHYLgQBmG7bHfO2p-P363kM4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fCMDUeqrJ-bl0gH3koHAAw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=accuracy%20beethoven%27s%20metronome&f=false Gunther Schuller, ''The Compleat Conductor'']</ref>

===Re-orchestrations and alterations===
A number of conductors have made alterations in the instrumentation of the symphony, notably [[Richard Wagner]], who doubled many woodwind passages, a modification greatly extended by [[Gustav Mahler]],<ref name=Holden>Raymond Holden, "The iconic symphony: performing Beethoven's Ninth Wagner's Way" ''The Musical Times'' Winter 2011</ref> who revised the orchestration of the Ninth to make it sound like what he believed Beethoven would have wanted if given a modern orchestra.<ref>[[Natalie Bauer-Lechner|Bauer-Lechner, Natalie]]: ''Erinnerungen an Gustav Mahler'', page 131. E.P. Tal & Co. Verlag, 1923</ref> 

Wagner's Dresden performance of 1864 was the first to place the chorus and the solo singers behind the orchestra as has since become standard; previous conductors placed them between the orchestra and the audience.<ref name=Holden />

====Horn and trumpet alterations====
Beethoven's writing for horns and trumpets throughout the symphony (mostly the 2nd horn and 2nd trumpet) is sometimes altered by performers to avoid large leaps (those of a 12th or more), as leaps of this sort are very difficult to perform on brass instruments and may be consistently and flawlessly executed only by highly proficient musicians.<ref>Rimsky-Korsakov "Principles of Orchestration" http://216.129.110.22/files/imglnks/usimg/4/41/IMSLP21030-PMLP48692-Rimsky_Osnovy_Ch1.PDF "Though far less flexible than the wood-wind, brass instruments heighten the effect of other orchestral groups ... In spite of valves, the horn has little mobility." (p.23-24)</ref>

====2nd bassoon doubling basses in the finale====
Beethoven's indication that the 2nd bassoon should double the basses in measures 115–164 of the finale was not included in the Breitkopf parts, though it was included in the full score.<ref>Del Mar, Jonathan (1981) ''Orchestral Variations: Confusion and Error in the Orchestral Repertoire'' London: Eulenburg Books, p. 43</ref>

==Notable performances and recordings==
The [[London Philharmonic Choir]] debuted on 15 May 1947 performing the Ninth Symphony with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Victor de Sabata]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref name='debut'>{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/933316 | title= London Concerts | journal=The Musical Times | volume= 88 |issue = 1250 | author=Anon. | month=April| year=1947 | pages=139 | publisher=Musical Times Publications Ltd. | jstor=933316}}</ref>

Political significance has attached to Beethoven's Ninth: [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted a version of the 9th at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], with "{{Lang|de|Freiheit}}" ("Freedom") replacing "{{Lang|de|Freude}}" ("Joy"), to celebrate the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] during Christmas 1989.<ref>Morin (2002), p. 98</ref> This concert was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from Germany, the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus, the Chorus of the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin)|Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]], and members of the [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]], the Philharmonischer Kinderchor Dresden; members of the orchestra of the [[Kirov Theatre]]; from the United Kingdom, members of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]; from the USA, members of the [[New York Philharmonic]]; and from France, members of the [[Orchestre de Paris]]. Soloists were [[June Anderson]], soprano, [[Sarah Walker (opera singer)|Sarah Walker]], mezzo-soprano, [[Klaus König]], tenor, and [[Jan-Hendrik Rootering]], bass.<ref name="Naxos 2072038">{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=2072038 |title=Ode To Freedom – Beethoven: Symphony No. 9|accessdate=26 November 2006 |author=Naxos |authorlink=Naxos Records |year=2006 |work=Naxos.com Classical Music Catalogue}}</ref> It was the last time that Bernstein conducted the symphony; he died ten months later.

Bernstein made his first recording of the Beethoven Ninth in 1964 with the New York Philharmonic, for [[Columbia Masterworks]], with soloists [[Martina Arroyo]] (soprano), [[Regina Safarty]] (mezzo), [[Nicholas di Virgilio]] (tenor), Norman Scott (bass), and the [[Juilliard]] Chorus. It was later reissued on CD. It was the first of three complete recordings of the Ninth that Bernstein made. He made his second recording of the piece with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], in 1979. This second one featured [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] (soprano), [[Hanna Schwarz]] (mezzo), [[René Kollo]], and [[Kurt Moll]] (bass), with the chorus of the [[Vienna State Opera]].<ref>http://www.leonardbernstein.com/disc_other.php?disc_other_php=&disc_other.php=&page=8</ref>

Sir [[Georg Solti]] recorded the symphony with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra several times. Their last recording of this symphony in 1986 won the Grammy for Best Orchestral Recording.<ref>

There have been various attempts to record the Ninth to come closer to what Beethoven's contemporaries would have heard, i.e., with period instruments. [[Roger Norrington]] conducting the [[London Classical Players]] recorded it with period instruments for a 1987 release by EMI Records (rereleased in 1997 under the Virgin Classics label). [[Benjamin Zander]] made a 1992 recording of the Ninth with the [[Boston Philharmonic|Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and noted soprano Dominique Labelle (who first performed the work with Robert Shaw), following Beethoven's own metronome markings<!-- but with modern instruments I believe -->. 12 years later after Norrington, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] recorded the Ninth with his [[period instruments|period-instrument]] [[Orchestre des Champs-Élysées]] and his [[Collegium Vocale Gent|Collegium Vocale]] chorus for [[Harmonia Mundi]] in 1999. Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]] recorded his period-instrument version of the Ninth Symphony,<ref>Talli Makell, "Ludwig van Beethoven" in ''Classical Music: The Listener's Companion'' ed. Alexander J. Morin (San Francisco: Backbeat Books, 2002), p. 99</ref> conducting his [[Monteverdi Choir]] and [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] in 1992. It was first released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 1994 on their early music Archiv Produktion label as part of his complete cycle of the Beethoven symphonies. His soloists included [[Ľuba Orgonášová]], [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson]] and [[Gilles Cachemaille]]. An additional period-instrument recording by [[Christopher Hogwood]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] was released in 1997 under the label [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]].

At 79 minutes, one of the longest Ninths recorded is [[Karl Böhm]]'s, conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1981 with [[Jessye Norman]] and [[Plácido Domingo]] among the soloists.<ref>{{cite web

[[Osmo Vänskä]], conducting the [[Minnesota Orchestra]], recorded the symphony as part of a cycle of all the Beethoven symphonies. Released on the [[BIS Records|BIS]] label, it included soloists Helena Juntunen, Katarina Karnéus, Daniel Norman and Neal Davies, as well as the Minnesota Chorale.

==Influence==
Many later composers of the Romantic period and beyond were influenced specifically by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

An important theme in the finale of Johannes Brahms' [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1 in C minor]] is related to the "Ode to Joy" theme from the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth symphony. When this was pointed out to [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], he is reputed to have retorted "Any fool can see that!" Brahms's first symphony was, at times, both praised and derided as "Beethoven's Tenth".<ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2650 Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 68]. The Kennedy Center, 2006</ref>

The Ninth symphony influenced the forms that [[Bruckner]] used for the movements of his symphonies. Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3]] is in the same D minor key as Beethoven's 9th and makes substantial use of thematic ideas from it. The colossal slow movement of Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]], "as usual", takes the same A–B–A–B–A form as the 3rd movement of Beethoven's symphony, and also uses some figuration from it.<ref name=taruskin>{{Cite book| first=Richard |last=Taruskin |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |year=2010 |title=Music in the Nineteenth Century |series=The Oxford History of Western Music |volume=3 |pages=747–751 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-538483-3}}</ref>

In the opening notes of the third movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9]] (The "New World"), [[Antonín Dvořák]] pays homage to the [[scherzo]] of this symphony with his falling fourths and timpani strokes.<ref>[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Steinberg, Michael]]. ''The Symphony: a listeners guide''. page 153. Oxford University Press, 1995.</ref>

Likewise, [[Béla Bartók]] borrows the opening motif of the [[Scherzo]] from Beethoven's Ninth symphony to introduce the second movement Scherzo in his own, Four Orchestral Pieces, op. 12.<ref>{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Orrin|title=About the Piece {{!}} Four Orchestral Pieces, op. 12|url=http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/four-orchestral-pieces-op-12-bela-bartok|publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bartók|first=Béla|title=4 Pieces, Op.12 - Violin I - (Musical Score)|year=1912|publisher=Universal Edition|pages=3|url=http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8b/IMSLP54751-PMLP46172-Bartok-Op12.Violin1.pdf}}</ref> 

One legend is that the [[Compact Disc]] was deliberately designed to have a 74-minute playing time in order to accommodate the length of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. [[Kees Immink]], Philips' chief engineer, who developed the CD, recalls that a commercial [[tug-of-war]] between the development partners, Sony and Philips, led to a settlement in a neutral 12-cm diameter format. The 1951 performance of the Ninth Symphony by Furtwängler was brought forward as the perfect excuse for the change.<ref name="ferguscassidy">{{cite news | url = http://www.ferguscassidy.ie/ethos-23-Oct-2005.html | title = Great Lengths | last = Cassidy | first = Fergus | format = reprint |work=[[Sunday Tribune]] | date = 23 October 2005| accessdate =21 December 2007}}</ref><ref name=Immink2>{{cite journal|url=http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~immink/pdf/beethoven.htm|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc|first=Kees A.

==Use as anthem==
During the division of Germany in the [[Cold War]], the "Ode to Joy" segment of the symphony was also played in lieu of an anthem at the Olympic Games for the [[Unified Team of Germany]] between 1956 and 1968.  In 1972, the musical backing (without the words) was adopted as the [[Anthem of Europe]] by the [[Council of Europe]] and subsequently by the [[European Communities]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm|title=The European Anthem|publisher=Europa}}</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm Europa – The EU at a glance – The European Anthem<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The "Ode to Joy" was used as the national anthem of Rhodesia between 1974 and 1979, as "[[Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia]]".<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cHBmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XosNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6475,5011881&dq "Rhodesia picks Ode to Joy"], ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', 30 August 1974</ref>

==New Year's tradition in Japan==
The Symphony No. 9, with accompanying chorus, is traditionally performed throughout Japan during its [[Japanese New Year|New Year's celebrations]]. In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.<ref name="Brasor">Brasor, Philip, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010;<br />Uranaka, Taiga, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19991201a5.html Beethoven concert to fete students' wartime sendoff]", ''The Japan Times'', 1 December 1999, retrieved on 24 December 2010.</ref>

The Ninth was introduced to Japan by German soldiers held at the [[Bandō prisoner-of-war camp]] during World War I. Japanese orchestras, notably the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], began performing the symphony in 1925. During World War II, the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial government]] promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve, to encourage allegiance to Japanese nationalism. The symphony was considered appropriate in this regard because Germany was an ally of Japan. After the war, orchestras and choruses, undergoing economic hard times during the reconstruction of Japan, promoted performances of the piece around New Year because of the popularity of the music with the public. In the 1960s, performances of the symphony for the New Year became more widespread and included participation by local choirs and orchestras, establishing the tradition which continues to this day – and which includes, since 2003, a concert of all nine symphonies.<ref name="Brasor" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/242/New-Years-Eve-concerts-in-Tokyo |title=New Year's Eve Concerts in Tokyo |publisher=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date= 15 December 2009 |accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>
