A '''cyanide''' is any [[chemical compound]] that contains monovalent combining group CN. This group, known as the '''cyano group''', consists of a [[carbon]] atom [[triple-bond]]ed to a [[nitrogen]] atom.<ref>[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01486.html ''cyanides'']</ref>

In inorganic cyanides, such as [[sodium cyanide]], NaCN, this group is present as the negatively-charged polyatomic '''cyanide ion''' (CN<sup>-</sup>); these compounds, which are regarded as salts of [[hydrocyanic acid]], are highly toxic. The cyanide ion is [[isoelectronic]] with [[carbon monoxide]] and with molecular [[nitrogen]].<ref>Greenwood, N. N.; & Earnshaw, A. (1997). Chemistry of the Elements (2nd Edn.), Oxford:Butterworth-Heinemann. ISBN 0-7506-3365-4.</ref><ref>G. L. Miessler and D. A. Tarr "Inorganic Chemistry" 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, ISBN 0-13-035471-6.</ref> Most cyanides are highly toxic.<ref name="CMC">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php| title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide| publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute|year=2006| accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref>

Organic cyanides are usually called [[nitrile]]s; in these, the CN group is linked by a [[covalent bond]] to a carbon-containing group, such as [[methyl]] (CH<sub>3</sub>) in methyl cyanide ([[acetonitrile]]).

Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid used to prepare [[acrylonitrile]], which is used in the production of [[acrylic fiber]]s, [[synthetic rubber]], and [[plastic]]s. Cyanides are employed in a number of chemical processes, including [[fumigation]], case hardening of [[iron]] and [[steel]], [[electroplating]], and the concentration of [[ore]]s. In nature, substances yielding cyanide are present in certain seeds, such as the pit of the [[wild cherry]].

In [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]], [[organic compound]]s that have a&nbsp;–C≡N [[functional group]] are called [[nitrile]]s. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.<ref>[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/N04151.html ''nitriles'']</ref><ref>NCBI-MeSH [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009570 ''Nitriles'']</ref>
An example of a nitrile is CH<sub>3</sub>CN, [[acetonitrile]], also known as [[methyl]] cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called [[cyanohydrin]].  Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release [[hydrogen cyanide]]. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N<sup>−</sup> ion are referred to as '''cyanides'''.

==Occurrence and reactions==
===In nature===
Cyanides are produced by certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]] and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[peach]]es.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=71&tid=19 |title=ToxFAQs for Cyanide |accessdate=2008-06-28 |date = July 2006|publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]}}</ref> In plants, cyanides are usually bound to [[sugar]] molecules in the form of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s and defend the plant against [[herbivore]]s. [[Cassava]] roots (also called manioc), an important [[potato]]-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which [[tapioca]] is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=J. |last=Vetter |title=Plant cyanogenic glycosides |journal=Toxicon |year=2000 |volume=38 |pages=11–36 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 |pmid=10669009 |issue=1}}</ref><ref name=jones>{{Cite journal|first=D.

The [[Madagascar]] bamboo ''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]'' produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. In response, the [[golden bamboo lemur]], which eats the bamboo, has developed a high tolerance to cyanide.

===Pyrolysis and combustion product===
Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or [[pyrolysis]] of certain materials under oxygen-deficient conditions. For example, it can be detected in the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[tobacco]] smoke. Certain [[plastic]]s, especially those derived from [[acrylonitrile]], release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.<ref name="CDC">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts about cyanide:Where cyanide is found and how it is used|last=Anon|date=27 January 2004|work=CDC Emergency preparedness and response|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>

===Coordination chemistry===
The cyanide anion is a [[ligand]] for many [[transition metals]].<ref>Sharpe, A. G. The Chemistry of Cyano Complexes of the Transition Metals; Academic Press: London, 1976</ref> The high affinities of metals for this [[anion]] can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include:
*hexacyanides [M(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3−</sup> (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape;
*the tetracyanides, [M(CN)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2−</sup> (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;
*the dicyanides [M(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>−</sup> (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.

The dye [[Prussian blue]] was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen.  Prussian blue consists of an [[iron]]-containing compound called "[[ferrocyanide]]" ({Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4-</sup>) meaning "blue substance with iron", from Latin ''[[wikt:ferrum|ferrum]]'' = "iron" and Greek ''[[kyanos]]'' = "(dark) blue".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Senning |first=Alexander |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-444-52239-5}}</ref> Prussian blue is the deep-[[blue]] pigment used in the making of [[blueprint]]s.

The [[enzymes]] called [[hydrogenase]]s contain cyanide [[ligand]]s attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases proceeds from [[carbamoyl]]phosphate, which converts to [[cystein]]yl [[thiocyanate]], the CN<sup>−</sup> donor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reissmann |first=Stefanie |coauthors=Elisabeth Hochleitner, Haofan Wang, Athanasios Paschos, Friedrich Lottspeich, Richard S.

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Nitriles}}
Because of the cyanide anion's high [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]], cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a [[halide]] group (e.g., the [[chloride]] on [[methyl chloride]]).  In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH<sub>3</sub>CN can be called methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as [[acetonitrile]]. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 [[synthon]]; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be [[wiktionary:functionalize|functionalized]].
:RX + CN<sup>−</sup> → RCN + X<sup>−</sup> ([[nucleophilic substitution]]) followed by
# RCN + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → [[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]]  +  NH<sub>3</sub> ([[hydrolysis]] under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or
# 2 RCN + [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH<sub>4</sub>]]  + (second step) 4 H<sub>2</sub>O  → [[amine|2 RCH<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>]]  +  LiAl(OH)<sub>4</sub> (under [[reflux]] in dry [[diethyl ether|ether]], followed by addition of H<sub>2</sub>O)

== Manufacture ==
{{main|Hydrogen cyanide#Production and synthesis}}
The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the [[Andrussow process]] in which gaseous [[hydrogen cyanide]] is produced from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].<ref>{{cite journal

Gaseous hydrogen cyanide may be dissolved in aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] solution to produce [[sodium cyanide]].

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Cyanide poisoning}}
Many cyanides are highly toxic. The cyanide anion is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (also known as aa<sub>3</sub>) in the fourth complex of the [[electron transport chain]] (found in the membrane of the [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells).  It attaches to the iron within this protein.  The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from [[cytochrome c oxidase]] to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=David L.|last2=Cox|first2=Michael M.|title=Lehniger Principles of Biochemistry|publisher=[[Worth Publishers]]|year=2000|location=New York|edition=3rd|isbn=1-57259-153-6|pages=668,670–71,676}}</ref> Tissues that depend highly on [[aerobic respiration]], such as the [[central nervous system]] and the [[heart]], are particularly affected.

The most hazardous compound is [[hydrogen cyanide]], which is a gas at ambient temperatures and pressure and can therefore be inhaled. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is produced when a solution containing a [[labile]] cyanide is made acidic, because HCN is a [[weak acid]]. Alkaline solutions are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of [[polyurethane]]s; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution as little as 200&nbsp;mg, or to airborne cyanide of 270 [[Parts per million|ppm]] is sufficient to cause death within minutes.<ref name=Biller/>

Organic [[nitrile]]s do not readily release cyanide ions, and so have low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Antidote===
[[Hydroxocobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be safely eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the FDA in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/814287-treatment |title=Cyanide Toxicity Treatment & Management |publisher=Emedicine.medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: [[amyl nitrite]] pearls (administered by inhalation), [[sodium nitrite]], and [[sodium thiosulfate]] (administered by infusion). The goal of the antidote was to generate a large pool of [[ferric]] iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) to compete with cyanide cytochrome a<sub>3</sub> (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather that the enzyme). The [[nitrite]]s [[oxidize]] [[hemoglobin]] to [[methemoglobin]], which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the [[cytochrome oxidase]] enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to [[thiocyanate]] by the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]].  Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for [[rhodanese]], needed in order to produce thiocyanate.

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, [[asthma]], or [[bronchitis]]. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates (Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006).

==Applications==

===Mining===
{{Main|Gold cyanidation}}
Cyanide is mainly produced for the [[mining]] of [[gold]] and [[silver]]: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores.  In the  ''[[cyanide process]]'', finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>−</sup> and [Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>−</sup>.<ref name=Ullmann>Andreas Rubo, Raf Kellens, Jay Reddy, Norbert Steier, Wolfgang Hasenpusch "Alkali Metal Cyanides" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2006 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany.ISBN 10.1002/14356007.i01 i01</ref>
::4 Au  +  8 NaCN  +  O<sub>2</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 4 Na[Au(CN)<sub>2</sub>]  +  4 NaOH

Silver is less "noble" than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O<sub>2</sub> is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
::Ag<sub>2</sub>S  +  4 NaCN  +  H<sub>2</sub>O  →   2 Na[Ag(CN)<sub>2</sub>]  +  NaSH  +  NaOH
The "pregnant liquor" containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a tailing pond or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed.  The metal is recovered from the "pregnant solution" by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems.  Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight.  It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present.  Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.

Cyanide is also used in [[electroplating]], where it stabilizes metal ions in the electrolyte solution prior to their deposition.

===Industrial organic chemistry===
Some nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., [[adiponitrile]] is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:
RCH=CH<sub>2</sub>  +  HCN   →   RCH(CN)CH<sub>3</sub>. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |year=1916 |month=August |title=THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY WITH CYANOCUPROL |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207–211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}</ref>

===Fishing===

Cyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near [[coral reef]]s for the [[aquarium]] and seafood markets.  The practice is controversial, dangerous, and damaging but is driven by the lucrative exotic fish market.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Pest control===
Cyanide is used for pest control in [[New Zealand]] particularly for [[Common Brushtail Possum in New Zealand|possums]], an introduced marsupial that threatens the conservation of native species and spreads [[tuberculosis]] amongst cattle. Possums can become bait shy but the use of pellets containing the cyanide reduces bait shyness.

===Niche uses===
[[Potassium ferrocyanide]] is used to achieve a blue color on cast [[bronze sculpture]]s during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue.  It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

Cyanide is also used in [[jewelry]]-making and certain kinds of [[photography]] such as [[sepia toning]].

Cyanides are used as [[insecticide]]s for fumigating ships. Cyanide salts are used for killing ants, and have in some places been used as rat poison (the less toxic poison [[arsenic]] is more common{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}).

For notable cyanide deaths, see [[Cyanide poisoning#Historical cases|Cyanide poisoning: Historical cases]]. 

Most significantly, hydrogen cyanide released from pellets of [[Zyklon-B]] was used extensively in the systematic mass murders of the [[Holocaust]], especially in extermination camps. Poisoning by hydrogen cyanide gas within a [[gas chamber]] (as a salt of hydrocyanic acid is dropped into a strong acid, usually sulfuric acid) is one method of [[capital punishment|executing a condemned prisoner]] as the condemned prisoner eventually breathes the lethal fumes.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==

===Prussian blue===
[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the [[sodium fusion test]]. The resulting mixture is acidified with [[mineral acid]]. The formation of [[Prussian blue]] is a positive result for cyanide.

===''para''-Benzoquinone in DMSO===
A solution of [[1,4-Benzoquinone|''para''-benzoquinone]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] reacts with inorganic cyanide to form  a cyano[[phenol]], which is [[fluorescent]]. Illumination with a [[UV light]] gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(80)90225-2 | pmid = 7423496 | title = Fluorometric determination of cyanide in biological fluids with p-benzoquinone*1 | first4 = JL | last4 = Way | first3 = RL | last3 = Morgan | first2 = GE | year = 1980 | last2 = Isom | last1 = Ganjeloo | first1 = A | journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–7    }}</ref>

===Copper and an aromatic amine===
As used by [[fumigation|fumigators]] to detect [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[copper]](II) salt and an aromatic amine such as [[benzidine]] is added to the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-''bis''-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color.  [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.

===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===
A sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis&nbsp;— Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Gas diffusion flow injection analysis&nbsp;— amperometry===
Instead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.
