'''Corona Borealis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɵ|ˈ|r|oʊ|n|ə|_|b|ɒr|i|ˈ|æ|l|ɨ|s}} is a small [[constellation]] in the northern sky. Its name is [[Latin]] for "northern crown", a name inspired by its shape; its main [[star]]s form a semicircular arc. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], it remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

The brightest star is the 2.2-magnitude [[Alpha Coronae Borealis]]. Four star systems have been found to have [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanets]] to date; three of these are orange giants, while the fourth—[[Rho Coronae Borealis]]—is a solar twin, very like our own [[Sun]]. [[Abell 2065]] is a highly concentrated [[galaxy cluster]] located one billion light-years from our Solar System containing over 400 members, the brightest of which are [[apparent magnitude|16th magnitude]].

== Characteristics ==
Corona Borealis is a small constellation bordered by [[Bootes]] to the north and west, [[Serpens|Serpens Caput]] to the south, and [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is 'CrB'.<ref name="pa30_469">{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 }}</ref> The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight segments. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|15|16.0}} and {{RA|16|25.1}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between 39.71° and 25.54°.<ref name="boundary">{{Cite journal | title=Corona Borealis, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#hyi | accessdate=12 October 2013 | postscript=. }}</ref> Covering 179 square degrees, Corona Borealis ranks 73rd in area.

[[Johann Bayer]] gave twenty stars in Corona Borealis [[Bayer designation]]s from Alpha to Upsilon in his 1603 [[star atlas]] ''[[Uranometria]]''. The components of the double star Zeta have since been designated Zeta<sup>1</sup> and Zeta<sup>2</sup>, and [[John Flamsteed]] equated his 20 and 21 Coronae Borealis with Nu<sup>1</sup> and Nu<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=wagman>{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, [[Virginia|VA]]  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=117–18}}</ref>

The seven stars that make up the constellation's figure are all 4th-magnitude stars, except for the constellation's brightest star, Alpha Coronae Borealis. This blue-white [[main-sequence star]], also called Alphekka and Gemma, is of magnitude 2.2, though it is an [[Algol]]-type [[eclipsing binary]]. It varies by 0.1 magnitudes with a period of 17.4 days.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} Alphekka is 75 light-years from Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Alpha+CrB&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id |title = Alpha Coronae Borealis—Eclipsing binary of Algol type (detached) |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 13 October 2013}}</ref>

The other six stars are [[Theta Coronae Borealis|Theta]], [[Beta Coronae Borealis|Beta]], [[Gamma Coronae Borealis|Gamma]], [[Delta Coronae Borealis|Delta]], [[Epsilon Coronae Borealis|Epsilon]], and [[Iota Coronae Borealis]].

Corona Borealis is home to several [[binary star|binary]] and [[double star]]s. [[Beta Coronae Borealis]] or Nusakan is a [[spectroscopic binary]] system located around 114 light-years away. The two components are separated by 10 astronomical units and orbit each other every 10.5 years.<ref name=kalerbeta>[http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/nusakan.html Nusakan], ''Stars'', Jim Kaler.  Accessed on line October 14, 2013.</ref> [[Zeta Coronae Borealis]] is a double star divisible in small telescopes. It has two blue-white components, 470 light-years from Earth. The primary is of magnitude 5.0 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0. Another double star is [[Nu Coronae Borealis]]; both components are 550 light-years from Earth but have different [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] and are assumed to be unrelated. The primary, [[Nu1 Coronae Borealis|Nu<sup>1</sup> Coronae Borealis]], is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 5.2; the secondary, [[Nu2 Coronae Borealis|Nu<sup>2</sup> Coronae Borealis]] is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.4. [[Sigma Coronae Borealis]], on the other hand, is a true [[binary star]]. Both components are yellow and orbit each other every 1000 years. The system, 71 light-years from Earth, has a primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.6. Sigma Coronae Borealis is divisible by small amateur telescopes.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} [[ADS 9731]] is a system composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.

Corona Borealis is home to two remarkable [[Variable star|variable]] stars. [[T Coronae Borealis]] is an exploding variable star also known as the Blaze Star.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} Normally placid around magnitude 10—it has a minimum of 10.2 and maximum of 9.9—it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours, caused by a [[nuclear chain reaction]] and the subsequent explosion. T Coronae Borealis is one of a handful of stars called [[recurrent nova]]e, which include [[RS Ophiuchi]], [[T Pyxidis]], [[V1017 Sagitarii]], and [[U Scorpii]]. An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its most recent outburst was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a [[binary star]] with a red-hued giant primary and a small blue secondary; its period is approximately 8 months.{{sfn|Levy|2005|pp=70–71}} [[R Coronae Borealis]] is a yellow-hued variable [[supergiant]] star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as [[R Coronae Borealis variable]]s. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. Though small dips in brightness occur sporadically, extreme decreases happened most recently in 1962, 1972, and 1977. Small carbon particles building up in the [[stellar atmosphere]] may be responsible.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}}

[[S Coronae Borealis]] is a [[Mira variable|Mira-type]] long period variable. [[RR Coronae Borealis]] is a [[stellar classification|M3-type]] [[semiregular variable star|semiregular]] [[variable star|variable]] [[star]]

The nearest star to Earth in the constellation is [[Gliese 611]], a binary system consisting of a yellow main-sequence star of spectral type G8V,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%402940202&Name=LHS%20%203152&submit=submit |title = LHS 3152—igh proper-motion Star  |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 13 October 2013}}</ref> and a [[red dwarf]] of spectral type M4.

Four star systems have been found to have [[Extrasolar planet|exoplanets]] to date. [[Kappa Coronae Borealis]] is an orange subgiant of spectral type K0III-IV that has a dust debris disk and one confirmed and one possible planet. [[Omicron Coronae Borealis]] is another K-type clump giant with one confirmed planet., believed to be, like [[HD 100655|HD 100655 b]], one of the two least massive planets known around clump giants. [[Rho Coronae Borealis]] is a [[Solar twin]], [[yellow dwarf]] around 57 [[light-year]]s distant. It has a planet around the size and mass of Jupiter orbiting it every 40 days. [[HD 145457]] is an orange giant of spectral type K0III found to have one planet.

=== Deep sky objects ===
Corona Borealis contains no bright [[deep-sky object]]s. [[Abell 2065]] is a highly concentrated [[galaxy cluster]] containing over 400 members, the brightest of which are [[apparent magnitude|16th magnitude]]. The cluster is more than one billion light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}}

In November 2013 astronomers discovered the largest structure in the universe that was found within this constellation, the [[Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall]].

== History and mythology ==
In [[Greek mythology]], Corona Borealis was sometimes considered to represent a crown that was given by [[Dionysus]] to [[Ariadne]], the daughter of [[Minos]] of Crete. When she wore the crown to her wedding, where she married Dionysus, he placed her crown in the heavens to commemorate the wedding.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=126–128}} In [[Welsh mythology]], it was called [[Caer Arianrhod]], "the Castle of the Silver Circle", and was the heavenly abode of the Lady [[Arianrhod]] (Squire, 2000:154–155). In [[Arabic mythology]], the constellation was known as "the bowl of the poor people" from the Arabic name قصعة المساكين, since the stars form an unsymmetrical pattern with an indent in one side, similar to the bowl of the poor. The Arabs also called the constellation Alphecca (a name later given to [[Alpha Coronae Borealis|Alpha Corona Borealis]]), which means "separated" or "broken up," a reference to the resemblance of the stars of Corona Borealis to a loose string of jewels.<ref>Paul Kunitzch and Tom Smart, ''A Short Guide to Modern Star Names and their Derivations'' (Harrassowitz, 1986).</ref>

== Equivalents ==
In [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy]], the constellation is called ''womera'' ("the boomerang") due to the shape of the stars.<ref>p. 151, [http://books.google.com/books?id=TIatz2DGXQwC Star Lore: Myths, Legends, and Facts], William Tyler Olcott, New York, Dover Publication Inc., 2004</ref>

The [[Cheyenne]] nation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] called the main stars of this constellation the "Camp Circle" as they arranged their camps in a semicircle. Native Americans also used stars to make designs in the ground at the Medicine Wheel in Bighorn National Forest, Wyoming, USA.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Corona Borealis are located within the [[Heavenly Market enclosure]] (天市垣, ''Tiān Shì Yuán'')<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0606/ap060626.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 6 月 26 日]</ref>

[[Polynesian people]]s often recognized Corona Borealis; it was likely called ''Te Hetu'' in the [[Tuamotus]], whose people called the constellation ''Na Kaua-ki-tokerau''. In [[Hawaii]], the constellation was likely called ''Kaua-mea''; it was called ''Rangawhenua'' in [[New Zealand]]. The figure of Corona Borealis was called ''Te Wale-o-Awitu'' in [[Pukapuka]]. Its name in [[Tonga]] was unsure; it was either called ''Ao-o-Uvea'' or ''Kau-kupenga''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=282}}
