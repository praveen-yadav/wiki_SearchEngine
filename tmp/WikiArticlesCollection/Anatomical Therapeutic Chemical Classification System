The '''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System''' is used for the [[taxonomic classification|classification]] of [[Medication|drug]]s. It is controlled by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC), and was first published in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_methodology/history/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC/DDD Methodology: History}}</ref>

This [[Pharmaceutical code|pharmaceutical coding system]] divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their [[medicine|therapeutic]] and [[chemical classification|chemical characteristics]]. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: [[acetylsalicylic acid]] (aspirin), for example, has {{ATC|A01|AD05}} as a drug for local [[mouth|oral]] treatment, {{ATC|B01|AC06}} as a [[platelet inhibitor]], and {{ATC|N02|BA01}} as an [[analgesic]] and [[antipyretic]]. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.

== Classification ==
In this system, drugs are classified into groups at 5 different levels:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC: Structure and principles}}</ref>

=== First level ===
The first level of the code indicates the anatomical main group and consists of one letter. There are 14 main groups:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATC/DDD Index}}</ref>

=== Second level ===
The second level of the code indicates the therapeutic main group and consists of two digits.

''Example'': [[ATC code C03|C'''03''']] [[Diuretic]]s

=== Third level ===
The third level of the code indicates the therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

''Example'': C03'''C''' High-ceiling diuretics

=== Fourth level ===
The fourth level of the code indicates the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

''Example'': C03C'''A''' [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|Sulfonamide]]s

=== Fifth level ===
The fifth level of the code indicates the chemical substance and consists of two digits.

''Example'': C03CA'''01''' [[Furosemide]]

=== ATCvet ===
The ''Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System for veterinary medicinal products'' (ATCvet) is used to classify [[veterinary]] drugs. ATCvet codes can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the ATC code of most human medications. For example, furosemide for veterinary use has the code '''Q'''C03CA01.

Some codes are used exclusively for veterinary drugs, such as ''[[ATCvet code QI|QI]] Immunologicals'', ''[[ATCvet code QJ51|QJ51]] Antibacterials for intramammary use'' or ''QN05AX90 [[amperozide]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/atcvet/atcvet_classification_system/general_principles/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=ATCvet classification system: General principles}}</ref>

== Defined daily dose ==
{{main|Defined daily dose}}
The ATC system also includes defined daily doses (DDDs) for many drugs. This is a measurement of drug consumption based on the usual daily dose for a given drug. According to the definition, "[t]he DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whocc.no/ddd/definition_and_general_considera/|publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology|title=DDD: Definition and general considerations}}</ref>

==National adaptations==
National issues of the ATC classification, such as the [[Germany|German]] ''Anatomisch-therapeutisch-chemische Klassifikation mit Tagesdosen'', may include additional codes and DDDs not present in the WHO version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dimdi.de/static/de/klassi/atcddd/atc-gesetze.htm|publisher=Deutsches Institut f√ºr Medizinische Dokumentation und Information|title=ATC-Klassifikation mit DDD: Gesetzlicher Hintergrund|language=German}}</ref>
