{{Politics of Costa Rica}}
[[Costa Rica]] is an active member of the international community and, in 1983, claimed it was for [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. Due to certain powerful constituencies{{who|date=July 2013}} favoring its methods, it has a weight in world affairs far beyond its size. The country lobbied aggressively for the establishment of the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and became the first nation to recognize the jurisdiction of the [[Inter-American Human Rights Court]], based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].

Then-President [[Óscar Arias]] authored a regional plan in 1987 that served as the basis for the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement]] and Arias was awarded the 1987 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work. Arias also promoted change in the USSR-backed Nicaraguan government of the era. Costa Rica also hosted several rounds of negotiations between the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran Government]] and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), aiding El Salvador's efforts to emerge from civil war and culminating in that country's 1994 free and fair elections. Costa Rica has been a strong proponent of regional arms-limitation agreements. Former President Miguel Ángel Rodríguez recently proposed the abolition of all [[Central America]]n militaries and the creation of a regional counternarcotics police force in their stead.

With the establishment of democratically-elected governments in all Central American nations by the 1990s, Costa Rica turned its focus from regional conflicts to the pursuit of neoliberal policies on the isthmus. The influence of these policies, along with the US invasion of Panama, was instrumental in drawing [[Panama]] into the Central American model of [[neoliberalism]]. Costa Rica also participated in the multinational [[Partnership for Democracy and Development in Central America]].

Regional political integration has not proven attractive to Costa Rica. The country debated its role in the Central American integration process under former President Calderon. Costa Rica has sought concrete economic ties with its Central American neighbors rather than the establishment of regional political institutions, and it chose not to join the [[Central American Parliament]]. President Figueres promoted a higher profile for Costa Rica in regional and international fora. Costa Rica gained election as President of the Group of 77 in the [[United Nations]] in 1995. That term ended in 1997 with the South-South Conference held in San Jose. Costa Rica occupied a nonpermanent seat in the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] from 1997 to 1999 and exercised a leadership role in confronting crises in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], as well as in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It is currently a member of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. On Jan. 1 2008 Costa Rica started its third year term on the Security council.

Costa Rica strongly backed efforts by the United States to implement [[UN Security Council Resolution 940]], which led to the restoration of the democratically elected Government of [[Haiti]] in October 1994. Costa Rica was among the first to call for a postponement of the May 22 elections in [[Peru]] when international observer missions found electoral machinery not prepared for the vote count.

Costa Rica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], without a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]])

Soon after [[Fidel Castro]] declared [[Cuba]] a [[Communist regime|socialist state]], Costa Rican President [[Mario Echandi]] ended diplomatic relations on 10 September 1961 with the island through ''Executive Decree Number 2'', in compliance with sanctions placed on Cuba by the [[Organization of American States]].  In 1995, Costa Rica established a [[consular office]] in [[Havana]]. Cuba opened a consular office in Costa Rica in 2001. Forty-seven years after the initial freeze, Costa Rican President [[Óscar Arias|Óscar Arias Sánchez]] announced on 18 March 2009 that normal relations were to be re-established, saying, "If we have been able to turn the page with regimes as profoundly different to our reality as occurred with the USSR or, more recently, with the Republic of China, how would we not do it with a country that is geographically and culturally much nearer to Costa Rica?" Arias also announced that both countries would exchange ambassadors.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-03-18/world/costa.rica.cuba.ties_1_costa-rica-president-oscar-arias-cuban-people?_s=PM:WORLD Costa Rica re-establishes ties with Cuba] CNN World, 2009-03-18.</ref> The next day, Cuba's government announced that it agreed to re-establishing relations.

===United States===
{{main|Costa Rica – United States relations}}

The United States is Costa Rica's most important trading partner. The U.S. accounts for almost half of Costa Rica's [[exports]], [[imports]], and [[tourism]], and more than two-thirds of its foreign investment. The two countries share growing [[Environmental protection|concerns for the environment]] and want to preserve Costa Rica's important tropical resources and prevent environmental degradation. In 2007, the United States reduced Costa Rica's debt in exchange for protection and conservation of Costa Rican forests through a debt for nature swap under the auspices of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. This is the largest such agreement of its kind to date.
