A '''campus''' is traditionally the land on which a [[college]] or [[university]] and related institutional buildings are situated. Usually a campus includes [[library|libraries]], [[lecture]] halls, [[residence hall]]s, student centers or dining halls, and park-like settings. The definition currently describes a collection of buildings that belong to a given institution, either academic or non-academic.

The word derives from a [[Latin]] word for "field" and was first used to describe the grounds of a college at the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) during the 18th century.<ref>Douglas Harper, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=campus Campus], ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', accessed October 2, 2011</ref> Some other American colleges later adopted the word to describe individual fields at their own institutions, but "campus" did not yet describe the whole university property. A school might have one space called a campus, one called a field, and another called a yard. 

The meaning expanded to include the whole institutional [[real property|property]] during the 20th century, with the old meaning persisting into the 1950s in some places. Sometimes the lands on which company office buildings sit, along with the buildings, are called campuses. The [[Microsoft Campus]] in [[Redmond, Washington]], as well as [[hospital]]s use the term to describe the territory of their facilities. The word "campus" has also been applied to European universities, although most such institutions are characterized by ownership of individual buildings in urban settings rather than park-like lawns in which buildings are placed.
