==History==
The school was founded in 1949 under the name '''United Baptist Bible Training School''' (UBBTS), and served as both a [[secondary school]] and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist College''' (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in 1983.<ref>http://www.crandallu.ca/cu/history Crandall University - History</ref> Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of [[Moncton]]'s central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to '''Atlantic Baptist University''', a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. ABU sports teams play under the name ''Blue Tide''. The institution was the first, and thus far only, [[English language|English]] university in Moncton. The ''Atlantic Baptist University Act'' was passed by the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] in 2008.<ref>http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/FILE/56/2/Bill-64-e.htm Atlantic Baptist University Act</ref>

In 2009, a $24 million expansion to the campus, including a new academic building, a second residence and a sports complex were unveiled. The new academic building and residence are completed and will allow the student enrollment to increase to 1200.

On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to '''Crandall University''' in honour of Rev. [[Joseph Crandall]], a pioneering Baptist minister in New Brunswick.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/08/21/nb-atlantic-baptist-university-crandall-557.html Atlantic Baptist University changes name</ref>
In 2011 Crandall University got a new Chargers mascot for the changes to the school in 2011.

In 2012, Crandall University came under public scrutiny for receiving municipal funds despite having an anti-gay hiring policy.<ref>http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/01/new_brunswick_university_under_fire_for_antigay_hiring_policy.html</ref><ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/05/31/nb-crandall-hiring-policy-205.html</ref>  Crandall University is an affiliate of the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]].

==Controversy==
The University has been criticized by some who say public money (municipal, provincial and federal) has been used to fund programs and expansions to a school with anti-gay policies. The school's Moral Code states that sexual relationships are to take place in the confines of a marriage between one man and one woman - staff and faculty are expected to adhere to the University's Moral Code.<ref name="CBC_Controversy_1">{{Citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/02/05/nb-crandall-university-funding-709.html |title=Crandall University drops request for city funding |newspaper= CBC.ca|date=2013-02-05|accessdate=2013-04-06}}</ref>
