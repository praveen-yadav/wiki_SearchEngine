'''Chemotherapy''' (often abbreviated to '''chemo''') is the treatment of [[cancer]] with one or more [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] anti-[[neoplastic]] drugs ("chemotherapeutic agents") as part of a [[chemotherapy regimen|standardized regimen]]. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]]. It is often used in conjunction with other cancer treatments, such as [[radiation therapy]] or [[surgery]]. Certain chemotherapeutic agents also have a role in the treatment of other conditions, including [[ankylosing spondylitis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[psoriasis]], [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[scleroderma]].

Traditional chemotherapeutic agents act by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. This means that chemotherapy also harms cells that divide rapidly under normal circumstances: cells in the [[bone marrow]], [[digestive tract]], and [[hair follicle]]s. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: [[myelosuppression]] (decreased production of blood cells, hence also [[immunosuppression]]), [[mucositis]] (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and [[alopecia]] (hair loss).

Some newer anticancer drugs (for example, various [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|monoclonal antibodies]]) are not indiscriminately cytotoxic, but rather target proteins that are abnormally expressed in cancer cells and that are essential for their growth. Such treatments are often referred to as [[targeted therapy]] (as distinct from classic chemotherapy) and are often used alongside traditional chemotherapeutic agents in antineoplastic treatment regimens.

Chemotherapy may use one drug at a time ('''single-agent chemotherapy''') or several drugs at once ('''combination chemotherapy''' or '''polychemotherapy'''). Chemotherapy using drugs that convert to cytotoxic activity only upon light exposure is called '''photochemotherapy''' or [[photodynamic therapy]].

An older and broader use of the word chemotherapy encompassed any chemical treatment of disease (for example, treatment of infections with [[antimicrobial]] agents). However, this use has become [[Archaism|archaic]].

==History==
{{Main|History of cancer chemotherapy}}
[[File:Sidney Farber nci-vol-1926-300.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sidney Farber]] is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy.]]
The first use of drugs to treat cancer was in the early 20th century, although it was not originally intended for that purpose. [[Mustard gas]] was used as a [[chemical warfare]] agent during [[World War I]] and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of [[hematopoiesis]] (blood production).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Krumbhaar EB |title=tole of the blood and the bone marrow in certain forms of gas poisoning |journal=JAMA |volume=72 |pages=39–41 |year=1919 |doi=10.1001/jama.1919.26110010018009f }}</ref> A similar family of compounds known as [[nitrogen mustards]] were studied further during [[World War II]] at Yale University.<ref name="gilman">{{cite journal |author=Gilman A |title=The initial clinical trial of nitrogen mustard|journal=Am.

===The term ''chemotherapy''===

Chemotherapy is described in one dictionary entry as "the treatment of disease by the use of chemical substances, especially the treatment of cancer by cytotoxic and other drugs." The word "chemotherapy" without a modifier usually refers to cancer treatment, but its historical meaning is broader. The term was historically used for non-[[Oncology|oncological]] references, such as the use of [[antibiotic]]s (''antibacterial chemotherapy''). The first modern chemotherapeutic agent was [[arsphenamine]], an arsenic compound discovered in 1909 and used to treat [[syphilis]].<ref name="pmid19868743">{{cite journal |author=Nichols HJ, Walker JE|title=Experimental observations on the prophyaxis and treatment of syphilis |journal=J.

Other uses that have been termed chemotherapy are the treatment of [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[multiple sclerosis]], [[dermatomyositis]], [[polymyositis]], [[lupus]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==General mode of action in cancer==
[[File:Cell cycle simple.png|thumb|The four phases of the cell cycle. G1 - the initial growth phase. S - the phase in which DNA is synthesised.

[[Cancer]] is the uncontrolled growth of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s coupled with [[malignant]] behaviour: invasion and [[metastasis]] (among other features).<ref name="pmid10647931">{{cite journal |author=Hanahan D, Weinberg RA |title=The hallmarks of cancer|journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |year=2000 |month=January |pmid=10647931 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81683-9|url=}}</ref> It is caused by the interaction between [[gene]]tic susceptibility and environmental factors.<ref name="pmid18196605">{{cite journal|author=Hodgson S |title=Mechanisms of inherited cancer susceptibility |journal=J Zhejiang Univ Sci B |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–4|year=2008 |month=January |pmid=18196605 |pmc=2170461 |doi=10.1631/jzus.B073001 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid9353182">{{cite journal|author=Perera FP |title=Environment and cancer: who are susceptible? |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5340 |pages=1068–73 |year=1997|month=November |pmid=9353182 |doi= 10.1126/science.278.5340.1068|url=|bibcode=1997Sci...278.1068P}}</ref> These factors lead to accumulations of [[genetic mutation]]s in [[oncogene]]s (genes that promote cancer) and [[tumor supressor gene]]s (genes that help to prevent cancer), which gives cancer cells their malignant characteristics, such as uncontrolled growth.<ref>Randall, pp, 93-94</ref>

In the broad sense, most chemotherapeutic drugs work by impairing [[mitosis]] ([[cell division]]), effectively targeting [[fast-dividing cells]]. As these drugs cause damage to cells, they are termed ''cytotoxic''. They prevent mitosis by various mechanisms including damaging DNA and inhibition of the cellular machinery involved in cell division.<ref name="pmid19651324">{{cite journal |author=Kehe K, Balszuweit F, Steinritz D, Thiermann H |title=Molecular toxicology of sulfur mustard-induced cutaneous inflammation and blistering |journal=Toxicology |volume=263 |issue=1 |pages=12–9 |year=2009 |month=September|pmid=19651324 |doi=10.1016/j.tox.2009.01.019 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid14508075">{{cite journal |author=Malhotra V, Perry MC |title=Classical chemotherapy: mechanisms, toxicities and the therapeutic window |journal=Cancer Biol.

As chemotherapy affects cell division, tumors with high [[proliferative index|growth rates]] (such as [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] and the aggressive [[lymphoma]]s, including [[Hodgkin's disease]]) are more sensitive to chemotherapy, as a larger proportion of the targeted cells are undergoing [[cell division]] at any time.

==Types==

[[File:Cross-linked DNA by nitrogen mustard.png|thumb|left| Two DNA bases that are cross-linked by a nitrogen mustard. Different nitrogen mustards will have different chemical groups (R). The nitrogen mustards most commonly alkylate the N7 nitrogen of guanine (as shown here) but other atoms can be alkylated.<ref name =Siddik/>]]

===Alkylating agents===
{{Main|Alkylating antineoplastic agent}}
Alkylating agents are the oldest group of chemotherapeutics in use today. Originally derived from [[mustard gas]] used in the war, there are now many types of alkylating agents in use.<ref name=Corrie/> They are so named because of their ability to [[alkylation|alkylate]] many molecules, including [[protein]]s, [[RNA]] and [[DNA]]. This ability to bind [[covalent bond|covalently]] to DNA via their [[alkyl group]] is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects.<ref name=lind>{{cite journal|last=Lind M.J.|title=Principles of cytotoxic chemotherapy|journal=Medicine|year=2008|volume=36|issue=1|pages=19–23|doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2007.10.003|first1=M.J.}}</ref> DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during [[cell division]], or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called [[apoptosis]].<ref name =Siddik>{{cite book|last=Siddik ZH|title=Mechanisms of Action of Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents: DNA-Interactive Alkylating Agents and Antitumour Platinum-Based Drugs|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0470025077.chap84b/abstract}}</ref><ref name="pmid19002790"/> Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.<ref name="pmid14508075"/>

The subtypes of alkylating agents are the [[nitrogen mustard]]s, [[nitrosoureas]], [[tetrazine]]s,  [[aziridine]]s, [[cisplatin]]s and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include [[mechlorethamine]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[melphalan]], [[chlorambucil]], [[ifosfamide]] and [[busulfan]]. Nitrosoureas include [[N-Nitroso-N-methylurea]] (MNU), [[carmustine]] (BCNU), [[lomustine]] (CCNU) and [[semustine]] (MeCCNU), [[fotemustine]] and [[streptozotocin]]. Tetrazines include [[dacarbazine]], [[mitozolomide]] and [[temozolomide]]. Aziridines include [[thiotepa]], [[mytomycin]] and diaziquone (AZQ).

===Anti-metabolites===
[[File:Deoxcytidine, Gemcitidine and Decitabine.png|thumb|Deoxcytidine (left) and two anti-metabolite drugs (centre and right); [[Gemcitabine]] and [[Decitabine]]. The drugs are very similar but they have subtle differences in their [[chemical group]]s.]]
{{Main|Antimetabolite}}
[[Anti-metabolite]]s are a group of molecules that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many of them have a similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are [[nucleotide]]s; a molecule comprising a [[nucleobase]], a sugar and a [[phosphate group]]. The nucleobases are divided into [[purine]]s ([[guanine]] and [[adenine]]) and [[pyrimidine]]s ([[cytosine]], [[thymine]] and [[uracil]]). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered [[chemical group]]s.<ref name="pmid19476376">{{cite journal |author=Parker WB |title=Enzymology of purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites used in the treatment of cancer |journal=Chem. Rev. |volume=109 |issue=7 |pages=2880–93 |year=2009 |month=July |pmid=19476376 |pmc=2827868 |doi=10.1021/cr900028p |url=}}</ref> These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorperation of the molecules into DNA, [[DNA damage]] can occur and programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case [[S-phase]] (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the [[antifolate|anti-folate]]s, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and [[thiopurine]]s.<ref name=lind/><ref name="pmid19476376"/>

The anti-folates include [[methotrexate]] and [[pemetrexed]]. Methotrexate inhibits [[dihydrofolate reductase]] (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates [[tetrahydrofolate]] from [[dihydrofolate]]. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These are required for [[thymidylate]] and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2">Wood, p. 11</ref><ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/> Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme [[thymidylate synthase]], but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and [[glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase]].<ref name="pmid15217974">{{cite journal |author=Adjei AA |title=Pemetrexed (ALIMTA), a novel multitargeted antineoplastic agent |journal=Clin.

Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2"/> Capecitabine is a [[prodrug]] of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug.<ref name="pmid12515569">{{cite journal |author=Wagstaff AJ, Ibbotson T, Goa KL |title=Capecitabine: a review of its pharmacology and therapeutic efficacy in the management of advanced breast cancer |journal=Drugs |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=217–36 |year=2003 |pmid=12515569 |doi= 10.2165/00003495-200363020-00009|url=}}</ref> The deoxynucleoside analogues include [[cytarabine]], [[gemcitabine]], [[decitabine]], [[Vidaza]], [[fludarabine]], [[nelarabine]], [[cladribine]], [[clofarabine]] and [[pentostatin]].

===Anti-microtubule agents===
[[File:Microtubules and alkaloids.png|thumb|left|Vinca alkaloids prevent the assembly of microtubules, whereas taxanes prevent their disassembly. Both mechanisms cause defective mitosis.]]
Anti-microtubule agents are [[plant]]-derived chemicals that block cell division by preventing [[microtubule]] function. Microtubules are an important cellular structure composed of two proteins; [[α-tubulin]] and [[β-tubulin]]. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions.<ref name="pmid1687171">{{cite journal |author=Rowinsky EK, Donehower RC |title=The clinical pharmacology and use of antimicrotubule agents in cancer chemotherapeutics |journal=Pharmacol. Ther. |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=35–84 |year=1991 |month=October |pmid=1687171 |doi= 10.1016/0163-7258(91)90086-2|url=}}</ref> Microtubules are dynamic structures, which means that they are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. [[Vinca alkaloid]]s and [[taxane]]s are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule disfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The vinca alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programed cell death ([[apoptosis]]).<ref name=lind/><ref name="pmid20577942"/> Also, these drugs can affect blood vessel growth; an essential process that tumours utilise in order to grow and metastasise.<ref name="pmid20577942">{{cite journal |author=Yue QX, Liu X, Guo DA |title=Microtubule-binding natural products for cancer therapy |journal=Planta Med. |volume=76 |issue=11 |pages=1037–43 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=20577942 |doi=10.1055/s-0030-1250073 |url=}}</ref>

Vinca alkaloids are derived from the [[Madagascar periwinkle]], ''Catharanthus roseus'' (formerly known as ''Vinca rosea''). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are completely natural chemicals, which include; [[vincristine]] and [[vinblastine]]. Following the success of these drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced; [[vinorelbine]], [[vindesine]] and [[vinflunine]].<ref name="pmid20577942"/> These drugs are [[cell cycle]] specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in [[S-phase]] and provent proper microtubule formation required for [[M-phase]].<ref name="pmid14508075"/>

Taxanes are natural and semi-synthetic drugs. The first drug of their class, [[paclitaxel]], was originally extracted from the [[Pacific Yew]] tree, ''Taxus brevifolia''.  Now this drug and another in this class, [[docetaxel]], are produced semi-synthetically from a chemical found in the bark of another Yew tree; ''[[Taxus baccata]]''. These drugs promote microtubule stability, preventing their disassembly. Paclitaxel prevents the cell cycle at the boundary of G2-M, whereas docetaxel exerts its effect during [[S-phase]]. Taxanes present difficulties in formulation as medicines because they are poorly soluble in water.<ref name="pmid20577942"/>

[[Podophyllotoxin]] is an anti-neoplastic [[lignan]] primarily obtained from the [[American Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum peltatum'') and [[Himalayan Mayapple]] (''Podophyllum hexandrum'' or ''Podophyllum emodi''). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism is similar to that of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action; [[etoposide]] and [[teniposide]].<ref name="pmid9562603">{{cite journal |author=Damayanthi Y, Lown JW |title=Podophyllotoxins: current status and recent developments |journal=Curr.

===Topoisomerase inhibitors===
[[File:Topoisomerase Inhibitor.JPG|thumb|Topoisomerase I and II Inhibitors]]
[[Topoisomerase inhibitor]]s are drugs that affect the activity of two enzymes; [[topoisomerase I]] and [[topoisomerase II]]. When the DNA double stranded helix is unwound, during DNA replication or [[translation (biology)|translation]] for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening the middle of a twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single or double strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during [[DNA replication|replication]] or [[translation (biology)|translation]]. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL, et al.|title=Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, [[irinotecan]] and [[topotecan]], are semi-synthetically derived from [[camptothecin]], which is obtained from the Chinese ornamental tree ''[[Camptotheca acuminata]]''.<ref name="pmid14508075"/> Drugs that target topoisomerase II can be divided into two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and [[translation (biology)|translation]], causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]). These agents include [[etoposide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[mitoxantrone]] and [[teniposide]]. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes [[novobiocin]], merbarone, and [[aclarubicin]], which also have other significant mechanisms of action.<ref name="pmid19377506">{{cite journal |author=Nitiss JL |title=Targeting DNA topoisomerase II in cancer chemotherapy |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=338–50 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19377506 |pmc=2748742 |doi=10.1038/nrc2607 |url=}}</ref>

===Cytotoxic antibiotics===
The cytotoxic antibiotics are a varied group of drugs that have various mechanisms of action. The group includes the [[anthracycline]]s and other drugs including [[actinomycin]], [[bleomycin]], [[plicamycin]] and [[mitomycin]]. [[Doxorubicin]] and [[daunorubicin]] were the first two anthracyclines, and were obtained from the [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptomyces peucetius]]''. Derivatives of these compounds include [[epirubicin]] and [[idarubicin]]. Other clinically used drugs in the anthracyline group are [[pirarubicin]], [[aclarubicin]] and [[mitoxantrone]]. The mechanisms of anthracyclines include [[DNA intercalation]] (molecules insert between the two strands of DNA), generation of highly reactive [[free radicals]] that damage intercellular molecules and topoisomerase inhibition.<ref name="pmid15169927">{{cite journal |author=Minotti G, Menna P, Salvatorelli E, Cairo G, Gianni L |title=Anthracyclines: molecular advances and pharmacologic developments in antitumor activity and cardiotoxicity |journal=Pharmacol.

There are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today. Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|palliate symptoms]].

*Combined modality chemotherapy is the use of drugs with other [[Cancer#Treatments|cancer treatments]], such as [[radiation therapy]] or [[surgery]].
*Induction chemotherapy is the first line treatment of cancer with a chemotherapeutic drug. This type of chemotherapy is used for curative intent.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8">Airley, pp. 55-59</ref> 
*Consolidation chemotherapy is the given after remission in order to prolong the overall disease free time and improve overall survival. The drug that is administered is the same as the drug that achieved remission.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/>
*Intensification chemotherapy is identical to consolidation chemotherapy but a different drug than the induction chemotherapy is used.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/>
*[[Combination chemotherapy]] involves treating a patient with a number of different drugs simultaneously. The drugs differ in their mechanism and side effects. The biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent. Also, the drugs can often be used at lower doses, reducing toxicity.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/><ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 6">Wood, pp. 17-18</ref>
*[[Neoadjuvant]] chemotherapy is given prior to a local treatment such as surgery, and is designed to shrink the primary tumor.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/> It is also given to cancers with a high risk of micrometastatic disease.<ref name="isbn0-7817-7328-8">Perry, p. 42</ref>
*[[Adjuvant chemotherapy]] is given after a local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery). It can be used when there is little evidence of cancer present, but there is risk of recurrence.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/> It is also useful in killing any cancerous cells that have spread to other parts of the body. These [[micrometastases]] can be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and can reduce relapse rates caused by these disseminated cells.<ref name="pmid16061845">{{cite journal |author=Epstein RJ |title=Maintenance therapy to suppress micrometastasis: the new challenge for adjuvant cancer treatment |journal=Clin. Cancer Res. |volume=11 |issue=15 |pages=5337–41|year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16061845 |doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0437 |url=}}</ref>
*[[Maintenance therapy|Maintenance]] chemotherapy is a repeated low-dose treatment to prolong remission.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/>
*Salvage chemotherapy or palliative chemotherapy is given without curative intent, but simply to decrease tumor load and increase life expectancy. For these regimens, a better toxicity profile is generally expected.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8"/>

All chemotherapy regimens require that the patient be capable of undergoing the treatment. [[Performance status]] is often used as a measure to determine whether a patient can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment ([[fractional kill]]), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.<ref name=skeel>{{cite book |last1=Skeel |first1= R.

==Dosage==
[[File:Screenshot at 2013-08-16 14 52 30.png|thumb|left|Dose response relationship of cell killing by chemotherapeutic drugs on normal and cancer cells. At high doses the percentage of normal and cancer cells killed is very similar. For this reason, doses are chosen where anti-tumour activity exceeds normal cell death.<ref name=Corrie/>]]
Dosage of chemotherapy can be difficult: If the dose is too low, it will be ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity ([[adverse effect|side-effects]]) will be intolerable to the patient.<ref name=Corrie/> This has led to the formation of detailed "dosing schemes" in most hospitals, which give guidance on the correct dose and adjustment in case of toxicity.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In immunotherapy (treatment of [[autoimmune disorder]]s), they are in principle used in smaller dosages than in the treatment of malignant diseases.<ref name="pmid15100330">{{cite journal |author=Ben-Ari ET |title=Dual purpose: some cancer therapies used to treat autoimmune diseases |journal=J.

The standard method of calculating dosage is based on calculated [[body surface area]] (BSA), a measure that correlates with blood volume. The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a [[nomogram]], using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement. This method was originally used in the 1960s to calculate a uniform dose to patients in clinical trials. Recently, the validity of this method in calculating uniform doses has been questioned. The reason for this is that the formula only takes into account the individual's weight or height. Other factors, such as [[drug clearance]], have major effects on the actual dose to an individual on chemotherapy, which can lead to sub-optimal dosing.<ref name="pmid11953888">{{cite journal |author=Gurney H |title=How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy |journal=Br.

[[Carboplatin]] is one of the only drugs that is not dosed depending on the BSA method. Another method, [[area under the curve (pharmacokinetics)|area under the curve]] (AUC), is employed to individualise the dosing. In this method, the drug levels in the [[blood plasma]] are measured over time. The area under this curve is used in conjunction with the [[glomerular filtration rate|renal function]] of the individual receiving chemotherapy to obtain the optimal dose.<ref name="isbn0-521-61816-9"/>

==Delivery==
[[File:Cyclophosphamide iv.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Cyclophosphamide]] IV drip]]
Most chemotherapy is [[Route of administration|delivered]] [[intravenous therapy|intravenously]], although a number of agents can be administered orally (e.g., [[melphalan]], [[busulfan]], [[capecitabine]]).

There are many intravenous methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the [[Winged infusion set|winged infusion device]], [[Intravenous therapy#Peripheral cannula|peripheral cannula]], midline catheter, [[peripherally inserted central catheter]] (PICC), [[central venous catheter]] and [[implantable port]]. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery and types of chemotherapeutic agent.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 3">{{cite book |author=Wood, Miriam; David Brighton|title=The Royal Marsden Hospital handbook of cancer chemotherapy: a guide for the multidisciplinary team |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingstone |location=St. Louis, Mo |year=2005|pages=93–94 |isbn=0-443-07101-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Depending on the patient, the cancer, the stage of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, intravenous chemotherapy may be given on either an [[inpatient]] or an [[outpatient]] basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 5">Wood, pp. 113-118</ref> Commonly used systems are the [[Hickman line]], the [[Port-a-Cath]], and the [[PICC line]]. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to [[phlebitis]] or [[extravasation]], and eliminate the need for repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Topical chemotherapies, such as [[5-fluorouracil]], are used to treat some cases of [[non-melanoma skin cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chitwood|first=K|coauthors=Etzkorn, J; Cohen, G|title=Topical and intralesional treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer: efficacy and cost comparisons.|journal=Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.]|date=2013 Sep|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1306-16|pmid=23915332}}</ref>

If the cancer has [[central nervous system]] involvement, or with meningeal disease, [[intrathecal]] chemotherapy may be administered.<ref name=Corrie/>

==Adverse effects==

[[Chemotherapeutic]] techniques have a range of side-effects that depend on the type of medications used. The most common medications affect mainly the [[fast-dividing cells]] of the body, such as blood cells and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Chemotherapy related toxicities can occur acutely after administration, within hours or days, or chronically, from weeks to years.<ref name="isbn0-470-09254-8 2">Airley, p. 265</ref>

===Immunosuppression and myelosuppression===
Virtually all chemotherapeutic regimens can cause depression of the [[immune system]], often by paralysing the [[bone marrow]] and leading to a decrease of [[white blood cell]]s, [[red blood cell]]s, and [[platelet]]s.
[[Anemia]] and [[thrombocytopenia]], when they occur, are improved with [[blood transfusion]]. [[Neutropenia]] (a decrease of the [[neutrophil granulocyte]] count below 0.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/[[litre]]) can be improved with synthetic [[G-CSF]] ([[granulocyte]]-colony-stimulating factor, e.g., [[filgrastim]], [[lenograstim]]).

In very severe [[myelosuppression]], which occurs in some regimens, almost all the bone marrow [[stem cell]]s (cells that produce [[white blood cells|white]] and [[red blood cell]]s) are destroyed, meaning ''allogenic'' or ''[[autologous]]'' [[bone marrow transplant|bone marrow cell transplants]] are necessary. (In autologous BMTs, cells are removed from the patient before the treatment, multiplied and then re-injected afterward; in ''allogenic'' BMTs, the source is a donor.) However, some patients still develop diseases because of this interference with bone marrow.

Although patients are encouraged to wash their hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own [[gastrointestinal tract]] (including [[oral cavity]]) and skin.<ref name="internal_medicine_a05">Huang, p. 130</ref> This may manifest as systemic infections, such as [[sepsis]], or as localized outbreaks, such as [[Herpes simplex]], [[shingles]], or other members of the [[human herpes virus|Herpesviridea]].<ref name="HSV">{{cite journal |author1=Elad S |author2=Zadik Y |author3=Hewson I |author4=Hovan A |author5=Correa ME |author6=Logan R |author7=Elting LS |author8=Spijkervet FK |author9=Brennan MT |author10=Viral Infections Section |author11=Oral Care Study Group |author12=Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC)/International Society of Oral Oncology (ISOO) |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993–1006 |year=2010 |month=August|pmid=20544224 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/g476114717852h80/ |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3}}</ref> Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.

In [[Japan]], the government has approved the use of some [[medicinal mushrooms]] like ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', to counteract depression of the immune system in patients undergoing chemotherapy.<ref name="psk">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Coriolous_Versicolor.asp |title=Coriolus Versicolor |publisher=Cancer.org|date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>

===Typhlitis===
Due to immune system suppression, [[typhlitis]] is a "life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of chemotherapy."<ref>PMID 16319675</ref> [[Typhlitis]] is an intestinal infection which may manifest itself through symptoms including [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], a [[distended abdomen]], [[fever]], [[chills]], or [[abdominal pain|abdominal pain and tenderness]].

[[Typhlitis]] is a [[medical emergency]]. It has a very poor [[prognosis]] and is often fatal unless promptly recognized and aggressively treated.<ref name="Keidan 1989 206–9">{{cite journal|last=Keidan|first=RD|coauthors=Fanning, Gatenby, Weese|title=Recurrent typhlitis.

===Gastrointestinal distress===

[[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], [[diarrhea]], abdominal cramps and [[constipation]] are common side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells.<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Gibson RJ, Keefe DM |title=Cancer chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and constipation: mechanisms of damage and prevention strategies |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=890–900 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid= 16604351|doi=10.1007/s00520-006-0040-y |url=}}</ref> [[Malnutrition]] and [[dehydration]] can result when the patient does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much in an effort to allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with [[antiemetic]] drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or [[Ginger#Medicinal use|ginger]] tea, are often recommended. This is generally a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However a high [[index of suspicion]] is appropriate, since [[diarrhea]] and bloating are also symptoms of [[typhlitis]], a very serious and potentially life-threatening [[medical emergency]] which requires immediate treatment.

===Anemia===

[[Anemia]] in cancer patients can be a combined outcome caused by myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and possible cancer-related causes such as [[bleeding]], [[blood cell]] destruction ([[hemolysis]]), hereditary disease, kidney disfunction, nutritional 
deficiencies and/or [[anemia of chronic disease]]. Treatments to mitigate anemia include hormones to boost blood production ([[erythropoietin]]), [[iron supplement]]s, and [[blood transfusion]]s.<ref name="pmid10511589">{{cite journal |author=Groopman JE, Itri LM |title=Chemotherapy-induced anemia in adults: incidence and treatment |journal=J.

===Fatigue===
[[Cancer-related fatigue|Fatigue]] may be a consequence of the cancer or its treatment, and can last for months to years after treatment.

=== Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) ===
{{Further|Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting}}
[[Nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are two of the most feared cancer treatment-related side-effects for cancer patients and their families. In 1983, Coates et al. found that patients receiving chemotherapy ranked nausea and vomiting as the first- and second-most-severe side-effects, respectively. Up to 20% of patients receiving highly emetogenic agents in this era postponed, or even refused, potentially curative treatments.<ref>{{cite journal

Since the 1990s, several novel classes of [[antiemetics]] have been developed and commercialized, becoming a nearly universal standard in chemotherapy regimens, and helping to successfully manage these symptoms in a large portion of patients. Effective mediation of these unpleasant and sometimes-crippling symptoms results in increased quality of life for the patient and more efficient treatment cycles, due to less stoppage of treatment due to better tolerance by the patient, and due to better overall health of the patient.

===Hair loss===
[[Alopecia|Hair loss]] (Alopecia) can be caused by chemotherapy that kills rapidly dividing cells; other medications may cause hair to thin.  These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow a few weeks after the last treatment, and sometimes can change colour, texture, thickness and style. Sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth, resulting in "chemo curls." Severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as [[doxorubicin]], [[daunorubicin]], [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]], [[cyclophosphamide]], [[ifosfamide]] and [[etoposide]]. Permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens.

Chemotherapy induced hair loss occurs by a non-androgenic mechanism, and can manifests as [[alopecia totalis]], telogen effluvium, or less often [[alopecia areata]].<ref name="pmid17642856">{{cite pmid|17642856}}</ref> It is usually associated with systemic treatment due to the high mitotic rate of hair follicles, and more reversible than androgenic hair loss,<ref name="pmid23187775">{{cite pmid|23187775}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid|9589208}}</ref> although permanent cases can occur.<ref>{{cite pmid|20487675}}</ref> Chemotherapy induces hair loss in women more often than men.<ref>{{cite pmid|22901547}}</ref>

===Secondary neoplasm===
Development of secondary neoplasia after successful chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment can occur. The most common [[secondary neoplasm]] is secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which develops primarily after treatment with alkylating agents or topoisomerase inhibitors.<ref>U. Rüther, C. Nunnensiek, H.-J.

===Infertility===
Some types of chemotherapy are gonadotoxic and may cause [[infertility]].<ref name=Brydoy>{{cite journal |author=Brydøy M, Fosså SD, Dahl O, Bjøro T |title=Gonadal dysfunction and fertility problems in cancer survivors |journal=Acta Oncol|volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=480–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17497315 |doi=10.1080/02841860601166958|url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02841860601166958}}</ref> Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine.<ref name=Brydoy/> Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin.<ref name=Brydoy/> On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.<ref name=Brydoy/>

[[Female infertility]] by chemotherapy appears to be secondary to [[premature ovarian failure]] by loss of [[primordial follicles]].<ref name=Morgan2012>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/dms022}}</ref> This loss is not necessarily a direct effect of the chemotherapeutic agents, but could be due to an increased rate of growth initiation to replace damaged developing follicles.<ref name=Morgan2012/>

Patients may choose between several methods of [[fertility preservation]] prior to chemotherapy, including [[cryopreservation]] of semen, ovarian tissue, oocytes, or embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gurgan T, Salman C, Demirol A |title=Pregnancy and assisted reproduction techniques in men and women after cancer treatment|journal=Placenta |volume=29 Suppl B |issue= |pages=152–9 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18790328|doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2008.07.007 |url=}}</ref> As more than half of cancer patients are elderly, this adverse effect is only relevant for a minority of patients. A study in France between 1999 and 2011 came to the result that embryo freezing before administration of gonadotoxic agents to females caused a delay of treatment in 34% of cases, and a live birth in 27% of surviving cases who wanted to become pregnant, with the follow-up time varying between 1 and 13 years.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1093/humrep/det268}}</ref>

In chemotherapy as a [[conditioning regimen]] in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a study of patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide alone for severe aplastic anemia came to the result that ovarian recovery occurred in all women younger than 26 years at time of transplantation, but only in five of 16 women older than 26 years.<ref>André Tichelli, Alicia Rovó.

===Teratogenicity===
Chemotherapy is potentially [[teratogenic]] during [[pregnancy]], especially during the [[first trimester]], to the extent that [[abortion]] usually is recommended if pregnancy in this period is found during chemotherapy.<ref name=arnon2011>{{cite doi|10.1093/humupd/7.4.394}} [http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/394.full.pdf]</ref> Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and adverse effects on cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of various [[complications of pregnancy]] and fetal myelosuppression.<ref name=arnon2011/>

In males previously having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy, there appears to be no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations in their children conceived after therapy.<ref name=arnon2011/> The use of [[assisted reproductive technologies]] and [[micromanipulation technique]]s might increase this risk.<ref name=arnon2011/> In females previously having undergone chemotherapy, miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased in subsequent conceptions.<ref name=arnon2011/> However, when [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[embryo cryopreservation]]is practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened.<ref name=arnon2011/>

===Neurological adverse effects===

Between 30 and 40 percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience [[chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy]] (CIPN), a progressive and enduring tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs.<ref name = NCI>{{vcite journal | author = del Pino BM | date = Feb 23, 2010 | journal = NCI Cancer Bulletin | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | page = 6 | title = Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy | url = http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2010/022310/page6}}</ref>

Some patients report fatigue or non-specific neurocognitive problems, such as an inability to concentrate; this is sometimes called [[post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment]], referred to as "chemo brain" by patients' groups.<ref name="pmid15169812">{{cite journal |author=Tannock IF, Ahles TA, Ganz PA, Van Dam FS|title=Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy for cancer: report of a workshop |journal=J. Clin. Oncol.|volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=2233–9 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15169812 |doi=10.1200/JCO.2004.08.094|url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=15169812}}</ref>

===Tumor lysis syndrome===
In particularly large tumors and cancers with high [[white cell count]]s, such as [[lymphoma]]s, [[teratoma]]s, and some [[leukemia]]s, some patients develop [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. The rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes the release of chemicals from the inside of the cells. Following this, high levels of [[hyperuricemia|uric acid]], [[hyperkalemia|potassium]], [[hyperphosphatemia|phosphate]] and [[hyperkalemia|calcium]] are found in the blood. This causes kidney damage and the high levels of potassium can cause [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|cardiac arrhythmia]]. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in patients with large tumors, this is a dangerous side-effect that can lead to death if left untreated.<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 4">Wood, p. 202</ref>

===Organ damage===
[[Cardiotoxicity]] (heart damage) is especially prominent with the use of [[anthracycline]] drugs ([[doxorubicin]], [[epirubicin]], [[idarubicin]], and [[liposomal doxorubicin]]). The cause of this is most likely due to the production of [[free radical]]s in the cell and subsequent [[DNA damage]]. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are [[cyclophosphamide]], [[docetaxel]] and [[clofarabine]].<ref name="pmid22382639">{{cite journal |author=Shaikh AY, Shih JA |title=Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity |journal=Curr Heart Fail Rep |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=117–27 |year=2012 |month=June |pmid=22382639 |doi=10.1007/s11897-012-0083-y |url=}}</ref>

[[Hepatotoxicity]] (liver damage) can be caused by many cytotoxic drugs. The susceptibility of an individual to liver damage can be altered by other factors such as the cancer itself, [[viral hepatitis]], [[immunosuppression]] and [[nutritional deficiency]]. The liver damage can consist of damage to liver cells, [[Hepatic veno-occlusive disease|hepatic sinusoidal syndrome]] (obstruction of the veins in the liver), [[cholestasis]] (where bile does not flow from the liver to the intestine) and [[liver fibrosis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=A.V.

[[Nephrotoxicity]] (kidney damage) can be caused by [[tumor lysis syndrome]] and also due direct effects of drug clearance by the kidneys. Different drugs will affect different parts of the kidney and the toxicity may be [[asymptomatic]] (only seen on blood or urine tests) or may cause [[acute renal failure]].<ref name="pmid16473645">{{cite journal |author=de Jonge MJ, Verweij J |title=Renal toxicities of chemotherapy |journal=Semin.

[[Ototoxicity]] (damage to the inner ear) is a common side effect of platinum based drugs that can produce symptoms such as dizziness and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].<ref name="pmid22547603">{{cite journal |author=Brock PR, Knight KR, Freyer DR, ''et al.'' |title=Platinum-induced ototoxicity in children: a consensus review on mechanisms, predisposition, and protection, including a new International Society of Pediatric Oncology Boston ototoxicity scale |journal=J.

===Other side effects===
Less common side-effects include red skin ([[erythema]]), dry skin, damaged fingernails, a dry mouth ([[xerostomia]]), [[Water retention (medicine)|water retention]], and [[sexual impotence]]. Some medications can trigger [[allergic]] or [[pseudoallergic]] reactions.

Specific chemotherapeutic agents are associated with organ-specific toxicities, including [[cardiovascular disease]](e.g., [[doxorubicin]]), [[interstitial lung disease]] (e.g., [[bleomycin]]) and occasionally [[secondary neoplasm]] (e.g., [[MOPP (medicine)|MOPP]] therapy for Hodgkin's disease).

==Limitations==
Chemotherapy does not always work, and even when it is useful, it may not completely destroy the cancer. Patients frequently fail to understand its limitations. In one study of patients who had been newly diagnosed with incurable, stage 4 cancer, more than two-thirds of patients with lung cancer and more than four-fifths of patients with colorectal cancer still believed that chemotherapy was likely to cure their cancer.<ref name=Weeks>{{cite journal |author=Weeks JC, Catalano PJ, Cronin A, ''et al.'' |title=Patients' expectations about effects of chemotherapy for advanced cancer|journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=367 |issue=17 |pages=1616–25 |year=2012 |month=October |pmid=23094723|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1204410 |url= |pmc=3613151}}</ref>

The [[blood brain barrier]] poses a difficult obstacle to pass to deliver chemotherapy to the [[brain]]. This is because the brain has an extensive system in place to protect it from harmful chemicals. Drug transporters can pump out drugs from the brain and brain's blood vessel cells into the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and blood circulation. These transporters pump out most chemotherapy drugs, which reduces their efficacy for treatment of brain tumors. Only small [[lipophilic]] [[alkylating agents]] such as [[temozolomide]] are able to cross this blood brain barrier.<ref name="pmid17363519">{{cite journal |author=Deeken JF, Löscher W |title=The blood-brain barrier and cancer: transporters, treatment, and Trojan horses |journal=Clin.

[[Blood vessel]]s in tumors are very different from those seen in normal tissues. As a tumor grows, tumor cells furthest away from the blood vessels become low in oxygen ([[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]]). To counteract this they then signal for new blood vessels to grow. The newly formed tumor vasculature is poorly formed and does not deliver an adequate blood supply to all areas of the tumor. This leads to issues with drug delivery because many drugs will be delivered to the tumor by the [[circulatory system]].<ref name="pmid16862189">{{cite journal |author=Minchinton AI, Tannock IF |title=Drug penetration in solid tumours |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=583–92 |year=2006 |month=August |pmid=16862189 |doi=10.1038/nrc1893 |url=}}</ref>

==Efficacy==
The efficacy of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. The overall effectiveness ranges from being curative for some cancers, such as some [[leukemias]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nastoupil|first=LJ|coauthors=Rose, AC; Flowers, CR|title=Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: current treatment approaches.|journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)|date=May 2012 |volume=26|issue=5|pages=488-95|pmid=22730604}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=A |title=Follicular lymphoma: 2012 update on diagnosis and management |journal=American journal of hematology|date=October 2012 |volume=87 |issue=10 |pages=988-95 |pmid=23001911}}</ref> to being nearly worthless, such as in some [[brain tumors]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rampling |first=R |coauthors=James, A; Papanastassiou, V |title=The present and future management of malignant brain tumours: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy |journal=Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry |date=June 2004 |volume=75 Suppl 2 |pages=ii24-30 |pmid=15146036}}</ref> to being needless in others, like most [[non-melanoma skin cancer|non-melanoma skin cancers]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Madan |first=V |coauthors=Lear, JT; Szeimies, RM |title=Non-melanoma skin cancer |journal=Lancet |date=February 20, 2010 |volume=375 |issue=9715 |pages=673-85 |pmid=20171403}}</ref>

Even when it is impossible for chemotherapy to provide a permanent cure, chemotherapy may be useful to reduce symptoms like pain or to reduce the size of an inoperable tumor in the hope that surgery will be possible in the future.

==Resistance==

[[Drug resistance|Resistance]] is a major cause of treatment failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as [[p-glycoprotein]], in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on [[p-glycoprotein]] and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of [[p-glycoprotein]] are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult.<ref name="pmid12591977">{{cite journal |author=Goldman B |title=Multidrug resistance: can new drugs help chemotherapy score against cancer? |journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=255–7 |year=2003 |month=February |pmid=12591977 |doi= 10.1093/jnci/95.4.255|url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=E. Crowley, CA. McDevitt, R. Callaghan|title=Multidrug Resistance in Cancer. Generating Inhibitors of P-Glycoprotein: Where to, Now?|year=2009|publisher=Springer Protocols|pages=405–432}}</ref> Another mechanism of resistance is [[gene duplication|gene amplification]], a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by [[enzyme]]s in the cell that carry out [[DNA repair]]. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as [[tubulin]], can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs.<ref name="pmid16103712">{{cite journal |author=Luqmani YA |title=Mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy |journal=Med Princ Pract |volume=14 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=35–48 |year=2005 |pmid=16103712 |doi=10.1159/000086183 |url=}}</ref>

==Cytotoxics and targeted therapies==

[[Targeted therapy|Targeted therapies]] are a relatively new class of cancer drugs that can overcome many of the issues seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is due to the lack of cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the [[adverse effects|side effects]] are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a genetic lesion found commonly in [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]]. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by [[imatinib]], a [[small molecule]] drug.<ref name="pmid18297955">{{cite journal |author=Gerber DE |title=Targeted therapies: a new generation of cancer treatments |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=311–9 |year=2008 |month=February |pmid=18297955 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12360278">{{cite journal |author=Allen TM |title=Ligand-targeted therapeutics in anticancer therapy |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=2 |issue=10|pages=750–63 |year=2002 |month=October |pmid=12360278 |doi=10.1038/nrc903 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19581909">{{cite journal|author=Chen HX, Cleck JN |title=Adverse effects of anticancer agents that target the VEGF pathway |journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology |volume=6|issue=8 |pages=465–77 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19581909 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2009.94 |url=}}</ref><ref name="pmid19104514">{{cite journal |author=Zhang J, Yang PL, Gray NS |title=Targeting cancer with small molecule kinase inhibitors |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=28–39 |year=2009 |month=January |pmid=19104514 |doi=10.1038/nrc2559 |url=}}</ref>

{{Main|Experimental cancer treatments}}

===Targeted therapies===
Specially targeted delivery vehicles aim to increase effective levels of chemotherapy for tumor cells while reducing effective levels for other cells. This should result in an increased tumor kill and/or reduced toxicity.<ref name="pmid21501554">{{cite journal |author=Chidambaram M, Manavalan R, Kathiresan K |title=Nanotherapeutics to overcome conventional cancer chemotherapy limitations |journal=J Pharm Pharm Sci |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=67–77|year=2011 |pmid=21501554 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

====Antibody-drug conjugates====

[[Antibody-drug conjugate]]s (ADCs) comprise an [[antibody]], drug and a linker between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a [[tumor antigen]]) or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel [[endothelial cells]]. They bind to the tumor antigen and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles vary in their stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells.<ref name="pmid22003066">{{cite journal |author=Teicher BA, Chari RV |title=Antibody conjugate therapeutics: challenges and potential |journal=Clin.

====Nanoparticles====

[[Nanoparticles]] are 1-1000 [[nanometer]] (nm) sized particles that can promote tumor selectivity and aid in delivering low-[[solubility]] drugs. Nanoparticles can be targeted passively or actively. Passive targeting exploits the difference between tumor blood vessels and normal blood vessels. Blood vessels in tumors are "leaky" because they have gaps from 200-2000&nbsp;nm, which allow nanoparticles to escape into the tumor. Active targeting uses biological molecules ([[antibodies]], [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[receptor ligand]]s) to preferentially target the nanoparticles to the tumor cells. There are many types of nanoparticle delivery systems, such as [[mesoporous silica|silica]], [[polymer]]s, [[liposome]]s and magnetic particles. Nanoparticles made of magnetic material can also be used to concentrate agents at tumor sites using an externally applied magnetic field.<ref name="pmid21501554"/>  They have emerged as a useful vehicle for poorly soluble agents such as [[paclitaxel]].<ref name="pmid19554862">{{cite journal|author=Vines T, Faunce T |title=Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs |journal=J Law Med|volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=822–45 |year=2009 |month=May |pmid=19554862 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

===Electrochemotherapy===
{{Main|Electrochemotherapy}}

Electrochemotherapy is the combined treatment in which injection of a chemotherapeutic drug is followed by application of high-voltage electric pulses locally to the tumor. The treatment enables the chemotherapeutic drugs, which otherwise cannot or hardly go through the membrane of cells (such as bleomycin and cisplatin), to enter the cancer cells. Hence, greater effectiveness of antitumor treatment is achieved.

Clinical electrochemotherapy has been successfully used for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors irrespective of their histological origin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heller R, Gilbert R, Jaroszeski MJ. |title= Clinical applications of electrochemotherapy |journal=Adv Drug Deliv Rev |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=119–129 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0169-409X(98)00067-2 |pmid=10837693 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Larkin JO, Collins CG, Aarons S, Tangney M, Whelan M, O’Reily S, Breathnach O, Soden DM, O’Sullivan GC |title=Electrochemotherapy - Aspects of preclinical development and early clinical experience |journal=Ann Surg |volume=245 |issue=3 |pages=469–479 |year=2007 |pmid=17435555|doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000250419.36053.33 |pmc=1877027}}</ref><ref name="Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O’Sullivan GC, Mir LM. 2006">{{cite journal |author=Marty M, Sersa G, Garbay JR, Gehl J, Collins CG, Snoj M, Billard V, Geertsen PF, Larkin JO, Miklavcic D, Pavlovic I, Paulin-Kosir SM, Cemazar M, Morsli N, Soden DM, Rudolf Z, Robert C, O’Sullivan GC, Mir LM |title=Electrochemotherapy - An easy, highly effective and safe treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases |pages=3–13 |journal=Eur J Cancer Suppl |volume=4 |issue=11 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.ejcsup.2006.08.002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sersa G, Miklavcic D, Cemazar M, Rudolf Z, Pucihar G, Snoj M. |title=Electrochemotherapy in treatment of tumours |journal=Eur J Surg Oncol |volume=34 |issue=2|pages=232–240 |year=2008 |pmid=17614247 |doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2007.05.016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Möller MG, Salwa S, Soden DM, O’Sullivan GC. |title=Electrochemotherapy as an adjunct or alternative to other treatments for unresectable or in-transit melanoma |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=9 |issue= 11 |pages=1611–1630|year=2009 |doi=10.1586/era.09.129 |pmid=19895245 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Testori A, Tosti G, Martinoli C, Spadola G, Cataldo F, Verrecchia F, Baldini F, Mosconi M, Soteldo J, Tedeschi I, Passoni C, Pari C, Di Pietro A, Ferrucci PF |title=Electrochemotherapy for cutaneous and subcutaneous tumor lesions: a novel therapeutic approach|journal=Dermatol Ther |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=651–661 |year=2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8019.2010.01370.x|pmid=21054709 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hampton T |title=Electric Pulses Help With Chemotherapy, May Open New Paths for Other Agents |journal=JAMA |volume=305 |issue=6 |pages=549–551 |year=2011 |doi=10.1001/jama.2011.92|pmid= 21304073 }}</ref> The method has been reported as safe, simple and highly effective in all reports on clinical use of electrochemotherapy.

Chemotherapy drugs are also used in [[conditioning regimen]]s prior to bone marow transplant ([[hematopoietic stem cell transplant]]). Conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient's immune system in order to allow a transplant to engraft. Cyclophosphamide is a common cytotoxic drug used in this manner, and is often used in conjunction with [[total body irradiation]]. Chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient's bone marrow cells (myeloablative conditioning) or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss (non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bacigalupo |first=A |coauthors=Ballen, K; Rizzo, D; Giralt, S; Lazarus, H; Ho, V; Apperley, J; Slavin, S; Pasquini, M; Sandmaier, BM; Barrett, J; Blaise, D; Lowski, R; Horowitz, M |title=Defining the intensity of conditioning regimens: working definitions |journal=Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation |date=December 2009 |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1628–33 |pmid=19896087}}</ref>

==Occupational precautions==
Healthcare workers exposed to anti-neoplastic agents take precautions to keep their exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} since pharmacists that prepare these drugs or nurses that may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs during the course of their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk for exposure to these drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/antineoplastic/|title=NIOSH Occupational Exposure to Antineoplastic Agents |accessdate=10 October 2007 |publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}</ref> Routes of entry into the users body are skin absorption, [[inhalation]] and [[ingestion]]. The long term effects of exposure include [[chromosomal abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] and [[infertility]].<ref name="isbn0-443-07101-2 2">Wood, p. 38.</ref>

==In other animals==
Chemotherapy is used in veterinary medicine similar to in human medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McKnight JA|title=Principles of chemotherapy |journal=Clin Tech Small Anim Pract |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=67–72 |year=2003|month=May |pmid=12831063 |doi= 10.1053/svms.2003.36617|url=}}</ref>
