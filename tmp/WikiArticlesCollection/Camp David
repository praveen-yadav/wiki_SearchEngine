'''Camp David''' is the country retreat of the [[President of the United States]]. It is located in wooded hills about 62 miles (100&nbsp;km) north-northwest of [[Washington, D.C.]], in [[Catoctin Mountain Park]] near [[Thurmont]], [[Maryland]].<ref>"[http://www.nps.gov/pwr/customcf/apps/maps/showmap.cfm?alphacode=cato&parkname=Catoctin%20Mountain%20Park Park Map Viewer]."

First known as Hi-Catoctin, Camp David was originally built as a camp for federal government agents and their families, by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], starting in 1935, opening in 1938.<ref>{{cite web | title =12 WPA Projects that Still Exist | work =How Stuff Works | publisher =Publications International, Ltd. | url =http://people.howstuffworks.com/12-wpa-projects-that-still-exist.htm | accessdate =March 11, 2009}}</ref> In 1942, it was converted to a presidential retreat by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and renamed "'''Shangri-La'''" (for the [[Shangri-La|fictional Himalayan paradise]]). Camp David received its present name from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in honor of his father and [[David Eisenhower|grandson]], both named David.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eisenhower |first=David |coauthors=Julie Nixon Eisenhower |title=Going Home to Glory: A Memoir of Life with Dwight David Eisenhower, 1961–1969 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |year=2010 |page=31}}</ref> Camp David is not open to the general public.
