'''Brian Wilson Aldiss''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 18 August 1925) is an English writer and [[anthologies]] editor, best known for science fiction novels and short stories. His byline reads either '''Brian W. Aldiss''' or simply '''Brian Aldiss''', except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s. Greatly influenced by science fiction pioneer [[H. G. Wells]], Aldiss is a vice-president of the international [[H. G. Wells Society]]. He is also (with [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]) co-president of the [[Birmingham Science Fiction Group]]. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He has received two [[Hugo Awards]], one [[Nebula Award]], and one [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]].<ref name=SFAwards/> His influential works include the short story "[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]", the basis for the [[Stanley Kubrick]]-developed [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]''.

== Life and career ==
{{BLP sources section |date=April 2013}}
Aldiss's father ran a department store that his grandfather had established, and the family lived above it.<ref name=andrewbrown>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/jun/16/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.artsandhumanities | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Brown | title=Profile: Brian Aldiss | date=16 June 2001}}</ref>He started to write stories as a 3 year old which his mother would bind and put on a shelf.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-brian-aldiss-87-author-8567603.html</ref> At the age of 6, Brian was sent to board at [[West Buckland School]] in Devon, which he attended until his late teens.<ref name=andrewbrown/> In 1943, he joined the [[Royal Signals]] regiment, and saw action in [[Burma]]; his Army experience inspired the Horatio Stubbs second and third books{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.

After [[World War II]], he worked as a bookseller in [[Oxford]]. He wrote a number of short pieces for a booksellers trade journal about life in a fictitious bookshop, which attracted the attention of Charles Monteith, an editor at the British publisher [[Faber and Faber]]. As a result Aldiss's first book was ''The Brightfount Diaries'' (Faber, 1955), a 200-page novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop. About this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to [[ISFDB]] his first [[speculative fiction]] in print was the short story "Criminal Record", published by [[John Carnell]] in the July 1954 number of ''[[Science Fantasy (magazine)|Science Fantasy]]''.<ref name=isfdb/> Several of his stories appeared in 1955 including three in monthly issues of ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'',<ref name=isfdb/> a more important magazine also edited by Carnell.<!-- supported by our magazine articles -->

In 1955, ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper ran a competition for a [[short story]] set in the year 2500, which Aldiss won with a story entitled "Not For An Age". ''The Brightfount Diaries'' had been a minor success, and Faber asked Aldiss if he had any more writing that they could look at with a view to publishing. Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of science fiction fans in high places, and so his first science fiction book was published,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} a collection of short stories entitled ''Space, Time and Nathaniel'' (Faber, 1957). By this time, his earnings from writing matched his wages in the bookshop, so he made the decision to become a full-time writer.

Aldiss led the voting for Most Promising New Author of 1958 at the next year's [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], but finished behind "no award".<ref name=SFAwards/> He was elected President of the [[British Science Fiction Association]] in 1960. He was the literary editor of the ''Oxford Mail'' newspaper during the 1960s. Around 1964 he and his long-time collaborator [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] started the first ever journal of science fiction criticism, ''Science Fiction Horizons'', which during its brief span of two issues published articles and reviews by such authors as [[James Blish]], and featured a discussion among Aldiss, [[C. S. Lewis]], and [[Kingsley Amis]] in the first issues, and an interview with [[William S. Burroughs]] in the second.

Besides his own writings, he has had great success as an anthologist. For Faber he edited ''Introducing SF'', a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and ''Best Fantasy Stories''. In 1961 he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher [[Penguin Books]] under the title ''Penguin Science Fiction''. This was remarkably successful, going into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies, ''More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1963), and ''Yet More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as ''The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus'' (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles ''Space Opera'' (1974), ''Space Odysseys'' (1975), ''Galactic Empires'' (1976), ''Evil Earths'' (1976), and ''Perilous Planets'' (1978) which were quite successful. Around this time, he edited a large-format volume ''Science Fiction Art'' (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and [[pulp magazines|pulps]].

In response to the results from the [[Space probe|planetary probes]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that [[Venus]] was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, he and Harry Harrison edited an anthology ''[[Farewell, Fantastic Venus]]!'', reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus. He also edited, with Harrison, a series of anthologies ''The Year's Best Science Fiction'' (1968-1976?)

Brian Aldiss also invented a form of extremely short story called the [[Minisaga]]. The Daily Telegraph hosted a competition for the best Minisaga for several years and Aldiss was the judge.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4717359/Your-chance-to-enter-the-Daily-Telegraph-Mini-saga-Competition-1999.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Your chance to enter the Daily Telegraph Mini-saga Competition 1999 | date=27 April 1999}}</ref> He has edited several anthologies of the best Minisagas.

[[Image:BRIAN ALDISS Metropolis.jpg|thumb|250px|'Metropolis' limited edition print by Brian Aldiss]]
He traveled to Yugoslavia, where he met Yugoslav fans in Ljubljana, Slovenia; he published a travel book about Yugoslavia entitled Cities and Stones (1966), his only work in the genre<ref>http://brianaldiss.co.uk/writing/non-fiction/non-fiction-a-p/cities-stones/</ref>; he published an alternative-history fantasy story about Serbian kings in the Middle Ages; and he wrote a novel called  ''The Malacia Tapestry'', about an alternative Dalmatia.

In addition to a highly successful career as a writer, Aldiss is also an accomplished artist whose abstract compositions or 'isolées' are influenced by the work of [[Giorgio de Chirico]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].<ref>email communication, 2011.</ref> His first solo exhibition ''The Other Hemisphere'' was held in [[Oxford]], August–September 2010, and the exhibition's centrepiece 'Metropolis' (see figure) has since been released as a limited edition fine art print.<ref name=metroart>{{cite web|url=http://www.wire-frame.net/fineart.html#Metropolis |title=wire-frame • giclée prints |publisher=Wire-frame fine art publishing (''wire-frame.net'') |date= |accessdate=2013-04-18}}</ref>{{The exhibition title denotes the writer/artist's notion, "words streaming from one side of his brain inspiring images in what he calls 'the other hemisphere'."<ref name=metroart/>}}

Earth is just a lesser-than-third-class colony ruled by a Nul tyrant whose deceiving devices together with good willing but ineffective attempts of a Nul signatory to clarify the abuses and with the disorganised earthling resistance reflect the complex relationship existing between imperialists and subject races which Aldiss himself had the chance of seeing at first hand when serving in India and Indonesia in the forties.

Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young [[Serbs|Serb]], who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols, and finds himself leading a messianic [[crusade]]. The narration and dialogue reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs, in mutating phrases and puns and allusions, in a deliberate echo of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.
