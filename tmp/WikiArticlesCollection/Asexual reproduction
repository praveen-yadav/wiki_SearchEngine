'''Asexual reproduction''' is a mode of [[reproduction]] by which offspring arise from a single parent, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it is reproduction which almost never involves [[meiosis]], [[ploidy]] reduction, or [[fertilisation]]. The offspring will be exact genetic copies of the parent, except in the specific case of automixis. A more stringent definition is '''agamogenesis''' which is reproduction without the fusion of [[gamete]]s. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for [[single-celled organism]]s such as the [[archaebacteria]], [[eubacteria]], and [[protist]]s. Many [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] reproduce asexually as well.

While all [[prokaryote]]s reproduce asexually (without the formation and fusion of gametes), mechanisms for [[lateral gene transfer]] such as [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] are sometimes likened to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name="Narra">{{cite journal|author = Narra HP, Ochman H|title = Of what use is sex to bacteria?|journal = Current Biology|year = 2006|volume = 16|pages = R705–710|pmid = 16950097|doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.08.024|issue = 17}}</ref> A complete lack of sexual reproduction is relatively rare among multicellular organisms, particularly animals.

==Types of asexual reproduction==

=== Fission ===
{{Main|Fission (biology)}}
An important form of fission is binary fission but there is another type of fission that is called multiplefission.
In binary fission, the parent organism is replaced by two daughter organisms, because it literally divides in two.  Organisms, both [[prokaryote]]s (the [[archaea]] and the [[bacteria]]), and [[eukaryote]]s (such as [[protist]]s and unicellular [[fungi]]), reproduce asexually through binary fission; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction.

'''Multiple fission''' at the cellular level occurs in many [[protists]], e.g. [[sporozoa]]ns and [[algae]]. The [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the parent cell divides several times by [[mitosis]], producing several nuclei. The cytoplasm then separates, creating multiple daughter cells.<ref name="ebrit">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498542/reproduction/76146/Multiple-fission|title=Cell reproduction|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref><ref name="fap">{{cite book|author=Britannica Educational Publishing|title =Fungi, Algae, and Protists|publisher =The Rosen Publishing Group |year =2011|isbn =978-1-61530-463-9|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_U9MB4iUpDIC&lpg=PA102&dq=multiple%20fission&hl=en&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q=multiple%20fission&f=false}}</ref><ref name="aff">{{cite book|author=P.Puranik, Asha Bhate|title =Animal Forms And Functions: Invertebrata|publisher =Sarup & Sons|year =2007|isbn =978-81-7625-791-6|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=-kdq6RyyVE0C&lpg=PA87&dq=multiple%20fission&hl=en&pg=PA87#v=onepage&q=multiple%20fission&f=false}}</ref>

In [[apicomplexa]]ns, multiple fission, or '''schizogony''', is manifested either as [[protozoal merogony|merogony]], [[sporogony]] or [[gametogony]]. Merogony results in [[merozoite]]s, which are multiple daughter cells,that originate within the same cell membrane,<ref name="margulis">{{cite book|author=Lynn Margulis, Heather I.

=== Budding ===
{{Main|Budding}}
Some cells split via [[budding]] (for example [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|baker's yeast]]), resulting in a 'mother' and 'daughter' cell. The offspring organism is smaller than the parent. Budding is also known on a multicellular level; an animal example is the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], which reproduces by budding. The buds grow into fully matured individuals which eventually break away from the parent organism.

Internal budding or Endodyogeny is a process of asexual reproduction, favoured by parasites such as ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. It involves an unusual process in which two daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.<ref name=smyth>{{cite book |author=James Desmond Smyth, Derek Wakelin |title=Introduction to animal parasitology |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=101–102 |edition=3 |isbn=0-521-42811-4 }}</ref>

Endopolygeny is the division into several organisms at once by internal [[budding]].<ref name=smyth /> also budding (external or internal) is present in some worm like [[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]] or  [[Echinococcosis|Echinococci]]; these worm produce cyst and then produce (invaginated or evaginated) [[protoscolex]] with [[budding]].

=== Vegetative propagation ===
{{Main|Vegetative reproduction}}
[[File:Bryophyllum daigremontianum nahaufnahme1.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[Kalanchoe daigremontiana|Bryophyllum daigremontianum]]]]

Vegetative reproduction is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by [[meiosis]] or [[syngamy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss6/asexual.html |title=Asexual Reproduction |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> Examples of vegetative reproduction include the formation of miniaturized plants called plantlets on specialized leaves (for example in [[kalanchoe]]) and some produce new plants out of [[rhizome]]s or [[stolon]] (for example in [[Garden strawberry|strawberry]]). Other plants reproduce by forming [[bulb]]s or [[tuber]]s (for example [[tulip]] bulbs and [[dahlia]] tubers). Some plants produce [[adventitious]] shoots and suckers that form along their lateral roots. Plants that reproduce vegetatively may form a [[clonal colony]], where all the individuals are clones, and the clones may cover a large area.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fun Fact |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/communities/aspen/grow.shtml |title=Celebrating Wildflowers - Fading Gold - How Aspens Grow |publisher=Fs.fed.us |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-13| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100923073834/http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/communities/aspen/grow.shtml| archivedate= 23 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Spore formation ===
{{Main|Sporogenesis}} 
Many multicellular organisms form [[spore]]s during their [[biological life cycle]] in a process called '''''sporogenesis'''''. Exceptions are animals and some protists, who undergo ''gametic meiosis'' immediately followed by fertilization. Plants and many algae on the other hand undergo ''sporic meiosis'' where meiosis leads to the formation of haploid spores rather than gametes. These spores grow into multicellular individuals (called [[gametophyte]]s in the case of plants) without a fertilization event. These haploid individuals give rise to [[gamete]]s through [[mitosis]]. Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or "phases" of the life cycle, referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes ([[fertilization]]), spore formation in plant [[sporophyte]]s and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction (agamogenesis) despite being the result of [[meiosis]] and undergoing a reduction in [[ploidy]]. However, both events (spore formation and fertilization) are necessary to complete sexual reproduction in the plant life cycle.

Fungi and some algae can also utilize true asexual [[spore]] formation, which involves [[mitosis]] giving rise to reproductive cells called mitospores that develop into a new organism after dispersal. This method of reproduction is found for example in [[Conidium|conidial fungi]] and the [[red alga]] ''Polysiphonia'', and involves sporogenesis without meiosis. Thus the chromosome number of the spore cell is the same as that of the parent producing the spores. However, mitotic sporogenesis is an exception and most spores, such as those of plants, most [[Basidiomycota]], and many algae, are produced by [[meiosis]].

=== Fragmentation ===
{{Main|Fragmentation (reproduction)}}
Fragmentation is a form  of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms such as animals (some [[annelid]] worms, [[turbellarians]] and [[sea stars]]), fungi, and plants. Some plants have specialized structures for reproduction via fragmentation, such as ''[[Gamma (botany)|gemma]]'' in [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]. Most [[lichen]]s, which are a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] union of a fungus and [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] algae or bacteria, reproduce through fragmentation to ensure that new individuals contain both symbiont. These fragments can take the form of ''soredia'', dust-like particles consisting of fungal hyphen wrapped around photobiont cells.

clonal Fragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning where an organism is split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into mature, fully grown individuals that are clones of the original organism. In [[echinoderm]]s, this method of reproduction is usually known as '''fissiparity'''.<ref name="skold">{{cite book|author=Helen Nilsson Sköld, Matthias Obst, Mattias Sköld, & Bertil Åkesson|editor =Baruch Rinkevich, Valeria Matranga|title =Stem Cells in Marine Organisms|chapter =Stem Cells in Asexual Reproduction of Marine Invertebrates|publisher =Springer|year =2009|page=125|isbn = 978-90-481-2766-5|url =http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=-eP2p0VF6VcC&lpg=PA125&dq=Fissiparity&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q=Fissiparity&f=false}}</ref>

=== Agamogenesis ===
Agamogenesis is any form of reproduction that does not involve a male gamete. Examples are [[parthenogenesis]] and [[apomixis]].

==== Parthenogenesis ====
{{Main|Parthenogenesis}}
Parthenogenesis is a form of [[agamogenesis]] in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in many plants, [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. water fleas, [[rotifer]]s, aphids, [[stick insect]]s, some ants, bees and parasitic wasps), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some reptiles, amphibians,rarely birds). In plants, [[apomixis]] may or may not involve parthenogenesis.

==== Apomixis and nucellar embryony ====
{{Main|Apomixis|Nucellar embryony}}
Apomixis in plants is the formation of a new [[sporophyte]] without fertilization. It is important in ferns and in flowering plants, but is very rare in other seed plants. In flowering plants, the term "apomixis" is now most often used for agamospermy, the formation of seeds without fertilization, but was once used to include [[vegetative reproduction]]. An example of an apomictic plant would be the [[triploid]] European [[dandelion]]. Apomixis mainly occurs in two forms: In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg within a diploid embryo sac that was formed without completing meiosis. In [[nucellar embryony]], the embryo is formed from the diploid [[nucellus]] tissue surrounding the embryo sac. Nucellar embryony occurs in some [[citrus]] seeds. Male apomixis can occur in rare cases, such as the Saharan Cypress ''[[Cupressus dupreziana]]'', where the genetic material of the embryo are derived entirely from [[pollen]].
The term "apomixis" is also used for asexual reproduction in some animals, notably water-fleas, ''[[Daphnia]]''.

== Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction ==
{{see also|Plant reproduction#Sexual reproduction}}
Some species alternate between the sexual and asexual strategies, an ability known as '''[[heterogamy]]''', depending on conditions. Alternation is observed in several [[rotifer]] species and a few types of insects, such as [[aphids]] which will, under certain conditions, produce eggs that have not gone through meiosis, thus cloning themselves. The cape bee [[Apis mellifera capensis|''Apis mellifera'' subsp. ''capensis'']] can reproduce asexually through a process called [[thelytoky]]. A few species of amphibians, reptiles, and birds have a similar ability (see [[parthenogenesis]] for examples).
For example, the freshwater crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' reproduces by parthenogenesis in the spring to rapidly populate ponds, then switches to [[sexual reproduction]] as the intensity of competition and predation increases. Another example are monogonont [[rotifer]]s of the genus [[Brachionus]], which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis: at low population densities females produce asexually and at higher densities a chemical cue accumulates and induces the transition to sexual reproduction. Many protists and fungi alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction.

For example, the slime mold ''[[Dictyostelium]]'' undergoes binary fission (mitosis) as single-celled amoebae under favorable conditions. However, when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells aggregate and follow one of two different developmental pathways, depending on conditions. In the social pathway, they form a multicellular slug which then forms a fruiting body with asexually generated spores. In the sexual pathway, two cells fuse to form a giant cell that develops into a large cyst. When this macrocyst germinates, it releases hundreds of amoebic cells that are the product of meiotic recombination between the original two cells.<ref name="MehrotraAneja1990">{{cite book|author1=R.

The hyphae of the common mold (''[[Rhizopus]]'') are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores. Many algae similarly switch between sexual and asexual reproduction.<ref name="ColeSheath1990">{{cite book|author1=Kathleen M. Cole|author2=Robert G.

== Inheritance of asexual reproduction in sexual species ==
For example, in the [[rotifer]] ''[[Brachionus]] calyciflorus'' asexual reproduction (obligate [[parthenogenesis]]) can be inherited by a recessive allele, which leads to loss of sexual reproduction in homozygous offspring.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stelzer | first1 = C.-P. | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = J. | last3 = Wiedlroither | first3 = A. | last4 = Riss | first4 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Loss of Sexual Reproduction and Dwarfing in a Small Metazoan | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e12854 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012854 | pmid=20862222}}</ref> Inheritance of asexual reproduction by a single recessive locus has also been found in the parasitoid wasp ''Lysiphlebus fabarum''.<ref>C.

Reptiles use the [[ZW sex-determination system]], which produces either males (with ZZ sex chromosomes) or females (with ZW or WW sex chromosomes). Until 2010, it was thought that the ZW chromosome system used by reptiles was incapable of producing viable WW offspring, but a (ZW) female [[boa constrictor]] was discovered to have produced viable female offspring with WW chromosomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regina.com/bookmarks/boa-constrictor-produces-fatherless-babies.html|title='Boa constrictor produces fatherless babies' |publisher=CBC News - Technology&Science |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> The female boa could have chosen any number of male partners (and had successfully in the past) but on these occasions she reproduced asexually, creating 22 female babies with WW sex-chromosomes.

[[Polyembryony]] is a widespread form of asexual reproduction in animals, whereby the fertilized egg or a later stage of embryonic development splits to form genetically identical clones. Within animals, this phenomenon has been best studied in the parasitic [[Hymenoptera]].  In the [[9-banded armadillos]], this process is obligatory and usually gives rise to genetically identical quadruplets.  In other mammals, [[monozygotic twinning]] has no apparent genetic basis, though its occurrence is common.  There are at least 10 million identical human twins and triplets in the world today.

Bdelloid [[rotifers]] reproduce exclusively asexually, and all individuals in the class [[Bdelloidea]] are females. Asexuality evolved in these animals millions of years ago and has persisted since. There is evidence to suggest that asexual reproduction has allowed the animals to evolve new proteins through the [[Matthew Meselson#The Meselson effect|Meselson effect]] that have allowed them to survive better in periods of dehydration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pouchkina-Stantcheva|first1=N.

Molecular evidence strongly suggest that at least two species of the [[stick insect]] genus ''[[Timema]]'' have used only asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction for one million years, the longest period known for any insect.<ref name=bbc0719>{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Ella|title=Sticks insects survive one million years without sex|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14122050|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 July 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110719215849/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14122050| archivedate= 19 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
