'''Genetically modified maize''' ([[maize|corn]]) is a [[genetically modified crop]] - in other words, specific maize strains have been [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] with agronomically desirable [[Phenotypic trait|traits]].  Corn that is resistant to herbicides has been developed, as has corn that expresses insecticidal proteins from [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] bacteria.   While GM maize has been widely adopted by farmers in countries where it has been approved, it has also caused controversy with respect to possible effects on health, nontarget insects, and other plants via [[gene flow]].   One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a [[Starlink corn recalls|series of recalls starting in 2000]].

===Herbicide resistant corn===
Corn varieties resistant to [[glyphosate]] herbicides (the original of which are [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]]) were first commercialized in 1996 by Monsanto, and are known as "Roundup Ready Corn".<ref>{{cite web|title=Roundup Ready System|url=http://www.monsanto.com/weedmanagement/Pages/roundup-ready-system.aspx|publisher=Monsanto}}</ref> [[Bayer CropScience]] developed "Liberty Link Corn" that is resistant to [[glufosinate]].<ref>[http://www.bayercropscience.us/products/herbicides/liberty/ Bayer LibertyLink official website]</ref>  [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to [[imidazoline]] herbicides under the trademark "Clearfield" - though in these hybrids, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate not [[genetic engineering]].<ref name="imidcorn" >{{Cite doi|10.1002/ps.993|noedit}}</ref> Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for Clearfield.<ref name="imidcorn" />

===Insecticide-producing corn===
[[Image:Corn borer.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The [[European corn borer]], ''Ostrinia nubilalis'', destroys corn crops by burrowing into the stem, causing the plant to fall over.]]

Bt corn is a variant of [[maize]] that has been [[genetic engineering|genetically altered]] to express one or more proteins from the bacteria, [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt]].<ref name=UC-history/>  The protein is poisonous to certain [[insect]] pests and is widely used in organic gardening. In the case of corn, the pest is the [[European corn borer]], which causes about a billion dollars in damage each year.<ref>Ostlie KR et al.  University of Minnesota Extension Office.

The Bt protein is expressed all through the plant.  When a target insect eats the Bt-containing plant, the protein is activated in the gut of the insect, which is alkaline (human guts are acidic), and in the alkaline environment the protein partially unfolds and is cut by other proteins, forming a [[toxin]] that paralyzes the insect's digestive system and forms holes in the gut wall.  The insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves to death.<ref name=ColoSt>W.S. Cranshaw, Colorado State University Extension Office.  Last updated March 26, 2013.

====Sweet corn====
GM varieties of sweet corn have been developed and marketed.  For example, "Attribute" is the brand name for the insect-resistance traits in sweet corn developed by [[Syngenta]].<ref>[http://www.syngenta-us.com/seeds/vegetables/sweet_corn/Sweet_Corn_Crop_Guide.pdf Syngenta Sweet Corn Products]</ref>

==Products in development==
In 2007, researchers from South Africa announced the production of transgenic maize resistant to [[maize streak virus]] (MSV).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shepherd DN, Mangwende T, Martin DP, ''et al.'' |title=Maize streak virus-resistant transgenic maize: a first for Africa |journal=Plant Biotechnol.

==Development of resistance==
By US EPA regulation, farmers who plant Bt corn must plant non-Bt corn nearby (called a "refuge") to provide a location to harbor [[Maize#Pests|pests]]<ref name=Witowski>{{cite report|author=J.F. Witkowski|coauthors=J.L. Wedberg, K.L.

EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges, and to report that data to the EPA.<ref name=Witowski/>   A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.<ref name=Witowski/>

The [[European corn borer]], one of the primary insects Bt is meant to target, has been shown to be capable of developing resistance to the Bt protein.<ref>Staff, University of Minnesota Extension.

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.<ref name="Wesseler-2011">[[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]], J. and N.

Critics have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds, including ecological concerns, and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law (although this latter issue applies equally to any plant variety).  GM crops also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops is safe and whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs.  See the [[genetically modified food controversies]] article for discussion of issues about GM crops and GM food.  These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive legislation in most countries.<ref name="Wesseler-2005">[[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]], J.

===Debate over the effects of Bt corn on nontarget insects===
One of the major uses of GM crops is in insect pest control though the expression of the ''cry'' (crystal delta-endotoxins) and ''cyt'' (cytolysins) genes from [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] (Bt). There are concerns that these toxins could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects as well as the targeted pest insect. The proteins produced by Bt have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported.<ref name=UC-history>{{cite web |url= http://www.bt.ucsd.edu/bt_history.html |title=History of Bt |author= |date= |work= |publisher= University of California|accessdate=8 February 2010}}</ref> While ''cyt'' proteins are toxic towards the insect orders [[Coleoptera]] (beetles) and [[Diptera]] (flies), ''cry'' proteins selectively target [[Lepidopterans]] (moths and butterflies). As a toxic mechanism, ''cry'' proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut ([[epithelial]]) cells resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate receptors in its gut cannot be affected by the ''cry'' protein, and therefore Bt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bt corn: is it worth the risk?|url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/bt-corn-is-it-worth-the-risk/|last1=Hall|first1=H.|publisher=The Science Creative Quarterly}}</ref><ref>Dorsch, J.A. et al.

===Gene flow===
Issues of [[gene flow]] have arisen in two contexts with respect to GM maize:  the interaction between GM maize and varieties in Mexico, and the question of gene flow into refuges.

In 2009 the government of Mexico created a regulatory pathway for approval of genetically modified maize,<ref>GMO Compass. 5 June 2009 [http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/447.mexico_controlled_cultivation_genetically_modified_maize.html Mexico: controlled cultivation of genetically modified maize]</ref> but because Mexico is the [[center of diversity]] for maize, concerns have been raised about the effect that genetically modified maize could have on local strains.<ref>Mike Shanahan for Science and Development Network, 10 November 2004.

===Concerns about safety of eating GM corn===

===Starlink corn recalls===
{{main|Starlink corn recall}}

StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing a variant of the [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] (Bt) protein called Cry9C that had not been used in a GM crop before.<ref name=ColStateExt-Starlink>Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at Colorado State University, Page last updated March 11, 2004  [http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/transgeniccrops/hotstarlink.html StarLink Corn]</ref>  Starlink's creator, [[Plant Genetic Systems]] (bought by AgrEvo which then became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident,<ref name=Pew/>{{rp|15–16}}  which was eventually bought by [[Bayer#Bayer_CropScience|Bayer]]), had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.<ref name=Pew>Michael R. Taylor and Jody S. Tick of Resources for the Future, Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. [http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_star_case.pdf  The StarLink Case: Issues for the Future]</ref>{{rp|14}}  However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system before breaking down than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.<ref>"While EPA had no specific data to indicate that Cry9C was an allergen, the protein expressed in StarLink corn did exhibit certain characteristics (i.e. relative heat stability and extended time to digestion) that were common to known food allergens such as those found in peanuts, eggs, etc. EPA’s concern was that StarLink corn may be a human food allergen and in the absence of more definitive data, EPA has not made a decision whether or not to register the human food use."

StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea.<ref name=Pew/>{{rp|20–21}} This corn became the subject of the widely publicized [[Starlink corn recall]], which started when Taco Bell-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn, resulting in sales of StarLink seed being discontinued.<ref>King D, Gordon A. Contaminant found in Taco Bell taco shells. Food safety coalition demands recall (press release), vol 2001. Washington, DC: Friends of the Earth, 2000. Available: http://www.foe.org/act/getacobellpr.html. 3 November 2001.</ref><ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/23/news/mn-25314</ref> The registration for the Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.<ref>Agricultural Biotechnology: Updated Benefit Estimates, Janet E. Carpenter and Leonard P. Gianessi 2001, National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy</ref>

51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.<ref>Staff, EPA review committee. [http://www.usda.gov/documents/LLP%20Incidents%202.docx LLP Incidents]</ref>  However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/default.htm CDC, National Center for Environmental Health.

Atlanta,GA:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001.]</ref>

A subsequent review of these tests by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel points out that while "the negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined ... in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this"<ref>FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel Report No. 2001-09, July 2001 http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/SAP/meetings/2001/july/julyfinal.pdf</ref>

The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starlink Corn Regulatory Information|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppbppd1/biopesticides/pips/starlink_corn.htm|date=April 2008|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)}}</ref>

In 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.<ref>http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2005/2005-02-16-09.asp#anchor2</ref>

In August 2013, StarLink corn was reported to be found again contaminating some foods in [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/breaking-illegal-starlink%E2%84%A2-gm-corn-resurfaces-saudi-arabian-food-supply</ref>
