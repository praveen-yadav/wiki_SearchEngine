==History==

===Village of Clam Lake===
Although [[European colonization of the Americas|European explorers]] and traders visited the area since the 18th century, permanent white communities were not established until some time later.{{When|date=March 2009}} Initial settlements were connected with the logging industry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In 1871, Cadillac's first [[sawmill]] began operations. Originally called the Pioneer Mill, it was built by John R. Yale.{{Failed verification|date=July 2008}} That same year, George A. Mitchell, a prominent Cadillac banker and railroad entrepreneur, and Adam Gallinger, a local carpenter, formed the Clam Lake Canal Improvement and Construction Company. Two years later, the Clam Lake Canal was constructed between Big and Little Clam lakes, present-day Lakes Mitchell and [[Lake Cadillac|Cadillac]]. Sawmill owners used the canal to transport timber from Big Clam Lake to the mills and railroad sites—{{Failed verification|date=July 2008}}the [[Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad|G.R. & I. Railroad]] had reached the area in 1872—on Little Clam Lake, in Cadillac.<ref name="factbook">Schindler, Kurt H.

Cadillac was originally named '''Clam Lake''' and was incorporated as a village in 1874. George Mitchell was elected the first mayor.<ref name="factbook"/> The village was incorporated as a city in 1877 and renamed Cadillac, after [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]], a Frenchman who made the first permanent settlement at [[Detroit]] in 1701.<ref>[http://www.cadillac-mi.net/profile_history.php City of Cadillac, History]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}.

===Battle of Manton===
The Wexford County seat of government, originally located in Sherman, was moved to [[Manton, Michigan|Manton]] in 1881, as the result of a compromise between the feuding residents of Cadillac and Sherman. Cadillac partisans, however, won the county seat by county-wide vote in April 1882.<ref name="factbook"/> The day following the election a sheriff's posse left the city for Manton by special train to seize the county records. After arriving and collecting a portion of the materials, however, an angry crowd confronted the Cadillac men and drove them from the town.<ref name="Battle">[http://www.absolutemichigan.com/dig/michigan/battling-for-the-county-seat/ Battling for the County Seat]. ''[http://www.absolutemichigan.com/ Absolute Michigan].'' Retrieved on January 5, 2008.</ref>

When the sheriff returned to Cadillac, a force consisting of several hundred armed men was assembled; this group reportedly included a brass band. The Sheriff's force, some of whom may have been intoxicated, traveled back to Manton to seize the remaining records. Although Manton residents confronted the Cadillac men and barricaded the courthouse, the posse successfully seized the documents and, in dubious glory, returned to Cadillac.<ref name="Battle"/>

In 1878, Ephraim Shay perfected his [[Shay locomotive]], which was particularly effective in its ability to climb steep grades, maneuver sharp turns and manage imperfections in railroad tracks. Cadillac was home to the [[Michigan Iron Works]] Company, which manufactured the Shay locomotive for a short time in the early 1880s.<ref>Henderson, Rick (2001).

In October 1975 the rock group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] visited Cadillac and performed at the Cadillac High School gymnasium. They played the concert to honor the [[Cadillac High School]] football team. In previous years, the team had compiled a record of sixteen consecutive victories, but the 1974 squad opened the season with two losses. The assistant coach, Jim Neff, an English teacher and [[rock'n'roll]] fan, thought to inspire the team by playing Kiss music in the locker room. He also connected the team's game plan, K-I-S-S or "Keep It Simple Stupid", with the band. The team went on to win seven straight games and their conference co-championship. After learning of their association with the team's success, the band decided to visit the school and play for the homecoming game.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=arruda/100301_kiss ESPN: KISS does a high school Homecoming]</ref><ref>Weinstein, Fannie (1996).

Cadillac sits on the eastern edge of the [[Manistee National Forest]] and the surrounding area is heavily wooded with mixed hardwood and conifer forests.

Apart from its manufacturing base, Cadillac is frequently considered by those who know it to be a tourist town.{{Who|date=March 2009}} The center of the city is generally perceived to have a "small-town-feel."<ref>Whetstone, Matt (December 7, 2007). [http://www.cadillacnews.com/articles/2007/12/07/news/107766.txt Survey says: Cadillac good, improvement needed]{{dead link|date=December 2012}} ''[http://www.cadillacnews.com/ Cadillac News]'' Retrieved on January 5, 2008</ref> In the summer, the downtown fills with tourists, many of whom are from southern Michigan. The city center is in fact only one block from Lake Cadillac and, by docking at the public docks, is as nearly accessible by boat as it is by car. The city’s immediate proximity to two lakes, as well as [[Manistee National Forest]], [[Pere Marquette State Forest]], [[Mitchell State Park]] and a number of major highways ensures that tourism occupies a significant sector of the local economy.<ref name=cadillacyesterday/>

During the winter months Lake Cadillac and Lake Mitchell freeze over and the city becomes covered with snow. Cadillac is connected to a number of trail systems heavily used by winter recreation enthusiasts, and the city itself integrates unusually well into the corridors of travel created by [[snowmobile]]rs.<ref>For details on popular trails, see [http://www.visitcadillac.com/snowmobile Cadillac Snowmobiling] Retrieved on January 5, 2008</ref>

Cadillac is also known as '''Chestnut Town, USA'''. The local area is home to a relatively large number of [[American chestnut]] trees, planted by pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania who settled in western Michigan. A [[chestnut blight|blight]] in the early 20th century wiped out nearly every American Chestnut tree, but those in western Michigan developed a mysterious resistance and survived. The Cadillac '''Chestnut Harvest Festival''' is held every year, on the second Saturday of October.<ref>Fulbright, Dennis (2003) [http://www.icserv.com/nnga/chstfest.htm Cadillac Chestnut Harvest Festival.]{{dead link|date=December 2012}} [http://www.icserv.com/nnga/ Northern Nut Growers Association, Inc.] Retrieved on January 5, 2008</ref>

==Lou Gehrig's Disease==
Based on a single, limited study involving twenty people, some people have labeled Cadillac as one of three "hot spots" for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's Disease]] in the US.

The study was designed to examine the possible occurrence of the disease due to genetic influences. The occurrence of the disease within the city limits of Cadillac is reportedly over 100 times the normal rate. The cause of the abnormally large occurrence of the disease in Cadillac remains unknown.<ref>Kaminski, Frank (March 14, 2003).
