'''Climate''' is a measure of the average pattern of variation in [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pressure]], [[wind]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], atmospheric particle count and other [[Meteorology|meteorological]] variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate is different than [[weather]], in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.

A region's climate is generated by the '''climate system''', which has five components: [[Earth's Atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[cryosphere]], land surface, and [[biosphere]].<ref name="IPCC glossary">[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexes.html AR4 SYR Synthesis Report Annexes].

The climate of a location is affected by its [[latitude]], [[terrain]], and [[altitude]], as well as nearby [[body of water|water bodies]] and their currents. Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was originally developed by [[Wladimir Köppen]]. The Thornthwaite system,<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/210739|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf|author=C. W. Thornthwaite|title=An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate|journal=Geographical Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=55–94|year=1948|jstor=210739}}</ref> in use since 1948, incorporates [[evapotranspiration]] along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential effects of climate changes. The Bergeron and [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]]s focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.

[[Paleoclimatology]] is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from ''proxy variables'' that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in [[lake beds]] and [[ice cores]], and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. [[Climate model]]s are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. [[Climate change]] may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in [[global warming]].

==Definition==
{{Weather}}

Climate (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''klima'', meaning ''inclination'') is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title = Climate|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1|accessdate = 2008-05-14}}</ref> The standard averaging period is 30&nbsp;years,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages |title= Climate averages |accessdate=2008-05-17 |publisher= Met Office}}</ref> but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) glossary definition is as follows:

{{quote|''Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the "average weather," or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30&nbsp;years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization ([[WMO]]). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.''<ref>[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

==Climate classification==
There are several ways to [[Climate classification|classify climates]] into similar regimes. Originally, [[clime]]s were defined in [[Ancient Greece]] to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into ''genetic'' methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and ''empiric'' methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the [[relative frequency]] of different [[air mass]] types or locations within [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] weather disturbances. Examples of [[empirical|empiric]] classifications include [[climate zone]]s defined by [[plant hardiness]],<ref>[[United States National Arboretum]].

A common shortcoming of these [[classification scheme]]s is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.

===Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic===
{{Main|Air mass}}

The simplest classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for [[tropical]], P for [[Polar region|polar]], A for [[Arctic]] or Antarctic, M for [[monsoon]], E for [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title = Airmass Classification|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1|accessdate = 2008-05-22}}</ref> While air mass identification was originally used in [[weather forecasting]] during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.<ref name=Schwartz1995>{{cite journal|author = Schwartz, M.D.|year = 1995|title = Detecting Structural Climate Change: An Air Mass-Based Approach in the North Central United States, 1958–1992|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 553–568|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01812.x}}</ref>

Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]] (SSC).  There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).<ref>Robert E.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rain forest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], [[polar ice cap]], and [[desert]].

'''Rain forests''' are characterized by high [[rainfall]], with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|1750|mm|in}} and {{convert|2000|mm|in}}.

A '''polar ice cap''', or polar ice sheet, is a high-[[latitude]] region of a [[planet]] or [[natural satellite|moon]] that is covered in [[ice]].

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.<ref>Arctic Climatology and Meteorology.

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], the term "climate change" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface [[temperature]] known as [[global warming]]. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the [[United Nations]] [[UNFCCC|Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses "climate variability" for non-human caused variations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm |title=Glossary |work=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major [[ice age]]s. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by [[interglacial]] periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface [[albedo]], reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the [[continent]]s, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.<ref>Illinois State Museum (2002).

They are used for a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.

The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[greenhouse gas]]). These models predict an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record|global mean surface temperature]], with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
* Simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] [[global climate model]]s discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.<ref>Climateprediction.net.

Climate forecasting is a way by some scientists are using to predict climate change. In 1997 the prediction division of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University began generating seasonal climate forecasts on a real-time basis. To produce these forecasts an extensive suite of forecasting tools was developed, including a multimodel ensemble approach that required thorough validation of each model's accuracy level in simulating interannual climate variability.<ref>http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_2476_580_1063_43/http%3B/iriportal3.ldeo.columbia.edu%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/development/climate_activities/prediction/climate_forecasts/climate_forecasts_overview__introduction/cf_intro_learn_more.html</ref>
