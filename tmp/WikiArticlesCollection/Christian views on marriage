Most [[Christianity|Christian]] authorities and bodies view '''[[marriage]]''' (also called '''Holy Matrimony''') as a state instituted and ordained by [[God in Christianity|God]] for the lifelong relationship between one man as [[husband]] and one woman as [[wife]]. They consider it the most intimate of human relationships, a gift from God, and a sacred institution.<ref>[http://www.crosswalk.com/family/marriage/relationships/a-biblical-perspective-on-marriage-1208405.html] Accessed 16 Mar 2013</ref> [[Protestantism|Protestants]] consider it to be sacred, holy, and even central to the community of faith,<ref name=Henderson>Henderson, Charles P.

"The Sacraments"]</ref> consider it a [[Sacrament]]. Biblically, it is to be "held in honour among all…."{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|13:4}}

[[Jesus Christ]] underscored the importance and sacredness of lifelong marriage in his own teachings. He stated that God had created mankind as male and female, {{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} and that in marriage {{" '}}the two will become one flesh'. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."{{Bibleref2c|Matt.|19:5b-6}}

Civil laws recognize marriage as having social and political statuses. Christian theology affirms the [[secular]] status of marriage, but additionally views it from a moral and religious perspective that transcends all social interests.

While marriage is honored and affirmed among Christians and throughout the Bible, there is no suggestion that it is necessary for everyone. Single people who either have chosen to remain unmarried or who have lost their spouse for some reason are neither incomplete in Christ nor personal failures.<ref name="Staggs">Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978. ISBN 0-664-24195-6</ref>

The [[New Testament]] teaches that sex is reserved for marriage.<ref name="Staggs"/> It calls sex outside of marriage the sin of [[adultery]] (for the married person) if either sexual participant is married to another person, while it calls voluntary sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons the sin of [[fornication]].

Christians seek to uphold the seriousness of wedding vows. Yet, they respond with compassion to deep hurts by recognizing that [[divorce]], though less than the ideal, is sometimes necessary to relieve one partner of intolerable hardship, unfaithfulness or desertion.<ref name="Staggs"/> While the voice of God had said, "I hate divorce",{{Bibleref2c|Malachi|2:16}} some authorities believe the divorce rate in the church is nearly comparable to that of the culture at large.<ref name=Desai>Amy Desai, J.D.

There is considerable disagreement among Christians as to the biblical way to define the ''roles'' of each marriage partner, and how each should interact in the family to create healthy family relationships and to please God. [[New Testament Household Code|Roles in Christian marriages]] between opposite-sex couples challenge deep-rooted beliefs, teachings, and traditions—most dating from biblical days. Opinions and teachings vary among three principal groups—one group that believes in a full and co-equal partnership of the husband and wife, and two others which advocate a male-dominant hierarchical structure in marriage:

*[[Christian egalitarianism]] proposes a completely ''equal partnership'' between men and women in both the family and in the church. Its proponents teach "the fundamental biblical principle of the equality of all human beings before God".{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}} According to this principle, there can be no moral or theological justification for permanently granting or denying status, privilege, or prerogative solely on the basis of a person's race, class, or gender.<ref name=Groothuis>Groothuis, Rebecca M. "Sexuality, Spirituality and Feminist Religion". [http://www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/sexuality-spirituality-and-feminist-religion] Accessed 8 Mar 2013</ref>
*[[Complementarianism]] prescribes a husband-headship male-dominant hierarchy. This view's core beliefs call for a "husband’s loving, humble headship" and "the wife’s intelligent, willing submission" to his headship. Without necessarily using the term "obey", they believe women have "different but complementary roles and responsibilities in marriage..."<ref name=Comp>Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW). Core Beliefs. [https://www.cbmw.org/core-beliefs/] Accessed 5 March 2013</ref>
*[[Biblical patriarchy]] prescribes a strict male-dominant hierarchy. Their organization's first tenet is that "God reveals Himself as masculine, not feminine. God is the eternal Father and the eternal Son, the Holy Spirit is also addressed as 'He,' and Jesus Christ is a male." They consider the husband-father to be "sovereign" over "his" household—the family leader, provider, and protector. They call for a wife to be ''obedient'' to her "head" (husband).<ref name=Patriarchy>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx "The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy".

A small and growing number of denominations conduct [[Same-sex marriage|weddings between same-sex couples]] where it is civilly legal. A few others perform ceremonies to bless [[same-sex union]]s without recognizing them as marriage.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Some [[Polygamy in Christianity|Christian authorities used to permit]] [[polygamy]] (specifically [[polygyny]]) in the past, but this practice, besides being illegal in Western cultures, is now considered to be out of the Christian mainstream and continues to be practised only by fringe fundamentalist sects.

==Family authority and responsibilities==
Christians today hold three competing views as to what is the biblically-ordained relationship between husbands and wives. These views range from one that believes the New Testament teaches complete equality of authority and responsibility between the man and woman in marriage, all the way to one that calls for a return to complete patriarchy in which relationships are based on male-dominant power and authority in marriage.<ref name=Patriarchy/>

The great debate about marriage in contemporary Christian circles is among three primary groups—“Christian egalitarians”, “Complementarians”, and "Biblical patriarchists".

Much of the dispute hinges on how one interprets the [[New Testament Household Code]] ''(Haustafel)'' which has as its main focus hierarchical relationships between three pairs of social classes that were controlled by Roman law: husbands/wives, parents/children, and masters/slaves. The Code, with variations, occurs in four epistles (letters) by the [[Apostle Paul]] and in 1&nbsp; Peter. The Roman law of ''Manus'' gave the husband nearly absolute autocratic power over his wife, including life and death. The law of ''Patria Potestas'' (Latin for "Rule of the Fathers") gave a husband equally severe power over his children and slaves. [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]]<ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7</ref>{{rp|pp.187ff}} finds the basic tenets of the Code in [[Aristotle]]'s discussion of the household in Book 1 of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and in [[Philo]]'s ''Hypothetica 7.14''.<ref>{{cite web|quote=
(7.14) Do not these objects appear to you to be of greater importance than any other pursuit can possibly be? Therefore they do not go to interpreters of laws to learn what they ought to do; and even without asking, they are in no ignorance respecting the laws, so as to be likely, through following their own inclinations, to do wrong; but if you violate or alter any one of the laws, or if you ask any one of them about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty; and the husband appears to be a master, endowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a father to teach them to his children...

In a [[Tübingen]] dissertation by James E. Crouch,<ref>Crouch. James E. ''The Origin and Intention of the Colossian Haustafel.'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1972.</ref> he concludes that the early Christians found in Hellenistic Judaism a code which they adapted and Christianized.

Biblical egalitarians, Complementarians, and Biblical patriarchists each differ on how the provisions of the [[New Testament Household Code]] are to be interpreted today, both as to meaning and to intended audiences. Some authorities view them as applicable to 1st century new Christians living under an oppressive Roman legal system, while others believe they were intended to apply to all peoples of all times to come, including today.

Stagg believes the several occurrences of the Code in the New Testament were intended to meet the needs for ''order'' within the churches and in the society of the day. He maintains that the New Testament Household Codes are attempts by Paul and Peter to Christianize these harsh Codes for Roman citizens who had become followers of Christ. Stagg writes that there is some suggestion in scripture that because Paul had taught that they had newly found freedom "in Christ", wives, children, and slaves were taking improper advantage of the ''Haustafel'' both in the home and the church. "The form of the code stressing reciprocal social duties is traced to Judaism's own Oriental background, with its strong moral/ethical demand but also with a low view of woman.... At bottom is probably to be seen the perennial tension between freedom and order.... What mattered to (Paul) was 'a new creation'{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|6:15}} and 'in Christ' there is 'not any Jew not Greek, not any slave nor free, not any male and female{{' "}}.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}<ref name=Staggs/> Such codes existed in Greek tradition. "These appear in Christian writings after 70, in response to a secular world which had proved unexpectedly durable. The subordination of women in the ''Haustafeln'' conflicts with the greater equality of earlier Christian practice, and accompanies a trend toward civic subordination and hierarchical authority in the Church, which both accommodated itself to secular culture and patterned itself on secular authority."<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/wsp/publications/studies/notes/n-haustafeln.pdf] Accessed 13 Feb 2013</ref>

Two of these Christianized codes are found in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21-33}} (which contains the phrases "husband is the head of the wife" and "wives, submit to your husband") and in {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18-4:1}} (which instructs wives to subordinate themselves to their husbands).

The importance of the meaning of "head" as used by the [[Apostle Paul]] is pivotal in the conflict between the Complementarian position and the Egalitarian view. The word Paul used for "head", transliterated from Greek, is ''kephalē''. Today's English word "cephalic" ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ɨ|k}} {{Respell|sə|FAL|ik}}) stems from the Greek ''kephalē'' and means "Of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head. " A thorough concordance search by [[Catherine Kroeger]] shows that the most frequent use of "head" ''(kephalē)'' in the New Testament is to refer to "the anatomical head of a body". She found that its second most frequent use in the New Testament was to convey the metaphorical sense of "source".<ref>Kroeger, Catherine Clark. "Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'. " ''Priscilla Papers, '' Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.</ref><ref>Johnson, Alan F. "A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings. ''Priscilla Papers, '' Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006</ref> Other Egalitarian authors such as [[Margaret Howe]] agree with Kroeger, writing that “The word 'head' (in {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&nbsp; Corinthians&nbsp;11:3}} and other similar passages) must be understood not as 'ruler' but as 'source{{' "}}.<ref>Margaret Howe, Women and Church Leadership (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982), p. 60.</ref>

Wayne Grudem criticizes commonly rendering ''kephalē'' in those same passages only to mean "source", and argue that it denotes "authoritative head" in such texts as {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3}}. They interpret that verse to mean that [[God the father]] is the authoritative head over the [[Jesus Christ|Son]], and in turn Jesus is the authoritative head over the church, not simply its source. By extension, they then conclude that in marriage and in the church, the man is the authoritative head over the woman.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/tj/kephale_grudem.pdf Wayne Grudem, “Does Kefale (“Head”) Mean “Source” Or “Authority Over” in Greek Literature? A Survey of 2,336 Examples”] Trinity Journal ns 6.1 (Spring 1985): 38-59</ref>

Another potential way to define the word "head", and hence the relationship between husband and wife as found in Bible, is through the example given in the surrounding context in which the word is found.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:20-33}} In that context the husband and wife are compared to Christ and his church. The context seems to imply an authority structure based on a man sacrificing himself for his wife, as Christ did for the church; a love-based authority structure, where submission is not required but freely given based on the care given to the wife.<ref>Wickstrom, Mark. ''The Gospel of Grace.'' Beaver Pond Press, 2008. ISBN 978-1-59298-232-5</ref>

Some biblical references on this subject are debated depending on one’s school of theology. The [[Historical-grammatical method|historical grammatical method]] is a [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. Thus references to a patriarchal Biblical culture may or may not be relevant to other societies. What is believed to be a timeless truth to one person or denomination may be considered a cultural norm or minor opinion to another.

=== {{anchor|Egalitarian view}} Egalitarian view ===
{{See also|Christian egalitarianism}}

Christian Egalitarians (from the French word "égal" meaning "equal") believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy—a full and equal partnership between the wife and husband. They emphasize that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to ''obey'' her husband. While "obey" was introduced into marriage vows for much of the church during the Middle Ages, its only New Testament support is found in {{Bibleref2|1pet|3:6||1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:6}}, with that only being by implication from Sarah's obedience to Abraham.<ref name="Staggs"/>{{rp|p.190}} Scriptures such as {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} state that in Christ, right relationships are restored and in him, “there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.”<ref name=CBE>Christians for Biblical Equality. "Men, Women and Biblical Equality". Ltd. CBE on the Web at "Biblical Equality", 1989. [www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/men-women-and-biblical-equality.] Accessed 5 Mar 2013</ref>

Christian Egalitarians interpret scripture to mean that God intended spouses to practice ''mutual submission'', each in equality with the other. The phrase "mutual submission" comes from a verse in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21}} which precedes advice for the three domestic relationships of the day, including slavery. It reads, "Submit to one another ('mutual submission') out of reverence for Christ", wives to husbands, children to parents, and slaves to their master. Christian Egalitarians believe that full partnership in marriage is the most biblical view, producing the most intimate, wholesome, and reciprocally-fulfilling marriages.<ref>Spencer, Aída Besançon, William Spencer. ''Marriage at the Crossroads''. InterVarsity Press, 2009. ISBN 978-0-8308-2890-6</ref>

The Christian Egalitarian view<ref>Christian Egalitarian view as differentiated from humanistic egalitarianism</ref> of marriage asserts that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.<ref name=Groothuis>Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. "The Bible and Gender Equality." [www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]</ref> A foundational belief of Christian Egalitarians is that the husband and wife are created equally and are ordained of God to "become one", a biblical principle first ordained by God in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}}, reaffirmed by Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4-6}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:6-8}}, and by the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:30-32}}. Therefore, they see that "oneness" as pointing to [[gender equality]] in marriage. They believe the biblical model for Christian marriages is therefore for the spouses to share equal responsibility within the family—not one over the other nor one under the other.

David Dykes, theologian, author, and pastor of a 15,000-member Baptist church, sermonized that "When you are in Christ, you have full equality with all other believers". In a sermon he entitled "The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross", he said that some theologians have called one particular Bible verse the Christian ''[[Magna Carta]]''. The Bible verse reads: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" ({{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}). Acknowledging that there are differences between men and women, he said "in Christ, these differences don't define who we are. The only category that really matters in the world is whether you are in Christ. At the cross, Jesus destroyed all the made-made barriers of hostility:" ethnicity, social status, and gender.<ref>Dykes, David O. "The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross". (Senior Pastor of Green Acres Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas) <http://www.preaching.com/sermons/11682921/page-3/></ref>

"Arise" CBE newsletter, 28 Feb 2013]</ref>}}

Those of the egalitarian persuasion point to the biblical instruction that all Christian believers, irrespective of gender, are to submit or be subject "to one another in the fear of God"{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|KJV|Eph.&nbsp;5:21&nbsp;KJV}} or "out of reverence for Christ".{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|NIV|NIV}} [[Gilbert Bilezikian]] writes that in the highly debated Ephesians&nbsp;5 passage, the verb "to be subject" or "to be submitted" appears in verse&nbsp;21 which he describes as serving as a "hinge" between two different sections. The first section consists of verses 18-20, verse 21 is the connection between the two, and the second section consists of verses 22-33.<ref name=Bilezikian>Bilezikian, Gilbert. ''Beyond Sex Roles.'' Baker Book House, 1989. ISBN 0-8010-0885-9</ref>{{rp|p.153}} When discussion begins at verse 22 in Ephesians&nbsp;5, Paul appears to be reaffirming a chain of command principle within the family. However,

{{Quotation|...when interpretation begins with verse 21, the entire passage describes mutual submission within the family. The wife submits to her husband in everything "as unto the Lord." If her husband makes a request unworthy of her Lord, her primary loyalty is "unto the Lord." ...Instruction about submission is four times longer for husbands than for wives. The greatest burden of submission is clearly placed on the husband.<ref name=Prescott>Prescott, Bruce. "The Christian Family: Mutual Submission or Chain of Command?" ''Mainstream Messenger'', Vol. 1, No. 3. November 1998. Online: http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mob2/family.htm</ref>}}

Advocates of [[Christian egalitarianism]] believe that this model has firm biblical support:
*The word translated "help" or "helper" in {{bibleref2|Genesis|2:18}} until quite recently was generally understood to subordinate a wife to her husband. The KJV translates it as God saying, "I will make a help meet for him”. The first distortion was extrabiblical: the noun "help" and the adjective "meet" traditionally have been combined into a new noun, "helpmate". Thus, wives were often referred to as her husband's "helpmate". Next, from the word "help" were drawn inferences of authority/subjection distinctions between men and women. "Helper" was taken to mean that husband was boss and wife his domestic. It is now realized that of the 21 times the Hebrew word 'ezer is used in the Old Testament, in eight of those instances the term clearly means “savior”—another word for Jehovah God. For example, {{Bibleref2|Psalm|33:20}} says "the Lord…is our help ('ezer) and shield". {{Bibleref2|Psalm|121:1-2}} reads "I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help ('ezer) come from? My help ('ezer) comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth." That Hebrew word is not used in the Bible with reference to any subordinate person such a servant.<ref name=Bilezikian/>{{rp|p.28}} Thus, forms of 'ezer in the Hebrew Bible can mean either “to save” or  “to be strong” or have the idea of power and strength.<ref>Freedman, R. David. ''Biblical Archaeology Review''. Jan/Feb 1983, pp. 56-58</ref>
*The "two becoming one" concept, first cited in {{bibleref2|Gen.|2:24}}, was quoted by Jesus in his teachings on marriage and recorded almost identically in the gospels of both Matthew and Mark.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|19:4–6}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|10:7–9}} In those passages Jesus reemphasized the concept by adding a divine postscript to the Genesis passage: "So, they are no longer two, but one" (NIV).
*The Apostle Paul also quoted the Genesis 2:24 passage in {{bibleref2|Ephesians|5:1}}<ref name="Staggs"/> Describing it as a "profound mystery", he analogizes it to "Christ and the church".{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:32}} Then Paul states that every husband must love his wife as he loves himself.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph.|5:33}}
*Jesus actually ''forbids'' any hierarchy of relationships in Christian relationships. All three [[synoptic gospels]] record virtually the same teaching of Jesus, adding to its apparent significance:<ref>Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. ISBN 0-567-04073-9</ref>{{bibleref2c|Matt.|20:25–26||Matt.&nbsp;20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mark|10:42-45}} {{bibleref2c|Luke|22:25-27}}
*The [[Apostle Paul]] calls on husbands and wives to be subject ''to each other'' out of reverence for Christ—mutual submission.{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21}}
*As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the other. In truth, they are one.<ref name="Staggs" /> Bible scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] and Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] write that husband-wife equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually fulfilling marriages. They conclude that the Apostle Paul's statement, sometimes called the "Magna Carta of Humanity"<ref>Jewett, Paul K. ''Man As Male and Female: A Study in Sexual Relationships from a Theological Point of View.'' Eerdmans, 1990, p. 142. ISBN 978-0-8028-1597-2</ref> and recorded in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}, applies to all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is ''neither male nor female'': for you are all ''one'' in Christ Jesus."
*The Apostle Peter calls husbands and wives "joint heirs of the grace of life" and cautions a husband who isn't considerate to his wife and does not treat her with respect that his prayers will be hindered.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|3:7||1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:7}}
*When Paul refers to [[Priscilla and Aquila]],<ref>Acts 18:18-19, Acts 18:26, Romans 16:3-4</ref> of the seven times Priscilla and Aquila are mentioned in the New Testament, the Apostle Paul always lists them together, suggesting that he viewed them as a ministry team and also as a family unit. Of those seven biblical references to this couple, Paul lists Priscilla first in five of those, suggesting that he may have viewed her as the more prominent of the two, but it is clear that he did not follow the tradition of always listing the male's name first for a married couple. Some scholars have concluded that Priscilla was the head of the family unit.<ref>{{cite book

*Among spouses it is possible to submit without love, but it is impossible to love without submitting mutually to each other.{{Bibleref2c|Col.|3:8-9}}

The egalitarian paradigm leaves it up to the couple to decide who is responsible for what task or function in the home. Such decisions should be made rationally and wisely,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:15}} not based on gender or tradition. Examples of a couple's decision logic might include:
*which spouse is ''more competent'' for a particular task or function;
*which has ''better access'' to it;
*or if they decide both are similarly competent and have comparable access, they might make the decision based on who ''prefers'' that function or task, or conversely, which of them ''dislikes it less'' than the other.

=== Complementarian view ===
{{See also|Complementarianism}}

Complementarians hold to a hierarchical structure between husband and wife. They believe men and women have different gender-specific roles that allow each to ''complement'' the other, hence the designation “Complementarians”. The Complementarian view of marriage is that while the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, husbands and wives are given different functions and responsibilities by God that are based on gender, and that male leadership is biblically ordained so that the husband is always the senior authority figure. They state they "observe with deep concern" "accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the loving, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the intelligent, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives".<ref>[http://www.cbmw.org/Danvers Core Beliefs]. [[Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood|CBMW]]. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.</ref> They believe "the Bible presents a clear chain of authority—above all authority and power is God; God is the head of Christ. Then in descending order, Christ is the head of man, man is the head of woman, and parents are the head of their children."<ref>"Authority in the Family". Online: [www.covenanttruth.com.au/html/study/f/f4.htm] Accessed 1 March 2013</ref> Complementarians teach that God intended men to lead their wives as “heads” of the family. [[Wayne Grudem]], in an article that interprets the "mutual submission" of {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21}} as being hierarchical, writes that it means "being considerate of one another, and caring for one another’s needs, and being thoughtful of one another, and sacrificing for one another."<ref>Grudem, Wayne. "Submission as an Interpretation of Ephesians 5:21."[http://goodshepherdinitiative.net/docs_pdf/cbmw-grudem-myth-mutual-submission.pdf] Accessed 14 Feb 2013.</ref>

Scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 11:3: "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God," (KJV) are understood as meaning the wife is to be subject to her husband, if not unconditionally.<ref>[https://www.cbmw.org/wp-content/uploads/jbmw_pdf/16_2/13%20meyer%20article.pdf Meyer, Jason C..

According to Complementarian authors [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], [[Wayne Grudem]], and others, historically, but to a significantly lesser extent in most of Christianity today, the predominant position in both Catholicism and conservative Protestantism places the male as the "head" in the home and in the church.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books/about/Recovering_Biblical_Manhood_Womanhood.html?id=NHPxcYNV0BwC John Piper, Wayne Grudem, ''Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism]'', p. 165; Crossway, 2006</ref><ref>Mr. David Blankenhorn, (ed), Mr. Don S.

Grudem also acknowledges exceptions to the submission of wives to husbands where moral issues are involved.<ref>[http://bible.org/seriespage/wives-sarah-and-husbands-who-honor-them-1-peter-31-7 Wives Like Sarah, and the Husbands Who Honor Them 1 Peter 3:1-7].</ref> Rather than unconditional obedience, Complementarian authors such as Piper and Grudem are careful to caution that a wife's submission should never cause her to "follow her husband into sin."<ref>Piper, John and Grudem, Wayne (eds.)'' ''[[Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood]]: A Response to Evangelical Feminism.'' Wheaton, IL: Crossway Books, 1991, p. 57</ref>

[[Roman Catholic Church]] teaching on the role of women includes that of Pope Leo XIII in his 1880 encyclical ''Arcanum,'' which states:
{{Quotation|The husband is the chief of the family and the head of the wife. The woman, because she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, must be subject to her husband and obey him; not, indeed, as a servant, but as a companion, so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honor nor dignity. Since the husband represents Christ, and since the wife represents the Church, let there always be, both in him who commands and in her who obeys, a heaven-born love guiding both in their respective duties."<ref>Pope Leo XIII Encyclical 1880 Arcanum [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html] 1880 Arcanum]</ref> This position was affirmed in the 1930 encyclical ''Casti Connubii,'' which invokes {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22}}, "Let women be subject to their husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ is the head of the Church.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121930_casti-connubii_en.html, Pope Pius XI, Casti Connubii]</ref>}}

Though each of their churches is autonomous and self-governed, the official position of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (the largest Protestant denomination) is:
{{Quotation|The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation."<ref>[http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/basicbeliefs.asp Southern Baptist Convention, Basic Beliefs] 2013</ref>}}

===Biblical patriarchy===
{{see also|Biblical patriarchy}}

Biblical patriarchy is similar to [[Complementarianism]] but with differences of degree and emphasis. They carry the husband-headship model considerably further and with more militancy. While Complementarians also hold to exclusively male leadership in both the home and the church, Biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/ballot_box/should_christians_support_a_wo.aspx Should Christians Support a Woman for the Office of Civil Magistrate?].</ref> and indeed should not have careers outside the home.<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/called_to_the_home_called_to_r.aspx Called to the Home — Called to Rule].</ref>

Biblical patriarchists see what they describe as a crisis of this era being what they term to be a systematic attack on the "timeless truths of biblical patriarchy." They believe such an attack includes the movement to "subvert the biblical model of the family, and redefine the very meaning of fatherhood and motherhood, masculinity, femininity, and the parent and child relationship."<ref name=Patriarchy/> Arguing from the biblical presentation of God revealing himself "as masculine, not feminine", they believe God ordained distinct gender roles for man and woman as part of the created order. They say "Adam’s headship over Eve was established at the beginning, before sin entered the world". Their view is that the male has God-given authority and mandate to direct "his" household in paths of obedience to God. They refer to man's "dominion" beginning within the home, and a man’s qualification to lead and ability to lead well in the public square is based upon his prior success in ''ruling his household''.<ref name=Patriarchy/>

Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as "two-point Complementarianism" (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as "three-point" or "full" complementarianism (male leadership in family, church ''and society'').<ref>[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/men_and_women_and_the_creation.aspx Men and Women and the Creation Order, Part 1 - Vision Forum Ministries]</ref>

The patriarchists teach that "the woman was created as a helper to her husband, as the bearer of children, and as a "keeper at home,"aa concluding that the God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household. Biblical patriarchists consider that "faithfulness to Christ requires that (Biblical patriarchy) be believed, taught, and lived." They claim that the "man is...the image and glory of God in terms of authority, while the woman is the glory of man." They teach that a wife is to be ''obedient'' to her "head" (husband), based upon [[Old Testament]] teachings and models.

==Biblical foundations and history==

Christians believe that marriage is considered in its ideal according to the purpose of [[God in Christianity|God]]. At the heart of God's design for marriage is companionship and intimacy.

The biblical picture of marriage expands into something much broader, with the husband and wife relationship illustrating the relationship between [[Bride of Christ|Christ and the church]].

It is also considered in its actual occurrence, sometimes involving failure. Therefore, the Bible speaks on the subject of [[divorce]].<ref name="Staggs" /> The New Testament recognizes a place for singleness. [[Salvation]] within Christianity is not dependent on the continuation of a biological lineage.<ref name="EOC" />

=== Old Testament ===
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 146.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Rembrandt's depiction of Samson's marriage feast]]
{{See also|Polygamy#Judaism|Pilegesh}}

Christians regard the foundational principle of the lifelong union of a man and a woman to have been first articulated biblically in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}}. It was reaffirmed by [[Jesus]] in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:5}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:6-8}} and by the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|1Co|6:16||1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:16}}. The [[Old Testament]] describes a number of marriages, some of the best known being [[Adam]] and [[Eve]]; [[Abraham]], [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar]]; [[Isaac]] and [[Rebekah]]; [[Jacob]], [[Rachel]] and [[Leah]]; [[Boaz]] and [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]]; [[David]], [[Michal]], [[Ahinoam]], [[Abigail]], [[Maachah]], [[Haggith]], [[Abital]], [[Eglah]] and [[Bathsheba]]; and [[Hosea]] and the prostitute [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], whom he married at God's command.{{Bibleref2c|Hosea|1:2-3}}

[[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Old Testament,<ref name="JewEncMar">{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&artid=213}}</ref> yet scholars doubt that it was common among average Israelites because of the wealth needed to practice it.<ref>Gene McAfee [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t120.e0669 "Sex"] The Oxford Companion to the Bible.

[[Betrothal]] (''[[erusin]]''), which is merely a binding promise to get married, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.<ref name="JewEncMar" /><ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar">{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Marriage|section=Manius-Mash}}</ref> Since a wife was regarded as property in biblical times, the betrothal (''erusin'') was effected simply by purchasing her from her father (or [[parental guardian|guardian]]);<ref name="JewEncMar" /><ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /> the girl’s consent is not explicitly required by any biblical law.<ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" />

Like the adjacent Arabic culture ([[Pre-Islamic Arabia|in the pre-Islamic period]]),<ref>[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 81</ref> the act of marriage appears mainly to have consisted of the groom fetching the bride, although among the [[Israelites]] (unlike the Arabs) the procession was a festive occasion, accompanied by music, dancing, and lights.<ref name="JewEncMar" /><ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /> To celebrate the marriage, week-long feasts were sometimes held.<ref name="JewEncMar" /><ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" />

In Old Testament times, a wife was regarded as [[chattel]], belonging to her husband.<ref name="JewEncMar" /><ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /> The descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].<ref>{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}</ref> However, wives were usually looked after with care, and [[bigamy|bigamous]] men were expected to ensure that they give their first wife food, clothing, and sexual activity.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her for any reason, at any time.<ref name="CheyneAndBlackMar" /> A divorced couple could get back together unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

=== Jesus on marriage, divorce, and remarriage ===
[[File:Christian-Marriage-Symbol.jpg|thumb|150x|Sometimes used as a [[symbol]] for Christian marriage: Two gold wedding rings interlinked with the Greek letters ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'' (X) and ''[[Rho (letter)|rho]]'' (P)—the first two letters in the Greek word for "Christ" (see [[Labarum]])]]

The Bible clearly addresses marriage and divorce. Those in troubled marriages are encouraged to seek counseling and restoration because most divorces are neither necessary nor unavoidable.<ref name=Desai/>

{{Quotation|"Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh"? So they ''are'' no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."|{{Bibleref2|Matt.|19:4–6}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:7–9}} Ital. added}}

In both Matthew and Mark, Jesus appealed to God's will in creation. He builds upon the narrative in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|1:27}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Genesis|5:2}} where male and female are created together and for one another. Thus Jesus takes a firm stand on the permanence of marriage in the original will of God. This corresponds closely with the position of the Pharisee school of thought led by [[Shammai]], at the start of the first millennium,<ref name="Git910">''[[Gittin]]'' 9:10</ref><ref>''[[Sotah]]'' ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] only), 1:1</ref><ref>''Sotah'' (Jerusalem Talmud only), 1:16b</ref> with which Jesus would have been familiar. By contrast, [[Rabbinic Judaism]] subsequently took the opposite view, espoused by [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], the leader of the other major Pharisee school of thought at the time; in Hillel's view, men were allowed to divorce their wives for any reason.<ref name="Git910" />

Some hold that marriage vows are unbreakable, so that even in the distressing circumstances in which a couple separates, they are still married from God’s point of view. This is so in the Roman Catholic church, although occasionally it will declare a marriage to be null (in other words, it never really was a marriage).<ref>"Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Matrimony". [www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm]</ref> William Barclay (1907-1978) has written:
{{Quotation|There is no time in history when the marriage bond stood in greater peril of destruction than in the days when Christianity first came into this world. At that time the world was in danger of witnessing the almost total break-up of marriage and the collapse of the home…. Theoretically no nation ever had a higher ideal of marriage than the Jews had. The voice of God had said, "I hate divorce" (in {{Bibleref2|Malachi|2:16}})|William Barclay<ref>Barclay, William. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Westminster John Knox Press, Rev Upd edition (December 1, 2001). ISBN 978-0664224912</ref>}}

Jesus brought together two passages from Genesis, reinforcing the basic position on marriage found in Jewish scripture. Thus, he implicitly emphasized that it is God-made ("God has joined together"), "male and female," lifelong ("let no one separate"), and monogamous ("a man…his wife").<ref name="Stagg NT">Stagg, Frank.''New Testament Theology''. Broadman, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7</ref>

[[Jesus]] used the image of marriage and the family to teach the basics about the [[Kingdom of God]]. He inaugurated his ministry by blessing the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast at Cana]]. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he set forth a new commandment concerning marriage, teaching that lustful looking constitutes [[adultery]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|5:28}} He also [[Supersessionism|superseded a Mosaic Law]] allowing divorce with his teaching that "…anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality (Gk. ''porneia''),<ref>Thayer and Smith. "Greek Lexicon entry for Porneia". ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon''.</ref> causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery".{{Bibleref2c|Mt|5:32||cf. Mt. 5:32}} {{Bibleref2c|Mt|19:19}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk|10:11}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk|16:18}} Similar Pauline teachings are found in {{Bibleref2|1cor|7:10–11|ESV|1&nbsp;Corinthians 7:10–11}}. The exception clause—"except for…"—uses the Greek word ''porneia'' which is variously translated "fornication" (KJV), "marital unfaithfulness" (NIV 1984), "sexual immorality" (NIV 2011), "unchastity" (RSV), ''et&nbsp;al''. ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon, KJV'' says ''porneia'' includes a variety of sexual "deviations" to include "illicit sexual intercourse, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, intercourse with animals, etc., sexual intercourse with close relatives…."{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|18}}

[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] says that manuscripts disagree as to the presence in the original text of the phrase "except for fornication".<ref name="Stagg NT"/>{{rp|pp.300–301}} Stagg writes: "Divorce always represents failure…a deviation from God's will…. There is grace and redemption where there is contrition and repentance…. There is no clear authorization in the New Testament for remarriage after divorce." Stagg interprets the chief concern of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:32}} as being "to condemn the criminal act of the man who divorces an innocent wife…. Jesus was rebuking the husband who victimizes an innocent wife and thinks that he makes it right with her by giving her a divorce". He points out that Jesus refused to be trapped by the [[Pharisees]] into choosing between the strict and liberal positions on divorce as held at the time in Judaism. When they asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:3}} he answered by reaffirming God's will as stated in Genesis {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|1:27}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|2:24}}, that in marriage husband and wife are made "one flesh", and what God has united man must not separate.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:4-6}}<ref name="Stagg NT"/>{{rp|pp.300–301}}

There is no evidence that Jesus himself ever married, and considerable evidence that he remained single. In contrast to Judaism and many other traditions,<ref name="EOC">Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey Bromiley. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity.'' Brill Academic Publishers (November 2000). ISBN 90-04-11695-8.</ref>{{Rp|p.283}} he taught that there is a place for voluntary singleness in Christian service. He believed marriage could be a distraction from an urgent mission,<ref>Armstrong, Karen. ''The Gospel according to women: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west,'' Anchor Books, 1991. ISBN 978-0-385-24079-6</ref> that he was living in a time of crisis and urgency where the [[Kingdom of God]] would be established where there would be no marriage nor giving in marriage:

{{Quotation|
"I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the [[World to Come|age to come]], [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]]."|{{bibleref2|Luke|18:29–30}}
}}

=== New Testament beyond the Gospels ===

The [[Saint Paul|Apostle Paul]] quoted passages from Genesis almost verbatim in two of his New Testament books. He used marriage not only to describe the kingdom of God, as Jesus had done, but to define also the nature of the 1st-century Christian church. His [[theology|theological view]] was a Christian development of the [[Old Testament]] parallel between marriage and the relationship between God and [[Israel]]. He analogized the church as a bride and Christ as the bridegroom─drawing parallels between Christian marriage and the relationship between Christ and the [[Christian Church|Church]].

[[Image:PaulT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century.]]

There is no hint in the New Testament that Jesus was ever married, and no clear evidence that Paul was ever married. However, both Jesus and Paul seem to view marriage as the preferred norm according to the purpose of God for Christians. They provide "exceptions" to being married because of extraordinary circumstances ("because of the impending crisis"), see also [[Pauline privilege]]. Their concerns were that marriage might be a distraction from the work of discipleship.<ref>Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family.'' Paulist Press, 2003. ISBN 0-8091-4118-3.</ref>

Some scholars have speculated that Paul may have been a widower since prior to his conversion to Christianity he was a [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] and member of the [[Sanhedrin]], positions in which the social norm of the day required the men to be married. But it is just as likely that he never married at all.<ref name="Adams">Adams, Jay E. ''Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the Bible,'' Zondervan, 1986, ISBN 0-310-51111-9</ref>

Yet, Paul acknowledges the mutuality of marital relations, and recognizes that his own singleness is "a particular gift from God" that others may not necessarily have. "Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion."{{Bibleref2c|1Co|7:8||1&nbsp;Cor 7:8}}

[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] indicates that [[bishop]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s must be "husbands of one wife", and that women must have one husband. This is usually understood to legislate against polygamy rather than to require marriage:

{{quotation|Now the overseer (bishop) is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:2||1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2}}}}

{{quotation|A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:12||1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:12}}}}

{{quotation|The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint (or ordain) elders in every town, as I directed you. An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.|{{Bibleref2|Titus|1:5-6}}}}

In the Roman Age, female widows who did not remarry were considered more pure than those who did.<ref>Peter Walcot: On Widows and their Reputation in Antiquity. In: Symbolae Osloenses, Volume 66, Issue 1. 1991: pp.5-26</ref> Such widows were known as ''one man woman'' (''enos andros gune'') in the epistles of Paul.{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:9||1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;5:9}} Paul writes:
{{Quotation|No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds".|{{Bibleref2|1Tim|5:9-10||1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;5:9-10}}}}

Paul allowed widows to remarry.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|7:39-40||1&nbsp;Cor.&nbsp;7:39-40}} {{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:11-16||1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;5:11-16}} Paul says that only ''one-man women'' older than 60 years{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:9-10||1&nbsp;Tim.&nbsp;5:9-10}} can make the list of Christian widows who did special tasks in the community, but that younger widows should remarry to hinder sin. By demanding that leaders of the Church be a ''one woman man'', Paul excluded remarried widowers from having influence. This was a more strict understanding of monogamy than what the Roman laws codified, and it was new and unusual that the demand was made on men.

=== Marriage and early Church Fathers ===

Building on what they saw the example of Jesus and Paul advocating, some early [[Church Fathers]] placed less value on the family and saw [[celibacy]] and freedom from family ties as a preferable state.

[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Nicene Fathers]] such as [[Augustine]] believed that marriage was a sacrament because it was a symbol used by Paul to express Christ's love of the Church. However, there was also an apocalyptic dimension in his teaching, and he was clear that if everybody stopped marrying and having children that would be an admirable thing; it would mean that the [[Kingdom of God]] would return all the sooner and the [[End times|world would come to an end]].<ref name="Armstrong">Armstrong, Karen. ''Gospel According to Women.'' Anchor Books, 1991. ISBN 978-0-385-24079-6</ref> Such a view reflects the [[Manichaean]] past of Augustine.

While upholding the New Testament teaching that marriage is "honourable in all and the bed undefiled,"<ref>Hebrews 13:4</ref> Augustine believed that "yet, whenever it comes to the actual process of generation, the very embrace which is lawful and honourable cannot be effected without the ardour of lust...This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer accounted sin in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except from sin."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15071.htm Augustine, “On Marriage and Concupiscence," Book I], cp. 27</ref>

Both [[Tertullian]] and Gregory of Nyssa were church fathers who were married. They each stressed that the happiness of marriage was ultimately rooted in misery. They saw marriage as a state of bondage that could only be cured by celibacy. They wrote that at the very least, the virgin woman could expect release from the "governance of a husband and the chains of children."<ref>Scholer, David M.''Women in early Christianity.'' Garland Publishing, 1993. ISBN 978-0-8153-1074-7</ref>{{rp|p.151}}

[[Tertullian]] argued that second marriage, having been freed from the first by death,"will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication," partly based on the reasoning that this involves desiring to marry a woman out of sexual ardor, which a Christian convert is to avoid.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.vi.ix.htm "An Exhortation to Chastity, Second Marriage a Species of Adultery, Marriage Itself Impugned, as Akin to Adultery"], Chapter IX.</ref>

Also advocating celibacy and virginity as preferable alternatives to marriage, [[Jerome]] wrote: "It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity. No one can make a comparison between two things if one is good and the other evil."<ref>''Classical library from 'Select Letters of St. Jerome,''&nbsp;' Letter 22. tr. by F. A. Wright. Cambridge MA: Harvard Univ Press, 1963.</ref> On [[First Corinthians]] 7:1 he reasons, "It is good, he says, for a man not to touch a woman. If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil."<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.vi.vi.I.html "Against Jovinianus," Book 1], Cps. 7,13,16,33</ref>

St. [[John Chrysostom]] wrote: "...virginity is better than marriage, however good.... Celibacy is...an imitation of the angels. Therefore, virginity is as much more honorable than marriage, as the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ, Himself, is the glory of virginity."<ref>St. John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on First Corinthians, NPNF, s. 1, v. 12, pp. 248–262</ref>

[[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, said that the first commandment given to men was to increase and multiply, but now that the earth was full there was no need to continue this process of multiplication.<ref>St. Cyprian, "Of the Discipline and Advantage of Chastity," ''ANF,'' v. 5, p.1251.</ref>

This view of marriage was reflected in the lack of any formal [[liturgy]] formulated for marriage in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]]. No special ceremonial was devised to celebrate Christian marriage—despite the fact that the Church had produced liturgies to celebrate the [[Eucharist]], [[Baptism]] and [[Confirmation]]. It was not important for a couple to have their nuptials blessed by a [[priest]]. People could marry by mutual agreement in the presence of witnesses.<ref name="Armstrong" />

At first, the old Roman pagan rite was used by Christians, although modified superficially. The first detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates from the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. This system, known as Spousals, persisted after the [[Reformation]].<ref name="Armstrong" />

==Denominational beliefs and practice==

=== Catholic Church ===
{{Main|Catholic marriage}}
[[Image:Pietro Longhi 007.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Catholic couple at their Holy Matrimony or marriage. In the [[Latin rite|Latin rite of the Catholic Church]], during the celebration the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] imposes his [[stole (vestment)|liturgical stole]] upon the couple's hands, as a sign to confirm the marriage bond.]]

The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that God himself is the author of the sacred institution of marriage, which is His way of showing love for those He created. Marriage is a divine institution that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God. Holy Matrimony is another name for sacramental marriage.

Marriage is intended to be a faithful, exclusive, lifelong union of a man and a woman. Committing themselves completely to each other, a Catholic husband and wife strive to sanctify each other, bring children into the world, and educate them in the Catholic way of life. Man and woman, although created differently from each other, complement each other. This complementarity draws them together in a mutually loving union.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1602–1605|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P51.HTM}}</ref>

The valid marriage of baptized Christians is one of the seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]]. The sacrament of marriage is the only sacrament that a priest does not administer directly; a priest, however, is the chief witnesses of the husband and wife's administration of the sacrament to each other at the wedding ceremony in a Catholic church.

The Catholic Church views that Christ himself established the sacrament of marriage at the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast of Cana]]; therefore, since it is a divine institution, neither the Church nor state can alter the basic meaning and structure of marriage. Husband and wife give themselves totally to each other in a union that lasts until death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|page=1643|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P55.HTM}}</ref>

[[Priest]]s are instructed that marriage is part of God's natural law and to support the couple if they do choose to marry. Today it is common for Catholics to enter into a "mixed marriage" between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic. Couples entering into a mixed marriage are usually allowed to marry in a Catholic church provided their decision is of their own accord and they intend to remain together for life, to be faithful to each other, and to have children which are brought up in the Catholic faith.<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=[[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1633–1637|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM}}</ref>

In Catholicism, marriage has two ends: the good of the spouses themselves, and the procreation and education of children (1983 code of canon law, c.1055; 1994 catechism, par.2363). Hence "entering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]]."<ref>McLachlan, P. "Sacrament of Holy Matrimony."</ref> It is normal procedure for a priest to ask the prospective bride and groom about their plans to have children before officiating at their wedding. The Catholic Church may refuse to marry anyone unwilling to have children, since procreation by "the marriage act" is a fundamental part of marriage.<ref name="humanae_vitae">[[Pope Paul VI]]."Humanæ Vitæ." 1968-7-25. Accessed: 2009-7-22</ref> Thus usage of any form of [[contraception]], [[in vitro fertilization]], or [[birth control]] besides [[Natural Family Planning]] is a grave offense against the sanctity of marriage and ultimately against God.<ref name="humanae_vitae" />

==== Purposes ====

Essentially all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations hold marriage to be ordained by God for the union between a man and a woman. They see the primary purposes of this union as intimate companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings.<ref>UMC</ref> Protestants generally approve of [[birth control]] and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God. While condoning [[divorce]] only under limited circumstances, most Protestant churches allow for divorce and remarriage.<ref>Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family,'' Paulist Press, 2003. ISBN 0-8091-4118-3.</ref>

[[Christian fundamentalism|Conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] take a stricter view of the nature of marriage. They consider marriage a solemn [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] between wife, husband and [[God]]. Most view sexual relations as appropriate only within a marriage. Divorce is permissible, if at all, only in very specific circumstances (for example, sexual immorality or abandonment by the non-believer).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotquestions.org/grounds-for-divorce.html|title=What are Biblical grounds for divorce?}}, gotquestions.org (Bible Questions Answered), Got Questions Ministries</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotquestions.org/abuse-divorce.html|title=Is abuse an acceptable reason for divorce?}}, gotquestions.org (Bible Questions Answered), Got Questions Ministries</ref>

==== Roles and responsibilities ====

Roles and responsibilities of husband and wives now vary considerably on a continuum between the long-held male dominant/female submission view and a shift toward equality (without sameness)<ref>Steil, Janice M. ''Marital Equality: Its Relationship to the Well-Being of Husbands and Wives.'' Sage. 1997. ISBN 0-8039-5251-1</ref> of the woman and the man.<ref>Throckmorton, Anne. [http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=3654 "The Lives of Wives: Their Changing Roles."] University of Virginia, January 9, 2008. Accessed 11 May 2009</ref> There is considerable debate among many Christians today—not just Protestants—whether equality of husband and wife or male headship is the biblically ordained view, and even if it is biblically permissible. The divergent opinions fall into two main groups: [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] (who call for husband-headship and wife-submission) and [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] (who believe in full partnership equality in which couples can discover and negotiate roles and responsibilities in marriage).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/august/8.55.html |title=Editor's Bookshelf: Creating Husbands and Fathers |accessdate=2007–02–11 |last=Neff |first=David |date=2004–08–01 |work=Christianity Today }}</ref>

There is no debate that {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:12-32|NIV}} presents a historically-benevolent husband-headship/wife-submission model for marriage. The questions are (a)&nbsp;how these [[New Testament household codes]] are to be reconciled with the calls earlier in Chapter 5 (cf. verses 1, 18, 21) for mutual submission among all believers, and (b)&nbsp;the meaning of "head" in v.23. It is important to note that verse 22 contains no verb in the original manuscripts:<ref name="Staggs"/>
<br />
{{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5}} (NIV)
::<sup>1</sup> Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children 2 and walk in the way of love....
::<sup>18</sup> be filled with the Spirit....
::<sup>21</sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
::<sup>22</sup> Wives, ''[submit yourselves]'' to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. <sup>23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. <sup>24</sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
::<sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her <sup>26</sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, <sup>27</sup> and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. <sup>28</sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup>29</sup> After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— <sup>30</sup> for we are members of his body. <sup>31</sup> “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” <sup>32</sup> This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup>33</sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], marriage is treated as a [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament), and as an [[ordination]]. It serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union before God.<ref name=Fitzgerald/><ref>[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=31112 Catholics and Orthodox: On Marriage and Family (Pt. I) – International – Catholic Online]. Catholic.org (2008-12-17).

Christianitytoday.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.</ref> Therefore, it is considered a [[martyr]]dom as each spouse learns to die to self for the sake of the other. Like all Mysteries, Orthodox marriage is more than just a celebration of something which already exists: it is the creation of something new, the imparting to the couple of the [[Divine grace|grace]] which transforms them from a 'couple' into husband and wife within the [[Body of Christ]].<ref name="Grabbe" />

[[Image:Wedding ring Louvre AC924.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine [[wedding ring]], depicting Christ uniting the bride and groom, 7th century, [[niello]]ed gold ([[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]]).]]

Marriage is an [[icon]] (image) of the relationship between Jesus and the Church. This is somewhat akin to the Old Testament [[prophet]]s' use of marriage as an analogy to describe the relationship between God and Israel. Marriage is the simplest, most basic unity of the church: a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] where "two or three are gathered together in Jesus' name."{{bibleref2c|Mt|18:20|KJV}}<ref name="Grabbe" /> The home is considered a consecrated space (the ritual for the Blessing of a House is based upon that of the Consecration of a Church), and the husband and wife are considered the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of that congregation. However, they do not "perform" the Sacraments in the [[house church]]; they "live" the Sacrament of Marriage. Because marriage is considered to be a [[pilgrimage]] wherein the couple walk side by side toward the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], marriage to a non-Orthodox partner is discouraged, though it may be permitted.

Unlike Western Christianity, Eastern Christians do not consider the sacramental aspect of the marriage to be conferred by the couple themselves. Rather, the marriage is conferred by the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] acting through the priest. Furthermore, no one besides a bishop or priest—not even a [[deacon]]—may perform the Sacred Mystery.

The external sign of the marriage is the placing of wedding [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] upon the heads of the couple, and their sharing in a "Common Cup" of wine. Once crowned, the couple walk a circle three times in a ceremonial "dance" in the middle of the church, while the choir intones a joyous three-part antiphonal hymn, "Dance, [[Isaiah]]"

The sharing of the Common Cup symbolizes the transformation of their union from a common marriage into a sacred union. The wedding is usually performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] at which the couple receives [[Holy Communion]]. Traditionally, the wedding couple would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, and there is a special prayer said by the priest at the removal of the crowns.

Divorce is discouraged. Sometimes out of ''[[economia]]'' (mercy) a marriage may be dissolved if there is no hope whatever for a marriage to fulfill even a semblance of its intended sacramental character.<ref name="Grabbe" /> The standard formula for remarriage is that the Orthodox Church joyfully blesses the first marriage, merely performs the second, barely tolerates the third, and invariably forbids the fourth.<ref name="Hapgood">{{Citation|last =Hapgoood|first =Isabel F.|year =1922|publicationdate=1975|title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=2nd|pages =291–305, 604–605|place =Englewood, N.J.|publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}</ref>

[[Image:07Thessaloniki Agia Sophia09.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Church prepared for a wedding ([[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]], [[Thessaloniki]].)]]

[[Early church]] texts forbid marriage between an Orthodox Christian and a [[Heresy|heretic]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] (which would include all non-Orthodox Christians). Traditional Orthodox Christians forbid [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s with other denominations. More liberal ones perform them, provided that the couple formally commit themselves to rearing their children in the Orthodox faith.

All people are called to celibacy—human beings are all born into [[virginity]], and Orthodox Christians are expected by [[Sacred Tradition]] to remain in that state unless they are called into marriage and that call is sanctified.<ref name="Grabbe">Gregory (Grabbe), Bishop. ''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective.'' Liberty, Tenn: St. John of Kronstadt Press, 1986
</ref> The church blesses two paths on the journey to salvation: [[monasticism]] and marriage. Mere celibacy, without the sanctification of monasticism, can fall into selfishness and tends to be regarded with disfavour by the Church.<ref name="Grabbe" />

Orthodox priests who serve in [[parish]]es are usually married. They must marry prior to their ordination. If they marry after they are ordained they are not permitted to continue performing sacraments. If their wife dies, they are forbidden to remarry; if they do, they may no longer serve as a priest. A married man may be ordained as a priest or deacon. However, a priest or deacon is not permitted to enter into matrimony after ordination. Bishops must always be monks and are thus celibate. However, if a married priest is widowed, he may receive monastic tonsure and thus become eligible for the episcopate.

The Eastern Orthodox Church believes that marriage is an eternal union of spouses, but in Heaven there will not be a procreative bond of marriage.

=== Oriental Orthodox Church ===
The [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] hold views almost identical to those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] allows second marriages only in cases of adultery.<ref>[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/coptic-pope-resists-court-ruling-divorce-remarriage Coptic Pope resists court ruling on divorce, remarriage | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt].

=== Non-Trinitarian denominations ===

[[Image:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A [[Celestial Marriage]] must be performed in an [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temple]].]]

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
{{See also|Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormonism and polygamy}}
In LDS teaching [[Celestial marriage]] is a sacred [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] between a man, a woman and [[God in Mormonism|God]] performed by a [[priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] authority in the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] of the Church. Eternal marriage is legally recognized, but unlike other civil marriages, Eternal marriage is intended to continue into the [[afterlife]] after the [[resurrection]] if the man and woman do not break their covenants. Eternally married couples are often referred to as being "[[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]]" to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the after life. Thus, the slogan of the LDS Church: "families are forever." The LDS Church encourages its members to be in good standing with it so that they may marry in the temple. "Cancellation of a sealing", sometimes incorrectly called a "temple divorce," is uncommon and is granted only by the highest authority in the Church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple is somewhat of a stigma in the [[Latter-day Saint]] culture although currently the Church itself directs its local leaders not to advise members about divorce one way or another.<ref>[http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?locale=0&sourceId=1d7f0bbce1d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD "Mormon view of divorce."]</ref>

==== New Church (or Swedenborgian Church) ====

[[The New Church]] teaches that marriage love (sometimes translated "conjugial love") is "the precious jewel of human life and the repository of the Christian religion" because the love shared between a husband and a wife is the source of all peace and joy.<ref>[http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&section=457 ML 457]</ref> [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] coined the term "conjugial" (not to be confused with the more general term for marriage, "conjugal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&section=98 |title=ML 98 - Small Canon Search - Reading - The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God - Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible - The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjugal |title=Conjugal &#124; Define Conjugal at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>) to describe the special love experienced by married partners.<ref>Swedenborg, E.

==== Jehovah's Witnesses ====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] view marriage to be a permanent arrangement with the only possible exception being adultery. Divorce is strongly discouraged even when adultery is committed since the wronged spouse is free to forgive the unfaithful one. There are provisions for a domestic separation in the event of "failure to provide for one's household" and domestic violence, or spiritual resistance on the part of a partner. Even in such situations though divorce would be considered grounds for loss of privileges in the congregation. Re-marrying after death or a proper divorce is permitted. Marriage is the only situation where any type of sexual interaction is acceptable, and even then certain restrictions apply to acts such as oral and anal sex. Married persons who are known to commit such acts may in fact lose privileges in the congregation as they are supposed to be setting a good example to the congregation.<ref>[[The Watchtower]] 9/15/2006, 3/15/1983, 11/1/2008</ref>

== Same-sex marriage ==
{{Main|Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|Same-sex marriage}}

A small number of mainline Protestant denominations such as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[United Church of Canada]] and some non-trinitarian denominations perform weddings between same-sex couples. Other churches perform ceremonies blessing same sex unions, but do not refer to them as marriages. The Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Christian Church, and the vast majority of [[Protestant]] denominations do not perform or recognise same-sex marriage. Whether or not to bless same-sex marriages and unions is a matter of debate within a few Protestant denominations.
