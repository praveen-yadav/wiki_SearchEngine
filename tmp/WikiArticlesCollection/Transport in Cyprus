Because [[Cyprus]] has no working [[railway]] system, various other methods of [[transport]] are  needed to ensure the proper delivery of any cargo, be it human or freight.  Since [[Cyprus Government Railway|the last railway]] was dismantled in 1952, the only remaining modes of transport are by [[motorway]]s, by sea, and by air.

Of the 12,118&nbsp;km of roads in the areas controlled by the Republic of Cyprus in 2006, 7,850&nbsp;km were paved, while 4,268&nbsp;km were unpaved. In 1996, the Turkish Cypriot area showed a close, but smaller ratio of paved to unpaved with about 1,370&nbsp;km out of 2,350&nbsp;km paved and 980&nbsp;km unpaved.<ref>[http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/PWD/pwd.nsf/All/0A49EACB1E1CA73FC2257354003B6922?Opendocument Τμήμα Δημοσίων Έργων - Στατιστικά Στοιχεία - Συντήρηση Δρόμων 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a legacy of [[British Empire|British rule]], Cyprus is one of only four EU nations in which vehicles drive on the [[Driving on the left or right|left]].

Public transport in Cyprus is limited to privately run bus services (except in [[Nicosia]]), taxis, and interurban 'shared' taxi services (locally referred to as ''service taxis''). Thus, private car ownership in the country is the fifth highest per capita in the world. However in 2006 extensive plans were announced to expand and improve bus services and restructure public transport throughout Cyprus, with the financial backing of the [[European Union]] Development Bank

== Ports and harbours ==

The ports of Cyprus are operated and maintained by the [[Cyprus Ports Authority]]. Major [[harbour]]s of the island are ''[[Limassol Port|Limassol]] harbour'', and ''[[Larnaca]] harbour'', which service cargo, passenger, and cruise ships. Limassol is the larger of the two, and handles a large volume of both cargo and cruise vessels. Larnaca is primarily a cargo port but played a big part in the evacuation of foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006, and in the subsequent humanitarian aid effort. A smaller cargo dock also exists at [[Vasilikos]], near [[Zygi]] (a small town between Larnaca and Limassol). Smaller vessels and private yachts can dock at Marinas in Cyprus.

==Public Bicycle sharing system==
[[File:New Public Buses in Nicosia Republic of Cyprus in the afternoon.jpg|thumb|Public bicycles in Nicosia]]

Bike in Action is the latest transportation system for the greater Nicosia area, similar to programs employed successfully in various cities around the world (Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Melbourne, etc.). Bicycles can be found at stations in all participating municipalities (Agios Dometios, [[Aglandjia]], Dali, Engomi, Latsia, Pallouriotissa, Strovolos) and returned after their use at any station.
