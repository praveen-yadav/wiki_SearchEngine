'''Bambara''', also known as Bamana, and '''Bamanankan''' by speakers of the language,  is a [[language]] spoken in [[Mali]], and to a lesser extent [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Senegal]], by as many as six million people (including second language users). The Bambara language is the language of people of the [[Bambara ethnic group]], numbering about 4,000,000 people, but serves also as a [[lingua franca]] in Mali (it is estimated that about 80 percent of the population speak it as a first or second language). It is a [[Subject–object–verb]] language and has two [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s.

==Classification==
Bambara is a language/dialect of the [[Manding languages|Manding]] language cluster, a cluster of languages whose ethnic-speakers generally trace their cultural history to the ancient city of Manding, where modern-day [[Kita, Mali|Kita]], Mali now exists.<ref>http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/mandekan.pdf</ref>  Bambara is classified as part of the larger, very broad [[Mande languages|Mandé]] group. Dialects of [[Manding languages|Manding]] are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible &ndash; dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers &ndash; and spoken by approximately 20 million people in the countries [[Burkina Faso]], [[Senegal]], [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[the Gambia]].<ref>http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Manding.htm</ref>

==Alphabet and literature==
It uses seven vowels {{unicode|a, e, ɛ, i, o, ɔ}} and {{unicode|u}} (the letters approximate their [[help:IPA|IPA]] equivalents).
Writing was introduced during the [[French West Africa|French]] occupation and literacy is limited, especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the "language of the educated"), there exists a wealth of [[oral history|oral literature]], which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly tradited by the "[[Griot]]s" (''Jɛliw'' in Bambara) who are a mixture of [[storytelling|storyteller]]s, [[praise singer]]s and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old kingdom of Mali.

==Geographical distribution==
Bambara is spoken throughout Mali as a lingua franca. The language is most widely spoken in the areas east, south, and northeast of Bamako, where native speakers and/or those that identify as members of the Bambara ethnic group are most densely populated. These regions are also usually considered to be the historical geographical origin of Bambara people, particularly [[Segou]], [[Sikasso]], after diverging from other Manding groups.<ref>http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Bamana.htm</ref>

==Sub-dialects==
The main sub-dialect is standard Bamara, which has significant influence from [[Western Maninkakan]]. Bambara has many local dialects. Some dialect variants: Somono, Segou, San, Beledugu, Ganadugu, Wasulu and Sikasso.<ref>http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bam</ref>

==Writing==
Since the 1970s Bambara has mostly been written in the [[Latin script]], using some additional phonetic characters. The vowels are ''a, e, {{unicode|[[ɛ]]}}'' (formerly ''[[è]]''<span style="margin-left:3px">)</span>, ''i, o, {{unicode|[[ɔ]]}}'' (formerly ''[[ò]]''<span style="margin-left:3px">)</span>, ''u''<span style="margin-left:2px">;</span> accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph ''ny'' is now written ''{{unicode|[[ɲ]]}}'' or ''[[ñ]]'' (in [[Senegal]]). The ambiguous digraph "ng" represented both the {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} [[List of  Latin-script digraphs#N|sound]] of English "fi'''ng'''er" and the {{IPAblink|ŋ}} [[velar nasal|sound]] of "si'''ng'''er". The 1966 Bamako spelling conventions render the latter sound as "[[ŋ]]".

The [[N'Ko]] (ߒߞߏ) alphabet is a script devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in 1949 as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa; N’Ko means 'I say' in all Manding languages. Kante created N’Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a "cultureless people" since prior to this time there had been no indigenous African writing system for his language. N'ko came first into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. N'ko and the [[Arabic script]] are still in use for Bambara, although the Latin script is much more common.

==Grammar==
Bambara belongs to a group of closely related languages called Manding (related to [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], [[Mande languages|Mande]] language group). It is an [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] language and has two (mid/standard and high) [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s; e.g. ''sa'' 'death' vs. ''sá'' 'snake.' The typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject, followed by an aspectival auxiliary, followed by the direct object, and finally a transitive verb.  Naturally, if the verb is intransitive, the direct object is not found.

Bambara does not inflect for gender. Gender for a noun can be specified by adding a suffix, ''-ce'' or ''-ke'' for male and ''-muso'' for female. The plural is formed by attaching ''-w'' to words.

Bambara uses postpositions in much the same manner as languages like English and French use prepositions. These postpositions are found after the verb and are used to express direction, location, and in some cases, possession.

===Loan words===
In urban areas, many Bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The [[Bamako]] dialect makes use of sentences like: ''N taara Kita mais il n'y avait personne là-bas.'' : ''I went to Kita [Bambara] but there was no one there [French].'' The sentence in Bambara alone would be ''{{unicode|N taara Kita nka mɔgɔsi tuntɛ yen}}.'' The French proposition "est-ce que" is also used in Bambara; however, it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables, {{IPA|[ɛsəkə]}}.

Bambara uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say:
''{{unicode|I ka kulosi ye jauni ye}}'': "Your skirt is yellow" (using a derivation of the French word for yellow, jaune.)

However, one could also say:
''{{unicode|I ka kulosi ye neremuguman ye}}'', also meaning "your skirt is yellow." The original Bambara word for yellow comes from "''neremugu''," ''mugu'' being flour made from [[Parkia biglobosa|Néré]], a seed from a long seed pod. Neremugu is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.

Most French loan words are suffixed with the sound 'i'; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bambara word for [[snow]] is ''niegei'', based on the French word for snow ''neige''. As there has never been snow in Mali, there has not been a traditional meaning for the word and thus no unique word in Bambara to describe it.

===Examples===
;''{{unicode|N bɛ bamanankan mɛn dɔɔni-dɔɔni}}''
:I understand/hear a little bit of Bambara (lit: I ''aux positive'' Bambara hear small-small)

;''{{unicode|I tɛna dumuni ke wa}}?''
:Aren't you going to eat? (lit: you ''aux negative future'' eating do ''question particle'')

;''{{unicode|Du Mara be ameriki hali bi wa?}}''
:Is Dou Mara still living in the USA? (lit: Dou Mara still America in live ''question particle'')
Macire nana MALI la wa ? (did Macire come to Mali?)

==Music==
Malian artists such as [[Oumou Sangaré]], [[Rokia Traoré]], [[Ali Farka Touré]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Habib Koité]], and the blind couple [[Amadou & Mariam]] often sing in Bambara.  Aïda of the band [[Métisse]] often sings in Dioula, as does [[Mory Kante]], born in Guinea to a Malian mother; his most famous song to date is "Yeke Yeke" ([[Alpha Blondy]]).  Lyrics in Bambara occur on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s soundtrack ''[[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]]''.
[[Tiken Jah Fakoly]] (reggae) often sings in Dioula and French.

Additionally, in 2010, [[Spain|Spanish]] rock group [[Dover (band)|Dover]] released their 7th studio album [[I Ka Kené]] with the majority of lyrics in the language.
