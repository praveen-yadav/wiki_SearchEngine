'''Cetus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|t|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]]. Its name refers to [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]], a [[sea monster]] in [[Greek mythology]], although it is often called 'the [[whale]]' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].

==Notable features==
[[Image:CetusCC.jpg|thumb|left|256px|The constellation Cetus as it can be seen by the naked eye.]]

===Ecliptic===
Although Cetus is not generally considered part of the [[zodiac]], the [[ecliptic]] passes close to its constellation boundary, and thus the planets may be seen in Cetus for brief periods of time.  This is even more true of asteroids, since their orbits usually have a greater [[inclination]] to the ecliptic than planets. For example, the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]] was discovered in this constellation in 1807.

===Stars===
{{main|List of stars in Cetus}}
The most notable [[star]] in Cetus is [[Mira]] ("the Wonderful"), designated [[Omicron Ceti]], the first [[variable star]] to be discovered and the prototype of [[Mira variable|its class]]. Over a period of 332 days it reaches a maximum [[apparent magnitude]] of 3 - visible to the naked eye - and dips to a minimum magnitude of 10, invisible to the unaided eye. Its seeming appearance and disappearance gave it its common name, which means "the amazing one". Mira [[pulsating variable|pulsates]] with a minimum size of 400 solar diameters and a maximum size of 500 solar diameters. 420 light-years from Earth, it was discovered by [[David Fabricius]] in 1596.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

There are several other bright stars in Cetus. [[Alpha Ceti|α Ceti]], traditionally called Menkar ("the nose"), is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 2.5, 220 light-years from Earth. It is a wide [[double star]]; the secondary is [[93 Ceti]], a blue-white hued star of magnitude 5.6, 440 light-years away. [[Beta Ceti|β Ceti]], also called Deneb Kaitos and Diphda, is the brightest star in Cetus. It is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.0, 96 light-years from Earth. The traditional name "Deneb Kaitos" means "the whale's tail". [[Gamma Ceti|γ Ceti]], Kaffaljidhma ("head of the whale") is a very close double star. The primary is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.5, 82 light-years from Earth, and the secondary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 6.6.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

[[Tau Ceti]] is noted for being the nearest [[Sun-like star]] at a distance of 11.9 light-years. It is a yellow-hued [[main-sequence star]] of magnitude 3.5.

[[AA Ceti]] is a triple star system; the brightest member has a magnitude of 6.2. The primary and secondary are separated by 8.4 arcseconds at an angle of 304 degrees. The tertiary is not visible in telescopes. AA Ceti is an eclipsing variable star; the tertiary star passes in front of the primary and causes the system's apparent magnitude to decrease by 0.5 magnitudes.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=67}} [[UV Ceti]] is an unusual binary variable star. 8.7 light-years from Earth, the system consists of two [[red dwarfs]]. both of magnitude 13. One of the stars is a [[flare star]], which are prone to sudden, random outbursts that last several minutes; these increase the pair's apparent brightness significantly - as high as magnitude 7.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}}

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.jpg|thumb|Messier 77 spiral galaxy by HST.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hubble observes the hidden depths of Messier 77|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1305/|accessdate=4 April 2013|newspaper=ESA/Hubble}}</ref>]]
Cetus lies far from the [[galactic plane]], so that many distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] are visible, unobscured by dust from the [[Milky Way]]. Of these, the brightest is [[Messier 77]] (NGC 1068), a 9th magnitude [[spiral galaxy]] near [[Delta Ceti]]. It appears face-on and has a clearly visible nucleus of magnitude 10. About 50 million light-years from Earth, M77 is also a [[Seyfert galaxy]] and thus a bright object in the [[radio spectrum]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=114-116}} Recently, the galactic cluster [[JKCS 041|JKCS&nbsp;041]] was confirmed to be the most distant [[cluster of galaxies]] yet discovered.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scientists identify new galaxy|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/756711-scientists-identify-new-galaxy|newspaper=Metro|date=23 October 2009}}</ref>

[[NGC 246]] ([[Caldwell catalog|Caldwell]] 56), also called the Cetus Ring, is a [[planetary nebula]] with a magnitude of 8.0, 1600 light-years from Earth. Among some amateur astronomers, NGC 246 has garnered the nickname "Pac-Man Nebula" because of the arrangement of its central stars and the surrounding star field.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=129}}

==History and mythology==
Cetus may have originally been associated with a [[whale]], which would have had mythic status amongst Mesopotamian cultures. It is often now called the Whale, though it is most strongly associated with [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus the sea-monster]], who was slain by [[Perseus]] as he saved the princess [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from [[Poseidon]]'s wrath. Cetus is located in a region of the sky called "The Sea" because many water-associated constellations are placed there, including [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanus]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], [[Piscis Austrinus]], [[Capricornus]], and [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].<ref name="staal">{{Harvnb|Staal|1988|pp=33–35}}</ref>

Cetus has been depicted many ways throughout its history. In the 17th century, Cetus was depicted as a "dragon fish" by [[Johann Bayer]]. Both [[Willem Blaeu]] and [[Andreas Cellarius]] depicted Cetus as a whale-like creature in the same century. However, Cetus has also been variously depicted with animal heads attached to a piscine body.<ref name="staal"/>

===In global astronomy===
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Cetus are found among two areas: the [[Black Tortoise|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'') and the [[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger of the West]] (西方白虎, ''Xī Fāng Bái Hǔ'').

The Brazilian [[Tukano]] and [[Kobeua]] people used the stars of Cetus to create a [[jaguar]], representing the god of hurricanes and other violent storms. Lambda, Mu, Xi, Nu, Gamma, and Alpha Ceti represented its head; Omicron, Zeta, and Chi Ceti represented its body; Eta Eri, Tau Cet, and Upsilon Cet marked its legs and feel; and Theta, Eta, and  Beta Ceti delineated its tail.<ref name="staal"/>

In [[Hawaii]], the constellation was called ''Na Kuhi'' and Mira (Omicron Ceti) may have been called ''Kane''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Cetus (AK-77)]] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation.
