Cerberus is featured in many works of ancient Greek and Roman literature and in works of both ancient and modern art and architecture, although the depiction and background surrounding Cerberus often differed across various works by different authors of the era. The most notable difference is the number of its heads: Most sources describe or depict three heads; others show it with two or even just one; a smaller number of sources show a variable number, sometimes as many as 50 or even 100.

==Mythology==
Cerberus was the offspring of [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], a hybrid half-woman and half-serpent, and [[Typhon]], a gigantic monster even the Greek gods feared. Its siblings are the [[Lernaean Hydra]]; [[Orthrus]], a two-headed [[hellhound]]; and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], a three-headed monster.<ref name="perseus-cerberustask">{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/cerberus.html|title=Hercules' Twelfth Labor: Cerberus|publisher=Perseus Project|accessdate=2008-10-21}}</ref> The common depiction of Cerberus in Greek mythology and art is as having three heads. In most works, the three heads each respectively see and represent the past, the present, and the future, while other sources suggest the heads represent birth, youth, and old age.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first=Maurice|last=Bloomfield|year= 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=0-7661-3020-7|page=8}}</ref> Each of Cerberus' heads is said to have an appetite only for live meat and thus allow only the spirits of the dead to freely enter the underworld, but allow none to leave.<ref>{{cite book|title= Myths, Gods & Fantasy|first=Pamela|last=Allardice|year=1991|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0-87436-660-7|page=52}}</ref> Cerberus was always employed as Hades' loyal watchdog, and guarded the gates that granted access and exit to the underworld.<ref>{{cite book|title=Myths of Greece and Rome|first=Helene|last=Guerber|isbn=0-7661-4856-4|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003}}</ref>

===The Twelfth Labor of Heracles===
[[File:Herakles Kerberos Eurystheus Louvre E701.jpg|thumb|left|An ancient Etruscan vase from [[Caere]] (''circa'' 525 BC) depicting [[Heracles]] presenting Cerberus to [[Eurystheus]]]]
[[File:Orthos Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2620.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orthrus]] slain by [[Heracles]].]]
Capturing Cerberus, without using weapons, was the final labour assigned to [[Heracles]] (Hercules) by [[Eurystheus|King Eurystheus]], in recompense for the killing of his own children by [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]] after he was driven insane by [[Hera]], and therefore was the most dangerous and difficult.

After having been given the task, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] so he could learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive, and in passing absolve himself for killing centaurs. He found the entrance to the underworld at [[Tanaerum]], and [[Athena]] and [[Hermes]] helped him to traverse the entrance in each direction. He passed [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] with Hestia's assistance and his own heavy and fierce frowning.

Whilst in the underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by Hades for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs then turning into stone; another tells that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the wife of a god for himself was so insulting, he was doomed to stay behind.

Heracles found [[Hades]] and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, to which Hades agreed if Heracles could overpower the beast without using weapons. Heracles was able to overpower Cerberus and proceeded to sling the beast over his back, dragging it out of the underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and bringing it to Eurystheus. The king was so frightened of the beast, he jumped into a [[pithos]], and asked Heracles to return it to the underworld in return for releasing him from his labours.

== Literature ==
[[File:Cerbere.jpg|thumb|Cerberus, as illustrated by [[Gustave Doré]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]
Cerberus featured in many prominent works of Greek and Roman literature, most famously in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Peisandros of Rhodes]]' [[epic poem]] the ''[[Labours of Hercules]]'', the story of [[Orpheus]] in [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium'', and in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', which is the only known reference to one of Heracles' labours which first appeared in a literary source.<ref>{{cite book|title=Iliad|author=Homer|chapter=8|page=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin//ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134&layout=&loc=8.366 366–369]}}</ref>

The depiction of Cerberus is relatively consistent between different works and authors, the common theme of the mane of serpents is kept across works, as is the serpent's tail, most literary works of the era describe Cerberus as having three heads with the only notable exception being [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' in which he had 50 heads.<ref name="hesiod-differs">{{cite book|title= Theogony|author=Hesiod|page=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D310 310]}}</ref>

Most occurrences in ancient literature revolve around the basis of the threat of Cerberus being overcome to allow a living being access to the underworld; in the ''Aeneid'' Cerberus was lulled to sleep after being tricked into eating drugged honeycakes and Orpheus put the creature to sleep with his music. Capturing Cerberus alive was the twelfth and final labour of Heracles. In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto VI, the "great worm" Cerberus is found in the Third Circle of Hell, where he oversees and rends to pieces those who have succumbed to [[gluttony]], one of the [[seven deadly sins]].<ref>Dante. ''Divine Comedy'' [http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/dante/dante_i_06.htm Inferno, canto VI]</ref>

In the [[Cerberus (constellation)|constellation Cerberus]] introduced by  [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687, Cerberus is sometimes substituted for the "branch from the tree of the golden apples" fetched by Atlas from the garden of the Hesperides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/cerberus.htm |title=Ian Ridpath, "Star Tales" |publisher=Ianridpath.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> This branch is the literary source of the "[[The Golden Bough (mythology)|golden bough]]" in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' by [[Virgil]].

In ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' 11.65, Cerberean hounds are mentioned in Hell: "A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd With wide Cerberean mouths full loud".

== Art ==
[[File:12th labour of Heracles - Project Gutenberg eText 19119.png|thumb|In this vase painting, Heracles leads a two-headed Cerberus out of Hades.]]
Numerous references to Cerberus have appeared in ancient [[Greek art|Greek]] and [[Roman art]],<ref>{{cite book|title=The Monist|publisher=Hegeler Institute|first=Edward|last=Hegeler|year=1904|page=524|author-link=Edward C. Hegeler}}</ref> found in [[archaeological]] ruins and often including in statues and architecture, inspired by the mythology of the creature. Cerberus' depiction in ancient art is not as definitive as in literature; the poets and linguists of ancient Greece and Rome mostly agreed on the physical appearance (with the notable exception in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' in which he had 50 heads).<ref name="hesiod-differs"/> His depiction in classical art mostly shows the recurring motif of serpents, but the number of heads differs.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first=Maurice|last=Bloomfield|isbn=0-7661-3020-7|page=3|chapter=Cerberus in Classical Art|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year =2003}}</ref> A statue in the [[Galleria Borghese]] depicts Cerberus with three heads sitting by the side of Hades, while a bronze sculpture depicting Heracles' twelfth labour shows the demi-god leading a two-headed Cerberus from the underworld. The majority of vases depicting the twelfth task also show Cerberus as having two heads.<ref>{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first= Maurice|last=Bloomfield|isbn=0-7661-3020-7|page=4|chapter=Cerberus in Classical Art|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2003}}</ref> Classical critics have identified one of the earliest works of Cerberus as "the most imaginative," that being a Laconian vase created around 560 BC in which Cerberus is shown with three-heads and with rows of serpents covering his body and heads.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Companion to Classical Mythology|first=Robert|last=Lenardon|coauthors=Mark Morford, Michael Sham|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-19-514725-1}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name "Cerberus" is a [[Latinised]] version of the Greek ''Kerberos''. The etymology of this name prior to Greek is disputed. It has been claimed to be related to the [[Sanskrit]] word सर्वरा "sarvarā", used as an epithet of one of the dogs of [[Yama]], from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *k̑érberos, meaning "spotted"<ref>

(This etymology suffers from the fact that it includes a reconstructed *b, which is extremely rare in Proto-Indo-European. Yet according to [[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch|Pokorny]] it is well distributed, with additional apparent cognates in Slavic, British and Lithuanian.<ref>

Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] dog [[Garmr]], relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root ''*ger-'' "to growl" (perhaps with the suffixes ''-*m/*b'' and ''-*r''). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires ''Cerberus'' and ''Garmr'' to be derived from two ''different'' Indo-European roots (*''ger-'' and *''gher-'' respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.

==Explanations==
There have been many attempts to explain the depiction of Cerberus. A 2nd century CE Greek known as [[Heraclitus the paradoxographer]]--- not to be confused with the 5th century BCE Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]--- claimed [[Euhemerus|Euhemeristically]] that Cerberus had two pups which were never away from their father, and that Cerberus was in fact a normal (though very large) dog, but that artists incorporating the two pups into their work made it appear as if his two children were in fact extra heads.<ref>{{cite book|title=Περὶ ἀπίστων|author=Heraclitus|page=331}}</ref> Classical historians have dismissed Heraclitus the paradoxographer's explanation as "feeble".<ref name="maurice-7">{{cite book|title=Cerberus the Dog of Hades|first=Maurice|last= Bloomfield|year=2003|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|isbn=0-7661-3020-7|page=7}}</ref> Mythologers have speculated that if Cerberus was given his name in Trikarenos it could be interpreted as "three karenos".<ref name="maurice-7"/> Certain experts believe that the monster was inspired by the [[golden jackal]].<ref name="GJ">{{cite web|title=Golden Jackal|work= |publisher=Canids.org|url=http://www.canids.org/species/Golden_jackal.pdf|accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>
