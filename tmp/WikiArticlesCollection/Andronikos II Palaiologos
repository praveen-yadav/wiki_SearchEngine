'''Andronikos II Palaiologos''' ({{lang-el|Ανδρόνικος Β' Παλαιολόγος}}) (25 March 1259 – 13 February 1332), Latinized as   '''Andronicus II Palaeologus''', was  [[Byzantine emperor]] from 1282 to 1328.  He was the eldest surviving son of [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] and [[Theodora Doukaina Vatatzina]], grandniece of [[John III Doukas Vatatzes]]. On 8 November 1273, Andronikos II married [[Anne of Hungary (1260–1281)]], daughter of the king [[Stephen V of Hungary]].

==Life==
Andronikos II Palaiologos was born at [[Nicaea]].

He was acclaimed co-emperor in 1261, after his father Michael VIII recovered [[Constantinople]] from the [[Latin Empire]], but he was crowned only in 1272. Sole emperor from 1282, Andronikos II immediately repudiated his father's unpopular Church union with the [[Papacy]] (which he had been forced to support while his father was still alive), but was unable to resolve the related schism within the Orthodox clergy until 1310. Andronikos II was also plagued by economic difficulties and during his reign the value of the Byzantine ''[[hyperpyron]]'' depreciated precipitously while the state treasury accumulated less than one seventh the revenue (in nominal coins) that it had done previously. Seeking to increase revenue and reduce expenses, Andronikos II raised taxes and reduced tax exemptions, and dismantled the Byzantine fleet (80 ships) in 1285, thereby making the Empire increasingly dependent on the rival republics of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. In 1291, he hired 50–60 Genoese ships. Later, in 1320, he tried to resurrect the navy by constructing 20 galleys, but failed.

Andronikos II Palaiologos sought to resolve some of the problems facing the [[Byzantine Empire]] through diplomacy. After the death of his first wife Anne of Hungary, he married [[Irene of Montferrat|Yolanda (renamed Irene) of Montferrat]], putting an end to the Montferrat claim to the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]]. Andronikos II also attempted to marry off his son and co-emperor [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] to the Latin Empress [[Catherine I of Courtenay]], thus seeking to eliminate Western agitation for a restoration of the Latin Empire. Another marriage alliance attempted to resolve the potential conflict with [[Serbia]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], as Andronikos II married off his five-year old daughter [[Simonida|Simonis]] to King [[Stefan Milutin]] in 1298.

In spite of the resolution of problems in [[Europe]], Andronikos II was faced with the collapse of the Byzantine frontier in [[Asia Minor]], despite the successful, but short, governorships of [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] and [[John Tarchaneiotes]]. The successful military victories in Asia Minor by [[Alexios Philanthropenos]] and [[John Tarchaneiotes]] against the Turks were largely dependant on a considerable military contingent of Cretan escapees, or exiles from Venetian occupied Crete, headed by Hortatzis, whom [[Michael VIII]] had repatriated to Byzantium through a treaty agreement with the Venetians ratified in 1277.<ref>Agelarakis, P. A. (2012), Cretans in Byzantine foreign policy and military affairs following the Fourth Crusade. Cretika Chronika, 32, 41-78.</ref>   Andronikos II had resettled those Cretans in the region of Meander river, the southeastern Asia Minor frontier of Byzantium with the Turks. After the failure of the co-emperor Michael IX to stem the Turkish advance in Asia Minor in 1302 and the disastrous [[Battle of Bapheus]], the Byzantine government hired the [[Catalan Company]] of [[Almogavars]] (adventurers from [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]]) led by Roger de Flor to clear Byzantine Asia Minor of the enemy. In spite of some successes, the Catalans were unable to secure lasting gains. Being more ruthless and savage than the enemy they intended to subdue they quarreled with Michael IX, and eventually openly turned on their Byzantine employers after the murder of Roger de Flor in 1305, devastating together with a party of willing Turks [[Thrace]], Macedonia, and [[Thessaly]] on their road to Latin occupied southern Greece. There they conquered the [[Duchy of Athens]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]]. The Turks continued to penetrate the Byzantine possessions, and [[Bursa, Turkey|Prusa]] fell in 1326. By the end of Andronikos II's reign, much of Bithynia was in the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]] of Osman I and his son and heir [[Orhan I|Orhan]]. Also, [[Karasids]] conquered [[Mysia]]-region with [[Balıkesir|Paleokastron]] after 1296, Germiyan conquered [[Simav]] in 1328, Saruhan captured [[Manisa|Magnesia]] in 1313 and [[Aydinids]] captured [[İzmir|Symirna]] in 1310.

The Empire's problems were exploited by [[Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria]], who defeated Michael IX and conquered much of northeastern Thrace in c. 1305–1307. The conflict ended with yet another dynastic marriage, between Michael IX's daughter Theodora and the Bulgarian emperor. The dissolute behavior of Michael IX's son [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] led to a rift in the family, and after Michael IX's death in 1320, Andronikos II disowned his grandson, prompting a [[First Palaiologan Civil War|civil war]] that raged, with interruptions, until 1328. The conflict precipitated Bulgarian involvement, and [[Michael Shishman of Bulgaria|Michael Asen III of Bulgaria]] attempted to capture Andronikos II under the guise of sending him military support. In 1328 Andronikos III entered Constantinople in triumph and Andronikos II was forced to abdicate.

He died as a monk at Constantinople in 1332.

==Family==
On 8 November 1273 Andronikos II married as his first wife [[Anna of Hungary (1260–1281)|Anna of Hungary]], daughter of [[Stephen V of Hungary]] and [[Elizabeth the Cuman]], with whom he had two sons:
* [[Michael IX Palaiologos]] (17 April 1277 – 12 October 1320).
* [[Constantine Palaiologos (son of Andronikos II)|Constantine Palaiologos]], ''[[despotes]]'' (c. 1278 – 1335). Married firstly Eudokia, a daughter of Theodore Mouzalon and a woman of the Kantakouzenos family. Married secondly Eudokia Neokaisareitissa. He also had a mistress, Kathara, who was in the service of his second wife. Constantine was forced to become a monk by his nephew [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]].
** Eudokia Palaiologina. Only legitimate daughter of Constantine and Eudokia Neokaisareitissa. [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] records her marriage to [[Demetrios Tzamplakon]], ''[[megas stratopedarches]]''.
** Michael Katharos. Illegitimate son of Constantine and Kathara. A favorite of his paternal grandfather Andronikos II in the later years of his reign.

After Anna died in 1281, in 1284 Andronikos II then married [[Irene of Montferrat|Yolanda (renamed Irene)]], a daughter of Marquis [[William VII of Montferrat]], with whom he had:
* [[John Palaiologos (son of Andronikos II)|John Palaiologos]] (c. 1286–1308), ''despotes'', married Irene Choumnaina, no issue.
* [[Theodore I of Montferrat|Theodore]], [[Marquis of Montferrat]] (1291–1338)
* [[Demetrios Palaiologos (son of Andronikos II)|Demetrios Palaiologos]] (d. after 1343), ''despotes''. Father of [[Irene Palaiologina (Byzantine empress)|Irene Palaiologina]].
* [[Simonida|Simonis Palaiologina]] (1294-after 1336), who married King [[Stefan Milutin]] of Serbia

Andronikos II also had at least two illegitimate daughters:
* Irene, who married [[John II Doukas]], ruler of [[Thessaly]]
* Maria, who married [[Toqta]], Khan of the [[Golden Horde]]
