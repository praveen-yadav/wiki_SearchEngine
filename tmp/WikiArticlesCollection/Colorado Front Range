The area is located just east of the [[foothills]] of the [[Front Range]], aligned in a north-south configuration on the western edge of the [[Great Plains]], where they meet the Rockies. [[Geology|Geologically]], the region lies mostly within the [[Colorado Piedmont]], in the valley of the [[South Platte River|South Platte]] and [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] rivers on the east side of the Rockies. The region contains the largest cities and the majority of the population of Colorado.
