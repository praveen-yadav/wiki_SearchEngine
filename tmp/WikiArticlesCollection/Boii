The '''Boii''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] plural, singular ''Boius''; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Βόϊοι}}) were a [[Gauls|Gallic]] tribe of the later [[Iron Age]], attested at various times in [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern [[Italy]]), [[Pannonia]] ([[Hungary]] and its western neighbours), in and around [[Bohemia]] (after whom the region is named), and [[Transalpine Gaul]]. In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the [[Kłodzko Valley]] into [[Silesia]], now part of [[Poland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rankin|1996|p=16}}</ref>

They first appear in history in connection with the [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Celtic invasion of Italia (390–387 BC)|Gallic invasion of north Italy]], 390 BC, when they made the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city of Felsina their new capital, [[Bologna|Bononia (Bologna)]]. After a series of wars they were decisively beaten by the Romans in a [[Battle of Mutina 193 BCE|battle near Mutina (Modena)]] and their territory became part of the Roman province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. According to [[Strabo]], writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours, <blockquote>''"the Boii were merely driven out of the regions they occupied; and after migrating to the regions round about the [[Danube|Ister]], lived with the [[Taurisci]], and carried on war against the [[Dacians|Daci]] until they perished, tribe and all — and thus they left their country, which was a part of [[Illyria]], to their neighbours as a pasture-ground for sheep."''<ref>Strabo, 5.213.</ref></blockquote>

Around 60 BC, a group of Boians joined the [[Helvetii|Helvetians']] ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by [[Julius Caesar]], along with their allies, in the [[battle of Bibracte]]. Caesar settled the remnants of that group in [[Gorgobina]], from where they sent two thousand to [[Vercingetorix]]'s aid at the [[battle of Alesia]] six years later. The eastern Boians on the Danube were incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] in 8 AD.

==Etymology and name==
From all the different names of the same Celtic people in literature and inscriptions it is possible to abstract a [[continental Celtic]] segment, boio-.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Continental Celtic Place-Names|editor-first=Alexander|editor-last=Falileyev|publisher=Aberystwyth University|year=2007|title=Boii|url=http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2160/282/5/ContCelticPNDictionary.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2 May 2009}}</ref> There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of [[Indo-European languages]]: from 'cow' and from 'warrior.' The Boii would thus be either "the herding people" or "the warrior people."

The "cow" derivation depends most immediately on the [[Old Irish]] legal term for "outsider:" ''amboue'', from [[proto-Celtic]] *ambouios, "not a cattle owner."<ref>{{cite book|page=225|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia|first=John T. |last=Koch|edition= illustrated|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2006|id=ISBN 1-85109-440-7, ISBN 978-1-85109-440-0|location=Santa Barbara, California}}</ref> In a reference to the first known historical Boii, [[Polybius]] relates<ref name=PB.2.17>''Histories'', II.17.</ref> that their wealth consisted of cattle and gold, that they depended on agriculture and war, and that a man's status depended on the number of associates and assistants he had. The latter were presumably the *ambouii, as opposed to the man of status, who was *bouvios, a cattle owner, and the *bouii were originally a class, "the cattle owners."

[[File:HallstattIlllyrianFootmanwithJavelins.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of a soldier wearing a plumed pot helmet, [[Hallstatt culture]] Bronze belt plaque from [[Vače]], [[Slovenia]], ca. 400 BC]]
The "warrior" derivation was adopted by the linguist [[Julius Pokorny]], who presented it as being from Indo-European *bhei(ə)-, *bhī-, "hit;" however, not finding any Celtic names close to it (except for the Boii), he adduces examples somewhat more widely from originals further back in time: phohiio-s-, a [[Venetic]] personal name; Boioi, an [[Illyria]]n tribe; Boiōtoi, a Greek tribal name ("the [[Boeotia]]ns") and a few others.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|language=German|pages=117–118|encyclopedia=Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch|first=Julius|last=Pokorny|authorlink=Julius Pokorny|title=bhei(ə)-, bhī-|url=http://www.indoeuropean.nl/|publisher=University of Leiden|date=1998-2006}}</ref> Boii would be from the [[Apophony|o-grade]] of *bhei-, which is *bhoi-. Such a connection is possible if the original form of Boii belonged to a tribe of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] speakers long before the time of the historic Boii. The Celtic tribe of central Europe must in that case be a final daughter population of a linguistically diversifying ancestor tribe.

The same wider connections can be hypothesized for the "cow" derivation: the Boeotians have been known for well over a century as a people of kine, which might have been parallel to the meaning of [[Italy#Etymology|Italy]] as a "land of calves." Indo-European reconstructions can be made using {{PIE|*gʷou-}} "cow" as a basis, such as {{PIE|*gʷowjeh³s}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|page=99}}</ref>

Contemporary derived words include ''[[Boiorix]]'' ("king of the Boii", one of the chieftains of the [[Cimbri]]) and ''Boiodurum'' ("gate/fort of the Boii", modern [[Passau]]) in Germany. Their memory also survives in the modern regional names of [[Bohemia]] (''Boiohaemum''), a mixed-language form from boio- and [[Proto-Germanic]] *''haimaz'', "home": "home of the Boii," and 'Bayern', [[Bavaria]], which is derived from the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''Baiovarii'' tribe (Germ. ''*baio-warioz'': the first component is most plausibly explained as a Germanic version of ''Boii''; the second part is a common formational morpheme of Germanic tribal names, meaning 'dwellers', as in [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''-ware'');<ref group="note">Indo-European short ''o'', as in the Celtic ''Boii'', developed to ''a'' in Germanic. As far as its formation is concerned, the name seems to be a hybrid between Celtic or Latin and Germanic, as the thematic vowel ''bai-'''''o'''- would have to be an ''a'' in a Germanic compound (cf. Celtic ''ambio-rix'' vs. Germanic ''þiuda-reiks'', "Theoderic"). This, however, should not be used as an argument against the 'traditional' etymology, as such forms are quite common (cf. ''Raetovarii'', an Allemanic tribe) and are most likely influenced by the Latin background of the ancient writers.</ref> this combination "Boii-dwellers" may have meant "those who dwell where the Boii formerly dwelt".

==History==
[[Image:Boians.png|upright=1.5|right|thumbnail|400px|Migratory movements of the Boii]]

===Settlement in north Italy===
According to the ancient authors, the Boii arrived in northern Italy by crossing the [[Alps]]. While of the other the tribes who had come to Italy along with the Boii, the [[Senones]], [[Lingones]] and [[Cenomani]] are also attested in Gaul at the time of the Roman conquest, there is no such clear evidence for the Boii in Gaul. It remains therefore unclear where exactly the [[Central Europe]]an origins of the Boii lay, if somewhere in Gaul, [[Southern Germany]] or in Bohemia.

[[Polybius]] relates that the Celts were close neighbors of the [[Etruscans]] and "cast covetous eyes on their beautiful country."<ref name=PB.2.17>''Histories'', II.17.</ref> Invading the [[Po valley]] with a large army they drove out the Etruscans and resettled it, the Boii taking the right bank in the center of the valley. [[Strabo]] confirms that the Boii emigrated from their lands across the [[Alps]]<ref>''Geography'', IV.4.1.</ref> and were one of the largest tribes of the Celts.<ref>''Geography'', V.1.6.</ref> The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of [[Felsina#History|Felsina]], which they named ''Bononia'' ([[Bologna]]). Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in Cisalpine Gaul as follows:
<blockquote>''"They lived in unwalled villages, without any superfluous furniture; for as they slept on beds of leaves and fed on meat and were exclusively occupied with war and agriculture, their lives were very simple, and they had no knowledge whatever of any art or science. Their possessions consisted of cattle and gold, because these were the only things they could carry about with them everywhere according to circumstances and shift where they chose. They treated comradeship as of the greatest importance, those among them being the most feared and most powerful who were thought to have the largest number of attendants and associates."''<ref name=PB.2.17/></blockquote>

The archaeological evidence from Bologna and its vicinity contradicts the testimony of Polybius and Livy on some points, who say the Boii expelled the Etruscans and perhaps some were forced to leave. It much rather indicates that the Boii neither destroyed nor depopulated Felsinum, but simply moved in and became part of the population by intermarriage.<ref>{{cite book|pages=201–202|title=Beyond the Rubicon: Romans and Gauls in Republican Italy|first=J. H. C.|last= Williams|edition=illustrated|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2001|id=ISBN 0-19-815300-7, ISBN 978-0-19-815300-9}}</ref> The cemeteries of the period in Bologna contain [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] weapons and other artifacts, as well as Etruscan items such as bronze mirrors. At [[Pianoro|Monte Bibele]] not far away one grave contained La Tène weapons and a pot with an Etruscan female name scratched on it.

===War against Rome===
In the second half of the 3rd century BC, the Boii allied with the other Cisalpine Gauls and the Etruscans against Rome. They also fought alongside [[Hannibal]], killing (in 216 BC) the Roman general [[Lucius Postumius Albinus (consul 234 and 229 BC)|L. Postumius Albinus]], whose skull was then turned into a sacrificial bowl.<ref>''History of Rome'', XXIII, 24.</ref> A short time earlier, they had been defeated at [[Battle of Telamon (224 BC)|Telamon]] in 224 BC, and were again later at [[Battle of Placentia (194 BC)|Placentia in 194 BC]] (modern [[Piacenza]]) and [[Battle of Mutina 193 BCE|Mutina in 193 BC]] (modern [[Modena]]). After the loss of their capital, according to Strabo, a large portion of the Boii left Italy.

===Boii on the Danube===
Contrary to the interpretation of the classical writers, the Pannonian Boii attested in later sources are not simply the remnants of those who had fled from Italy, but rather another division of the tribe, which had settled there much earlier. The burial rites of the Italian Boii show many similarities with contemporary Bohemia, such as [[inhumation]], which was uncommon with the other Cisalpine Gauls, or the absence of the typically western Celtic [[torc]]s.<ref>Cunliffe, Barry: "The Ancient Celts", Penguin Books 1999, pp. 72f.</ref> This makes it much more likely that the Cisalpine Boii had actually originated from Bohemia rather than the other way round.<ref>{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|p=124}}</ref> Having migrated to Italy from north of the Alps, some of the defeated Celts simply moved back to their kinsfolk.<ref group="note">Other tribes of whom divisions are attested both in the 'Celtic homeland' and at the periphery include the Senones (Umbria and the Marne region), Lingones (Aemilia and the Langres plateau), Cenomani (Venetia and Maine), Tectosages (Galatia and Provence).</ref>

The Pannonian Boii are mentioned again in the late 2nd century BC when they repelled the [[Cimbri]] and [[Teutones]] (Strabo VII, 2, 2). Later on, they attacked the city of [[Noreia]] (in modern Austria) shortly before a group of Boii (32,000 according to [[Julius Caesar]] - the number is probably an exaggeration) joined the [[Helvetii]] in their attempt to settle in western Gaul. After the Helvetian defeat at [[Bibracte]], the influential [[Aedui]] tribe allowed the Boii survivors to settle on their territory, where they occupied the ''oppidum'' of [[Gorgobina]]. Although attacked by [[Vercingetorix]] during one phase of the war, they supported him with two thousand troops at the battle of [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] (Caes. Bell. Gall., VII, 75).

Again, other parts of the Boii had remained closer to their traditional home, and settled in the Slovak and [[Hungary|Hungarian lowlands]] by the [[Danube]] and the [[Mur River|Mura]], with a centre at [[Bratislava]]. Around 60 BC they clashed with the rising power of the [[Dacians]] under their king [[Burebista]] and were defeated. When the Romans finally conquered [[Pannonia]] in 8 AD, the Boii seem not to have opposed them. Their former territory was now called ''deserta Boiorum'' (deserta meaning 'empty or sparsely populated lands').<ref>{{harvnb|Birkhan|1999|p=251}}</ref> However, the Boii had not been exterminated: There was a ''civitas Boiorum et Azaliorum'' (the Azalii being a neighbouring tribe) which was under the jurisdiction of a prefect of the Danube shore (''praefectus ripae Danuvii'').<ref>[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] IX 5363</ref> This civitas, a common Roman  administrative term designating both a city and the tribal district around it, was later adjoined to the city of [[Carnuntum]].

==The Boii in ancient sources==

===Plautus===
[[Plautus]] refers to the Boii in ''[[Captivi]]'':
:''At nunc Siculus non est, Boius est, Boiam terit''
:But now he is not a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] — he is a Boian, he has got a Boian woman.
There is a play on words: ''Boia'' means "woman of the Boii", also "convicted criminal's restraint collar".<ref>{{cite book |first=Titus Maccius |last=Plautus |title=Amphitryo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Bacchides, Captivi |first2=Paul, Translator |last2=Nixon |publisher=Gutenberg Project | year=2005 |origyear=1916 |id=EBook No. 16564 |page=890 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16564}}</ref>

===Livy===
In volume 21 of his work ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', [[Livy]] (59 BC - 17 AD) claims that it was a Boian man that offered to show [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] the way across the [[Alps]].
:When, after the action had thus occurred, his own men returned to each general, [[Publius Cornelius Scipio|Scipio]] could adopt no fixed plan of proceeding, except that he should form his measures from the plans and undertakings of the enemy: and Hannibal, uncertain whether he should pursue the march he had commenced into [[Italy]], or fight with the Roman army which had first presented itself, the arrival of ambassadors from the Boii, and of a petty prince called [[Magalus]], diverted from an immediate engagement; who, declaring that they would be the guides of his journey and the companions of his dangers, gave it as their opinion, that Italy ought to be attacked with the entire force of the war, his strength having been nowhere previously impaired.

===Inscriptions===
In the 1st century BC, the Boii living in an [[enclosed oppidum|oppidum]] of [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia) minted [[Biatec]]s, high-quality coins with inscriptions (probably the names of kings) in Latin letters. This is the only "written source" provided by the Boii themselves.
