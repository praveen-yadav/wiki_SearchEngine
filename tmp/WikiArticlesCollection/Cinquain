'''Cinquain''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|k|eɪ|n}} is a class of [[Poetry|poetic]] forms that employ a 5-line pattern.  Earlier used to describe any five-line form, it now refers to one of several forms that are defined by specific rules and guidelines.<ref>{{cite book | title=Metre, rhythm and verse form | series=The new critical idiom | first=Philip | last=Hobsbaum | publisher=Routledge | year=1996 | isbn=0-415-08797-X | pages=186–188 }}</ref>

==American cinquain==
The American poet [[Adelaide Crapsey]] invented the modern form, known as American Cinquain<ref>[http://amaze-cinquain.com Garison, Denis, ''An Introduction to the American Cinquain'', Amaze: The Cinquain Journal Vol 1 No 1 Summer 2002]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | jstor=2926066 | journal=American Literature | volume=57 | number=2 | date=May 1985 | title=Death, Order, and Poetry | first=Karen | last=Alakalay-Gut | pages=263–289 }}</ref> inspired by Japanese [[haiku]] and [[tanka]],<ref>{{cite book | title=The poetry dictionary | first=John | last=Drury | publisher=Writer's Digest Books | year=2006 | isbn=1-58297-329-6 | page=61 }}</ref><ref name=toleostheory>Toleos, Aaron.

In her 1915 collection titled ''Verse'', published one year after her death, Crapsey included 28 cinquains.<ref>Toleos, Aaron. [http://www.cinquain.org/verse.html ''Verse'' and its legacy]  Retrieved 2010-06-11.</ref>
Crapsey's American Cinquain form developed in two stages. The first, fundamental form is a stanza of five lines of accentual verse, in which the lines comprise, in order, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1 [[Stress (linguistics)|stresses]]. Then Crapsey decided to make the criterion a stanza of five lines of accentual-syllabic verse, in which the lines comprise, in order, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1 stresses and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 2 syllables. Iambic feet were meant to be the standard for the cinquain, which made the dual criteria match perfectly. Some resource materials define classic cinquains as solely iambic, but that is not necessarily so.<ref>[http://amaze-cinquain.com Garison, Denis, An Introduction to the American Cinquain, Amaze: The Cinquain Journal Vol 1, No 1, Summer 2002]</ref> In contrast to the Eastern forms upon which she based them, Crapsey always titled her cinquains, effectively utilizing the title as a sixth line. Crapsey's cinquain depends on strict structure and intense physical imagery to communicate a mood or feeling.<ref>Fever Show, article by Erin Post, Lake Champlain Weekly, October 16, 2002</ref>

The form is illustrated by Crapsey's "November Night":<ref>Crapsey, Adelaide (1922). ''Verse'', p.31.  Quoted in [http://www.cinquain.org/cinquain.html 28 cinquains from Adelaide Crapsey's ''Verse''], at [http://www.cinquain.org/ Cinquain.org.]  Retrieved 2010-06-09.</ref>
<blockquote>
Listen... <br>
With faint dry sound, <br>
Like steps of passing ghosts, <br>
The leaves, frost-crisp'd, break from the trees <br>
And fall.
</blockquote>
The Scottish poet [[William Soutar]] also wrote over one hundred American Cinquains (he labelled them [[Epigrams]]) between 1933 and 1940.<ref>''Flowers of Life'', A Selection of Cinquains by William Soutar, Ed. Brian Strand, QQ Press, Rothesay ISBN 1-903203-47-3</ref>

==Didactic cinquain==
The didactic cinquain is closely related to the Crapsey cinquain.  It is an informal cinquain widely taught in elementary schools and has been featured in, and popularized by, children's media resources, including [[Junie B. Jones]] and [[PBS Kids]]. This form is also embraced by young adults and older poets for its expressive simplicity.  The prescriptions of this type of cinquain refer to word count, not syllables and stresses.  Ordinarily, the first line is a one-word title, the subject of the poem; the second line is a pair of adjectives describing that title; the third line is a three word phrase that gives more information about the subject; the fourth line consists of four words describing feelings related to that subject; and the fifth line is a single word synonym or other reference for the subject from line one.
