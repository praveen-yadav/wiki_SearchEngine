{{For|the book by Robert Rankin|The Antipope}}

An '''antipope''' ({{lang-la|antipapa}}) is a person who, in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected [[Pope]], makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the Pope,<ref>"One who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt" ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28501/antipope Encyclopaedia Britannica: ''Antipope'']).</ref> the [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]] and leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. At times between the 3rd and mid-15th century, antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and secular [[king]]s and kingdoms. Persons who claim to be pope, but have few followers, such as the modern [[sedevacantist]] antipopes, are not classified with the historical antipopes.

In the list of popes given in the [[Holy See]]'s annual directory, ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', the following note is attached to the name of [[Pope Leo VIII]] (963–965):
<blockquote>
At this point, as again in the mid-11th century, we come across [[Papal conclave|elections]] in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of [[Saint Peter]]. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.<ref>Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 ISBN 978-88-209-8722-0), p.&nbsp;12*</ref>
</blockquote>

==History==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (d.&nbsp;235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he headed a separate group within the Church in Rome against [[Pope Callixtus I]]. Hippolytus was reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, [[Pope Pontian]], and both he and Pontian are honoured as saints by the Roman Catholic Church with a shared [[feast day]] on 13 August. Whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of Hippolytus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html|title= The catacombs the destination of the great jubilee|publisher=[[Vatican City]]|accessdate=3 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070910175629/http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html| archivedate= 10 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> and whether Hippolytus actually declared himself to be the Bishop of Rome, remains unclear, since no such claim by Hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him.

[[Eusebius of Caesarea]] quotes<ref>''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', V, 28</ref> from an unnamed earlier writer the story of Natalius, a [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd-century]] priest who accepted the bishopric of a heretical group in Rome. Natalius soon repented and tearfully begged [[Pope Zephyrinus]] to receive him into communion.<ref>[[s:Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century/Dictionary/Z/Zephyrinus|Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature: Zephyrinus]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm|title=Monarchians – Dynamists, or Adoptionists|publisher=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=3 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930012741/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm| archivedate= 30 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

[[Antipope Novatian|Novatian]] (d. 258), another 3rd-century figure, certainly claimed the See of Rome in opposition to [[Pope Cornelius]], and if Natalius and Hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them, Novatian could then be said to be the first antipope.

The period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the 11th and 12th centuries. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants ([[antiking]]s) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.

The [[Western Schism]]—which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of [[Pope Urban VI]] was invalid, elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope—led to two, and eventually three, rival lines of claimants to the papacy: the Roman line, the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon line]] (Clement VII took up residence in [[Avignon]], France), and the [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] line. The Pisan line was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the (Pisan) council had elected [[Pope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as a third claimant. To end the schism, in May 1415, the [[Council of Constance]] deposed [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] of the Pisan line. [[Pope Gregory XII]] of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, [[Pope Martin V]] was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Western Schism created anti-papal sentiment, and fed into the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the 16th century.

== List of historical antipopes ==
An asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later Popes who took the same name. (The more common case is that the antipope is ignored in later Papal regnal numbers; for example, there was [[Antipope John XXIII]], but the new Pope John elected in 1958 was also called [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]].) For the additional confusion regarding Popes named John, see [[Pope John (numbering)]]. The list of popes and antipopes in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' does not include Natalius or [[Antipope Clement VIII]]; it may be that Clement's following was considered insignificant.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09725a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Martin V<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester III]], sometimes listed as an antipope, appears in the Holy See's ''Annuario Pontificio'' as a pope: because of obscurities about mid-11th-century canon law and the historical facts, it expresses no judgement on his legitimacy. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' places him in its ''List of Popes'',<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: List of Popes]</ref> but with the annotation: "Considered by some to be an antipope". Some other sources do classify him as an antipope.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=Previt%C3%A9-Orton+%22by+the+Anti-pope+Sylvester+III%22&btnG= Charles William Previté-Orton, ''The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History'' (Cambridge University Press 1952, republished 1975 ISBN 0-521-20962-5), vol. 1, p. 477]</ref><ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&tbo=1&q=+Darras+%22title+of+sylvester+iii%22&btnG= Joseph Épiphane Darras, ''A General History of the Catholic Church'', vol.

== Modern claimants to papacy ==
{{details|Conclavism}}

In modern times various people claim to be pope and, though they do not fit the technical definition of "antipope", are sometimes referred to as such. They are usually leaders of [[sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] groups who view the See of Rome as vacant and elect someone to fill it. They are sometimes referred to as [[conclavism|conclavists]] because of their claim, on the basis of an election by a "conclave" of perhaps half a dozen laypeople, as in the case of [[David Bawden]] ("Pope Michael I"), to have rendered the See no longer vacant. A significant number of these have taken the name "[[Pope Peter II|Peter II]]", owing to its special significance. From the point of view the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they are [[schism (religion)|schismatics]], and as such are [[Latae sententiae|automatically excommunicated]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P52.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1364]</ref>

=== Collinites ===
{{details|Apostles of Infinite Love}}
* [[Michel Collin (antipope)|Michel Collin or Colin]] (Pope Clement XV), self-proclaimed (1950–1974) in France, founder of Order of the Mother of God (a name later changed to Apostles of Infinite Love)
* [[Jean-Gaston Tremblay]], Gregory XVII (1968–2011), in [[Canada]]

=== Palmarian Catholic Church ===
{{details|Palmarian Catholic Church}}
* [[Clemente Domínguez y Gómez]] (Pope Gregory XVII), mystically self-proclaimed (1978&ndash;2005) in Spain
* [[Manuel Corral]] (Pope Peter II) (2005&ndash;11)
* [[Sergio María]] (Pope Gregory XVIII) (2011&ndash;present)

The Palmarian Catholic Church regards [[Pope Paul VI]], whom they revere as a martyr, and his predecessors as true popes, but hold, on the grounds of claimed apparitions, that the Pope of Rome is excommunicated and that the position of the [[Holy See]] has, since 1978, been transferred to the See of [[El Palmar de Troya]].

* Popes of the "[[Iglesia Católica Apostólica Remanente]]", based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]:  Oscar Michaelli, elected on 24 March 2006 by a group of 34 [[episcopi vagantes]]{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} as Pope Leo XIV.  On his death on 14 February 2007, he was succeeded by Juan Bautista Bonetti, who took the name of Pope Innocent XIV, but resigned on 29 May 2007. Alexander IX was chosen in his place.<ref>[http://icaremanente.blogspot.com Iglesia Católica en el Exilio]</ref>
