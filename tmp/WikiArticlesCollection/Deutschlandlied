[[File:Nationalhymne der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|National anthem of Germany]]
The "'''{{lang|de|Deutschlandlied}}'''" ("Song of Germany", {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃlantˌliːt}}; also known as "'''{{lang|de|Das Lied der Deutschen}}'''" or "The Song of the Germans"), has been the [[national anthem]] of [[Germany]] since 1922, except in [[East Germany]], whose anthem was "[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]" ("Risen from Ruins") from 1949 to 1990.

Since [[World War II]] and the fall of [[Nazi Germany]], only the third [[stanza]] has been used as the national anthem. The stanza's [[incipit]], "'''''Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit'''''" ("Unity and Justice and Freedom") are considered the unofficial [[national motto]] of Germany, and are inscribed on [[Bundeswehr]] belt buckles and the rims of some [[German coins]].

The music was written by [[Austrian people|Austria]]n composer [[Joseph Haydn]] in 1797 as an anthem for the birthday of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1841, the German linguist and poet [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] wrote the lyrics of "Das Lied der Deutschen" to Haydn's melody, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time.

The song is also well known by the incipit and refrain of the first stanza, "'''''{{lang|de|Deutschland, Deutschland über alles}}'''''" (literally, "Germany, Germany above all"), but this has never been its title. The line "Germany, Germany above all" meant that the most important goal of the [[Vormärz]] revolutionaries should be a unified Germany overcoming the perceived anti-liberal [[Kleinstaaterei]]. Along with the [[Flag of Germany]], it was one of the symbols of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution of 1848]].

In order to endorse its republican and liberal tradition, the song was chosen for national anthem of Germany in 1922, during the [[Weimar Republic]]. [[West Germany]] adopted the ''Deutschlandlied'' as its official national anthem in 1952 for similar reasons, with only the third stanza sung on official occasions. Upon [[German reunification]] in 1990, only the third stanza was confirmed as the national anthem.

== Melody ==
[[File:Haydn portrait by Thomas Hardy (small).jpg|upright|thumb|left|Portrait of Haydn by [[Thomas Hardy (English painter)|Thomas Hardy]], 1792]]
{{Main|Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser}}
The melody of the ''Deutschlandlied'' was originally written by [[Joseph Haydn]] in 1797 to provide music to the poem ''"[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]"'' ("God save Franz the Emperor") by [[Lorenz Leopold Haschka]]. The song was a birthday anthem to [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]] of the [[House of Habsburg]], and was intended to rival in merit the British "[[God Save the King]]".

It has been conjectured that Haydn took the first four measures of the melody from a Croatian folk song. Supporters of this theory note that a similar melody appears in a composition by Telemann.<ref>{{cite web|work=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Emperor's Hymn|accessdate=6 November 2011|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e2247}}</ref> This hypothesis has never achieved unanimous agreement; the alternative theory is that Haydn's original tune was adapted into a folk song.

The same melody was later used by Haydn as the basis for the second [[Movement (music)|movement]] (poco adagio) of [[String Quartets, Op. 76 (Haydn)#Opus 76, No. 3|Opus 76 No. 3]], a [[string quartet]] often called the "Emperor" or "Kaiser" quartet. The melody in this movement is also termed the "Emperor's Hymn."

== Historical background ==
{{Main|Unification of Germany}}
The [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] was already weak when the [[French Revolution]] and the ensuing [[Napoleonic Wars]] altered the political map of [[Central Europe]]. Hopes for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[human rights]], [[republican government]], democracy, and freedom after [[Napoleon I]]'s defeat in 1815 were dashed, however, when the [[Congress of Vienna]] reinstated many [[monarchy|monarchies]]. In addition, with the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] of 1819, [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Chancellor Prince Metternich]] and his secret police enforced [[censorship]], mainly in universities, to keep a watch on the activities of professors and students, whom he held responsible for the spread of [[Political radicalism|radical]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas. Particularly since hardliners among the monarchs were the main adversaries, demands for [[freedom of the press]] and other liberal rights were most often uttered in connection with the demand for a united Germany, even though many revolutionaries-to-be had different opinions whether a republic or a [[constitutional monarchy]] would be the best solution for Germany.

The [[German Confederation]] or German Union (''Deutscher Bund'') was a loose confederation of thirty-five monarchical states and four republican (but hardly democratic) free cities, with a [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Federal Assembly]] in [[Frankfurt]]. They began to remove internal customs barriers during the Industrial Revolution, though, and the German Customs Union [[Zollverein]] was formed among the majority of the states in 1834. In 1840 Hoffmann wrote a song about the Zollverein, also to Haydn's melody, in which he praised the free trade of German goods which brought Germans and Germany closer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.von-fallersleben.de/text252.html|title=Schwefelhölzer, Fenchel, Bricken (Der deutsche Zollverein)|work=www.von-fallersleben.de|accessdate=27 June 2010|language=German}}</ref>

After the March Revolution of 1848, the German Confederation handed over its authority to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], and Eastern Prussia joined the Confederation. For a short period in the late 1840s, Germany was united with the borders described in the anthem, with a democratic constitution in the making, and with the [[Flag of Germany#Revolution and the Frankfurt Parliament|black-red-gold flag]] to represent it. The two big monarchies put an end to this period of national unification, and waged the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against each other.

== Hoffmann's lyrics ==
[[File:August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben.jpg|thumb|upright|left|August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1841]]
[[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|August Heinrich Hoffmann]] (who called himself ''Hoffmann von [[Fallersleben]]'' after his home town to distinguish himself from others with the same common name of "Hoffmann") wrote the text in 1841 on vacation on the [[North Sea]] island [[Heligoland]], then a possession of the United Kingdom.

Hoffmann von Fallersleben intended ''Das Lied der Deutschen'' to be sung to Haydn's tune, as the first publication of the poem included the music. The first line, "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt" (usually translated into English as "Germany, Germany above all, above all in the world"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a united Germany a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" (unity and justice and freedom), Hoffmann expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the [[rule of law]], not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundestag.de/blickpunkt/103_Parlament/0502/0502014.html|title=Staatssymbole Zeichen politischer Gemeinschaft|first=Nadja|last=Bareth|work=[[Bundestag|Blickpunt Bundestag]]|date=February 2005|accessdate=1 December 2009|language=German}}</ref>

In the era after the [[Congress of Vienna]], which was influenced by Prince Metternich and his secret police, Hoffmann's text had a distinctly revolutionary, and at the same time liberal, connotation, since the demand for a united Germany was most often made in connection with demands for freedom of the press and other liberal rights. Its implication that loyalty to a larger Germany should replace loyalty to one's personal sovereign was in itself a revolutionary idea.

The year after he wrote ''Das Deutschlandlied'', Hoffmann von Fallersleben lost his job as a librarian and professor in [[Breslau]], Prussia, because of this and other revolutionary works, and was forced into hiding until being pardoned after the [[revolutions of 1848 in the German states]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Deutschlandlied-Geographie.png|thumb|right|Geography according to the first stanza, with modern borders (dark green) and territories where German is an official language today (light green)]]
In 1841, when the text was written, the [[German Confederation]] was not a unified state in the modern sense. It also included a few regions inhabited largely by non-German speakers, but excluded large areas inhabited primarily by German-speakers, like parts of Eastern Prussia. Hoffmann, who in his research had collected German writings and tales, based his definition of Germany on linguistic criteria: he described the approximate area where a majority of German speakers lived at the time, as encountered in his studies. 19th century nationalists generally relied on such linguistic criteria to determine the borders of the [[nation-state]]s they desired. Thus, the borders mentioned in the first stanza loosely reflected the breadth of territory across which German speakers were spread at the time.<ref>[http://www.brandenburghistorica.com/page5.html Das Lied der Deutschen] at Brandenburg Historica</ref>

{| class=wikitable
|<poem>Von der [[Meuse River|Maas]] bis an die [[Memel river|Memel]],
Von der [[Adige|Etsch]] bis an den [[Little Belt|Belt]].</poem>
|<poem>From the Meuse to the Memel,
From the Etsch to the Little Belt.</poem>
|}
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|right|The German Confederation]]
* In the west, the river known as the Maas or the Meuse ran through the Dutch-ruled and [[Limburgish]]-speaking [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Duchy of Limburg]] which was joined to the German Confederation between 5 September 1839 and 23 August 1866. The modern German border is close to the river in that area.
* In the east, the lower part of the Memel, known in other languages as the Neman, was located within [[East Prussia]], part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], which actually stretched north beyond the river, and beyond the city of Memel ([[Klaipėda]]). In 1920, the area north of the river was detached from Germany and became known as [[Memelland]]. Only a few German speakers remained in the area after 1945.
* In the south, the Adige river (German: Etsch) runs to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 1841, the [[Austrian Empire]] ruled all of its length, and much of the population of its area was German. Historically, the river was the southern border of the medieval [[Duchy_of_Carinthia#Carantania_and_medieval_dynasties|Duchy of Carinthia]], and centuries later it marked the border between Austrian [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and Napoleonic [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Italian Republic]]; in the middle, it was divided among the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Bishopric of Trent]] and [[Austria]]. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, the river's southern part became part of [[Italy]], while the northern one remained part of Austrian [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]; but it then became part of Italy too, after [[World War I|1918]]. Now, as then, the town of [[Salorno]] (German: Salurn), marks the linguistic border between the German and the Italian speaking population in the valley.
* To the north, the strait of the Baltic Sea known as the Little Belt (Danish: Lillebælt) ran alongside the ethnically mixed Danish [[Duchy of Schleswig]], part of an area subject to a highly complex dispute, known as the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]], between Denmark and its neighbors. After the [[Second Schleswig War]] in 1864, the Danish-German border ran through the strait until 1920, but ultimately, the [[Schleswig Plebiscite]] moved the border to its current location, south of the Little Belt.

In the south and west, Hoffmann's definition of Germany coincided with the borders of the German Confederation as it existed then. Hoffmann went beyond the Confederation boundaries of 1841 in the north and in the east, as neither South Schleswig nor East Prussia (although both German-speaking) belonged to it at that time yet, but joined before 1866. Thus, when the [[German Empire]] was finally founded in 1871, both were parts of the German Empire, whereas Luxemburg, Limburg, and Austria were not (see ''[[Kleindeutsche Lösung]]''). Hoffmann picked only one marker in the south and, possibly to avoid confrontation, made no mention of other areas inhabited by German speakers, like Alsace, Switzerland, or the Eastern part of the Austrian Empire.

== Use before 1933 ==

The melody of the Deutschlandlied was originally written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" ("God save Franz the Emperor") by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. The song was a birthday anthem to Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Habsburg, and was intended to rival in merit the British "God Save the King".

After the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation|Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806, the song "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser"—the predecessor of the Deutschlandlied—became the official anthem of the emperor of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the subsequent [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] until the end of the Austrian monarchy in 1918. The first line of the anthem changed with each new emperor until 1918. Austrian monarchists continued to use this anthem after 1918 in the hope of restoring the monarchy. The adoption of the hitherto Austrian anthem by Germany in 1922 was not opposed by Austria, as this helped the government in weakening the monarchist causes.

''Das Lied der Deutschen'' was not played at an official ceremony until Germany and the United Kingdom had agreed on the [[Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty]] in 1890, when it appeared only appropriate to sing it at the ceremony on the now officially German island of [[Heligoland]]. During the time of the German Empire it did become one of the more frequently printed patriotic songs.

The song became very popular after the [[Battle of Langemarck (1914)|1914 Battle of Langemarck]] during [[World War I]], when, supposedly, several German regiments, consisting mostly of students no older than 16, attacked the British lines singing the song, suffering heavy casualties. They are buried in the [[Langemark German war cemetery]]. The official report of the army embellished the event as one of young German soldiers heroically sacrificing their lives for the fatherland. In reality the untrained troops were sent out to attack the British trenches side by side and were mown down by machine guns and rifle fire. This report, also known as the "Langemarck Myth", was printed on the first page in newspapers all over Germany. It is doubtful that the soldiers would have sung the song in the first place: carrying heavy equipment, they might have found it difficult to run at high speed toward enemy lines while singing the slow song. Nonetheless, the story was widely repeated.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mosse|first=George L.|title=Fallen Soldiers: Reshaping the Memory of the World Wars|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|pages=70–73|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JwzIUz8aIk4C&pg=PA70|isbn=978-0-19-507139-9}}</ref>

The melody used by the ''Deutschlandlied'' was still in use as the anthem of the [[Austrian Empire]] until its demise in 1918. On 11 August 1922, President [[Friedrich Ebert]] made the ''Deutschlandlied'' the official German national anthem, as one element of a certain political negotiation. In 1919 the black, red, and gold, the colors of the 19th century liberal revolutionaries advocated by the political left and center were adopted (rather than the previous black, white, and red); now the political right was granted the nationalistic anthem. Ebert already advocated using only the anthem's third stanza, which was done after World War II.<ref name=Geisler70>{{Cite book|last=Geisler|first=Michael E.|title=National symbols, fractured identities: Contesting the national narrative|publisher=UPNE|year=2005|page=70|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CLVaSxt-sV0C&pg=PA70|isbn=978-1-58465-437-7}}</ref>

== Use during Nazi rule ==
During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] era, only the first stanza was used, followed by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] song "[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]".<ref>Geisler, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CLVaSxt-sV0C&pg=PA71 p.71.]</ref> The anthem was played at occasions of great national significance, such as the opening of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, when Hitler and his entourage, along with the Olympic officials, walked into the stadium amid a chorus of three thousand Germans singing the ''Deutschlandlied''. In this way, the first verse of the anthem became closely identified with the Nazi regime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/triumph/tr-olympics.htm|title=The Triumph of Hitler|work=The History Place|year=2001|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref>

== Use after World War II ==
[[File:Standarte des Bundespräsidenten.svg|170px|thumb|right|The Standard of the [[President of Germany]], a 'symbol of the state']]
After the [[Second World War]] ended in 1945, singing ''Das Lied der Deutschen'' was banned along with other symbols of Nazi Germany by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

After its founding in 1949, [[West Germany]] did not have a national anthem for official events for some years despite the growing need for proper diplomatic procedures. Different songs were discussed or used, such as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ode An die Freude]]'' (Ode To Joy). Though the black, red and gold colors of the national flag had been incorporated into Article 22 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|(West) German constitution]], a national anthem was not specified. On 29 April 1952, Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] asked President [[Theodor Heuss]] in a letter to accept ''Das Lied der Deutschen'' as the national anthem, with only the third stanza sung on official occasions. President Heuss agreed to this on 2 May 1952. This exchange of letters was published in the Bulletin of the Federal Government. Since it was viewed as the traditional right of the president as head of state to set the symbols of the state, the ''Deutschlandlied'' thus became the national anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Protokoll/briefwechsel1952.html?nn=109812|title=Briefwechsel zur Nationalhymne 1952|work=[[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Bundesministerium des Innern]]|date=6 May 1952|accessdate=1 December 2009|language=German}}</ref>

Meanwhile, [[East Germany]] adopted its own national anthem, ''[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]'' (Risen from the Ruins). As the lyrics of this anthem called for "Germany, united Fatherland", they were no longer officially used after the DDR abandoned its goal of uniting Germany under the East's leadership. The lyrics of ''Auferstanden aus Ruinen'' can be sung to the melody of ''Deutschlandlied'' and vice versa.

When [[West Germany]] won the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final]] in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], the lyrics of the first stanza dominated when the crowd sang along to celebrate the surprise victory that was later dubbed [[1954 FIFA World Cup#Final: .22The Miracle of Berne.22|Miracle of Bern]].

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, efforts were made by conservatives in Germany to reclaim all three stanzas for the anthem; the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]], for instance, attempted twice (in 1985 and 1986) to make German high school students study all three stanzas, and in 1989 CDU politician Christean Wagner decreed that all high school students in [[Hesse]] were to memorize the three stanzas.<ref>Geisler, [http://books.google.com/books?id=CLVaSxt-sV0C&pg=PA72 p.72.]</ref>

On 7 March 1990, months before [[German reunification|reunification]], the Constitutional Court declared only the third stanza of Hoffmann von Fallersleben's poem to be protected as a national anthem under criminal law; Section 90a of the Criminal Code (''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'') makes defamation of the national anthem a crime, but does not specify what the national anthem is.

In November 1991, President [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] and Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] agreed in an exchange of letters to declare the third stanza alone the national anthem of the enlarged republic.<ref name=PresidentsOffice>{{cite web | url = http://www.bundespraesident.de/DE/Amt-und-Aufgaben/Wirken-im-Inland/Repraesentation-und-Integration/repraesentation-und-integration-node.html| title = Repräsentation und Integration | author = Bundespräsidialamt | authorlink = Bundespräsidialamt | language = German | accessdate = 24 May 2013 | quote = Nach Herstellung der staatlichen Einheit Deutschlands bestimmte Bundespräsident von Weizsäcker in einem Briefwechsel mit Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl im Jahr 1991 die dritte Strophe zur Nationalhymne für das deutsche Volk. }}</ref> On official occasions, Haydn's music is used, and only the official anthem, that is the third stanza of the song, is supposed to be sung. For other uses, all stanzas may be performed.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}


[[File:2-EUR-Muenze-de-freiheit.png|162px|thumbnail|The word FREEDOM]]
The opening line of the third stanza, ''Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit'', ("Unity and Justice and Freedom") is widely considered to be the national motto of Germany, although it was never officially proclaimed as such. It appears on soldiers' belts (replacing the earlier ''[[Gott mit uns]]'' of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] and the [[Wehrmacht]]), was engraved into the rim of former 2 and 5-[[Deutsche Mark]] coins, and is present on 2-[[Euro coins]] minted in Germany.

== Criticisms ==
Despite the text and tune of the song being remarkably peaceful compared to many other national anthems, the song has frequently been criticized for its generally nationalist theme, the geographic definition of Germany given in the first stanza, and the somewhat male chauvinist attitude in the second stanza.<ref name="malzahn">{{Cite news|last=Malzahn|first=Claus Christian|title=Deutsche Nationalhymne: 'Die blödsinnigste Parole der Welt'|newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|date=24 June 2006|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/0,1518,422419,00.html|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2065774,00.html?maca=en-tagesschau_englisch-335-rdf-mp|title=Germans Stop Humming, Start Singing National Anthem|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=24 June 2006|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> An early critic was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza ("Deutschland über alles") "die blödsinnigste Parole der Welt" ("the stupidest phrase in the world").<ref name="malzahn"/> [[Kurt Tucholsky]] was also negative about the song, and in 1929 published a photo book under the same title, criticizing right wing tendencies in Germany. German grammar is sufficiently precise to distinguish "über alles" i.e. above everything (for me), from "über allen", meaning "above everyone else". The latter misleading translation was purposely chosen by the Allies during the First World War for propaganda purposes.<ref>{{cite book|title=Falsehood in War Time: Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War (Chapter 11)|first=Arthur|last=Ponsonby|isbn=1162798653|publisher=George Allen and Unwin, London|year=1928}}</ref>

== Variants, additions, and controversial performances ==

=== Additional or alternate stanzas ===
Hoffmann von Fallersleben also intended the text to be used as a [[drinking song]]; the second stanza's toast to German women and wine are typical of this genre.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The original Heligoland manuscript included a variant ending of the third stanza for such occasions:

In 1921, Albert Matthai wrote a stanza in reaction to Germany's losses in and after [[World War I]]. This stanza was never used as a national anthem and was not part of the Deutschlandlied.

=== Notable performances and covers ===
The Unitarian Universalist hymnbook published in 1993, "Singing the Living Tradition" (Beacon Press, Boston) contains two versions of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 'Light of Ages and of Nations:' the second hymn (#190) is sung to the tune of the 'Emperor's Hymn', labelled as 'Austria'. Because of a common misconception that the tune is of Nazi origin, some parishioners have complained of being reminded of Holocaust associations, and this version is included with caution in some congregations.

The German musician [[Nico]] sometimes performed the national anthem at concerts and dedicated it to militant [[Andreas Baader]], leader of the [[Red Army Faction]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rockwell|first=John|title=Cabaret: Nico is back|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=21 February 1979|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> She included a version of ''Das Lied der Deutschen'' on her 1973 album ''[[The End...]]''. In 2006, the Slovenian industrial band [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] incorporated Hoffmann's lyrics in a song titled "Germania", on the album ''Volk'', which contains fourteen songs with adaptations of national anthems.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/art772,1975298 |title=Völker, hört die Fanale! |last=Hesselmann |first=Markus |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |date=7 December 2006 |accessdate=1 December 2009 |language=German}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/laibach-volk/ |title= Rev. of Laibach, ''Volk'' |last=Schiller |first=Mike |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Performing the song in Germany in 2009, the band cited the first stanza in the closing refrain, while on a video screen images were shown of a German city bombed during World War II.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.maerkischeallgemeine.de/cms/ziel/604050/DE?article_id=1892492 |format=subscription only |title=Die slowenische Band Laibach stellte in der Arena ihr Album ''Volk'' vor |newspaper=[[Märkische Allgemeine]] |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009|language=German}}<!-- originally at http://www.maerkischeallgemeine.de/cms/beitrag/11563106/60709/Die-slowenische-Band-Laibach-stellte-in-der-Arena.html --></ref>

In November 2009, the English singer [[Pete Doherty]] caused a stir when, live on the ''[[Bayerischer Rundfunk]]'' radio in [[Munich]], he sang the first stanza of the anthem; he was booed by the audience and after a few more songs the radio station pulled the plug on the show and the radio transmission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rnw.nl/nl/nederlands/article/rockzanger-pete-doherty-schoffeert-duitsers |title=Rockzanger Pete Doherty schoffeert Duitsers |work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009 |language=[[Dutch language|Dutch]]}}</ref>

In August 2011, at the [[Canoe racing|Canoe Sprint]] World Championships in Hungary, [[List_of_ICF_Canoe_Sprint_World_Championships_medalists_in_women's_kayak#K-2_1000_m|Anne Knorr and Debora Nich]] won gold for Germany in the 1000 metres [[Sprint_kayak#Canoe_sprint|K-2]] women's final race. The organizers of the event caused outrage when they mistakenly played the first stanza of the anthem during the medal ceremony. In a subsequent television interview German national coach Rainer Kiessler said that he was appalled and could not accept what had happened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20110822_110|title=Nazivolkslied op WK kajak|work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|date=22 August 2011|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://au.eurosport.com/olympicgames/london-2012/2012/germans-appalled-by-gaffe_sto2916606/story.shtml|title='Nazi anthem' played at canoe championship|publisher=[[Eurosport]]|date=22 August 2011}}</ref>

In October 2011, on the American TV series ''[[Pan Am (TV series)|Pan Am]]'', Colette ([[Karine Vanasse]]), a French stewardess, is in [[West Berlin]] when President [[John F. Kennedy]] delivers his [[Ich bin ein Berliner|famous 1963 speech at the Berlin Wall]]. Attending a party at the [[Embassy of the United States, Berlin#Mission Berlin (1945–1990)|US Mission]] that evening, she sings the controversial first verse of the "Deutschlandlied" slowly and emotionally, embarrassing the diplomats who she believes have been too quick to forgive and forget the events of World War II. Colette had been orphaned at the age of three when her parents died in [[Buchenwald]], where they were sent by the Nazis.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ich Bin Ein Berliner|url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/pan-am/episode-guide/episode103-ich-bin-ein-berliner|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|work=Pan Am|date=9 October 2011|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>
