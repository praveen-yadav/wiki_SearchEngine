'''Candidiasis''' or '''thrush''' is a [[Fungal infection in animals|fungal infection]] (mycosis) of any species from the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' (one genus of [[yeast]]s). ''[[Candida albicans]]'' is the most common agent of Candidiasis in humans.<ref name=Baron>{{cite book | author = Walsh TJ, Dixon DM | chapter=Deep Mycoses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S ''et al.'' eds.| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 |isbn=0-9631172-1-1 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4006 }}</ref><ref name=MedlinePlus>{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001511|Vaginal yeast infection}}</ref> Also commonly referred to as a '''yeast infection''', candidiasis is also technically known as '''candidosis''', '''moniliasis''', and '''oidiomycosis'''.<ref name="Andrews">{{cite book |author=James, William D.; Berger, Timothy G.; et al. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier|pages=308–311|year=2006 |isbn=0-7216-2921-0}}</ref>

Candidiasis encompasses infections that range from [[wiktionary:superficial|superficial]], such as [[Oral candidiasis|oral thrush]] and [[vaginitis]], to [[systemic disease|systemic]] and potentially life-threatening diseases. ''Candida'' infections of the latter category are also referred to as [[candidemia]] or invasive candidiasis, and are usually confined to severely [[immunocompromised]] persons, such as [[cancer]], [[Organ transplant|transplant]], and [[AIDS]] patients, as well as nontrauma emergency surgery patients.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kourkoumpetis T, Manolakaki D, Velmahos G, ''et al.'' |title=Candida infection and colonization among non-trauma emergency surgery patients |journal=Virulence |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=359–66 |year=2010 |pmid=21178471 |doi=10.4161/viru.1.5.12795 |url=http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/viru/abstract.php?id=12795}}</ref>

[[Antibiotic candidiasis]]  (iatrogenic candidiasis)

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Derm-57.jpg|thumb|Skin candidiasis]]
[[File:Toefungus.jpg|thumb|Nail candidiasis ([[onychomycosis]])]]
Symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the area affected.<ref name=ID10/> Most candidial infections result in minimal complications such as redness, itching and discomfort, though complications may be severe or even fatal if left untreated in certain populations. In [[immunocompetence|immunocompetent]] persons, candidiasis is usually a very localized infection of the skin or mucosal membranes, including  the [[oral cavity]] ([[oral thrush|thrush]]), the [[pharynx]] or [[esophagus]], the [[gastrointestinal tract]],  the [[urinary bladder]], the fingernails or toenails (onychomycosis), and the genitalia ([[vagina]], [[penis]]).<ref name=Baron/>

Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or [[vaginitis]], and can also occur on the [[male genitals]]. In [[immunocompromised]] patients, ''Candida'' infections can affect the [[esophageal candidiasis|esophagus]] with the potential of becoming [[systemic disease|systemic]], causing a much more serious condition, a [[fungemia]] called [[candidemia]].<ref name="Fidel"/><ref name="Pappas"/>

Thrush is commonly seen in infants. It is not considered abnormal in infants unless it lasts longer than a few weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title = Thrush| url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001650/ |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-04-08}}</ref>

Infection of the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]] may cause severe itching, burning, soreness, irritation, and a whitish or whitish-gray [[cottage cheese]]-like discharge, often with a curd-like appearance. These symptoms are also present in the more common [[bacterial vaginosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/features/is-it-yeast-infection |author=Terri Warren, RN |title=Is It a Yeast Infection? |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> In a 2002 study published in the ''Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology'', only 33% of women who were self-treating for a yeast infection actually had a such an infection, while most had either bacterial vaginosis or a mixed-type infection.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01759-8 |author=Ferris DG; Nyirjesy P; Sobel JD; Soper D; Pavletic A; Litaker MS |year=2002 |month=March |title=Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=419–425 |pmid=11864668 }}</ref> Symptoms of infection of the male genitalia (balanitis thrush) include red skin around the head of the penis, swelling, irritation, itchiness and soreness of the head of the penis, thick, lumpy discharge under the foreskin, unpleasant odour, difficulty retracting the foreskin ([[phimosis]]), and pain when passing urine
or during sex.<ref>[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Thrush-men/Pages/Symptoms.aspx NHS: Symptoms of thrush in men (balanitis thrush)]</ref>

Perianal candidiasis can cause [[pruritis ani]]. The lesion can be erythematous, papular or ulcerative in appearance, and it is not considered to be a [[sexually transmissible disease]].<ref>{{cite book|editors=Bruce G. Wolff et al.|title=The ASCRS textbook of colon and rectal surgery|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0-387-24846-3|pages=241, 242, 245}}</ref>

Esophageal candidiasis can cause [[dysphagia]] (difficulty swallowing), or less commonly [[odynophagia]] (painful swallowing).<ref name="Yamada 2009" />

== Causes ==
{{See also|Candida albicans}}
''Candida'' yeasts are generally present in healthy humans, particularly on the skin, but their growth is normally limited by the human [[immune system]], by competition of other [[microorganism]]s, such as bacteria occupying the same locations in the human body,<ref>{{cite book |author=Mulley, A.

''C. albicans'' was isolated from the vaginas of 19% of apparently healthy women, i.e., those who experienced few or no symptoms of infection.  External use of detergents or [[douche]]s or internal  disturbances (hormonal or physiological) can [[Perturbation (biology)|perturb]] the normal [[vaginal flora]], consisting of [[lactic acid bacteria]], such as [[lactobacilli]], and result in an overgrowth of ''Candida'' cells, causing symptoms of infection, such as local [[inflammation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mårdh P A, Novikova N, Stukalova E |title=Colonisation of extragenital sites by Candida in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidosis |journal=BJOG |volume=110 |issue=10 |pages=934–7 |year=2003 |month=October |pmid=14550364 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=1470-0328&date=2003&volume=110&issue=10&spage=934 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2003.01445.x}}</ref> Pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives have been reported as risk factors.<ref name="Schiefer">{{cite journal |author=Schiefer HG |title=Mycoses of the urogenital tract |journal=Mycoses |volume=40 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=33–6 |year=1997 |pmid=9476502 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.1997.tb00561.x }}</ref> [[Diabetes mellitus]] and the use of antibacterial [[antibiotics]] are also linked to an increased incidence of yeast infections.<ref name="Schiefer"/> Diets high in simple [[carbohydrates]] have been found to affect rates of oral candidiases,<ref name=Review2002>{{cite journal|last=Akpan|first=A|coauthors=Morgan, R|title=Oral candidiasis|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|date=2002 Aug|volume=78|issue=922|pages=455–9|pmid=12185216|doi=10.1136/pmj.78.922.455|pmc=1742467}}</ref> and [[hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] and infertility treatments may also be predisposing factors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nwokolo N C, Boag F C |title=Chronic vaginal candidiasis.

In penile candidiasis, the causes include sexual intercourse with an infected individual, low immunity, antibiotics, and diabetes.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Candida albicans PHIL 3192 lores.jpg|thumb|[[Agar plate]] culture of ''C. albicans'']]
[[Image:Esophageal candidiasis (2) PAS stain.jpg|thumb|Micrograph of esophageal candidiasis showing hyphae, [[biopsy]] specimen, [[PAS stain]]]]

Diagnosis of a yeast infection is done either via microscopic examination or culturing.

For identification by light microscopy, a scraping or swab of the affected area is placed on a [[microscope slide]]. A single drop of 10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution is then added to the specimen. The KOH dissolves the skin cells, but leaves the ''Candida'' cells intact, permitting visualization of [[hyphae|pseudohyphae]] and budding [[yeast cell]]s typical of many ''Candida'' species.

For the culturing method, a sterile swab is rubbed on the infected skin surface. The swab is then streaked on a culture medium. The culture is incubated at 37°C for several days, to allow development of yeast or bacterial colonies. The characteristics (such as morphology and colour) of the colonies may allow initial diagnosis of the organism causing disease symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Srikumar Chakravarthi, Nagaraja HS |title=A comprehensive review of the occurrence and management of systemic candidiasis as an opportunistic infection |journal=Microbiology Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=1–5 |year=2010 |url=http://scialert.net/abstract/?doi=mj.0000.20270.20270 |issn=2153-0696}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Candidiasis is commonly treated with [[antimycotic]]s; these [[antifungal drug]]s include topical [[clotrimazole]], topical [[nystatin]], [[fluconazole]], and topical [[ketoconazole]].

===Localized infection===
A one-time dose of [[fluconazole]] is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection.<ref name=Moosa>{{cite journal |author=Moosa MY, Sobel JD, Elhalis H, Du W, Akins RA |title=Fungicidal Activity of Fluconazole against Candida albicans in a Synthetic Vagina-Simulative Medium |journal=Antimicrob.

The [[genus]] ''Candida'' and [[species]] ''C. albicans'' were described by botanist [[Christine Marie Berkhout]] in her doctoral thesis at the [[University of Utrecht]] in 1923. Over the years, the classification of the genera and species has evolved. Obsolete names for this genus include ''Mycotorula'' and ''Torulopsis''. The species has also been known in the past as ''Monilia albicans'' and ''Oidium albicans''. The current classification is ''[[nomen conservandum]]'', which means the name is authorized for use by the International Botanical Congress (IBC).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm |title=International Code of Botanical Nomenclature |year=2000 |isbn=3-904144-22-7 |location =Königstein | accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>

The genus ''Candida'' includes about 150 different species; however, only a few are known to cause human infections. ''C. albicans'' is the most significant [[pathogen]]ic species. Other species pathogenic in humans include ''C. tropicalis'', ''C. glabrata'', ''C. krusei'', ''C. parapsilosis'', ''C. dubliniensis'', and ''C. lusitaniae''.

The name Candida was proposed by Berkhout.

Some [[alternative medicine]] proponents postulate a widespread occurrence of systemic candidiasis (or candida hypersensitivity syndrome, yeast allergy, fungal type dysbiosis or gastrointestinal candida overgrowth), a medically unrecognised condition.<ref name="NCAHF">[http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/candida.html candidiasis hypersensitivity], [[National Council Against Health Fraud]]</ref> The view was most widely promoted in a book published by Dr. William Crook<ref name=Crook>{{cite book |author=Crook, William G. |title=The yeast connection: a medical breakthrough |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1986 |isbn=0-394-74700-3 }}</ref> that hypothesized a variety of common symptoms such as fatigue, [[PMS]], [[sexual dysfunction]], [[asthma]], [[psoriasis]], digestive and urinary problems, [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Myalgia|muscle pain]] could be caused by [[subclinical infection]]s of ''C. albicans''.<ref name=Crook/> Crook suggested a variety of remedies to treat these symptoms, including dietary modification (commonly referred to as the ''rainbow diet''—eating fresh foods and avoiding foods high in vinegar, sugar, or yeast), prescription antifungals, [[pau d'arco]] tea, [[Echinacea purpurea|echinacea]] tea, and [[colonic irrigation]]. With the exception of the few dietary studies in the [[urinary tract infection]] section, conventional medicine has not used most of these alternatives, since there is limited scientific evidence proving either their effectiveness or that subclinical systemic candidiasis is a viable diagnosis.<ref>{{cite web |author=Weil A |title=Concerned About Candidiasis? |url=http://www.drweil.com/u/QA/QA125503/ |date=2002-10-25 |publisher=Weil Lifestyle |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Barrett S |title=Dubious "Yeast Allergies" |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html |date=2005-10-08 |publisher=QuackWatch |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Katherine Zeratsky |title=Candida cleanse: Does it treat candidiasis? |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/candida-cleanse/AN01679 |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Blonz ER |title=Is there an epidemic of chronic candidiasis in our midst? |journal=JAMA |volume=256 |issue=22 |pages=3138–9 |year=1986 |month=December |pmid=3783850 |doi=10.1001/jama.1986.03380220104032 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/256/22/3138.full.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>

In 1990, alternative health vendor ''Nature's Way'' signed an FTC consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of $30,000 payable to the National Institutes of Health for research in genuine candidiasis.<ref name="NCAHF" />
