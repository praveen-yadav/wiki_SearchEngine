'''Abdera''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄβδηρα}}) was a major [[ancient Greece|Greek]] ''[[polis]]'' on the coast of [[Thrace]]. It lay 17&nbsp;km east-northeast of the mouth of the [[Nestos River]], almost directly opposite the island of [[Thasos]]. The site now lies in the [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi]] regional unit of [[western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Greece]]. The municipality of Abdera ([[Modern Greek]]: {{lang|el|Άβδηρα}}, {{IPA-el|ˈavðira|}}) has 19,005 inhabitants (2011).

==History==
[[File:Abdera location.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Location of Abdera and its two successive [[metropolis]]es, [[Clazomenae]] and [[Teos]].]]
[[File:Abderacoin.png|thumb|200px|right|The chief coin type, with griffon.]]
Its mythical foundation was attributed to [[Heracles]] who founded the city on behalf of his fallen friend [[Abderus]]. 

The historical founding is traced back to a colony from [[Klazomenai]].  This historical founding was traditionally dated to 654 BC, which is unverified, although evidence in 7th century BC [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek pottery]] tends to support it.<ref name="OCD">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hornblower| first = Simon| title = Abdera | encyclopedia = The Oxford Classical Dictionary| pages = 1| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| year = 1996}}</ref>  But its prosperity dates from 544 BC, when the majority of the people of [[Teos]] (including the poet [[Anacreon]]) migrated to Abdera to escape the [[Iran|Persian]] yoke ([[Herodotus]] i.168).<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Abdera |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=19}}</ref>  The chief coin type, a ''[[griffon]]'', is identical with that of Teos; the rich silver coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.

In 513 BC and 512 BC, the Persians conquered Abdera. In 492 BC, the Persians again conquered Abdera, this time under [[Darius I]]. It later became part of the [[Delian League]] and fought on the side of Athens in the [[Peloponnesian war]].

Abdera was a wealthy city, the third richest in the League, due to its status as a prime port for trade with the interior of Thrace and the [[Odrysian kingdom]].<ref name="OCD"/>

A valuable prize, the city was repeatedly sacked: by the [[Triballi]] in 376 BC, [[Philip II of Macedon]] in 350 BC; later by [[Lysimachus|Lysimachos of Thrace]],<ref name=EB/> the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and again by the Macedonians. In 170 BC the Roman armies and those of [[Eumenes II|Eumenes II of Pergamon]] besieged and sacked it.

The town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the 4th century BC. The air of Abdera was proverbial in Athens as causing stupidity,<ref>Cicero. ''Epistulae ad Atticum'',  4.17.3, 7.7.4.</ref> but the city counted among its citizens the philosophers [[Democritus]], [[Protagoras]]<ref name=EB/> and [[Anaxarchus]], historian and philosopher [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], and the lyric poet [[Anacreon]].

The ruins of the town may still be seen on Cape Balastra (40°56'1.02"N 24°58'21.81"E); they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbor; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of Polystylon. Abdera is a [[titular see]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the province of [[Rhodope (Roman province)|Rhodope]] on the southern coast of Thrace, now called Bouloustra.

==Municipality==
The municipality Abdera was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref>

The municipal unit Abdera is subdivided into the communities Abdera, [[Mandra, Xanthi|Mandra]], [[Myrodato]] and [[Nea Kessani]]. The community Abdera consists of the settlements Abdera, [[Giona, Xanthi|Giona]], Lefkippos, [[Pezoula]] and Skala.
