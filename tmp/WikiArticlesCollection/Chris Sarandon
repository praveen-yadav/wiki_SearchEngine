After graduation, he toured with numerous improv companies and became heavily involved in [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]], making his professional debut in ''The Rose Tattoo'' in 1965. In 1968, Sarandon moved to [[New York]], where he landed his first television role as Dr. Tom Halverson on ''[[The Guiding Light]]'' (1969–1973). He appeared in the primetime TV movies ''The Satan Murders'' (1974) and ''[[Thursday's Game]]'' before landing the role of [[Al Pacino]]'s [[transsexual]] wife in ''Dog Day Afternoon'' (1975), a performance which earned him nominations for Best New Male Star of the Year at the [[Golden Globes]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

He also appeared in a series of television roles, some of which (such as ''A Tale of Two Cities'' in 1980) mirrored his affinity for the classics. He also took roles in horror films opposite the late [[Margaux Hemingway]] in the thriller ''[[Lipstick (film)|Lipstick]]'' (1976) and as a [[demon]] in the shocker ''[[The Sentinel (1977 film)|The Sentinel]]'' (1977).

These were followed by another mainstream success as the vampire-next-door in the teen horror film ''[[Fright Night]]'' (1985).

He is best known in the film industry for his role as Prince Humperdinck in [[Rob Reiner]]'s 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', though he also has had supporting parts in some other successful films such as the original ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]'' (1988). In 1992, he played Joseph Curwen/Charles Dexter Ward in ''[[The Resurrected]]''. He also provided the voice of [[Jack Skellington]], the main character in [[Tim Burton]]'s [[animation|animated]] [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), and has since reprised the role in many other subsequent productions, including the Disney/[[Square (company)|Square]] video games ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and the [[Capcom]] sequel to the original film, ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge|Oogie's Revenge]]''. Sarandon also reprised his role as Jack Skellington for ''[[Halloween Screams]]'' and the [[Haunted Mansion Holiday]], a three-month overlay of the [[Haunted Mansion]] at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]], where Jack and his friends take over the Mansion in an attempt to take over Christmas, much as his character did in the film.

Sarandon would later find work on television again with a recurring role as Dr. Burke on [[NBC]]'s long-running medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

In 1991 he performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the short-lived musical ''[[Nick & Nora]]'' (based on the ''[[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]]'' film) with [[Joanna Gleason]], the daughter of [[Monty Hall]]. Sarandon married Gleason in 1994. They have appeared together in a number of films, including ''[[Edie & Pen]]'' (1996), ''[[American Perfekt]]'' (1997) and ''[[Let the Devil Wear Black]]'' (1999). In the 2000s he made guest appearances in quite a few TV series, notably as [[List of Charmed characters#The Necromancer|the Necromancer demon]], Armand, in ''[[Charmed]]'', and as superior court judge Barry Krumble in six episodes of ''[[Judging Amy]]''.

He returned to Broadway in 2006 playing Signor Naccarelli in the six-time [[Tony award]]-winning Broadway musical ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'' at [[Lincoln Center]]. Most recently he appeared in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' as Antoine de Guiche, alongside [[Kevin Kline]], [[Jennifer Garner]] and [[Daniel Sunjata]].
