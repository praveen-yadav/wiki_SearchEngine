{{Politics of Burkina Faso}}
[[Burkina Faso]] has good relations with the [[European Union]], African and Asian countries. France, the former colonial power, in particular, continues to provide significant aid and supports [[Blaise Compaoré|Compaoré's]] developing role as a regional powerbroker. Burkina maintains diplomatic relations with the [[Republic of China]] (usually referred to as "[[Taiwan]]") instead of the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{CIA World Factbook}}</ref>

According to the U.S. State Department, "[[Burkina Faso-United States relations|U.S. relations with Burkina Faso]] are good but subject to strains in the past because of the Compaoré government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity."<ref>{{StateDept}} [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm]</ref> 

Burkina Faso's relations with its West African neighbors have improved in recent years. Relations with [[Ghana]], in particular, have warmed with a change in government in that country. President Compaoré has mediated a political crisis in [[Togo]] and helped to resolve the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] conflict in [[Niger]]. Burkina maintains cordial relations with [[Libya]]. A territorial dispute with [[Mali]] was mediated by Ghana and [[Nigeria]], which has led to lessening of tensions between the two nations.

Since the [[First Ivorian Civil War|2002 civil war]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], relations between it and Burkina Faso have been filled with accusations of Burkinabé support for rebels on one side and claims of mistreatment of Burkinabé workers on the other.<ref>''Ivorian raiders "are foreigners"'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4720883.stm BBC], July 27, 2005</ref><ref>''Blaise Campaoré:<<La crise ivoirienne inquiète le Burkina>>'', [http://www.lefigaro.fr/index.html Le Figaro], December 11, 2005</ref> Côte d'Ivoire remains Burkina Faso's largest regional trading partner in spite of their disputes and tens of thousands of Burkinabés continue to work in the Ivory Coast.<ref>''Unending Crises'', [http://africatoday.eh7.co.uk/cgi-bin/public.cgi?sub=news&action=one&cat=23&id=532 Africa Today], February 25, 2006</ref>

Nineteen provinces of Burkina Faso are joined with contiguous areas of Mali and Niger under the [[Liptako-Gourma Authority]], a regional economic organization.

Burkina Faso is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]])

With the coming to power of [[Thomas Sankara]] in [[Burkina Faso]] in 1983, relations between [[Ghana]] and Burkina became both warm and close. Indeed, [[Rawlings]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}} and Sankara began discussions about uniting Ghana and Burkina in the manner of the defunct [[Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union]], which Nkrumah had sought unsuccessfully to promote as a foundation for his dream of unified continental government. Political and economic ties between Ghana and Burkina, a poorer country, were strengthened through joint commissions of cooperation and through border demarcation committee meetings. Frequent high-level consultations and joint military exercises, meant to discourage potential dissidents and to protect young "revolutions" in each country, were fairly regular features of Ghana-Burkina relations.<ref name=cs>Owusu, Maxwell.

{{main|Burkina Faso – Russia relations}}

Diplomatic relations between Burkina Faso and the Soviet Union were established for the first time on February 18, 1967. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Burkina Faso recognized Russia as the USSR's successor. However financial reasons has shut the embassies between the two nations. In 1992, the embassy of the Russian Federation in [[Ouagadougou]] was closed, and in 1996, the embassy of Burkina Faso in Moscow was closed.

===United States===
{{main|Burkina Faso – United States relations}}

Relations are good but subject to strains in the past because of the [[Blaise Compaoré|Compaoré]] government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity. In addition to regional peace and stability, U.S. interests in Burkina are to promote continued [[democratization]] and greater respect for [[human rights]] and to encourage sustainable economic development. Although the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) closed its office in [[Ouagadougou]] in 1995, about $18 million annually of USAID funding goes to Burkina's development through non-governmental and regional organizations. The largest is a [[Food for Peace]] school lunch program administered by [[Catholic Relief Services]]. Burkina has been the site of several development success stories. U.S. leadership in building food security in the [[Sahel]] after the 1968-74 drought has been successful in virtually eliminating famine, despite recurrent drought years. [[River blindness]] has been eliminated from the region. In both cases, the U.S. was the main donor to inter-African organizations headquartered in Ouagadougou which through sustained efforts have achieved and consolidated these gains. In 2005, Burkina Faso and the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC) signed a $12 million Threshold Country Program to build schools and increase girls' enrolment rates. In November 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Burkina Faso as eligible to submit a proposal for Millennium Challenge Account assistance for fiscal year 2006, making it one of only two countries eligible for threshold as well as compact funding. The [[Government of Burkina Faso]] is working closely with MCC staff to finalize its compact submission.
