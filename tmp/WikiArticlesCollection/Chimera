===Literature===
<!--There is general consensus (see talk page) that chimaeras which are not important enough to a fiction to be mentioned in that article should not be mentioned here. If the chimaera is simply a fictional instance of one of the other meanings, particularly the mythological creature or genetic anomaly, please reconsider, and discuss, before adding; your contribution will probably be reverted otherwise.-->
