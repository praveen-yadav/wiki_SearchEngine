'''Ampicillin''' is a [[beta-lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam]] [[antibiotic]] that is part of the [[aminopenicillin]] family and is roughly equivalent to its successor, [[amoxicillin]] in terms of spectrum and level of activity.<ref name=AHFS>{{cite book | title= AHFS DRUG INFORMATION 2006 | publisher= American Society of Health-System Pharmacists | year= 2006 | edition= 2006}}</ref> It can sometimes result in reactions that range in severity from a [[rash]] (in the case of patients that may unwittingly have [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]]) to potentially lethal [[allergic reaction]]s such as [[anaphylaxis]]. However, as with other penicillin drugs, it is relatively non-toxic and adverse effects of a serious nature are encountered only rarely.

==Mechanism of action==
Belonging to the [[penicillin]] group of beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin is able to penetrate [[Gram-positive]] and some [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It differs from [[Benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]], or benzylpenicillin, only by the presence of an [[amino]] group. That amino group helps the drug penetrate the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.

Ampicillin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase|transpeptidase]], which is needed by bacteria to make their [[cell wall]]s.<ref name=AHFS/> It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis in [[binary fission]], which ultimately leads to cell [[lysis]]. Ampicillin has received FDA approval for its mechanism of action.

===Effects on chloroplast division===
Ampicillin, like other [[beta-lactam|β-lactam]] antibiotics, not only blocks the division of bacteria, but also the division of [[chloroplast]]s of the [[Glaucophyte]]s (called cyanelles) and chloroplasts of the moss ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', a [[bryophyte]]. In contrast, it has no effect on the [[plastid]]s of the higher developed [[vascular plant]] ''Solanum lycopersicum'' ([[tomato]]).<ref>Britta Kasten und [[Ralf Reski]] (1997): [[beta-lactam|β-lactam]] antibiotics inhibit chloroplast division in a moss (Physcomitrella patens) but not in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Journal of [[Plant Physiology]] 150, 137-140. [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=2640663]</ref>

==Spectrum of Bacterial Susceptibility and Resistance==
The bacteria Diplococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are susceptible to Ampicillin meanwhile Stenotrophomonas maltophilia developed resistance towards Ampicillin. Some of Neisseria gonorrhoeae are resistant to Ampicillin. For detailed information of Ampicillin, see Ampicillin Susceptibility and Resistance data sheet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ampicillin Susceptibility and Resistance Data|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Ampicillin%20anhydrous.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>

==Application==
Ampicillin is closely related to [[amoxicillin]], another type of penicillin, and both are used to treat [[urinary tract infections]], [[otitis media]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', [[salmonellosis]] and ''[[Listeriosis|Listeria]]'' [[meningitis]]. It is used with [[flucloxacillin]] in the combination antibiotic [[co-fluampicil]] for [[Empirical|empiric]] treatment of [[cellulitis]]; providing cover against [[Group A streptococcal infection]] whilst the flucloxacillin acts against the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacterium. Of concern is the number of bacteria that have become [[antibiotic resistance|resistant]] to Ampicillin necessitating combination therapy or use of other [[antibiotics]].

All ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and most strains of ''[[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Aerobacter]]'' are considered resistant.<ref name=Mosby>{{cite book | title=Mosby's Drug Consult 2006 | publisher= Mosby, Inc. | year= 2006 | edition= 16}}</ref>  Additionally, resistance to ampicillin is seen in [[enterobacter]], [[citrobacter]], [[serratia]], indole-positive proteus species, and other hospital-acquired gram negative infections.<ref>{{cite book|last=Katzung|first=Bertram G.|title=Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, 10th edition|year=2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Medical|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-145153-6|pages=733}}</ref>

An ampicillin resistance gene (abbreviated ''ampR'') is commonly used as a [[selectable marker]] in routine biotechnology. Due to concerns over [[horizontal gene transfer]] to pathogenic organisms in the wild, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] restricts use of this gene (among other resistance genes) in commercial genetically modified organisms. The enzyme responsible for degrading ampicillin is called [[beta-lactamase]], in reference to the beta-lactam structure of ampicillin and related drugs.
  
==History==
Ampicillin has been used extensively to treat [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s since 1961. Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]], penicillin therapies had only been effective against [[Gram-positive]] organisms such as [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]]. Ampicillin (originally branded as 'Penbritin') also demonstrated activity against [[Gram-negative]] organisms such as ''[[H. influenzae]]'', [[coliform]]s and ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' spp. Ampicillin was the first of a number of so-called broad spectrum penicillins subsequently introduced by Beecham.
