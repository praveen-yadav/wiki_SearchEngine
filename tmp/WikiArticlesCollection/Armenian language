The '''Armenian language''' ({{lang|hy|հայերեն}} {{IPA-hy|hɑjɛˈɾɛn|}} ''{{transl|hy|ISO|hayeren}}'') is an [[Indo-European language]] spoken by the [[Armenians]]. It is the official language of the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]]. It has historically been spoken throughout the [[Armenian Highlands]] and today is widely spoken in the [[Armenian diaspora]]. It is of interest to linguists for its distinctive [[phonological development]]s within the Indo-European family of languages.

Armenian has its own unique script, the [[Armenian alphabet]], invented in 405-406 AD by the ancient linguist and cleric [[Mesrop Mashtots]].

Linguists classify Armenian as an independent branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109780/Armenian-language Armenian language – Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Armenian shares a number of major innovations with [[Greek language|Greek]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Armenian Language|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/language/about/armenian.html}}</ref>  and some linguists group these two languages together with [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] and the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] family into a higher-level subgroup of Indo-European, which is defined by such [[synapomorphy|shared innovations]] as the [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]]. More recently, others have proposed a [[Balkans|Balkan]] grouping including Greek, Armenian, Phrygian, and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].<ref>''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', Benjamin W. Fortson, John Wiley and Sons, 2009, p383.</ref><ref>Hans J. Holm (2011): “Swadesh lists” of Albanian Revisited and Consequences for its position in the Indo-European Languages. The Journal of Indo-European Studies, Volume 39, Number 1&2.</ref>

Armenia was a monolingual country not later than by II century BC.<ref>Strabo, Geographica, XI, 14, 5; Հայոց լեզվի համառոտ պատմություն, Ս. Ղ. Ղազարյան։ Երևան, 1981, էջ 33 (Concise History of Armenian Language, S. Gh. Ghazaryan. Yerevan, 1981, p. 33).</ref> Its language has long literary history, with a fifth-century Bible translation as its oldest surviving text. Its vocabulary has been heavily influenced by [[Middle Iranian languages|Western Middle Iranian languages]], particularly [[Parthian language|Parthian]], and to a lesser extent by Greek, [[Latin]], [[Old French]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages throughout its history. There are two standardized modern literary forms, [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]], with which most contemporary dialects are [[mutually intelligible]]. The divergent and almost extinct [[Lomavren language]] is a [[Romani language|Romani]]-influenced dialect with an Armenian grammar and a largely Romani-derived vocabulary, including Romani numbers.

{{Indo-European}}

While the Armenians were known to history much earlier (for example, they were mentioned in the 6th century BC [[Full translation of the Behistun Inscription|Behistun Inscription]] and [[Xenophon]]'s 4th century BC history, ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|The Anabasis]]''),<ref>"Armenia as Xenophon Saw It", p. 47, ''A History of Armenia''. Vahan Kurkjian, 2008</ref> the oldest surviving Armenian language text is the 5th century AD [[Bible]] translation of [[Saint Mesrob Mashtots|Mesrob Mashtots]]. Mesrob Mashtots created the [[Armenian alphabet]] in 405 AD, at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some with the creation of the [[Georgian alphabet]].

===Early contacts===
The large percentage of loans from [[Iranian languages]] initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. The distinctness of Armenian was only recognized when Hübschmann (1875)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read12.html |title=A Reader in Nineteenth Century Historical Indo-European Linguistics: On the Position of Armenian in the Sphere of the Indo-European Languages |publisher=Utexas.edu |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> used the [[comparative method]] to distinguish two layers of Iranian loans from the older Armenian [[vocabulary]].

W. M. Austin (1942) concluded<ref>{{cite journal|last=Austin |first=William M. |title=Is Armenian an Anatolian Language? |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |date=January–March, 1942 |pages=22–25 |doi=10.2307/409074 |journal=Language |volume=18 |issue=1 |jstor=409074}}</ref> that there was an early contact between Armenian and [[Anatolian languages]], based on what he considered common archaisms, such as the lack of a feminine and the absence of inherited long vowels. However, unlike shared innovations (or ''[[synapomorphies]]''), the common retention of archaisms (or ''[[symplesiomorphy]]'') is not necessarily considered evidence of a period of common isolated development.

Soviet linguist [[Igor Mikhailovich Diakonov|Igor Diakonov]] (1985)<ref>Igor Mikhailovich Diakonov, "Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 105.4 (1985) [http://azargoshnasp.net/history/Hurrian/diaokonoff_hurro_armenian_borrowing.pdf text]</ref> noted the presence in [[Grabar|Old Armenian]] of what he calls a [[Caucasian language|Caucasian substratum]], identified by earlier scholars, consisting of loans from the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages]] such as [[Udi language|Udi]]. Noting that the [[Hurro-Urartian]] peoples inhabited the Armenian homeland in the second millennium {{smallcaps|b.c.}}, Diakonov identifies in Armenian a Hurro-Urartian substratum of social, cultural, and animal and plant terms such as ''[[wikt:աղախին|ałaxin]]'' "slave girl" ( ← Hurr. ''al(l)a(e)ḫḫenne''), ''cov'' "sea" ( ← Urart. ''ṣûǝ'' "(inland) sea"), ''ułt'' "camel" ( ← Hurr. ''uḷtu''), and ''[[wikt:խնձոր|xnjor]]'' "apple(tree)" ( ← Hurr. ''ḫinzuri''). Some of the terms he gives admittedly have an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] provenance, but he suggests they were borrowed through Hurrian or Urartian. Given that these borrowings do not undergo [[sound change]]s characteristic of the development of Armenian from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], he dates their borrowing to a time before the written record but after the [[Proto-Armenian language]] stage.

===Graeco-Armenian hypothesis===
{{Main|Graeco-Armenian hypothesis}}

The hypothesis that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Pedersen]] (1924), who noted that the number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. [[Antoine Meillet|Meillet]] (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the [[PIE|parent language]]. Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his ''Esquisse'' (1936). Solta (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. Hamp (1976:91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time "when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian" (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]], a negator derived from the set phrase ''ne hoiu kwid'' ("not ever at all"), the representation of word-initial [[laryngeals]] by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. The closeness of the relationship between Armenian and Greek sheds light on the [[paraphyletic]] nature of the [[Centum-Satem isogloss]]. Nevertheless, linguists, including Fortson (2004), comment "by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD, the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces."

==Evolution==
Early in the fifth century, [[Classical Armenian]], or Grabar, was one of the great languages of the Near East and Asia Minor. Although an autonomous branch within the Indo-European family of languages, it had some affinities to Middle Iranian, Greek and the Balto-Slavic languages but belonged to none of them. It was characterized by a system of inflection unlike the other languages, as well as a flexible and liberal use of combining root words to create derivative and compound words by the application of certain agglutinative affixes.

The classical language imported numerous words from Middle Iranian languages, primarily [[Parthian language|Parthian]], and contains smaller inventories of borrowings from Greek, Syriac, Latin, and [[Autochthonic language|autochthonous languages]] such as [[Urartian language|Urartian]]. Middle Armenian (11th–15th centuries AD) incorporated further loans from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Latin, and the modern dialects took in hundreds of additional words from Modern Turkish and Persian. Therefore, determining the historical evolution of Armenian is particularly difficult because Armenian borrowed many words from [[Parthian language|Parthian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] (both [[Iranian language]]s) as well as from Greek.

In the period that followed the invention of the alphabet and up to the threshold of the modern era, Grabar (Classical Armenian) lived on. An effort to modernize the language in [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] (11–14th centuries) resulted in the addition of two more characters to the alphabet, bringing the total number to 38.

The Book of Lamentations by [[Gregory of Narek]] (951–1003) is an example of the development of a literature and writing style in Middle Armenian. In addition to elevating the literary style of the Armenian language, Gregory of Nareg paved the way for his successors to include secular themes in their writings. The thematic shift from mainly religious texts to writings with secular outlooks further enhanced and enriched the vocabulary. “A Word of Wisdom”, a poem by Hovhannes Sargavak devoted to a starling, legitimizes poetry devoted to nature, love, or female beauty. Gradually, the interests of the population at large were reflected in other literary works as well. Konsdantin Yerzinkatsi and several others even take the unusual step of criticizing the ecclesiastic establishment and addressing the social issues of the Armenian homeland. Not surprisingly, these changes altered the nature of the literary style and syntax, but they did not constitute radical changes to the fundamentals of the grammar or the morphology of the language.

The [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828 once again divided the traditional Armenian homeland. This time, two thirds of historical Armenia fell under Ottoman control, while the remaining territories were divided between the Russian and Persian empires. The antagonistic relationship between the Russian and Ottoman Empires led to creation of two separate and different environments under which Armenians lived and suffered. Halfway through the 19th century, two important concentrations of Armenian communities were constituted.

Because of persecutions or the search for better economic opportunities, many Armenians living under Ottoman rule gradually moved to [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]], while Tiflis (Tbilisi) in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] became the center of Armenians living under Russian rule. These two cosmopolitan cities very soon became the primary poles of Armenian intellectual and cultural life.

The introduction of new literary forms and styles, as well as many new ideas sweeping Europe, reached Armenians living in both regions. This created an ever-growing need to elevate the vernacular, Ašxarhabar, to the dignity of a modern literary language, in contrast to the now-anachronistic Grabar. Numerous dialects developed in the traditional Armenian regions, which, different as they were, had certain morphological and phonetic features in common. On the basis of these features two major variants emerged:
* Western variant: The influx of immigrants from different parts of the traditional Armenian homeland to Constantinople crystallized the common elements of the regional dialects, paving the way to a style of writing that required a shorter and more flexible learning curve than Grabar.
* Eastern variant: The [[Yerevan dialect|dialect of the Ararat plateau]] provided the primary elements of Eastern Armenian, centered in Tiflis ([[Tbilisi]], Georgia). Similar to the Western Armenian variant, the Modern Eastern was in many ways more practical and accessible to the masses than Grabar.

Both centers vigorously pursued the promotion of Ašxarhabar. The proliferation of newspapers in both versions (Eastern & Western) and the development of a network of schools where modern Armenian was taught, dramatically increased the rate of literacy (in spite of the obstacles by the colonial administrators), even in remote rural areas. The emergence of literary works entirely written in the modern versions increasingly legitimized the language’s existence. By the turn of the 20th century both varieties of the one modern Armenian language prevailed over Grabar and opened the path to a new and simplified grammatical structure of the language in the two different cultural spheres. Apart from minor morphological, phonetic, and grammatical differences, the largely common vocabulary and identical rules of grammatical fundamentals allows users of one variant to understand the other easily.

After the [[First World War]], the existence of the two modern versions of the same language was sanctioned even more clearly. The [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (1920–1990) used Eastern Armenian as its official language, while the Diaspora created after the [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide of 1915]] carried with it the only thing survivors still possessed: their native language, Western Armenian.

===Modern changes===
The two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their Turkish lexical influences in the 20th century, primarily following the [[Armenian Genocide]].

==Phonology==
{{see also|Armenian alphabet|Armenian braille}}
[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] voiceless [[plosive|occlusives]] are aspirated in [[Proto-Armenian]], one of the circumstances that is often linked to the [[Glottalic theory]], part of which postulated that the voiceless occlusives of Proto-Indo-European were aspirated.<ref>James Clackson, ''Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (2007, Cambridge)<br>Robert S.P. Beekes, ''Comparative Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (1995, John Benjamins)<br>Oswald J.L. Szemerényi, ''Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics'' (1996, Oxford)</ref>

===Stress===
In Armenian the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last syllable contains {{IPA|[ə]}}, in which case it falls on the penultimate one. For instance, <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:ախորժակ|ɑχoɾˈʒɑk]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:մաղադանոս|mɑʁɑdɑˈnos]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:գինի|giˈni]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> but <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:Վահագն|vɑˈhɑgən]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:դաշտը|ˈdɑʃtə]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. Exceptions to this rule are some words with the final letter է (ե in the reformed orthography) (մի՛թէ, մի՛գուցե, ո՛րեւէ) and sometimes the ordinal numerals (վե՛ցերորդ, տա՛սներորդ, etc.).

===Vowels===
{{Armenians}}
Modern Armenian has six monophthongs. Each vowel phoneme in the table is represented by three symbols. The first indicates the phoneme's pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).  After that appears the corresponding letter of the Armenian alphabet. The last symbol is its Latin transliteration (according to ISO 9985).

The occlusives and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] have a special aspirated series (transcribed with a Greek ''[[spiritus asper]]'' after the letter): ''p’'', ''t’'', ''c’'', ''k’'' (but ''č''). Each phoneme in the table is represented by three symbols. The first indicates the phoneme's pronunciation in the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), after that appears the corresponding letter of the [[Armenian alphabet]], and the last symbol is its [[Latin script|Latin]] [[transliteration]] (according to [[ISO 9985]]).

==Morphology==

Armenian corresponds with other Indo-European languages in its structure, but it shares distinctive sounds and features of its grammar with neighboring languages of the [[Caucasus]] region. Armenian is [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]], one of only two Indo-European languages with this characteristic, the other one being [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref>[http://armenianlanguage.org/origins/origins.html (Armenian is the only indoeuropean language which is agglutinative)]</ref> Armenian is rich in combinations of consonants. Both classical Armenian and the modern spoken and literary dialects have a complicated system of declining nouns, with six or seven noun cases but no gender. In modern Armenian the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in "he will go") has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of [[Classical Armenian]]. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English "he goes" and "he does not go"). Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations. With time the Armenian language made a transition from a synthetic language (Old Armenian or [[Grabar]]) to a typical analytic language (Modern Armenian) with Middle Armenian as a midpoint in this transition.

===Noun===
Classical Armenian has no [[grammatical gender]], not even in the pronoun, but there is a feminine suffix (-ուհի "-uhi"). For example, ուսուցիչ (''usuts'ich'', "teacher") becomes ուսուցչուհի (''usuts'chuhi'', female teacher). This suffix, however, does not have a grammatical effect on the sentence. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. Nouns are declined for one of seven cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[locative case|locative]], [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], or [[instrumental case|instrumental]].

===Verb===
{{Main|Armenian verbs}}

Verbs in Armenian have an expansive system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] with two main verb types (three in Western Armenian) changing form based on [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

==Dialects==
[[File:Armenian dialects, Adjarian 1909.png|thumb|350px|Map of the [[Historical dialects of Armenian|Armenian dialects in early 20th century]]:
{{legend|#00FF00|-owm dialects, corresponding to Eastern Armenian.}}
{{legend|#808080|-el dialects.}}
{{legend|#FFD800|-gë dialects, corresponding to Western Armenian.}}]]
Armenian is a [[pluricentric language]], having two modern [[Standard language|standardized]] forms: [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]]. The most distinctive feature of Western Armenian is that it has undergone several phonetic mergers; these may be due to proximity to Arabic- and Turkish-speaking communities.

For example, Eastern Armenian speakers pronounce ({{lang|hy|թ}}) as an aspirated "t" as in "tiger", ({{lang|hy|դ}}) like the "d" in "develop", and ({{lang|hy|տ}}) as a [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] occlusive, sounding somewhere between the two as in "s'''t'''op." Western Armenian has simplified the occlusive system into a simple division between voiced occlusives and aspirated ones; the first series corresponds to the tenuis series of Eastern Armenian, and the second corresponds to the Eastern voiced and aspirated series. Thus, the Western dialect pronounces both ({{lang|hy|թ}}) and ({{lang|hy|դ}}) as an aspirated "t" as in "tiger", and the ({{lang|hy|տ}}) letter is pronounced like the letter "d" as in "develop".

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects.

Armenian can be subdivided in two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have died due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. While Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, some subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. It is true, however, that a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is exposed to the other dialect over even a short period of time will be able to understand the other with relative ease.
