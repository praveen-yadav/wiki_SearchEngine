'''Chaparral''' is a [[shrubland]] or [[Heath (habitat)|heathland]] [[plant community]] found primarily in the U.S. state of [[California]] and in the northern portion of the [[Baja California peninsula]], [[Mexico]]. It is shaped by a [[Mediterranean climate]] (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire, featuring summer-drought tolerant plants with hard [[sclerophyllous]] evergreen leaves, as contrasted with the associated soft-leaved, [[drought deciduous]], [[scrubland|scrub]] community of [[Coastal sage scrub]], found below the chaparral biome.  Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California, and associated Mediterranean shrubland an additional 3.5%.<ref name="calacademy.org">[http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/california_hotspot/habitat_mediterranean_shrublands.htm]</ref> The name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''[[Quercus coccifera|chaparro]]'', applied to [[scrub oak (disambiguation)|scrub oak]]s.

==Introduction==
In its natural regime, chaparral is characterized by infrequent fires, with intervals ranging between 10–15 years to over a hundred years.  Mature chaparral (stands that have been allowed greater intervals between fires) is characterized by nearly impenetrable, dense thickets (except the more open chaparral of the desert).  These plants are highly flammable.  They grow as woody shrubs with hard and small leaves; are non-leaf dropping ([[deciduous|non-deciduous]]); and are drought tolerant.  After the first rains following a fire, the landscape is dominated by soft-leaved non-woody annual plants, known as fire followers, which die back with the summer dry period.  

Similar plant communities are found in the four other Mediterranean climate regions around the world, including the [[Mediterranean Basin]] (where it is known as [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]), central [[Chile]] (where it is called [[Chilean Matorral|matorral]]), [[South Africa]]n Cape Region (known there as [[fynbos]]), and in Western and Southern [[Australia]] (as [[kwongan]]).  According to the California Academy of Sciences, Mediterranean shrubland contains more than 20% of the world's plant diversity.<ref name="calacademy.org"/>  The word ''chaparral'' is a [[loanword|loan word]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[Quercus coccifera|chaparro]]'', meaning both "small" and "dwarf" evergreen oak, which itself comes from the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''txapar'', with exactly the same meaning.

[[Conservation International]] and other conservation organizations consider the chaparral to be a [[biodiversity hotspot]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/california_floristic/Pages/default.aspx |title= The Biodiversity Hotspots_Conservation International}}</ref>- a [[biological community]] with a large number of different species - that are under threat by human activity.

==California chaparral==
===California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion===
{{main|California chaparral and woodlands}}
The [[California chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]], of the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[Biome]], has three sub-ecoregions with [[ecosystem]]—[[plant community]] subdivisions:
* [[California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion|California coastal sage and chaparral]]:<br>In coastal [[Southern California]] and northwestern coastal [[Baja California]], as well as all of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] off California and [[Guadalupe Island]] (Mexico).
* [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]]:<br>In [[Southern California|southern]] and [[Central Coast (California)|central]] coast adjacent and inland California regions, including covering some of the mountains of: the [[California Coast Ranges]]; the [[Transverse Ranges]]; and the western slopes of the northern [[Peninsular Ranges]].
* [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]]:<br>In central interior California surrounding the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], covering the foothills and lower slopes of the northeastern Transverse Ranges and the western [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range.

===California cismontane and transmontane chaparral subdivisions===
Another [[phytogeography]] system uses two California chaparral and woodlands subdivisions: the cismontane chaparral; and the transmontane (desert) chaparral.

====California cismontane chaparral====
''Cismontane chaparral'' ("this side of the mountain") refers to a chaparral ecosystem in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[Biome]] in California, growing on the western (and coastal) sides of large mountain range systems, such as: western slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] foothills, western slopes of the [[Peninsular Ranges]] and [[California Coast Ranges]], and south-southwest slopes of the [[Transverse Ranges]] in the Central Coast and Southern California regions.

=====Cismontane chaparral plant species=====
In Central and [[Southern California]] chaparral forms a dominant habitat. Members of the chaparral biota native to California, all of which tend to regrow quickly after fires, include:

* ''[[Adenostoma fasciculatum]]'', Chamise

* ''[[Arctostaphylos]]'' spp.), Manzanita
* ''[[Ceanothus]] spp.'', Ceanothus
* ''[[Cercocarpus]]'' spp., Mountain mahogany

* ''[[Rhus integrifolia]]'', Lemonade berry
* ''[[Rhus ovata]]'', Sugar bush
* ''[[Salvia mellifera]]'', Black sage
* ''[[Xylococcus bicolor]]''), Mission manzanita

=====Cismontane chaparral bird species=====
The complex ecology of chaparral habitats supports a very large number of animal species. the following is a short list of birds which are an integral part of the cismontane chaparral ecosystems. 

:The species essential to the health of the ecosystem include:
* California thrasher (''[[Toxostoma redivivum]]'')
* California towhee (''[[Pipilo crissalis]]'')
* Spotted towhee (''[[Pipilo maculatus]]'')
* Western scrub jay (''[[Aphelocoma californica]]'')

:Very common inhabitant species include:
* Anna's hummingbird (''[[Calypte anna]]'')
* Bushtit (''[[Psaltriparus minimus]]'')
* Costa's hummingbird (''[[Calypte costae]]'')
* Greater roadrunner (''[[Geococcyx californianus]]'')
* Wrentit (''[[Chamaea fasciata]]'')

====California transmontane (desert) chaparral====
'''Transmontane chaparral''' or '''Desert chaparral'''  — ''transmontane'' ("the other side of the mountain") ''chaparral'' — refers to the [[desert]] shrubland [[habitat]] and chaparral [[plant community]] growing in the [[rainshadow]] of these ranges. Transmontane chaparral features xeric [[desert]] climate - not [[Mediterranean climate]] habitats, and is also referred to as [[Desert chaparral]].<ref name="ReferenceA">A Natural History of California, Allan A. Schoenerr, Figure 8.9 - 8.10, Table 8.2</ref><ref name="co.san-diego.ca.us">County of San Diego Department of Planning and Land Use Multiple Species Conservation Program, [http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/dplu/mscp/docs/Biodiversity/handoutvegcomm14.pdf]</ref>  Desert chaparral is a regional [[ecosystem]] subset of the [[Deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[Biome]], with some plant species from the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].  Unlike cismontain chaparral, which forms dense, impenatrable stands of plants, desert chaparral is open, with only about 50% of the ground covered.<ref=NHC p.&nbsp;357/>  Individual shrubs can reach up to {{convert|10|ft|m}} in height.  

Transmontane chaparral or Desert chaparral is found on the eastern slopes of major [[mountain range]] systems on the western sides of the [[deserts of California]]. The mountain systems include: the southeastern [[Transverse Ranges]] (the [[San Bernardino Mountains|San Bernardino]] and [[San Gabriel Mountains]]) in the [[Mojave Desert]] north and northeast of the [[Los Angeles basin]] and Inland Empire; and the northern [[Peninsular Ranges]] (San Jacinto, [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa]], and [[Laguna Mountains]]), which separate the [[Colorado Desert]] (western [[Sonoran Desert]]) from lower coastal [[Southern California]].<ref name=NHC>''A Natural History of California'', Allan A. Schoenherr, pp.8-9, 357, 327, ISBN 978-0-520-06922-0</ref>  It is distinguished from the cismontain [[chapparal]] found on the coastal side of the mountains, which experiences higher winter rainfall. Naturally, desert chaparral experiences less winter rainfall than cismontain chaparral. Plants in this community are characterized by small, hard ([[sclerophyllic]]) evergreen (non-dropping; non-[[deciduous]]) leaves. Desert chaparral grows above California's desert cactus scrub plant community, and below the [[Pinyon-juniper woodland]]. It is further distinguished from the deciduous sub-alpine scrub above the pinyon-juniper woodlands on the same side of the Peninsular ranges.

=====Transmontane chaparral distribution=====
Transmontane—Desert chaparral typically grows on the lower ({{convert|3500|–|4500|ft|m}} elevation) northern slopes of the southern Transverse Ranges (running east to west in [[San Bernardino County|San Bernardino]] and [[Los Angeles County|Los Angeles]] Counties) and on the lower ({{convert|2500|–|3500|ft|m}}) eastern slopes of the Peninsular Ranges (running south to north from lower [[Baja California]] to Riverside and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] Counties and the Transverse Ranges).<ref>''A Natural History of California'', Allan A. Schoenherr, pp.327, Figure 8.9, ISBN 978-0-520-06922-0</ref>  It can also be found in higher elevation [[sky island]]s in the interior of the deserts, such as in the upper [[New York Mountains]] within the [[Mojave National Preserve]] in the Mojave Desert.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The California transmontane (desert) chaparral is found in the rain shadow deserts of the:
* [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] creating the [[Great Basin Desert]] and northern Mojave Desert
* [[Transverse ranges]] creating the western through eastern [[Mojave Desert]]
* [[Peninsular ranges]] creating the [[Colorado Desert]] and [[Yuha Desert]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="co.san-diego.ca.us"/>

=====Transmontane chaparral plants=====
* ''[[Adenostoma fasciculatum]]'', [[Chamise]] (a low shrub common to most chaparral with clusters of tiny needle like leaves or ''fascicles''.) (similar in appearance to coastal ''[[Eriogonum fasciculatum]]'')
* ''[[Agave deserti]]'', Desert agave
* ''[[Arctostaphylos glauca]]'', Bigberry manzanita (smooth red bark with large edible berries, glauca means blue-green, the color of its leaves)
* ''[[Ceanothus greggii]]'', Desert ceanothus, California Lilac (a [[Nitrogen_fixation#Symbiotic_nitrogen_fixing_plants|nitrogen fixer]], has hair on both sides of leaves for heaat dissipation)
* ''[[Cercocarpus ledifolius]]'', Curl leaf mountain mahogany, a [[Nitrogen_fixation#Symbiotic_nitrogen_fixing_plants|nitrogen fixer]] important food source for [[Desert bighorn sheep]]

==Chaparral and wildfires==
The Chaparral is a coastal biome with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The Chaparral area receives about {{convert|38|–|100|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year. This makes the chaparral most vulnerable to fire in the late summer and fall.

The chaparral ecosystem as a whole is adapted to be able to recover from infrequent wildfires (fires occurring a minimum of 15 years apart); indeed, chaparral regions are known culturally and historically for their impressive fires. (This does create a conflict with human development adjacent to and expanding into chaparral systems.) Before a major fire, typical chaparral plant communities are dominated by [[manzanita]], chamise (also called greasewood or ''[[Adenostoma fasciculatum]]'') and ''[[Ceanothus]]'' species, [[Toyon]] (which can sometimes be interspersed with [[California Scrub Oak|scrub oak]]s), and other drought-resistant shrubs with hard ([[sclerophyllous]]) leaves; these plants resprout (see [[resprouter]]) from underground [[burl]]s after a fire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Some chaparral plant communities may grow so dense and tall that it becomes difficult for large animals and humans to penetrate, but may be teeming with smaller fauna in the understory. Many chaparral plant species require some fire cue (heat, smoke, or charred wood, and chemical changes in the soil following fires) for germination. Others, such as annual and herbaceous species like ''[[Phacelia]]'' require fires to allow sunlight to reach them, and are known as [[fire follower]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} During the time shortly after a fire, chaparral communities may contain soft-leaved herbaceuous annual plants that dominate the community for the first few years - until the burl resprouts and seedlings of chaparral perennials create an overstory, blocking the sunlight from other plants in the community. When the overstory regrows, seeds of annuals and smaller plants may lie dormant until the next fire creates the conditions required for germination. Mid-sized plants such as ''Ceonothus'' fix nitrogen, while others cannot, which, together with the need for exposure to the sun, creates a symbiotic relationship of the entire community with infrequent fires.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Because of the hot, dry conditions that exist in the California summer and fall, chaparral is one of the most fire-prone plant communities in North America. Some fires are caused by lightning, but these are usually during periods of high humidity and low winds and are easily controlled. Nearly all of the very large wildfires are caused by human activity during periods of very hot, dry easterly [[Santa Ana winds]]. These man-made fires are commonly caused by power line failures, vehicle fires and collisions, sparks from machinery, arson, or campfires.

===Wildfire debate===
There are two assumptions relating to California chaparral fire regimes that appear to have caused considerable debate, and sometimes confusion and controversy, within the fields of wildfire ecology and land management. 
# That older stands of chaparral become "[[senescent]]" or "[[decadent]]", thus implying that fire is necessary for the plants to remain healthy,<ref>(Hanes 1971)</ref>
# That [[wildfire suppression]] policies have allowed dead chaparral to accumulate unnaturally, creating ample fuel for large fires.<ref>(Minnich 1983)</ref>

The perspective that older chaparral is unhealthy or unproductive may have originated during the 1940s when studies were conducted measuring the amount of forage available to deer populations in chaparral stands.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, according to recent studies, California chaparral is extraordinarily resilient to very long periods without fire <ref>(Keeley, Pfaff, and Safford 2005)</ref> and continues to maintain productive growth throughout pre-fire conditions.<ref>(Hubbard 1986, Larigauderie et al. 1990)</ref> Seeds of many chaparral plants actually require 30 years or more worth of accumulated leaf litter before they will successfully germinate (e.g. scrub oak: ''[[Quercus berberidifolia]]'', toyon: ''[[Heteromeles arbutifolia]]'', and holly-leafed cherry: ''[[Prunus ilicifolia]]''). When intervals between fires drop below 10 to 15 years, many chaparral species are eliminated and the system is typically replaced by non-native, invasive, weedy grassland.<ref>(Haidinger and Keeley 1993, Keeley 1995, Zedler 1995)</ref>

The idea that older chaparral is responsible for causing large fires was originally proposed in the 1980s by comparing wildfires in [[Baja California]] and southern California .{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It was suggested that fire suppression activities in southern California allowed more fuel to accumulate, which in turn led to larger fires {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} (in Baja, fires often burn without active suppression efforts {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}). This is similar to the argument that fire suppression in western United States has allowed [[Ponderosa Pine]] forests to become “overstocked”. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In the past, surface-fires burned through these forests at intervals of anywhere between 4 and 36 years, clearing out the understory and creating a more ecologically balanced system. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, chaparral has a crown-fire regime, meaning that fires consume the entire system whenever they burn. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In one study, a detailed analysis of historical fire data concluded that fire suppression activities have failed to exclude fire from southern California chaparral, as they have in Ponderosa Pine forests.<ref>(Keeley et al. 1999)</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2010}} In addition, the number of fires is increasing in step with population growth. Chaparral stand age does not have a significant correlation to its tendency to burn.<ref>(Moritz et al. 2004)</ref> Low humidity, low fuel moisture, and high winds appear to be the primary factors in determining when, where, and how large a chaparral fire burns. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}{{clarify|date=October 2010}}
