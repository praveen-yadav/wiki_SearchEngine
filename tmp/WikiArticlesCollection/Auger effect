[[Image:Auger Process.svg|thumb|280px| Two views of the Auger process. (a) illustrates sequentially the steps involved in Auger deexcitation. An incident electron (or photon) creates a core hole in the 1s level. An electron from the 2s level fills in the 1s hole and the transition energy is imparted to a 2p electron which is emitted. The final atomic state thus has two holes, one in the 2s orbital and the other in the 2p orbital. (b) illustrates the same process using spectroscopic notation, <math>KL_1L_{2,3}</math>.]]The '''Auger effect''' {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|ʒ|eɪ}} is a physical phenomenon in which the filling of an [[Inner-shell electrons|inner-shell]] vacancy of an [[atom]] is accompanied by the emission of an [[electron]] from the same atom.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger effect|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00520.html}}</ref> When a [[core electron]] is removed, leaving a vacancy, an electron from a higher energy level may fall into the vacancy, resulting in a release of [[energy]]. Although sometimes this energy is released in the form of an emitted [[photon]], the energy can also be transferred to another electron, which is ejected from the atom. This second ejected electron is called an '''Auger electron''',<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Auger electron|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00521.html}}</ref> after one of its discoverers, [[Pierre Victor Auger]].

Upon ejection the [[kinetic energy]] of the Auger electron corresponds to the difference between the energy of the initial [[electronic transition]] and the [[ionization energy]] for the [[electron shell]] from which the Auger electron was ejected. These energy levels depend on the type of atom and the chemical environment in which the atom was located. [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] involves the emission of Auger electrons by bombarding a sample with either [[X-ray]]s or energetic electrons and measures the intensity of Auger electrons as a function of the Auger electron energy. The resulting spectra can be used to determine the identity of the emitting atoms and some information about their environment. [[Carrier generation and recombination#Auger recombination|Auger recombination]] is a similar Auger effect which occurs in [[semiconductor]]s. An electron and [[electron hole]] (electron-hole pair) can recombine giving up their energy to an electron in the conduction band, increasing its energy. The reverse effect is known as [[impact ionization]].

==Discovery==
The Auger emission process was discovered in 1922 by [[Lise Meitner]],<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01326962|author=L. Meitner|title=Über die Entstehung der β-Strahl-Spektren radioaktiver Substanzen|journal=Z. Physik |volume=9|issue=1|year=1922|pages=131–144|bibcode = 1922ZPhy....9..131M }}</ref> an Austrian-Swedish physicist, as a side effect in her competitive search for the nuclear beta electrons with the British physicist [[Charles Drummond Ellis]]. The French physicist [[Pierre Victor Auger]] also discovered it in 1923<ref>P. Auger: [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3130n.image.f187.langFR Sur les rayons β secondaires produits dans un gaz par des rayons X], C.R.A.S. 177 (1923) 169-171.</ref> upon analysis of a Wilson [[cloud chamber]] experiment and it became the central part of his PhD work.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3139/146.110163|title=Pierre Auger – Lise Meitner: Comparative contributions to the Auger effect|year=2009|last1=Duparc|first1=Olivier Hardouin|journal=International Journal of Materials Research (formerly Zeitschrift fuer Metallkunde)|volume=100|issue=09|pages=1162}}</ref> High-energy X-rays were applied to ionize gas particles and observe [[photoelectric]] electrons. Observation of electron tracks independent of the frequency of the incident photon suggested a mechanism for electron ionization that was caused from an [[internal conversion]] of energy from a radiationless transition. Further investigation and theoretical work showed that the effect was a radiationless effect more than an internal conversion effect by use of elementary quantum mechanics and transition rate and transition probability calculations.<ref>"The Auger Effect and Other Radiationless Transitions".
