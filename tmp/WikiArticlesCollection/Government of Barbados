The '''Government of Barbados''' (GoB), is made up structurally of [[Monarchy of Barbados|The Monarch]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as Head of State.<ref>Constitution of Barbados: EXECUTIVE POWER (Chapter 6), Section 63. Section 63 of the Constitution says that the executive authority of Barbados shall be vested in Her Majesty the Queen"</ref> She is represented by her representative the [[Governor General of Barbados|Governor-General]], Sir [[Elliott Belgrave]], G.C.M.G., K.A.,<ref>[https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/TheQueenandBarbados/TheQueensroleinBarbados.aspx The Queen's role in Barbados], Royal.gov.uk</ref> The country has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a mature social democratic party system, based on universal adult suffrage and total purity in elections. The [[Senate (Barbados)|Senate]] has 21 members, all appointed by the Governor-General on behalf of the Monarch, 12 on the advice of the Prime Minister, two on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, and seven in the Governor-General’s sole discretion. The [[House of Assembly (Barbados)|House of Assembly]] has 30 members, all elected.   Both Houses debate all legislation.  However, the House of Assembly may ultimately override Senate's rejection of money Bills and other Bills except Bills amending the Constitution.
Officers of each House (President and Deputy President of the Senate and Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the Assembly) are elected from the Members of the respective Houses. 

In keeping with the evolution of the [[Westminster system]] of governance, Barbados has evolved into a leading independent [[Parliamentary democracy]] and [[Constitutional monarchy]], meaning that all [[Political power|real power]] rests with the Parliament, but the country maintains aspects of a historic Monarchy/Kingdom government also, which allows [[Monarchy of Barbados#stability|stability]].  Executive authority is vested in the Monarch who grants all functioning of the government to both the Prime Minister and Cabinet who are collectively responsible to Parliament.<ref>[https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/TheQueenandBarbados/Overview.aspx The Queen and the Commonwealth] , Royal.gov.uk</ref> Barbadian law is rooted historically on [[English law|English common law]], and the [[Constitution of Barbados]] implemented in 1966, is supreme [[law of the land]].

Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the individual are set out in the Constitution and are protected by a strict legal code.

The [[Cabinet (Barbados)|Cabinet]] is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Barbados|Prime Minister]] who must be an elected MP and other Ministers are appointed from either chamber by the Governor-General as advised by the Prime Minister. 

The Governor-General appoints as Leader of the Opposition the Member of House of Assembly who commands the support of the largest number of Members of that House in opposition to the ruling party's government. 

The maximum duration of a Parliament is five years from the first sitting. There is a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses of Parliament by the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. 

There is an established non-political public service. Also, there are separate constitutional commissions for: the Judicial and Legal Service, the Public Service, and the Police Service.

==History==
[[File:Simplification of govt structure of Barbados.gif|thumb|right|300px|A simplified diagram of the Barbados government]]
The government has been chosen by elections since [[Barbadian general election, 1961|1961 elections]], when Barbados achieved full [[Self-governing colony|self-governance]].  Before then, the government was a [[Crown colony]] consisting of either colonial administration solely (such as the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]]), or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially elected assembly, such as the [[Legislative Council of Barbados|Legislative Council]].   Since Independence, the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) governed from 1976 to 1986, and from September 1994 – 2008. The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) held office 1966 to 1976, from 1986 to 1994, and has formed the Government January 2008 to present.

== Executive branch ==
The Prime Minister and Cabinet is formed by the [[political party]] which gains a simple majority in the [[Elections in Barbados|general election]]s held in [[Barbados]].  These elections constitutionally must be held no longer than every five years apart, however elections can be called whenever the Government so chooses to seek a new mandate or loses a vote of [[no confidence]] in [[Parliament of Barbados|Parliament]].  It is part of [[Politics of Barbados|Barbados' political system]] and supported by the [[Barbadian Public Service|Public service]].
