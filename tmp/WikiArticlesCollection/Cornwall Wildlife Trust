The '''Cornwall Wildlife Trust''' is a charitable organisation founded in 1962 that is concerned solely with [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. 

It deals with the conservation and preservation of Cornwall's wildlife and habitats managing over 50 nature reserves covering approximately {{convert|4300|acre|km2}}, amongst them [[Looe Island]]. 

Cornwall Wildlife Trust is part of [[The Wildlife Trusts partnership]] of 47 wildlife trusts in the [[United Kingdom]]. It works in conjunction with the [[Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust]], and jointly produces a thrice yearly magazine called ''Wild Cornwall & Wild Scilly''

The direction and work that the Trust currently does is guided by the Cornwall [[Biodiversity]] action plan. Living Seas and Living Landscapes are two such projects. The Trust  runs ERCCIS (Environmental Records Centre for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly), a county wide database of sightings of animals and plants. It also gives [[Land use planning|planning]] advice (CEC - Cornwall Environmental Consultants) to land developers.

The Trust is based at [[Allet]] near [[Truro]] in [[Cornwall]]. The headquarters and offices are adjacent to the Trust's '''Five Acres''' nature reserve. This reserve includes two ponds, as well as mixed broadleaved woodland.
