'''AbiWord''' is a [[free and open source software]] [[word processor]] written in [[C++]] with the help of [[gtkmm]]. Since version 3 it is based on GTK+ 3. The name "AbiWord" (pronounced [æbiː], like the name, "Abby" + [wərd]) is derived from the root of the Spanish word "''[[wikt:en:abierto#Spanish|abierto]]''", meaning "open".<ref name="abi">Project Mascot [http://www.abisource.com/~abi/ Abi the Ant].  Page explains Abi is pronounced just like "Abby"</ref>

Abiword was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite but was adopted by open source developers after SourceGear changed its business focus and ceased development. It now runs on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[ReactOS]], Solaris, [[AmigaOS]] 4.0 (through its [[Cygnix]] [[X11]] engine), [[MeeGo]] (on the [[Nokia N9]] smartphone), [[QNX]] and other [[operating system]]s.

The [[Mac OS X]] port has remained on version 2.4 since 2005,<ref>{{Citation

</ref> although the current version does run non-natively on Mac OS X through [[X11.app]].

AbiWord is part of the [[AbiSource]] project which develops a number of [[office suite|office-related]] technologies.<ref name="abisource">{{cite web

The software is available on [[Android OS|Android]] devices as part of the ''Ubuntu noroot'' package from the Google [[Play Store]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cuntubuntu |title=Ubuntu noroot on Google Play |publisher=Google Play |date=2012-09-22 |accessdate=2012-12-24}}</ref>
==Features==
AbiWord supports both basic word processing features such as lists, indents and character formats, and more sophisticated features including tables, styles, page headers and footers, [[footnotes]], templates, multiple views, page columns, [[spell check]]ing, and [[grammar check]]ing.<ref name="grammar-check">{{cite web

}}</ref> Starting with version 2.8.0, AbiWord includes a [[collaborative software|collaboration]] plugin that allows integration with AbiCollab.net, a Web-based service that permits multiple users to work on the same document [[Collaborative real-time editor|in real time]], in full synchronization.  The Presentation view of AbiWord, which permits easy display of presentations created in AbiWord on "screen-sized" pages, is another feature not often found in word processors.

===Interface===
AbiWord generally works similarly to classic versions (pre-Office 2007) of [[Microsoft Word]], as direct ease of migration was a high priority early goal.  While many interface similarities remain, cloning the Word interface is not a top priority.  The interface is intended to follow user interface guidelines for each respective platform.

===File formats===
AbiWord comes with several import and export filters providing a partial support for such formats as [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Word]] (.doc), [[Office Open XML]] (.docx),<ref>{{cite web

[[LaTeX]] is supported for export only. Plug-in filters are available to deal with many other formats, notably [[WordPerfect]] documents. The native [[file format]], .abw, uses [[XML]], so as to mitigate [[vendor lock-in]] concerns with respect to interoperability and [[digital archiving]].

===Grammar checking===
The AbiWord project includes a US English-only grammar checking plugin using [[Link Grammar]]. AbiWord had grammar checking before any other open source word processor, although a grammar checker was later added to [[OpenOffice.org]].<ref name="grammar-check" /> Link Grammar is both a theory of syntax and an open source parser which is now{{When|date=May 2010}} developed by the AbiWord project.
