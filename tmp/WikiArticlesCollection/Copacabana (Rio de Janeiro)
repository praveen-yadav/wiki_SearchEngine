'''Copacabana''' (<small>local and standard </small>{{IPA-pt|kɔpakɐˈbɐ̃nɐ}} or {{IPA-pt|kɔpɐkaˈbɐ̃nɐ|}}, rarely {{IPA-pt|kɔpakaˈbɐ̃nɐ|}} and {{IPA-pt|kopɐkaˈbɐ̃nɐ|}} in other [[Portuguese dialects|Brazilian dialects]]) is a ''[[bairro]]'' (neighbourhood) located in the [[Rio de Janeiro#South Zone|South Zone]] of the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It is known for its 4&nbsp;km [[balneario]] beach, which is one of the most famous in the world.<ref>http://www.photos4travel.com/destination-ideas/top-10-most-popular-beaches-in-the-world</ref>

== History ==
The district was originally called ''Sacopenapã'' (translated from the [[Tupi language]], it means "the way of the socós (a kind of bird)") until the mid-18th century. It was renamed after the construction of a chapel holding a replica of the [[Virgen de Copacabana]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Bolivia]].
<ref>http://www.infoescola.com/geografia/copacabana/</ref>

== Characteristics ==
Copacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis ([[lifeguard]] watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches: one, inside [[Fort Copacabana]] and other, right after it: Diabo ("Devil") Beach. [[Arpoador]] beach, where surfers used to go after its perfect waves, comes in the sequence, followed by the famous borough of [[Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro|Ipanema]]. The area will be one of the four "Olympic Zones" during the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.<ref>[http://www.rio.rj.gov.br/riotur/en/hotel/?Canal=184 Riotur]</ref>

== Copacabana Beach ==
Copacabana beach stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). [[Leme, Rio de Janeiro|Leme]] is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; ''Fort Copacabana'', built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and Fort Duque de Caxias, built in 1779, at the north end. One curiosity is that the lifeguard watchtower of Posto Seis never existed.<ref>[http://www.funceb.org.br/espacocultural.html FUNCEB - Fundação Cultural Exército Brasileiro]</ref>

Hotels, restaurants, bars, night clubs and residential buildings dot the [[promenade]].

Copacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations and, in most years, has been the official venue of the [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]].

This beach is also the venue where Usain Bolt will attempt to beat the 150m world record.

==Copacabana promenade==
The Copacabana promenade is a pavement landscape in large scale (4 kilometres long). It was completed in 1970 and has used a black and white [[Portuguese pavement]] design since its origin in the 1930s: a geometric wave. The Copacabana promenade was designed by [[Roberto Burle Marx]]

==Living standard==
Copacabana has the 11th highest [[Human Development Index]] in Rio, the 2000 census put the [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of Copacabana at 0.902.<ref>[http://www.copacabana.com/copafato.shtml Compilação de dados, informações e fatos sobre Copacabana - Copacabana.COM]</ref>

==The neighbourhood==
According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], 160,000 people live in Copacabana and 44,000 or 27.5% of them are 60 years old or older.<ref>[http://spl.camara.rj.gov.br/spl/spl_docdown; jsessionid=D87126B13F258E820EA8A71A891194B3?id=8449 SPL.camera.rj.gov.br]</ref><ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/vejarj/070606/comportamento.html Veja Rio on-line]</ref> Copacabana covers an area of 7.84&nbsp;km²{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} which gives the borough a [[population density]] of 20,400 people per km².

Residential buildings eleven to thirteen stories high built right next to each other dominate the borough. Houses and two-story buildings are rare.

==Transportation==
More than 40 different bus routes serve Copacabana,<ref>[http://www.rioonibus.com/guia_de_itinerarios/consultas/consulta-todos-numeros.asp Rio Ônibus]</ref> as do three subway [[Rio de Janeiro Metro|Metro]] stations: Cantagalo, Siqueira Campos and Cardeal Arcoverde.

Three major arteries parallel to each other cut across the entire borough: [[Avenida Atlântica|Atlantic Avenue]], which is a 6-lane, 4&nbsp;km avenue by the beachside, [[Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana|Nossa Senhora de Copacabana Avenue]] and [[Rua Barata Ribeiro|Barata Ribeiro]]/[[Rua Raul Pompéia|Raul Pompéia Street]] both of which are 4 lanes and 3.5&nbsp;km in length. Barata Ribeiro Street changes its name to Raul Pompéia Street after the Sá Freire Alvim [[Tunnel]]. Twenty-four streets intersect all three major arteries, and seven other streets intersect some of the three, but not all.

==Notable events==
*On 26 April 1949, {{RMS|Magdalena|1948|6}} broke in two as she was being towed into Rio de Janeiro harbour. Much of her cargo of [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] was washed up upon the beach.

*On December 31, 1994, the New Year's Eve celebrations featured a [[Rod Stewart]] concert with an attendance of 3.5 million, making it the largest concert crowd ever.<ref>{{cite web

On March 21, 2005, [[Lenny Kravitz]] performed there in front of 300,000 people, on a Monday night. On February 18, 2006, a Saturday, [[The Rolling Stones]] surpassed that mark by far, attracting over 1.5 million people to the beach.

*On July 7, 2007, the beach hosted the [[Live Earth concert, Rio de Janeiro|Brazilian leg]] of the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth concerts]], which attracted 400,000 people. As the headliner, [[Lenny Kravitz]] got to play the venue a second time, with [[Jorge Benjor]], [[Macy Gray]], [[O Rappa]] and [[Pharrell]] as the main opening acts, on October 2, 2009, 100,000 people filled the beach for a huge beach party as the IOC announced Rio would be hosting the 2016 Olympics. 11 of the 15 [[FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup]]s have taken place here.
* On July 28, 2013, the beach hosted the final event of the [[World Youth Day 2013]]. About 3 million people including 3 presidents joined [[Pope Francis]] when he celebrated the holy mass. This was one of the largest religious gatherings in history.<ref>[[Pope to Mass of millions]]</ref>
