==Natural background radiation==
[[Image:Natural Radiation Atlas of Europe.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Average annual dosage from natural radiation varies by several mSv between different European countries.<ref name=EuropeRadAtlas>{{cite web|url=http://funk.on.br/esantos/doutorado/ARTIGOS%20AEROGAMA/papers%20sem%20catalogar/491.pdf|title=Natural Radiation Atlas of Europe|publisher=National Radiological Protection Board (U.K.) for the Commission of the European Communities (1992)}}</ref>]]

Radioactive material is found throughout nature. Detectable amounts occur naturally in [[soil]], rocks, water, air, and vegetation, from which it is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this ''internal exposure'', humans also receive ''external exposure'' from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural [[effective radiation dose|dose]] to humans is about 2.4 [[millisievert]] (mSv) per year.<ref name=UNSCEAR2008 /> This is four times more than the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in the year 2008 amounted to about 0.6&nbsp;mSv per year. In some rich countries like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to [[medical imaging]]. In Europe, average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2&nbsp;mSv annually in the United Kingdom to more than 7&nbsp;mSv annually in Finland.<ref name="EuropeRadAtlas"/>

===Air===
The biggest source of natural background radiation is airborne [[radon]], a radioactive gas that emanates from the ground. Radon and its [[isotope]]s, parent [[radionuclide]]s, and [[decay product]]s all contribute to an average inhaled dose of 1.26&nbsp;mSv/a. Radon is unevenly distributed and varies with weather, such that much higher doses apply to many areas of the world, where it represents a [[Health effects of radon|significant health hazard]]. Concentrations over 500 times higher than the world average have been found inside buildings in Scandinavia, the United States, Iran, and the Czech Republic.<ref name="UNSCEAR2006E">>{{cite book|author=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|title=Effects of Ionizing Radiation |year=2006 (published 2008)|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|isbn=978-92-1-142263-4|volume=II|chapter=Annex E: Sources-to-effects assessment for radon in homes and workplaces|url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2006/09-81160_Report_Annex_E_2006_Web.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> Radon is a decay product of uranium, which is relatively common in the Earth's crust, but more concentrated in ore-bearing rocks scattered around the world. Radon seeps out of these [[ores]] into the atmosphere or into ground water or infiltrates into buildings. It can be inhaled into the lungs, along with its [[decay product]]s, where they will reside for a period of time after exposure.

Although radon is naturally occurring, exposure can be enhanced or diminished by human activity, notably house construction. A poorly sealed basement in an otherwise well insulated house can result in the accumulation of radon within the dwelling, exposing its residents to high concentrations. The widespread construction of well insulated and sealed homes in the northern industrialized world has led to radon becoming the primary source of background radiation in some localities in northern North America and Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Since it is heavier than air, radon tends to collect in basements and mines. Basement sealing and suction ventilation reduce exposure. Some building materials, for example [[lightweight concrete]] with [[alum shale]], [[phosphogypsum]] and Italian [[tuff]], may emanate radon if they contain [[radium]] and are porous to gas.<ref name=UNSCEAR2006E />

Radiation exposure from radon is indirect. Radon has a short half-life (4 days) and decays into other solid particulate [[Decay chain#Radium series|radium-series]] radioactive nuclides. These radioactive particles are inhaled and remain lodged in the lungs, causing continued exposure. Radon is thus the second leading cause of [[lung cancer]] after [[tobacco smoking|smoking]], and accounts for 15,000 to 22,000 cancer deaths per year in the US alone.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/radon Radon and Cancer: Questions and Answers - National Cancer Institute (USA)]</ref>{{better source|date=December 2012}}<!--Radon may also dissolve in groundwater and be ingested, producing a dose to the stomach and the foetus. But this section is about air, inhalation only--> 

About 100,000&nbsp;Bq/m<sup>3</sup> of radon was found in [[Health effects of radon#Accumulation in dwellings|Stanley Watras's]] basement in 1984.<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://wpb-radon.com/Radon_research_papers/1995%20Nashville,%20TN/1995_14_Indoor%20Radon%20Concentration%20Data--Geographic%20and%20Geologic%20Distribution,%20Captial%20District,%20NY.pdf |title=Indoor Radon Concentration Data: Its Geographic and Geologic Distribution, an Example from the Capital District, NY |first1=John J. |last1=Thomas |first2=Barbara R. |last2=Thomas |first3=Helen M. |last3=Overeynder |date=September 27–30, 1995 |year=1995 |conference=International Radon Symposium |conferenceurl=http://internationalradonsymposium.org/ |publisher=American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists |location=Nashville, TN |accessdate=2012-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Upfal |first1=Mark J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Christine |title=Occupational, industrial, and environmental toxicology|year=2003|publisher=Mosby|location=St Louis, Missouri|isbn=9780323013406|url=http://toxicology.ws/Greenberg/Chapter%2065%20-%20Residential%20Radon.pdf|edition=2nd|chapter=65 Residential Radon|editor1-first=Michael I. |editor1-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Richard J. |editor2-last=Hamilton |editor3-first=Scott D. |editor3-last=Phillips |editor4-first=Gayla J. |editor4-last=McCluskey|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> He and his neighbours in [[Boyertown, Pennsylvania]], United States may hold the record for the most radioactive dwellings in the world.

===Cosmic radiation===
{{main|Cosmic ray}}
[[Image:Sievert-sigle.png|thumb|Estimate of the maximum dose of radiation received at an altitude of 12 km January 20, 2005, following a violent solar flare. The doses are expressed in microsieverts per hour.]]
The Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from [[proton]]s to [[iron]] and larger [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] derived sources outside our [[solar system]]. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an [[air shower (physics)|air shower]] of secondary radiation, including [[X-ray]]s, [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, and [[neutron]]s. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies in different parts of the world based largely on the [[geomagnetic field]] and altitude. This radiation is much more intense in the upper [[troposphere]], around 10&nbsp;km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for [[airline]] crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2&nbsp;mSv (220 mrem) per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radiation Exposure During Commercial Airline Flights|accessdate=2011-03-17|url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html}}</ref>

Similarly, cosmic rays cause higher background exposure in [[astronaut]]s than in humans on the surface of Earth. Astronauts in low [[orbit]]s, such as in the [[International Space Station]] or the [[Space Shuttle]], are partially shielded by the [[magnetic field]] of the Earth, but also suffer from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] which accumulates cosmic rays and results from the earths magnetic field. Outside low Earth orbit, as experienced by the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts who traveled to the [[Moon]], this background radiation is much more intense, and represents a considerable obstacle to potential future long term human exploration of the [[Manned mission to the moon|moon]] or [[Manned mission to Mars|Mars]].

Cosmic rays also cause [[Nuclear transmutation|elemental transmutation]] in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation generated by the cosmic rays combines with [[atomic nuclei]] in the atmosphere to generate different  [[nuclides]]. Many so-called [[cosmogenic nuclides]] can be produced, but probably the most notable is [[carbon-14]], which is produced by interactions with [[nitrogen]] atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and can be incorporated into living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short [[half-life]] of carbon-14 are the principles used in [[radiocarbon dating]] of ancient biological materials such as wooden artifacts or human remains.

===Terrestrial sources===
'''Terrestrial radiation''', for the purpose of the table above, only includes sources that remain external to the body. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern are [[potassium]], [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] and their decay products, some of which, like [[radium]] and [[radon]] are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to [[radioactive decay]] since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from [[uranium-238]] is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] year half-life, and [[potassium]]-40 (half-life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is minimal however. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half-life of a billion years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.

In addition, many shorter half-life and thus more intensely radioactive isotopes have not decayed out of the terrestrial environment, however, because of natural on-going production of them. Examples of these are [[radium]]-226 (decay product of uranium-238) and radon-222 (a decay product of [[radium]]-226).

===Food and water===
Some of the essential elements that make up the human body, mainly potassium and carbon, have radioactive isotopes that add significantly to our background radiation dose.  An average human contains about 30 milligrams of [[potassium-40]] (<sup>40</sup>K) and about 10 nanograms (10<sup>−8</sup>&nbsp;g) of [[carbon-14]] (<sup>14</sup>C) {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}, which has a decay half-life of 5,730 years. Excluding internal contamination by external radioactive material, the largest component of internal radiation exposure from biologically functional components of the human body is from potassium-40. The decay of about 4,000 nuclei of <sup>40</sup>K per second<ref>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/QuantumRelativity/RadioactiveHumanBody/RadioactiveHumanBody.html Radioactive human body&nbsp;— Harvard University Natural Science Lecture Demonstrations]{{Self-published inline|date=April 2011}}</ref> makes potassium the largest source of radiation in terms of number of decaying atoms. The energy of [[beta particle]]s produced by <sup>40</sup>K is also about 10 times more powerful than the beta particles from <sup>14</sup>C decay.
<sup>14</sup>C is present in the human body at a level of 3700 Bq with a [[biological half-life]] of 40 days.<ref>http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/carbon14.pdf</ref> There are about 1,200 beta particles per second produced by the decay of <sup>14</sup>C. However, a <sup>14</sup>C atom is in the genetic information of about half the cells, while potassium is not a component of [[DNA]]. The decay of a <sup>14</sup>C atom inside  DNA in one person happens about 50 times per second, changing a carbon atom to one of [[nitrogen]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Only A Trillion |origyear=1957 |edition=Revised and updated |year=1976 |publisher=ACE books |location=New York |pages=37–39 |chapter=The Explosions Within Us |isbn=1-157-09468-6 }}</ref> The global average internal dose from radionuclides other than radon and its decay products is 0.29&nbsp;mSv/a, of which 0.17&nbsp;mSv/a comes from <sup>40</sup>K, 0.12&nbsp;mSv/a comes from the uranium and thorium series, and 12&nbsp;μSv/a comes from <sup>14</sup>C.<ref name=UNSCEAR2008 />

The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], primarily due to the use of local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material. The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external [[effective radiation dose]] of 6&nbsp;mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times more than the [[ICRP]] recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources.<ref name=HNBR2009 /> They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131&nbsp;mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal [[committed dose]] from [[radon]] was 72&nbsp;mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr).<ref name=HNBR2009>{{cite journal|last=Hendry|first=Jolyon H|coauthors=Simon, Steven L; Wojcik, Andrzej; Sohrabi, Mehdi; Burkart, Werner; Cardis, Elisabeth; Laurier, Dominique; Tirmarche, Margot; Hayata, Isamu|title=Human exposure to high natural background radiation: what can it teach us about radiation risks?|journal=Journal of Radiological Protection|date=1 June 2009|volume=29|issue=2A|pages=A29–A42|doi=10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S03|pmid=19454802|url=http://cricket.biol.sc.edu/papers/natural/Hendry%20et%20al%202009.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2012|bibcode = 2009JRP....29...29H }}</ref>  This unique case is over 80 times higher than the world average natural human exposure to radiation.

Epidemiological studies are underway to identify health effects associated with the high radiation levels in Ramsar. It is much too early to draw statistically significant conclusions.<ref name=HNBR2009 /> While so far support for beneficial effects of chronic radiation (like longer lifespan) has not been observed, a protective and adaptive effect is suggested by at least one study whose authors nonetheless caution that data from Ramsar are not yet sufficiently strong to relax existing regulatory dose limits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ghiassi-nejad|first=M|coauthors=Mortazavi, SM; Cameron, JR; Niroomand-rad, A; Karam, PA|title=Very high background radiation areas of Ramsar, Iran: preliminary biological studies|journal=Health physics|date=2002 Jan|volume=82|issue=1|pmid=11769138|url=http://www.probeinternational.org/Ramsar.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2012|quote=Our preliminary studies seem to indicate the presence of adaptive response in the cells of some Ramsar residents, but we do not claim to have seen hormetic effects in any of those studied.

However, the available data do not seem sufficient to cause national or international advisory bodies to change their current conservative radiation protection recommendations;|pages=87–93 [92]}}</ref>

===Photoelectric===
Background radiation doses in the immediate vicinities of particles of high atomic number materials, within the human body, have a small enhancement due to the [[photoelectric effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |pages=603–11 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0300 |title=Enhancement of natural background gamma-radiation dose around uranium microparticles in the human body |year=2009 |last1=Pattison |first1=J.

==Artificial background radiation==

===Medical===
The global average human exposure to artificial radiation is 0.6&nbsp;mSv/a, primarily from [[medical imaging]]. This medical component can range much higher, with an average of 3&nbsp;mSv per year across the USA population.<ref name=NCRP106 /> Other human contributors include smoking, air travel, radioactive building materials, historical nuclear weapons testing, nuclear power accidents and nuclear industry operation.

A typical chest x-ray delivers 0.02&nbsp;mSv (2 mrem) of effective dose.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wall|first=B.F.|coauthors=and Hart, D.|title=Revised Radiation Doses for Typical X-Ray Examinations|journal=The British Journal of Radiology|year=1997|volume=70|pages=437–439|url=http://bjr.birjournals.org/content/70/833/437.full.pdf|accessdate=18 May 2012|pmid=9227222|issue=833}} (5,000 patient dose measurements from 375 hospitals)</ref> A dental x-ray delivers a dose of 5 to 10 µSv<ref>{{cite book|last=Hart|first=D.|title=Radiation Exposure of the UK Population from  Medical and Dental X-ray Examinations|year=2002|publisher=National Radiological Protection Board|isbn=0859514684|url=http://medicalphysicist.co.uk/nrpb_w4.pdf|coauthors=and Wall, B.F.|accessdate=18 May 2012|page=9}}</ref> The average American receives about 3&nbsp;mSv of diagnostic medical dose per year; countries with the lowest levels of health care receive almost none. Radiation treatment for various diseases also accounts for some dose, both in individuals and in those around them.

===Consumer items===
Cigarettes contain polonium-210, originating from the decay products of radon, which stick to tobacco leaves. Heavy smoking results in a radiation dose of 160 mSv/year to localized spots at the bifurcations of segmental bronchi in the lungs from the decay of polonium-210. This dose is not readily comparable to the radiation protection limits, since the latter deal with whole body doses, while the dose from smoking is delivered to a very small portion of the body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q3137.html|title=Doses from cigarette smoking|author=Dade W. Moeller|work=Health Physics Society|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>

Air travel causes increased exposure to cosmic radiation. The average extra dose to flight personnel is 2.19 mSv/year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html|title=Radiation exposure during commercial airline flights|author=Health Physics Society|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>

===Atmospheric nuclear testing===
[[Image:US fallout exposure.png|right|thumb|Per capita [[thyroid]] doses in the continental United States resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]] from 1951-1962.]]
Frequent above-ground nuclear explosions between the 1940s and 1960s scattered a substantial amount of [[radioactive contamination]]. Some of this contamination is local, rendering the immediate surroundings highly radioactive, while some of it is carried longer distances as [[nuclear fallout]]; some of this material is dispersed worldwide. The increase in background radiation due to these tests peaked in 1963 at about 0.15&nbsp;mSv per year worldwide, or about 7% of average background dose from all sources. The [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 prohibited above-ground tests, thus by the year 2000 the worldwide dose from these tests has decreased to only 0.005&nbsp;mSv per year.<ref name = "rrjhjx">[http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications.html United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]{{failed verification|need a more specific citation that supports this statement|date=April 2011}}</ref>

===Occupational exposure===
The [[ICRP]] recommends limiting [[occupational radiation exposure]] to 50&nbsp;mSv (5 rem) per year, and 100&nbsp;mSv (10 rem) in 5 years.<ref name="ICRP103">{{cite journal|title=The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection|journal=Annals of the ICRP|year=2007|volume=37|series=ICRP publication 103|issue=2–4|url=http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103|accessdate=17 May 2012|isbn=978-0-7020-3048-2}}</ref>

At an [[IAEA]] conference in 2002, it was recommended that occupational doses below 1–2 mSv per year do not warrant regulatory scrutiny.<ref>http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1145_web.pdf</ref>

Under normal circumstances, nuclear reactors release small amounts of radioactive gases, which cause negligibly-small radiation exposures to the public. Events classified on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]] as incidents typically do not release any additional radioactive substances into the environment. Large releases of radioactivity from nuclear reactors are extremely rare. Until the present day, there were two major '''civilian''' accidents - the [[Chernobyl accident]] and the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] - which caused substantial contamination. The Chernobyl accident was the only one to cause immediate deaths.

Total doses from the Chernobyl accident ranged from 10 to 50 mSv over 20 years for the inhabitants of the affected areas, with most of the dose received in the first years after the disaster, and over 100 mSv for [[Liquidator (Chernobyl)|liquidators]]. There were 28 deaths from [[acute radiation syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/backgrounder/en/index.html|author=World Health Organization|title=Health effects of the Chernobyl accident: an overview|date=2006-04|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>

Total doses from the Fukushima I accidents were between 1 and 15 mSv for the inhabitants of the affected areas. Thyroid doses for children were below 50 mSv. 167 cleanup workers received doses above 100 mSv, with 6 of them receiving more than 250 mSv (the Japanese exposure limit for emergency response workers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/fukushima-s-doses-tallied-1.10686|title=Fukushima’s doses tallied|author=Geoff Brumfiel|date=2012-05-23|publisher=Nature|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>

The average dose from the [[Three Mile Island accident]] was 0.01 mSv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html|title=Backgrounder on the Three Mile Island Accident|author=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=2009-08|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>

'''Non-civilian''': In addition to the civilian accidents described above, several accidents at early nuclear weapons facilities - such as the [[Windscale fire]], the contamination of the [[Techa River]] by the nuclear waste from the [[Mayak]] compound, and the [[Kyshtym disaster]] at the same compound - released substantial radioactivity into the environment. The Windscale fire resulted in thyroid doses of 5-20 mSv for adults and 10-60 mSv for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://karws.gso.uri.edu/Marsh/Newsgroups/Wscal-is.htm|title=Radiological Consequences of the 1957 Windscale Fire|date=1997-10-10|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref> The doses from the accidents at Mayak are unknown.

===Nuclear fuel cycle===
The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and other U.S. and international agencies, require that licensees limit radiation exposure to individual members of the public to 1&nbsp;[[sievert|mSv]] (100 m[[roentgen equivalent man|rem]]) per year.

===Other===
Coal plants emit radiation in the form of radioactive [[fly ash]] which is inhaled and ingested by neighbours, and incorporated into crops. A 1978 paper from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] estimated that coal-fired power plants of that time may contribute a whole-body committed dose of 19&nbsp;µSv/a to their immediate neighbours in a radius of 500 m.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McBride |first1=J.

==Other usage==
In other contexts, '''background radiation''' may simply be any radiation that is pervasive, whether ionizing or not. A particular example of this is the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], a nearly uniform glow that fills the sky in the microwave part of the spectrum; stars, galaxies and other objects of interest in [[radio astronomy]] stand out against this background.

In a laboratory, '''background radiation''' refers to the measured value from any sources that affect an instrument when a radiation source sample is not being measured. This background rate, which must be established as a stable value by multiple measurements, usually before and after sample measurement, is subtracted from the rate measured when the sample is being measured.

'''Background radiation''' for occupational doses measured for workers is all radiation dose that is not measured by radiation dose measurement instruments in potential occupational exposure conditions. This includes both "natural background radiation" and any medical radiation doses. This value is not typically measured or known from surveys, such that variations in the total dose to individual workers is not known. This can be a significant confounding factor in assessing radiation exposure effects in a population of workers who may have significantly different natural background and medical radiation doses. This is most significant when the occupational doses are very low.
