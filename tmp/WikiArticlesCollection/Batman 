'''''Batman & Robin''''' is a 1997 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. The film was directed by [[Joel Schumacher]], written by [[Akiva Goldsman]], and stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[George Clooney]], [[Chris O'Donnell]], [[Uma Thurman]], and [[Alicia Silverstone]]. It was distributed by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The fourth and final film in the ''[[Batman (film series)|Batman]]'' film series, the film tells the story of Batman and Robin as they attempt to prevent [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] from covering [[Gotham City]] with ice and vegetation while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together.

Development for ''Batman & Robin'' began following the box office success of the previous film, ''[[Batman Forever]]''. Warner Bros. commissioned the film for a June 1997 release. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the film's plotline during [[pre-production]] on ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time to Kill]]''. [[Principal photography]] began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the [[shooting schedule]].

''Batman & Robin'' is often listed as one of the [[worst movies ever made]]. It was released on June 20, 1997 to negative reviews. Observers criticized the film for its [[toyetic]] and [[Camp (style)|camp]] approach, as well as [[Homosexuality in the Batman franchise|homosexual innuendo]] added by Schumacher. ''Batman & Robin'' received 11 nominations at the [[18th Golden Raspberry Awards|1997 ceremony]] of the [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]]s, including one for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]]. After this, Warner Bros. canceled the unproduced ''[[Batman Triumphant]]'', and the film series was eventually [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed with ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005) by director [[Christopher Nolan]]. The song made for the film, "[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]" by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[40th Grammy Awards]]. However, it was also nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song]].

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
In [[Gotham City]], [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] attempt to stop a new villain called [[Mr. Freeze]]  from stealing a cache of diamonds. The supervillain freezes Robin and flees, warning Batman he has 11 minutes to thaw Robin. They learn that Freeze was scientist Dr. Victor Fries, who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]], who was suffering from a [[terminal illness]] called MacGregor's Syndrome.
	
Meanwhile, in South America, botanist Dr. Pamela Isley is working under [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]], a mad scientist who recently had his funding cut by [[Wayne Enterprises]] and is experimenting with the strength serum "[[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]]". Pamela discovers Woodrue subjecting a diminutive convict to the experiment, transforming him into the muscular [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. Woodrue and Pamela argue over the use of the drug and, when she refuses to join him, Woodrue overturns a shelf of various toxins onto her. She transforms into the seductive [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] before killing Woodrue with a kiss from her poisonous lips. She leaves with Bane for Gotham, intending to use the chemicals produced by Wayne Enterprises for her schemes.

Back in Gotham, Barbara Wilson, the niece of Bruce Wayne's butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]], makes a surprise visit and is invited to stay at [[Wayne Manor]] until she returns to college. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome. Poison Ivy interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference at the Gotham Observatory unveiling a new telescope, to propose a project that would turn Gotham City into a lush [[rainforest]], but Bruce turns down the offer. Later, a charity event is held by Wayne Enterprises with special guests Batman and Robin in attendance. Ivy seduces them as well as several other men with her [[pheromone]] powder she blows at victims, until Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at [[Arkham Asylum]], but flees with the help of Ivy and Bane after dealing with the guards who are guarding Freeze.

Ivy shuts off Nora's life support, and tells Freeze that Batman did it to convince Freeze into destroying Gotham. Meanwhile, Robin becomes smitten with Ivy and begins to rebel against Batman at Freeze's hideout. Ivy imprisons Robin when he does not give in to her charms and subdues Batman when he confronts her. Barbara — now a costumed crime-fighter calling herself [[Batgirl]] — arrives and defeats her. Batman, Robin and Batgirl go after Freeze together. When they arrive at the observatory where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen from Freeze's ice ray. Robin and Batgirl confront Bane and defeat him, while Batman and Freeze fight. After Batman defeats Freeze by placing a bat-shaped thaw machine on Freeze's suit, Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs Bane planted, but Batman escapes. Batgirl and Robin unfreeze Gotham by repositioning the observatory's satellites, which use their mirrors to reflect sunlight, in order to thaw Gotham from outer space.

After playing Ivy's confession that she killed Nora, Batman reveals to Freeze that Nora is not dead and was restored by himself upon learning about the unplugged chamber and would be moved to Arkham, where he could complete his research. Batman asks Freeze for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred. Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving him two vials of the medicine he had developed.

Ivy is detained at Arkham with a vengeful Freeze as her cellmate lecturing her for trying to sabotage his research. Alfred is eventually healed, and everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at the mansion.

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of ''Batman & Robin'' on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production.

''Batman & Robin'' was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]], as well as categories for [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]]. [[Alicia Silverstone]] won the [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher (Worst Director), George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell (Worst Screen Couple), Akiva Goldsman (Worst Screenplay), both Chris O'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Worst Supporting Actor), Uma Thurman (Worst Supporting Actress), and [[Billy Corgan]] (Worst Song for "[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]"). ''Batman & Robin'' also received nominations for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, ''Batman & Robin''' garnered only one Razzie Award.

Many observers thought Schumacher added possible [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] [[innuendo]] in the storyline.<ref name=shadow/> [[James Berardinelli]] questioned the "random amount of rubber nipples and camera angle [[close-up]]s of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches."<ref>{{cite web | author=[[James Berardinelli]] | title = Batman and Robin | work=ReelViews.net | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman4.html | accessdate = November 13, 2008}}</ref> Similar to ''Batman Forever'', this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged [[codpiece]]s to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, "I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from [[Ancient Greek art|ancient Greek statue]]s, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct."<ref name=shadow/> Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual."<ref name=shadow/> [[George Clooney]] joked, "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another ''Batman'' film because Batman was gay".<ref>{{cite news | author=Sharon Swart; Bill Higgins | url = http://www.variety.com/vstory/vr1117925178.html?categoryID=38&cs=1 | title = 'Happy' to sign off|work=Variety  | date = June 27, 2005 | accessdate = November 11, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081220040609/http://www.variety.com/vstory/vr1117925178.html?categoryID=38&cs=1| archivedate= December 20, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, "I think we might have killed the franchise",<ref name="Boston Globe">{{cite news | title=Batman and Robin |work=The Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2005/06/12/behind_the_masks/?page=1 | accessdate=May 17, 2006 | first=Mac | last=Daniel | date=June 12, 2005}}</ref> and called it "a waste of money".<ref>{{cite news | author=Lynn Hirschberg | title = Questions for George Clooney; True Confessions |work=The New York Times | date = November 3, 2002 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}</ref>

===Cancelled sequel and legacy===

During the filming of ''Batman & Robin'', Warner Bros. was impressed with the [[dailies]], prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a sequel. However, writer [[Akiva Goldsman]] turned down an offer to write the script.<ref name=mike/> In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the script for a fifth ''Batman'' film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255 | title = Helmer's 3rd At Bat |work=Variety  | date = February 21, 1997 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019042349/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255| archivedate= October 19, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Titled ''Batman Triumphant'', Protosevich's script had the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the main villain. Through the use of his fear [[toxin]], he resurrects the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] as a hallucination in Batman's mind.

Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' film and an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most.<ref name=ass/> Schumacher felt he "owe[d] the Batman culture a real ''Batman'' movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight."<ref name=Jen/> He approached Warner Bros. about doing ''Batman: Year One'' in mid-1998,<ref name=Jen>{{cite news | author=Jeff Jensen | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html | title = Winging It |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = December 4, 1998 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019113057/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html| archivedate= October 19, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> but they were more interested in hiring [[Darren Aronofsky]]. Aronofsky and Frank Miller developed a ''Year One'' script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. [[Christopher Nolan]] was eventually hired to helm the next ''Batman'' film in January 2003, resulting in the [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).<ref name=ass>{{cite book | author=David Hughes | title = Tales From Development Hell | publisher=[[Titan Books]] | year = 2004 | month = March | location = London | pages = 192–211| chapter = The Dark Knight Strikes Out | isbn = 1-84023-691-4 }}</ref>

In "[[Chemistry (The New Batman Adventures)|Legends of the Dark Knight]]", an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like.
