'''Alternative medicine''' is any practice that is put forward as having the healing effects of [[medicine]] but is not based on [[evidence]] gathered using the [[scientific method]].<ref name=NSF_2002/> It consists of a wide range of [[health care]] practices, products and therapies,<ref name=FDA_regulatory/> using [[:Category:Alternative medical diagnostic methods|alternative medical diagnoses]] and treatments which  typically have not been included in the degree courses of established [[medical schools]] or used in [[medicine|conventional medicine]]. Examples of alternative medicine include [[homeopathy]], [[naturopathy]], [[chiropractic]], and [[acupuncture]].

'''Complementary medicine''' is alternative medicine used together with conventional medical treatment in a [[belief]], not proven by using scientific methods, that it "complements" the treatment.{{refn|group=n|The ''Final Report'' (2002) of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy states:<blockquote>The Commissioners believe and have repeatedly stated in this Report that our response should be to hold all systems of health and healing, including conventional and CAM, to the same rigorous standards of good science and health services research. Although the Commissioners support the provision of the most accurate information about the state of the science of all CAM modalities, they believe that it is premature to advocate the wide implementation and reimbursement of CAM modalities that are yet unproven.<ref name="whccamp.hhs.gov"/></blockquote>}}<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name= Ernst_1995/><ref name= Joyce_1994/> '''CAM''' is the abbreviation for '''Complementary and alternative medicine'''.<ref name=ernstinterview/><ref name=CassilethDeng2004/> [[Integrative medicine]] (or integrative health) is the combination of the practices and methods of alternative medicine with conventional medicine.<ref name=BMJ_May/>

[[Normative]] definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated or ineffective and support of theories which have no recognized scientific basis.{{sfn|CAM Committee|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=17 17]}} These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of [[evidence-based medicine]], they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but which are not based on [[evidence]] gathered with the [[scientific method]].<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/><ref name= NCI_PDQ_CAM/><ref name=Borkan2012/><ref name=Kong2005/> Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by a former editor of the ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine|New England Journal of Medicine]]'', [[Marcia Angell]], argued that: <blockquote>It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence.

=== Regional definitions ===

Public information websites maintained by the governments of the US and of the UK make a distinction between "alternative medicine" and "complementary medicine", but mention that these two can overlap. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (a part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]]) states that "alternative medicine" refers to using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine and that "complementary medicine" generally refers to using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine, and comments that the boundaries between complementary and conventional medicine overlap and change with time.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service (NHS)]] website ''NHS Choices'' (owned by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|UK Department of Health]]), adopting the terminology of NCCAM, states that when a treatment is used alongside conventional treatments, to help a patient cope with a health condition, and not as an alternative to conventional treatment, this use of treatments can be called "complementary medicine"; but when a treatment is used instead of conventional medicine, with the intention of treating or curing a health condition, the use can be called "alternative medicine".<ref name= NHS_Choices_CAM/>

Similarly, the public information website maintained by the [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of  Australia uses the acronym "CAM" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements.<ref name= NHMRC_CAM/>

The Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicine an independent institution under the [[Ministry of Interior and Health (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health]] (Danish abbreviation: ViFAB) uses the term “alternative medicine” for:
* Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals, where authorized healthcare professionals are those practicing what is proven by science.
* Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system, which is based on science in Denmark. People without a healthcare authorisation must be able to perform the treatments.

====Institutions====
In ''General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine'', published in 2000 by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]], complementary and alternative medicine were there defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.<ref name= "WHO_Trad_Med_Defs"/>{{sfn|WHO|2000}}

Some herbal therapies are mainstream in Europe but are alternative in the US.<ref name= Cotter2005/>

====Special terminology used by selected individuals====
Two advocates of integrative medicine, writing in 2002 of the American healthcare system, claimed that it also addresses alleged problems with medicine based on science, which are not addressed by CAM; [[Ralph Snyderman]] and [[Andrew Weil]] stated that "integrative medicine is not synonymous with complementary and alternative medicine. It has a far larger meaning and mission in that it calls for restoration of the focus of medicine on health and healing and emphasizes the centrality of the patient-physician relationship."<ref name=Snyderman2002/> <!-- WE CAN'T USE PROJECTIONS SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE FACT; ALSO, THE ESTIMATE IS UNCITED In 2002, the growth estimate during the years 1995 to 2005 in the USA and other developed countries for the number of chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and other nonphysician clinicians was double that of physicians.<ref name=Cassileth2002>{{cite journal | last = Cassileth |first= B.R. | title = The Role of Complementary & Alternative Medicine: Accommodating Pluralism | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 347 | pages = 860–861 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200209123471123 | issue = 11}}</ref>-->

==History - 19th century onwards==
{{main|History of alternative medicine}}

Dating from the 1970s, medical professionals, sociologists, anthropologists and other commentators noted the increasing visibility of a wide variety of health practices that had neither derived directly from nor been verified by biomedical science.<ref name=Bivins2011/> Since that time, those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field.<ref name=Bivins2011/> A variety of terms have been used, including heterodox, irregular, fringe and alternative medicine while others, particularly medical commentators, have been satisfied to label them as instances of quackery.<ref name=Bivins2011/> The most persistent term has been alternative medicine but its use is problematic as it assumes a value-laden dichotomy between a medical fringe, implicitly of borderline acceptability at best, and a privileged medical orthodoxy, associated with validated medico-scientific norms.<ref name=Jutte2001/> The use of the category of alternative medicine has also been criticized as it cannot be studied as an independent entity but must be understood in terms of a regionally and temporally specific medical orthodoxy.<ref name= DeBlecourt1999/> Its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists.<ref name=Jutte1999/> As with near-synonymous expressions, such as unorthodox, complementary, marginal, or quackery, these linguistic devices have served, in the context of processes of professionalisation and market competition, to establish the authority of official medicine and police the boundary between it and its unconventional rivals.<ref name=Jutte2001/>

From a historical perspective, the emergence of alternative medicine, if not the term itself, is typically dated to the 19th century.<ref name= "Porter_Ramsey_Loudon"/> This is despite the fact that there are variants of Western non-conventional medicine that arose in the late-eighteenth century or earlier and some non-Western medical traditions, currently considered alternative in the West and elsewhere, which boast extended historical pedigrees.<ref name=Jutte2001/> Alternative medical systems, however, can only be said to exist when there is an identifiable, regularized and authoritative standard medical practice, such as arose in the West during the nineteenth-century, to which they can function as an alternative.{{sfn|Bivins|2007|p=171}}

During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of Europe and,<ref name= "Brunton_Brown"/> as the nineteenth century progressed, most Western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semi-protected medical markets.<ref name= Pickstone2006/> It is at this point that an "official" medicine, created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of [[Legitimation|legitimacy]], emerges as a recognizable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable.<ref name= Ramsey1999/> As part of this process, professional adherents of mainstream medicine in countries such as Germany, France, and Britain increasingly invoked the scientific basis of their discipline as a means of engendering internal professional unity and of external differentiation in the face of sustained market competition from homeopaths, naturopaths, mesmerists and other nonconventional medical practitioners, finally achieving a degree of imperfect dominance through alliance with the state and the passage of regulatory legislation.<ref name=Jutte2001/><ref name=Jutte1999/> In the US the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], based in Baltimore, Maryland, opened in 1893 and was the first medical school devoted to teaching "German scientific medicine".<ref name= Silverman2011/> Buttressed by the increased authority consequent to the significant advances in the medical sciences of the late 19th century onwards&nbsp;— including the development and application of the [[germ theory of disease]] by the chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and the surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister]], of [[microbiology]] co-founded by [[Robert Koch]] (in 1885 appointed professor of [[hygiene]] at the [[University of Berlin]]), and of the use of [[X-ray]]s ([[Röntgen ray]]s)&nbsp;— the 1910 [[Flexner Report]] called upon [[Medical school in the United States|American medical schools]] to follow the model set by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and adhere to mainstream science in their teaching and research. This was in a belief, mentioned in the Report's introduction, that the preliminary and professional training then prevailing in medical schools should be reformed in view of the new means for diagnosing and combating disease being made available to physicians and surgeons by the sciences on which medicine depended.{{refn|group=n|In his introduction to the Flexner Report, Henry S. Pritchett stated, "The fundamental sciences upon which medicine depends have been greatly extended. The laboratory has come to furnish alike to the physician and to the surgeon a new means for diagnosing and combating disease. The education of the medical practitioner under these changed conditions makes entirely different demands in respect of both preliminary and professional training." <ref name= Pritchett1910/>}}<ref name= Hiatt2003/> An early instance of the influence of the Flexner Report outside North America is [[Peking Union Medical College]].<ref name= Bullock1980/>{{refn|group=n|[[Peking University Health Science Center]] (formerly Beijing Medical University) was the first of the kind in China to teach western medicine and train medical professionals.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}}}{{refn|group=n|For an encyclopaedic account of the development of "western" medicine in the period leading up to the reforms in the medical schools of US resulting from the Flexner Report, published at the time of that report, see the article, [[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Medicine|"Medicine"]], in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica by [[Thomas Clifford Allbutt]].}}

Among putative medical practices available at the time which later became known as "alternative medicine" were homeopathy (founded in Germany in the early 19c.) and chiropractic (founded in North America in the late 19c.). These conflicted in principle with the developments in medical science upon which the Flexner reforms were based, and they have not become compatible with further advances of medical science such as listed in [[Timeline of medicine and medical technology]], 1900-1999 and 2000–present, nor have Ayurveda, acupuncture or other kinds of alternative medicine.

At the same time "[[Tropical medicine]]" was being developed as a specialist branch of western medicine in research establishments such as [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]] founded 1898, [[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine]], founded 1899 and [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine]], founded 1912. A distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems. An example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in India, including Ayurveda, submitted by [[Mohammad Usman of Madras]] and others in 1923. This stated that the first question the Committee considered was "to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not".<ref name= Usman1925/><ref name= Madras1984/>{{sfn|Bivins|2007|pp=164–170}}

By the later twentieth century the term 'alternative medicine' had come into use for the purposes of public discussion,{{refn|group=n|According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the earliest recorded English language usage in a print medium of the term "alternative medicine" is found in a 1974 text by Helen Kruger.<ref name= OED_Kruger/>}}<ref name= BMA_Cant_Saks/> but it was not always being used with the same meaning by all parties. [[Arnold S. Relman]] remarked in 1998 that in the best kind of medical practice, all proposed treatments must be tested objectively, and that in the end there will only be treatments that pass and those that do not, those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not. He asked 'Can there be any reasonable "alternative"?'<ref name= Relman1998/> But also in 1998 the then [[Surgeon General of the United States]], [[David Satcher]],<ref name= HistoryMakers_HHS_Satcher_Bio/> issued public information about eight common alternative treatments (including acupuncture, holistic and massage), together with information about common diseases and conditions, on nutrition, diet, and lifestyle changes, and about helping consumers to decipher fraud and quackery, and to find healthcare centers and doctors who practiced alternative medicine.<ref name= New_Millennium/>

In respect of alternative medicine [[History of alternative medicine#altmed since the 1970s|since the 1970s]] in North America, Great Britain and elsewhere, there has been a tendency for the terms ‘alternative’ and ‘complementary’ to be used interchangeably to describe a wide diversity of therapies that attempt to use the self-healing powers of the body by amplifying natural recuperative processes to restore health. By 1990, approximately 60 million Americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues, according to a nationwide survey in the US published in 1993 by David Eisenberg.<ref name= Eisenberg1993/> A study published in the November 11, 1998 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] reported that 42% of Americans had used complementary and alternative therapies, up from 34% in 1990.<ref name= Eisenberg1998/> However, despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine, most of the early alternative/complementary medical centers failed.<ref name= Bravewell2007/>

===Medical education since 1910===
Mainly as a result of reforms following the [[Flexner Report]] of 1910<ref name= Flexner_Report/> [[medical education]] in established [[medical schools]] in the US has generally not included alternative medicine as a teaching topic.{{refn|group=n|As the medical professor [[Kenneth Ludmerer|Kenneth M. Ludmerer]] noted in 2010: <blockquote>Flexner pointed out that the scientific method of thinking applied to medical practice. By scientific method, he meant the testing of ideas by well-planned experiments in which accurate facts were carefully obtained. The clinician's diagnosis was equivalent to the scientist's hypothesis: both [[medical diagnosis]] and hypothesis needed to be submitted to the test of an experiment... Flexner argued that mastery of the scientific method of problem solving was the key for physicians to manage medical uncertainty and to practice in the most cost-effective way."<ref name= Ludmerer2010/></blockquote>}} Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology.<ref name= Bianco/> Medical schools' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine,<ref name= Stanford_Curriculum/> and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making).<ref name= Yale_Curriculum/> Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center in which education, research and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the [[pathophysiological]] basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions which were not well understood in mechanistic terms and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.<ref name=Snyderman2002/>

By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US.<ref name= Berman2001/> Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration).<ref name= UM_CIM/><ref name= UM_CAM_Field/> Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed [[physicians in the United States|physicians in the US]] who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD).<ref name= Medline_MD/> All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)]].<ref name=Medline_MD/>

The British Medical Association, in its publication ''Complementary Medicine, New Approach to Good Practice'' (1993), gave as a working definition of non-conventional therapies (including acupuncture, chiropractic and homeopathy): "those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the orthodox health-care professions, and the skills of which are not part of the undergraduate curriculum of orthodox medical and paramedical health-care courses".{{sfn|BMA|1993}} By 2000 some medical schools in the UK were offering CAM familiarisation courses to undergraduate medical students while some were also offering modules specifically on CAM.<ref name= "Walton_Science_and_Technology_Committee"/>

===Proponents and opponents===
The Cochrane Collaboration Complementary Medicine Field explains its "Scope and Topics" by giving a broad and general definition for complementary medicine as including practices and ideas which are outside the domain of conventional medicine in several countries and defined by its users as preventing or treating illness, or promoting health and well being, and which complement mainstream medicine in three ways: by contributing to a common whole, by satisfying a demand not met by conventional practices, and by diversifying the conceptual framework of medicine.<ref name= Cochrane_CAM_Field/>

Proponents of an [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-base for medicine]]{{refn|group=n|Two definitions of evidence based medicine are:<blockquote>"Evidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients'.<ref name= Sackett1996/></blockquote> <blockquote>"Evidence based medicine, whose philosophical origins extend back to mid-19th century Paris and earlier, remains a hot topic for clinicians, public health practitioners, purchasers, planners, and the public. British centres for evidence based practice have been established or planned in adult medicine, child health, surgery, pathology, pharmacotherapy, nursing, general practice, and dentistry; the Cochrane Collaboration and Britain's Centre for Review and Dissemination in York are providing systematic reviews of the effects of health care".<ref name= Sackett1996/></blockquote>}}<ref name= Nuffield_Trust/><ref name= Belsey2009/><ref name= Nuffield2/><ref name= Bardsley2011/> such as the Cochrane Collaboration (founded in 1993 and from 2011 providing input for WHO resolutions) take a position that ''all'' systematic reviews of treatments, whether "mainstream" or "alternative", ought to be held to the current standards of scientific method.<ref name= UM_CAM_Field/> In a study titled ''Development and classification of an operational definition of complementary and alternative medicine for the Cochrane Collaboration'' (2011) it was proposed that indicators that a therapy is accepted include government licensing of practitioners, coverage by [[health insurance]], statements of approval by government agencies, and recommendation as part of a practice guideline; and that if something is currently a standard, accepted therapy, then it is not likely to be widely considered as CAM.<ref name= Wieland2011/>

That alternative medicine has been on the rise "in countries where Western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare, and 'evidence-based' practice is the dominant paradigm" was described as an "[[wikt:enigma|enigma]]" in the Medical Journal of Australia.<ref name=Coulter2004/>

Critics in the US say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that ''complementary'' is deceptive because the word implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines which have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a [[placebo]].<ref name= Sampson1995/><ref name= Skep_Dic_comp_med/><ref name= Novella2010/><ref name= Gorski2010/>

Some opponents, focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems in the US, are highly critical of alternative medicine, notably [[Wallace Sampson]] and [[Paul Kurtz]] founders of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]] and [[Stephen Barrett]], co-founder of [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]] and webmaster of [[Quackwatch]].<ref name= NCAHF_mission/>

Grounds for opposing alternative medicine which have been stated in the US and elsewhere are:
*that it is usually based on [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, or fraud.<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name= Sampson1995/><ref name=Beyerstein2001/><ref name=Other_sources/>

*that alternative therapies typically lack any [[scientific validation]], and their effectiveness is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].<ref name= Sampson1995/><ref name=Kent1997/><ref name= Goldrosen2004/>{{dubious|date=January 2013}}

*that the treatments are those that are not part of the conventional, science-based healthcare system.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/><ref name= "WHO_Trad_Med_Defs"/>{{sfn|CAM Committee|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=17 17-19]}}<ref name=Zollman1999/>

* that where alternative treatments are used in place of conventional science-based medicine, even with the very safest alternative medicines, failure to use or delay in using conventional science-based medicine has resulted in deaths.<ref name=Lilienfeld2002/><ref name= Hughes2010/>

[[Paul Offit]] has proposed four ways in which "alternative medicine becomes quackery":<ref name= Offit2013/>

# "...by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful."
# "...by promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning."
# "...by draining patients' bank accounts,..."
# "...by promoting magical thinking,..."

Alternative medicine practices and beliefs are diverse in their foundations and methodologies, and typically make use of preparations and dosages other than such as are included in the [[Pharmacopeia]] recognised by established medical schools. Methods may incorporate or base themselves on  [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles, errors in reasoning, or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal.<ref name= Sampson1995/><ref name=Beyerstein2001/><ref name= Acharya2008/> African, Caribbean, Pacific Island, Native American, and other regional cultures have traditional medical systems as diverse as their diversity of cultures.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/>

==Examples and classes==
{{Further2|[[List of branches of alternative medicine]]}}
[[File:Botanica.jpg|thumb|right|A [[botánica]] of traditional Hispanic medicines]]

Alternative medicines include a wide range of treatments and practices. Some stem from nineteenth century North America, such as [[Chiropractic]] and [[Naturopathy]], some, mentioned by Jütte, originated in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Germany, such as [[homeopathy]] and [[hydropathy]],<ref name= Jutte1999/> some have originated in China or India.

The following examples include some of the more common methods in use. Most therapies can be considered as part of five broad classes; biological based approaches, energy therapies, alternative medical systems, muscle and joint manipulation and mind body therapies.

[[File:Dhanvantari-at-Ayurveda-expo.jpg|thumb|upright|Indian [[Dhanvantari]], an incarnation of Krishna<ref name= Prabhupada2012/> and the Lord of Ayurveda worshiped at an ayurveda expo, [[Bangalore]]]]
[[File:ColouredChakraswithDescriptions.jpg|thumb|right|In Japanese [[Reiki]], it is believed that supernatural energies flow from the palms of the healer into the patient near [[Chakras]], influencing disease.]]

Alternative medical systems are complete health systems with their own approaches to diagnosis and treatment that differ from the conventional biomedical approach to health. Some are cultural systems such as [[Ayurveda]] and [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]], while others, such as [[Homeopathy]] and [[Naturopathy]] are relatively recent and were developed in the West.<ref name= Goldrosen2004 />

Writing as a historian Matthew Ramsey has asked whether some counter-hegemonic medicines are better understood as manifestations of more general developments in the larger society, or as the product of a coherent alternative world view.<ref name= Ramsey1999/>

===Ayurvedic medicine===

[[Ayurvedic medicine]] is a traditional medicine of India and has strong links with [[Hinduism]]. It is based on the belief that health is controlled by 3 "humours" with disease caused by an imbalance of these "humours". The basis of treatment has some similarities with "Western medicine". Remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials.<ref name= Wujastyk2003/> Safety concerns have been raised about Ayurveda, with two U.S. studies finding about 20 percent of Ayurvedic Indian-manufactured [[patent medicine]]s contained toxic levels of heavy metals such as [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[arsenic]]. Other concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.<ref name= Saper2008/><ref name=Valiathan2006/>

===Body manipulation===

Body-based therapies such as massage, chiropractic and [[osteopathy]] use movement and physical manipulation of joints and muscles.

Manipulative and body-based practices feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in [[chiropractic]] manipulation.

===Energy therapies===
Energy therapies are designed to influence energy fields (biofields) that practitioners believe surround and enter the body. Some energy therapies involve the use of crystals, while others use magnets and electric fields. NCCAM has distinguished two types of [[energy medicine]]: one, "Veritable" involving scientifically observable [[energy]], including [[magnet therapy]], [[colorpuncture]] and [[light therapy]]; the other "Putative" which invoke physically undetectable or unverifiable energy.<ref name= NCCAM_EMed/>

====Biofields====
[[File:Acupuncture1-1.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[acupuncture]] it is believed that insertion and manipulation of needles affects the flow of [[qi]], or "life energy".<ref name= NIH_Con/>]]
[[File:Chiropractic spinal adjustment.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chiropractic]] was developed in the US in the belief that manipulation of the spine affects a supernatural [[vitalism|vital energy]] that influences health and disease.<ref name= Keating2005/><ref name= Ernst2008/>]]

[[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that, it is purported, surround and penetrate the body.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> Writers such as [[Carl Sagan]] (1934-1996), a noted astrophysicist, advocate of skeptical thinking ([[Scientific skepticism]]) and the author of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon–Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'' (1996), have described the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.<ref name= Sagan1996/>

[[Acupuncture]] is a component of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]]. In acupuncture theory, an energy called [[qi]] flows through through the body and helps propel the blood. Disease and pain occur when this flow is blocked.<ref name=Lu2002/> Insertion of needles at specific points of the body restores balance to the blocked area, and thereby cures any disease or removes any pain.<ref name= Lu2002/>

Chiropractic was developed in the belief that manipulating the spine affects the flow of a supernatural [[vital energy]] termed "innate intelligence" that governs health and disease.<ref name= Keating2005/><ref name=Ernst2008/>

In [[reiki]], practitioners claim to channel a "universal life energy" to induce a healing effect.<ref name= Lee2008/> This putative energy is transferred through the palms or through tapping or blowing or similar means.

====Electromagnetic fields====
Alternative therapies based on [[Electromagnetic therapy (alternative medicine)|electricity or magnetism]] use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in an unconventional manner rather than claiming the existence of imponderable or supernatural energies.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> [[Magnet therapy|Magnetic healing]] asserts that magnets can be used in defiance of the laws of [[physics]] to influence health. These uses are generally unrelated to [[electromagnetic therapy|electromagnetic therapies]].

===Herbs, diet and vitamins===

Biological approaches include the use of herbal medicines, special diets or very high doses of vitamins.

Substance based practices use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, non-vitamin supplements and megavitamins, and minerals, and includes traditional herbal remedies with herbs specific to regions in which the cultural practices arose.<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> "Herbal" remedies in this case, may include use of nonherbal toxic chemicals from nonbiological sources, such as use of the poison [[lead]] in Traditional Chinese Medicine.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Nonvitamin supplements include [[fish oil]], [[Omega-3 fatty acid]], [[glucosamine]], [[echinacea]], [[flaxseed oil]] or pills, and [[ginseng]], when used under a claim to have healing effects.<ref name= US_use_survey/>

===Homeopathy===

Homeopathy is based on the belief that a disease can be cured by a very low dose of substance that creates similar symptoms in a healthy person. These ideas are known as 'like cures like' and the 'law of the minimum dose'<ref name= "Stratten_in_Hahnemann"/>{{refn|group=n|In his book ''The Homœopathic Medical Doctrine'' [[Samuel Hahnemann]] the creator of homeopathy stated:<blockquote>Observation, reflection, and experience have unfolded to me that the best and true method of cure is founded on the principle, ''[[similia similibus curentur]].'' To cure in a mild, prompt, safe, and durable manner, it is necessary to choose in each case a medicine that will excite an affection similar (''{{lang|el|ὅμοιος πάθος}}'') to that against which it is employed.{{sfn|Hahnemann|1833|pp=[http://books.google.com/books?id=EnEFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA48 48–49]|ps=}}</blockquote>}} This conflicts with fundamental concepts of physics and chemistry and there is no good evidence from reviews of research to support its use.<ref name="Ernst2002"/><ref name= "HoC_Evidence_Check2_homeopathy"/><ref name="Shang2005"/><ref name="NCCAM_homeopathy"/>

===Mind body therapies===
Mind–body therapies attempt to use the mind to affect bodily symptoms and functions; examples include yoga, spirituality and relaxation.

[[Mind-body medicine]] takes a holistic approach to health that explores the interconnection between the mind, body and spirit. It works under the premise that the mind can affect "bodily functions and symptoms".<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/> Mind body medicine includes healing claims made in [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]], [[meditation]], [[deep-breathing exercises]], [[guided imagery]], [[hypnotherapy]],<ref name="Shine2003"/> [[progressive relaxation]], [[qi gong]] and [[tai chi]].<ref name=NCCAMwhatiscam/>

Yoga, a method of traditional stretches, exercises and meditations in [[Hinduism]], may also be classified as an energy medicine insofar as its healing effects are believed to be due to a healing "life energy" that is absorbed into the body through the breath, and is thereby believed to treat a wide variety of illnesses and complaints.<ref name="Raub2002"/>

[[File:Fallerjfa.JPG|thumb|upright|Christian priest [[Faith healer]] laying hands on sick girl in belief in divine healing.]]

Religion based healing practices, such as use of [[prayer]] and the laying of hands in [[Christian]] [[faith healing]], rely on belief in divine intervention for healing.
                                                                                                                                         
Meditation practices including Mantra meditation, Mindfulness meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong have many uncertainties. According to an [[AHRQ]] review, the available evidence on meditation practices through September 2005 is of poor methodological quality and definite conclusions on the effects of meditation in healthcare cannot be made using existing research.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17764203][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19123875]

===Naturopathy===

Naturopathy is based on a belief in [[vitalism]], which posits that a special energy called vital energy or vital force guides bodily processes such as [[metabolism]], reproduction, growth, and adaptation.<ref name= "SarrisWardle2010"/> Naturopathy favors a [[holistic health|holistic]] approach with non-invasive treatment and, similar to conventional medicine, encourages minimal use of [[surgery]] and [[Medication|drugs]].

The term "naturopathy" is derived from Greek and Latin, and literally translates as "nature disease".<ref name="NCCAM_naturopathy"/> Modern naturopathy grew out of the Natural Cure movement of Europe.<ref name= "Brown1988"/><ref name= "Langley2007"/>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2013}}<!-- no evidence book was published --> The term was coined in 1895 by John Scheel and popularized by [[Benedict Lust]],<ref name= "AMA_CoSA_rpt12"/> the "father of U.S. naturopathy".<ref name=Baer2001/> Beginning in the 1970s, there was a revival of interest in the United States and Canada in conjunction with the [[holistic health]] movement.<ref name=Baer2001/><ref name="Gale_naturopathic"/> Today, naturopathy is primarily practiced in the United States and Canada.<ref name="Romeyke2011"/> The scope of practice varies widely between jurisdictions, and naturopaths in unregulated jurisdictions may use the Naturopathic Doctor designation or other titles regardless of level of education.<ref name= "Iowa_BoM"/>

===Traditional Chinese medicine===

[[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] is based on a concept of vital energy, or [[Qi]],<ref name= "Ho2000"/> flowing in the body along specific pathways.  These purported pathways consist of 12 primary meridians.  TCM has many branches including, acupuncture, massage, feng shui, herbs, as well as [[Chinese astrology]].<ref name= Lu2002/> TCM diagnosis is primarily based on looking at the tongue, which  is claimed to show the condition of the organs, as well as feeling the pulse of the radial artery, which is also claimed to show the condition of the organs.<ref name= "Maclocia1995"/>

==Criticism==
Use of the terms "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)" and "alternative medicine" have been criticized.

CAM is a broader term for unorthodox treatment and diagnosis of illnesses, disease, infections, etc.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  Examples of CAM include [[yoga]], [[acupuncture]], [[aromatherapy]], [[chiropractic]], [[herbalism]], [[homeopathy]], [[hypnotherapy]], [[massage]], [[osteopathy]], [[reflexology]], relaxation, [[spiritual healing]] and [[tai chi]].<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen"/> CAM differs from conventional medicine. It is normally private medicine and not covered by [[health insurance]].<ref name="Ernst_Cohen" /> It is paid out of pocket by the patient and is an expensive treatment.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  CAM tends to be a treatment for upper class or more educated people.<ref name= Eisenberg1998/> CAM is often done by non-physicians and does not operate with the same medical licensing laws as conventional medicine.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />

There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to perform the treatments they give to patients.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  It is an issue of non-maleficence.<ref name="Ernst 2"/> CAM is not as well researched as conventional medicine which undergoes intense research before being released to the public.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />   This creates an issue of whether the patient is receiving all the information about the treatment that is necessary for the patient to be well informed.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  CAM creates issues since it is not as well regulated as conventional medicine.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />

Even with the little research done on it, CAM has not been proven to be effective.<ref name="Ernst 3"/> Funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of CAM.<ref name="Ernst 4"/> Most funding for CAM is funded by government agencies.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  The research for CAM has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees which most CAM researchers find almost impossible to meet.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  Proposed research for CAM are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />

CAM is thought to help the patient in a mental or psychological sense since research for CAM is hit and miss.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />  Because the results of CAM are not quantifiable, it is hard to prove its effectiveness and appears to work in a more [[holistic]] sense.<ref name= "Ernst_Cohen" />

===In US===
A 2002 report on public attitudes and understanding issued by the US National Science Foundation defines the term "alternative medicine" as treatments that had not been proven effective using scientific methods.<ref name=NSF_2002/>

Criticisms have come from individuals such as Wallace Sampson in an article in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, June 1995.<ref name= Sampson1995/> Sampson argued that proponents of alternative medicine often used terminology which was loose or ambiguous to create the appearance that a choice between "alternative" effective treatments existed when it did not, or that there was effectiveness or scientific validity when it did not exist, or to suggest that a dichotomy existed when it did not, or to suggest that consistency with science existed when it might not; that the term "'''alternative'''" was to suggest that a patient had a choice between effective treatments when there was not; that use of the word "'''conventional'''" or "'''mainstream'''" was to suggest that the difference between alternative medicine and science based medicine was the prevalence of use, rather than lack of a scientific basis of alternative medicine as compared to "conventional" or "mainstream" science based medicine; that use of the term "'''complementary'''" or "'''integrative'''" was to suggest that purported supernatural energies of alternative medicine could complement or be integrated into science based medicine. "''Integrative medicine''" or "integrated medicine" is used to refer to the belief that medicine based on science would be improved by "integration" with alternative medical treatments practices that are not, and is substantially similar in use to the term "complementary and alternative medicine".<ref name=BMJ_May/>
Sampson has also written that CAM is the "propagation of the absurd", and argues that ''alternative'' and ''complementary'' have been substituted for ''quackery'', ''dubious'', and ''implausible''.<ref name="SampsonAtwood2005"/>

Another critic, with reference to government funding studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream, [[Steven Novella]], a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that it "is used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate." Another, Marcia Angell, argued that it was "a new name for snake oil."<ref name="Brown2009" /> Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]], and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered "alternative" to begin with.<ref name=Angell1998 /> It was thus possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. Prominent supporters of this position include [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).<ref name= Fontanarosa1998/>

In an article first published in ''CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians'' in 1999, "Evaluating complementary and alternative therapies for cancer patients.", [[Barrie R. Cassileth]] mentioned that a 1997 letter to the US Senate Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists. (This was supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).)<ref name= "Cassileth1999"/>

In March 2009 a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' staff writer reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], quoting one of them, Steven Salzberg, a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, saying "One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience."  They argued that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of [[physiology]] and [[disease]], and have shown little or no effect.<ref name="Brown2009"/>
[[Stephen Barrett]], founder and operator of [[Quackwatch]], has argued that practices labeled "alternative" should be reclassified as either genuine, experimental, or questionable. Here he defines genuine as being methods that have sound evidence for safety and effectiveness, experimental as being unproven but with a plausible rationale for effectiveness, and questionable as groundless without a scientifically plausible rationale.<ref name= "Quackwatch_wary"/>
Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated [[falacy|contradiction]] without thorough reason and experiment.<ref name="SampsonAtwood2005"/> Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.<ref name="$2.5 billion"/> Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some "alternatives" have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.<ref name= "Quackwatch_wary"/>

According to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K. Butler, marketing is part of the medical training required in [[chiropractic]] education, and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by Hitler and Goebels in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine.<ref name= Sampson1995/><ref name= "ButlerBarrett1992"/>

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|NCCAM]] budget has been criticized<ref name="Brown2009"/> because,  despite the duration and intensity of studies to measure the efficacy of alternative medicine, there had been no effective CAM treatments supported by scientific evidence as of 2002, according to the QuackWatch website; the NCCAM budget has been on a sharp and sustained rise.<ref name="QuackWatch_defund_NCCAM" /> Critics of the Center argue that the plausibility of interventions such as diet, relaxation, yoga, and botanical remedies should not be used to support research on implausible interventions based on superstition and belief in the supernatural, and that the plausible methods can be studied just as well in other parts of NIH, where they should be made to compete on an equal footing with other research projects.<ref name="Brown2009"/>

===Other critics (UK)===
[[Richard Dawkins]], an English evolutionary biologist and author, in an essay in his book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) (chapter 4.4), has defined alternative medicine as a "set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests."<ref name=Dawkins2003/> Another essay in the same book (chapter 1.4) quoted from an article by [[John Diamond (journalist)|John Diamond]] in ''[[The Independent]]'': "There is really no such thing as alternative medicine, just medicine that works and medicine that doesn't."<ref name= Dawkins2003a/> 
Dawkins has argued that, if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials, it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.<ref name= "Holloway2003"/>

As it relates to [[ethics]], in November 2011 [[Edzard Ernst]] stated that the "level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this."<ref name= "Ernst_Guardian"/> Ernst requested that [[Prince Charles]] recall two guides to alternative medicine published by the Foundation for Integrated Health, on the grounds that "[t]hey both contain numerous misleading and inaccurate claims concerning the supposed benefits of alternative medicine" and that "[t]he nation cannot be served by promoting ineffective and sometimes dangerous alternative treatments."<ref name= "Henderson2008"/> In general, he believes that CAM can and should be subjected to scientific testing.<ref name=goodbadugly />{{refn|group=n|In an article in ''The British Journal of General Practice'' Edzard Ernst et al. stated, <blockquote>Complementary medicine is diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention that complements mainstream medicine by contributing to a common whole, by satisfying a demand not met by orthodoxy or by diversifying the conceptual frameworks of medicine.<ref name="Ernst1995">{{cite journal |last1= Ernst |first1= E. |first2= K.L. |last2= Resch |first3= S. |last3= Mills |first4= R. |last4= Hill |first5= A. |last5= Mitchell |first6= M. |last6= Willoughby |first7= A. |last7= White |display-authors= 1 |title= Complementary medicine — a definition |journal= The British Journal of General Practice |year= 1995 |volume= 45 |issue= 398 |page= 398 |pmc= 1239386}}</ref></blockquote>}}

== Placebo effect ==
A research methods expert and author of "Snake Oil Science", R. Barker Bausell, has stated that "it's become politically correct to investigate nonsense."<ref name="$2.5 billion"/> There are concerns that just having NIH support is being used to give unfounded "legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."<ref name="Brown2009"/>

Use of placebos in order to achieve a [[placebo effect]] in integrative medicine has been criticized as “diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology”.<ref name= Novella2010/><ref name=Gorski2010/>

Another critic has argued that academic proponents of [[integrative medicine]] sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments in order to achieve a placebo effect.{{refn|group=n|As a 2010 article in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' concluded: <blockquote>real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments. There was, nevertheless, evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment, and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.<ref name= "Berman2010"/></blockquote>}} However, a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56% of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well. Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits.<ref name= "Kerman2010"/>

[[Integrative medicine]] has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending [[placebo]]s are not. "[[Quackademic medicine]]" is a pejorative term used for “[[integrative medicine]]”, which is considered to be an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science-based medicine]].<ref name=Gorski2010/>

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase there had been changes in the medical marketplace which influenced the type of response in the journals.<ref name= "Winnick2005_2009"/> Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (now [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]).{{refn|group=n|According to the medical historian James Harvey Young:<blockquote>In 1991 the Senate Appropriations Committee responsible for funding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared itself "not satisfied that the conventional medical community as symbolized at the NIH has fully explored the potential that exists in unconventional medical practices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Young |first1= J.H. |title= The Development of the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health, 1991-1996 |doi= 10.1353/bhm.1998.0110 |journal= Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 279–98 |year= 1998 |pmid=  9628052 |pmc= }}</ref></blockquote>}} In the "condemnation" phase, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, authors had ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM; in the "reassessment" phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), when increased consumer utilization of CAM was prompting concern, authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend; in the "integration" phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control.

==Use and regulation==

===Prevalence of use===
[[File:Bangladesh Prayer.jpg|thumb|Studies show that prayer is a common "complementary" practice, in the belief it might increase the efficacy of science based medicine.]]

'''Complementary and alternative medicine''' (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.<ref name= Wieland2011/>{{dubious|date=February 2013}}

About 50% of people in developed countries use some kind of complementary and alternative medicine other than prayer for health.<ref name="Ernst2003"/><ref name="Barnes2004"/><ref name="Astin1998"/> A British telephone survey by the BBC of 1209 adults in 1998 shows that around 20% of adults in Britain had used alternative medicine in the past 12 months.<ref name= "Thomas2001"/> About 40% of cancer patients use some form of CAM.<ref name= "Horneber2011"/>

In [[developing country|developing nations]], access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and [[poverty]]. [[Traditional medicine|Traditional remedies]], often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.<ref name="WHO_tradmed_fact"/>

====In US====
In respect of taxation in the US the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has discriminated in favour of medical expenses for acupuncture and chiropractic (and others including [[Christian Science practitioner]]s) but against homeopathy and the use of non-prescription required medicine.{{refn|group=n|The US Internal Revenue Service provides the following definition of medical expenses: <blockquote>Medical expenses are the costs of diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and the costs for treatments affecting any part or function of the body. These expenses include payments for legal medical services rendered by physicians, surgeons, dentists and other medical practitioners.... primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental defect or illness.'' ''Medicines: You can include expenses amounts you pay for prescribed medicines and drugs. A prescribed drug is one that requires a prescription by a doctor for its use by an individual.<ref name= "IRS502">{{cite web |title= Medical and Dental Expenses (Including the Health Coverage Tax Credit) |url= http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p502.pdf |publisher= [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Dept. of the Treasury]], [[Federal government of the United States|US Government]] |page= 2 |volume= Publication 502 |issue= Cat. No. 15002Q |date= 2012-12-10}}</ref></blockquote>}}

The use of alternative medicine in the US has increased,<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name=Eisenberg1998/> with a 50 percent increase in expenditures and a 25 percent increase in the use of alternative therapies between 1990 and 1997 in America.<ref name=Eisenberg1998/> Americans spend many billions on the therapies annually.<ref name=Eisenberg1998/> Most Americans used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain.<ref name= "Barnes2004"/> In America, women were more likely than men to use CAM, with the biggest difference in use of [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Mind-body interventions|mind-body therapies]] including prayer specifically for health reasons".<ref name= "Barnes2004"/> In 2008, more than 37% of American hospitals offered alternative therapies, up from 26.5 percent in 2005, and 25% in 2004.<ref name= "Warner2006"/><ref name="AHA2008"/> More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.<ref name="AHA2008"/>

A survey of Americans found that 88 percent agreed that "there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical [[science]] does not recognize".<ref name=NSF_2002/> Use of magnets was the most common tool in [[energy medicine]] in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least “sort of [[scientific method|scientific]]”, when it is not at all scientific.<ref name=NSF_2002/> In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies.<ref name=NSF_2002/> "Therapeutic touch," was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nine-year-old child for a school science project.<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name= "Rosa1998"/>

A 1997 survey found that 13.7% of respondents in the US had sought the services of both a medical doctor and an alternative medicine practitioner. The same survey found that 96% of respondents who sought the services of an alternative medicine practitioner also sought the services of a medical doctor in the past 12 months. Medical doctors are often unaware of their patient's use of alternative medical treatments as only 38.5% of the patients alternative therapies were discussed with their medical doctor.<ref name=Eisenberg1998/>

According to [[Michael H. Cohen]], US regulation of alternative includes state licensure of healthcare providers and scope of practice limits on practice by non-MD healthcare professionals; state-law malpractice rules (standard of care limits on professional negligence); discipline of practitioners by state regulatory boards; and federal regulation such as food and drug law.<ref name= "Cohen1998"/> He argues that US regulation of alternative medicine "seeks to integrate biomedical, holistic, and social models of health care in ways that maximize patients’ well-being [w]hile still protecting patients from fraud."{{sfn|Cohen|1998|page= 118}}

====Prevalence of use of specific therapies====
The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45.2%), [[herbalism]] (18.9%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing meditation]] (11.6%), [[meditation (alternative medicine)|meditation]] (7.6%), [[chiropractic medicine]] (7.5%), [[yoga (alternative medicine)|yoga]] (5.1%-6.1%), [[body work (alternative medicine)|body work]] (5.0%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Diet-based therapy|diet-based therapy]] (3.5%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Progressive Relaxation|progressive relaxation]] (3.0%), [[Orthomolecular medicine|mega-vitamin therapy]] (2.8%) and [[Visualization (cam)|Visualization]] (2.1%)<ref name= "Barnes2004"/><ref name= "Barnes2008"/>

In Britain, the most often used alternative therapies were [[Alexander technique]], [[Aromatherapy]], Bach and other flower remedies, Body work therapies including massage, Counseling stress therapies, [[hypnotherapy]], [[Meditation]], [[Reflexology]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], Nutritional medicine, and [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Sir Walton: Science and Technology Committee|2000}}

According to the [[National Health Service (England)]], the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.<ref name= NHS_Careers_CAM/>

"Complementary medicine treatments used for pain include: acupuncture, low-level laser therapy, meditation, aroma therapy, Chinese medicine, dance therapy, music therapy, massage, herbalism, therapeutic touch, yoga, osteopathy, chiropractic, naturopathy, and homeopathy."<ref name= "StopPain.org"/>

====In palliative care====
Complementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients.  Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine.  "From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable."<ref name= "Kellhear2003"/> The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ [[mind-body intervention|mind-body]] interventions designed to "reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life."<ref name= "Menefee2005"/>

===Regulation===
{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}
In Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with [[Medical degree|MDs]],<ref name="ernstinterview"/> and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs.<ref name= "Cassileth1996"/> In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.<ref name= "JAMA_book_review"/>

Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic|chiropractic medicine]], have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world{{sfn|WHO|2005}} and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine.  In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.{{sfn|WHO|2005}}

Government bodies in the USA and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. One of those is the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which mentions specifically [[homeopathic]] products, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and [[Ayurvedic]] products.<ref name="fda.gov"/> A document which the FDA has issued for comment is headed ''Guidance for Industry: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Products and Their Regulation by the Food and Drug Administration'', last updated on March 2, 2007. The document opens with three preliminary paragraphs which explain that ''in the document'':

: - "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) are being used to encompass a wide array of health care practices, products, and therapies which are distinct from those used in "conventional" or "allopathic" medicine.

: - some forms of CAM, such as traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, have been practiced for centuries, and others, such as electrotherapy, are of more recent origin.

: - in a publication of The [[Institute of Medicine]] it has been stated that more than one-third of American adults reported using some form of CAM and that visits to CAM providers each year exceed those to primary care physicians (Institute of Medicine, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States, pages 34-35, 2005).

: - no mention (in the document) of a particular CAM therapy, practice or product should be taken as expressing FDA's support or endorsement of it or as an agency determination that a particular product is safe and effective.<ref name=FDA_regulatory/>

==Efficacy==
Alternative therapies lack the requisite [[scientific validation]], and their [[efficacy|effectiveness]] is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].<ref name=NSF_2002/><ref name= Sampson1995/><ref name=Kent1997/><ref name= Goldrosen2004 /> Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.{{sfn|CAM Committee|2005}}{{Full|date=September 2013}} [[Publication bias|Selective publication of results]] (misleading results from only publishing positive results, and not all results),  marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims, call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where herbs may have some evidence of containing chemicals that may affect health.<ref name="Sarris2012"/> ''The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine'' points to confusions in the general population -  a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.<ref name= "Alcock1999"/>

[[Edzard Ernst]] characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative<ref name=goodbadugly/> and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on "sound evidence", although he believes that may be an overestimate due to various reasons.<ref name=Ernst2011/> Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are "statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments", but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.<ref name= "Economist2011"/><ref name= "HHH2008"/>

In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].<ref name= "Katz2003"/> According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically. The book cites Vickers (1998), who found that many of the CAM-related RCTs are in the Cochrane register, but 19% of these trials were not in MEDLINE, and 84% were in conventional medical journals.{{sfn|CAM Committee|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=133 133]}}

As of 2005, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.69% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|CAM Committee|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=135 135-136]}}

Most alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able, which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy—also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.<ref name=Ernst2005/> Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.<ref name= "Horrobin1986"/> However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCAM and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than $2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.<ref name="$2.5 billion"/><ref name="nccam_$"/><ref name="Atwood2003"/>

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.<ref name= "Bodeker2002"/>

Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers has stated:

:Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many [[alternative cancer treatments]] have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. In this article, clinical trial data on a number of alternative cancer cures including Livingston-Wheeler, Di Bella Multitherapy, antineoplastons, vitamin C, hydrazine sulfate, [[Laetrile]], and psychotherapy are reviewed. The label "unproven" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been "disproven."<ref name=Vickers/>

==Safety==
{{See also|List of herbs with known adverse effects}}

===Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety===
Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

One of the commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the manner in which is regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.<ref name= "Colquhoun2012"/>  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.

Advocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.<ref name= "Connelly2012"/> Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).<ref name= "Malcolm2012"/>

====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.<ref name=CassilethDeng2004/> An anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking "natural" potions to "build up her strength" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.<ref name="Hills1999"/>

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

:And lastly {{sic}} there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.<ref name= "SwanABC"/>

====Potential side-effects====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., "that which is natural cannot be harmful".

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in "several significantly different ways from other drugs."<ref name=Stehlin/> Homeopathic preparations, termed "remedies," are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but "their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength," and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.<ref name=Stehlin/>

====Treatment delay====

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.<ref name= "Navarro2006"/> For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, "unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments" and refers to this as "[[opportunity cost]]". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.<ref name=Lilienfeld2002/>
Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.<ref name= Hughes2010/>

HIDING THIS SECTION FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION
Secondary metabolites in thousands of plants are regularly tested by drug companies in search of new therapies. [[Atropa belladonna|Deadly nightshade]] contains atropine, a potent (and dangerous) substance useful in the treatment of a number of disorders, including as an antidote for nerve agents. Chemicals isolated from [[Foxglove]] are used in the treatment of epilepsy; [[Opiates]] derived from poppies are highly effective painkillers, and [[THC]], found in [[cannabis sativa]], is used to counter the effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy itself owes some of its constituent drugs to [[Chemotherapy#Plant alkaloids and terpenoids (L01C)|plant alkaloids]]. These name just a few of the most prominent classes of drugs derived from natural sources that have been adopted as treatments by alternative therapies.

In the US, many medical insurers and some hospitals integrate chiropractic and massage therapy as adjuncts to mainstream medical care.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Unconventional cancer "cures"====

Perhaps because many forms of [[cancer]] are difficult or impossible to cure, there have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as "unproven," suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown. However, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective.
<ref name=Vickers/>

===Research funding===

Although the Dutch government funded CAM research between 1986 and 2003, it formally ended funding in 2006.<ref name= "Renkens2009"/>

==Appeal==
Physicians who practice complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available complementary therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.<ref name= "Sobel2000"/> Some mind-body techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, were once considered complementary medicine, but are now a part of conventional medicine in the United States.<ref name= "WebMD2011"/>

Against alternative medicine it has been argued that in addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the placebo effect, which is a well-established observation in medicine.<ref name= "van_Deventer2008"/>  Related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe,<ref name=Beyerstein /> [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,<ref name=Beyerstein /> and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.<ref name=Beyerstein />

===In UK===
CAM's popularity may be related to other factors which [[Edzard Ernst]] mentioned in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'':

: Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. "People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. "At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.<ref name="Con?"/>

In a paper published in October 2010 entitled ''The public's enthusiasm for complementary and alternative medicine amounts to a critique of mainstream medicine'', Ernst described these views in greater detail and concluded:

: [CAM] is popular. An analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor. Providers of CAM tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals. In turn, this implies that much of the popularity of CAM is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare. We should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients.<ref name= "Ernst2010"/>

===In US and Canada===
A study published in 1998 indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments.<ref name="Astin1998"/> Approximately 4.4 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine.  The research found that those having used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status.  Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was not a meaningful factor in the choice, but rather the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so largely because "they find these healthcare alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life." In particular, subjects reported a holistic orientation to health, a transformational experience that changed their worldview, identification with a number of groups committed to environmentalism, feminism, psychology, and/or spirituality and personal growth, or that they were suffering from a variety of common and minor ailments – notable ones being anxiety, back problems, and chronic pain.

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among that minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine.  There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].<ref name=Beyerstein /> Related to this are vigorous [[advertising|marketing]]<ref name= Weber/> of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.<ref name=Beyerstein2001/><ref name=Beyerstein/>

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.<ref name=Beyerstein2001/> Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.<ref name= "Barnes2004"/> Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.<ref name=Weber/>

Patients can also be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Also, many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach.  In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.<ref name=Beyerstein2001/><ref name=Beyerstein/>

Schofield and others, in a systematic review published in 2011, make ten recommendations which they think may increase the effectiveness of consultations in a conventional (here: oncology) setting, such as "Ask questions about CAM use at critical points in the illness trajectory"; "Respond to the person's emotional state"; and "Provide balanced, evidence-based advice". They suggest that this approach may address "... concerns surrounding CAM use [and] encourage informed decision-making about CAM and ultimately, improve outcomes for patients".<ref name= "Schofield2010"/>
