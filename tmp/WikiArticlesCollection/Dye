A '''dye''' is a [[color]]ed substance that has an [[Chemical affinity|affinity]] to the [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] to which it is being applied. The dye is generally applied in an [[aqueous solution]], and requires a [[mordant]] to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.  

Both dyes and pigments appear to be colored because they absorb some wavelengths of [[light]] more than others. In contrast with a dye, a [[pigment]] generally is insoluble, and has no affinity for the substrate. Some dyes can be [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] with an inert salt to produce a [[lake pigment]], and based on the salt used they could be aluminum lake, calcium lake or barium lake pigments.

Dyed [[flax]] fibers have been found in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] dated back in a prehistoric cave to 36,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref>Balter M. (2009).

The dyes were obtained from  [[animal]], [[vegetable]] or [[mineral]] origin, with none to very little processing. By far the greatest source of dyes has been from the [[plant kingdom]], notably [[root]]s, [[berry|berries]], [[bark]], [[leaf|leaves]] and [[wood]], but only a few have ever been used on a commercial scale.

{{Main|Natural dye}}
The majority of natural dyes are from plant sources – [[root]]s, [[berry|berries]], [[bark]], [[leaf|leaves]], and [[wood]], [[fungi]], and [[lichen]]s.  [[Textile]] dyeing dates back to the [[Neolithic]] period. Throughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally available materials. Scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes [[Tyrian purple]] and crimson [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] were highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based dyes such as [[isatis tinctoria|woad]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]], [[trade and use of saffron|saffron]], and [[rubia|madder]] were raised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using [[resist dyeing]] techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth. Dyes from the [[New World]] such as [[cochineal]] and [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] were brought to Europe by the [[Spain|Spanish]] treasure fleets, and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The discovery of man-made synthetic dyes late in the 19th century ended the large-scale market for natural dyes.

==Synthetic dye==
The first human-made (synthetic) [[organic compound|organic]] dye, [[mauveine]], was discovered [[serendipity|serendipitously]] by [[Sir William Henry Perkin|William Henry Perkin]] in 1856, the result of a failed attempt at the [[total synthesis]] of [[quinine]]. Many thousands of synthetic dyes have since been prepared.<ref>Hunger, K., ed. (2003). Industrial Dyes. Chemistry, Properties, Applications. Weinheim: Wiley-VCH.</ref><ref>Zollinger, H. (2003). Color Chemistry. Synthesis, Properties and Applications of Organic Dyes and Pigments, 3rd ed. Weinheim: Wiley-VCH.</ref>

Synthetic dyes quickly replaced the traditional natural dyes. They cost less, they offered a vast range of new colors, and they imparted better properties to the dyed materials.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color That Changed the World|author=Simon Garfield|year=2000|publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=0-393-02005-3 }}</ref> Dyes are now classified according to how they are used in the dyeing process.
Synthetic dyes now also be used in medicinal field. Department of Dyestuff Technology, ICT, Mumbai, India synthesizing this type of dye.

==Dye types==

'''[[Acid dye]]s''' are [[water]]-[[soluble]] [[anionic]] dyes that are applied to [[fiber]]s such as [[silk]], [[wool]], [[nylon]] and modified [[acrylic fiber]]s using neutral to acid dye baths. Attachment to the fiber is attributed, at least partly, to salt formation between anionic groups in the dyes and [[cationic]] groups in the fiber. Acid dyes are not substantive to [[Cellulose|cellulosic]] fibers. Most synthetic food colors fall in this category.

'''Basic dyes''' are water-soluble [[cationic]] dyes that are mainly applied to [[acrylic fiber]]s, but find some use for wool and silk. Usually [[acetic acid]] is added to the dyebath to help the uptake of the dye onto the fiber. Basic dyes are also used in the coloration of [[paper]].

'''Direct''' or '''[[substantive dye]]ing''' is normally carried out in a neutral or slightly [[alkaline]] dyebath, at or near [[boiling point]], with the addition of either [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) or [[sodium sulfate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) or [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Direct dyes are used on [[cotton]], paper, [[leather]], wool, silk and [[nylon]]. They are also used as [[pH indicator]]s and as [[staining (biology)|biological stain]]s.

'''Mordant dyes''' require a [[mordant]], which improves the fastness of the dye against water, [[light]] and [[perspiration]]. The choice of mordant is very important as different mordants can change the final color significantly. Most natural dyes are mordant dyes and there is therefore a large literature base describing dyeing techniques. The most important mordant dyes are the synthetic mordant dyes, or chrome dyes, used for wool; these comprise some 30% of dyes used for wool, and are especially useful for black and navy shades. The mordant, [[potassium dichromate]], is applied as an after-treatment.  It is important to note that many mordants, particularly those in the heavy metal category, can be hazardous to health and extreme care must be taken in using them.

'''[[Vat dye]]s''' are essentially insoluble in water and incapable of dyeing fibres directly. However, reduction in [[alkaline liquor]] produces the water soluble [[alkali]] [[metal]] [[salt]] of the dye, which, in this leuco form, has an affinity for the textile fibre. Subsequent [[oxidation]] reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to indigo, the original vat dye.

'''[[Reactive dyes]]''' utilize a [[chromophore]] attached to a [[substituent]] that is capable of directly [[chemical reaction|reacting]] with the fibre substrate. The [[covalent]] bonds that attach reactive dye to natural fibers make them among the most permanent of dyes. "Cold" reactive dyes, such as [[Procion MX]], [[Cibacron F]], and [[Drimarene K]], are very easy to use because the dye can be applied at room temperature. Reactive dyes are by far the best choice for dyeing [[cotton]] and other [[cellulose]] fibers at home or in the art studio.

'''Disperse dyes''' were originally developed for the dyeing of [[cellulose acetate]], and are water insoluble. The dyes are finely ground in the presence of a dispersing agent and sold as a paste, or spray-dried and sold as a powder. Their main use is to dye [[polyester]]  but they can also be used to dye nylon, [[cellulose triacetate]], and acrylic fibres. In some cases, a dyeing [[temperature]] of 130 °C is required, and a pressurised dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fibre. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of dispersing agent used during the grinding.

'''Azoic dyeing''' is a technique in which an insoluble [[Azo compound|azo]] dye is produced directly onto or within the fibre. This is achieved by treating a fibre with both diazoic and coupling [[wikt:component|components]]. With suitable adjustment of dyebath conditions the two components react to produce the required insoluble azo dye. This technique of dyeing is unique, in that the final color is controlled by the choice of the diazoic and coupling components. This method of dyeing cotton is declining in importance due to the toxic nature of the chemicals used.

'''[[Sulfur dye]]s''' are two part "developed" dyes used to dye cotton with dark colors. The initial bath imparts a yellow or pale [[Chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]] color, This is aftertreated with a sulfur compound in place to produce the dark black we are familiar with in socks for instance. Sulfur Black 1 is the largest selling dye by volume.

==Food dyes==
One other class that describes the role of dyes, rather than their mode of use, is the [[food coloring|food dye]].  Because food dyes are classed as [[food additive]]s, they are manufactured to a higher standard than some industrial dyes. Food dyes can be direct, mordant and vat dyes, and their use is strictly controlled by [[law|legislation]]. Many are [[Azo compound|azo]] dyes, although [[anthraquinone]] and [[triphenylmethane]] compounds are used for colors such as [[green]] and [[blue]]. Some naturally-occurring dyes are also used.

==Other important dyes==
A number of other classes have also been established, including:
* Oxidation bases, for mainly hair and fur
* Laser dyes: see, for example, [[rhodamine 6G]] and [[coumarin]] dyes.<ref>[[F. J. Duarte]] and L. W. Hillman (Eds.), ''Dye Laser Principles'' (Academic, New York, 1990).</ref>
* [[Leather]] dyes, for leather
* [[Fluorescent brightener]]s, for textile fibres and paper
* [[Solvent dye]]s, for wood staining and producing colored lacquers, solvent inks, coloring oils, waxes.
* [[Carbene dye]]s, a recently developed method for coloring multiple substrates
* Contrast dyes, injected for magnetic resonance imaging, are essentially the same as clothing dye except they are coupled to an agent that has strong paramagnetic properties.<ref>[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6123921/description.html patentstorm.us]</ref>
*Mayhem's dye, used in water cooling for looks, often rebranded RIT dye
